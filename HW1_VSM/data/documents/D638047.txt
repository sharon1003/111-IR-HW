connecting dac to amp better to have longer usb cable or rca due to the setup of my room and equipment i can either have the dac with the pc so using a small length usb and then about 3 or maybe 4 metre rca cable or i could have the dac on the amp thereby requiring a 3 or 4 metre usb cable is there a preference or should it not matter at all i will try to get the best of both but budgets apply so could you recommend both an rca and usb cable please forget about kimber and its ilk as that is not for me at the moment something cheaper but not cheapo if that makes any sense thanks
