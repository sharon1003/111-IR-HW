what is opium opium is a highly addictive narcotic drug acquired in the dried latex form from the opium poppy  papaver somniferum seed pod traditionally the unripened pod is slit open and the sap seeps out and dries on the outer surface of the pod the resulting yellowbrown latex which is scraped off of the pod is bitter in taste and contains varying amounts of alkaloids such as morphine codeine thebaine and papaverine what is heroin heroin diacetylmorphine is derived from the morphine alkaloid found in opium and is roughly 23 times more potent a highly addictive drug heroin exhibits euphoric rush anxiolytic and analgesic central nervous system properties heroin is classified as a schedule i drug under the controlled substances act of 1970 and as such has no acceptable medical use in the united states pure heroin is a white powder with a bitter taste most illicit heroin is sold as a white or brownish powder and is usually cut with other drugs or with substances such as sugar starch powdered milk or quinine it can also be cut with strychnine or other poisons because heroin abusers do not know the actual strength of the drug or its true contents they are at risk of overdose or death another form of heroin known as black tar may be sticky like roofing tar or hard like coal its color may vary from dark brown to black heroin street names include smack h skag junk brown sugar horse and black tar methods of use heroin is most often injected however it may also be vaporized smoked sniffed snorted used as a suppository or orally ingested smoking and sniffing heroin do not produce a rush as quickly or as intensely as intravenous injection oral ingestion does not usually lead to a rush but use of heroin in suppository form may have intense euphoric effects heroin can be addictive by any given route effects of heroin use heroin is metabolized to morphine and other metabolites which bind to opioid receptors in the brain the shortterm effects of heroin abuse appear soon after a single dose and disappear in a few hours after an injection of heroin the user reports feeling a surge of euphoria the rush accompanied by a warm flushing of the skin a dry mouth and heavy extremities following this initial euphoria the user experiences an alternately wakeful and drowsy state mental functioning becomes clouded due to the depression of the central nervous system other effects that heroin may have on users include respiratory depression constricted pinpoint pupils and nausea effects of heroin overdose may also include slow and shallow breathing hypotension muscle spasms convulsions coma and possible death intravenous heroin use is complicated by other issues such as the sharing of contaminated needles the spread of hivaids hepatitis and toxic reactions to heroin impurities other medical complications that may arise due to heroin use include collapsed veins abscesses spontaneous abortion or endocarditis an inflammation of the heart lining and valves heroin addiction can remove an otherwise healthy and contributing member from society treatment options for heroin addiction or overdose several medical treatment options exist for heroin addiction these treatments can be effective when combined with a medication compliance program and behavioral therapy methadone dolophine® methadose® buprenorphine subutex®  brand discontinued in u s buprenorphine combined with naloxone suboxone® and naltrexone depade® re via® are approved in the us to treat opioid dependence these treatments work by binding fully or partially to opiate receptors in the brain and work as agonists antagonists or a combination of the two agonists mimic the action of the opiate and antagonists block and reverse the action of the opiate oral administration of these drugs may allow for a more gradual withdrawal from opiates a longacting intramuscular depot formulation of naltrexone vivitrol® is also available for use following opiate detoxification methadone has been used for over a quarter century to treat heroin addiction the use of methadone in opiate dependency is highly regulated in the us and may differ between states oral methadone is approved for opiate detoxification and maintenance only in approved and certified treatment programs although certain emergency or inpatient care exceptions exist patients usually need to visit a center daily for treatment and followup however special exceptions may be granted for sundays state and federal holidays and other times as determined by the treatment center medical director 1buprenorphinenaloxone like methadone has been shown in clinical trials to be effective in treating heroin dependence and may have a lower risk for withdrawal effects upon discontinuation naloxone a pure opiate antagonist at receptor sites is present to help prevent the intravenous abuse of the buprenorphine component buprenorphinenaloxone treatment takes place in an authorized physicians office and this may be more acceptable to patients buprenorphine is also available as a single agent and is used primarily for induction at treatment onset patients are usually switched to the combined buprenorphinenaloxone agent for outpatient maintenance therapy a 2013 report by the drug abuse warning network dawn highlights the fact that buprenorphine has become a popular drug of abuse itself emergency department visits involving buprenorphine increased substantially from 3161 in 2005 to 30135 in 2010 2naltrexone available orally and as an intramuscular depot injection is another treatment option but patients must be opioidfree for at least 7 to 10 days prior to treatment naltrexone is a pure opioid antagonist and may result in withdrawal symptoms if the patient is not opioidfree heroin overdose is a medical emergency that requires treatment with naloxone intravenous naloxone will result in reversal of the opioidinduced respiratory depression within 2 minutes retreatment with naloxone may be required as the duration of action of naloxone 30 to 120 minutes may be shorter than the action of the opioid respiratory support intravenous fluids and other adjunctive medications may be required extent of heroin use heroin addiction is a treatable condition but its use is increasing in recent years according to the 2011 survey on drug use and health by the us substance abuse and mental health administration it is estimated that 607000 persons per year used heroin in the years 20092011 compared to 374000 during 20022005 similarly the estimated number of new heroin users increased from 109000 per year during 20022005 to 169000 per year during 20092011 3the increase in initiation is evident among young adults aged 18 to 25 and adults aged 26 and older there were 28000 youth initiates per year in 20022005 and 27000 in 20092011 young adult initiates increased from 53000 per year to 89000 per year and older adult initiates increased from 28000 to 54000 for these combined time periods past year use estimates for 20022005 and 20092011 showed the same pattern for youths estimates were 43000 and 39000 for young adults the estimates were 124000 and 208000 and for older adults the estimates were 207000 and 361000 monitoring the future mtf data indicates an increase for young adults aged 19 to 28 and a decrease for 10th graders in rates of past year heroin use between 2002 and 2011 mtf data did not indicate any changes among 8th and 12th graders between these 2 years 3patients with heroin addiction should seek advice from health care providers who can guide them with the most appropriate and safe treatment combined behavioral and medical therapies may allow the patient to integrate back into mainstream society and lead a positive and productive life
