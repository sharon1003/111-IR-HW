drinks at sea should you buy a beverage package on a cruise use this guide to help calculate if a drinks package  or à la carte pricing for bottled water sodas and alcohol  makes more financial sense for your cruise by heidi sarnaadvertisement most cruises include the cabin meals entertainment and activities in the fare  though youll have to pay extra for drinks such as bottled water soda wine beer cocktails and specialty coffees these extra fees can really add up if youre a big drinker exceptions to this rule are highend cruise lines such as silversea seabourn regent seven seas sea dream yacht club and crystal which include tips and all alcoholic and nonalcoholic drinks in their rates but on mainstream cruise lines you can easily rack up an onboard bill of hundreds of dollars or more just for drinks  whether you guzzle the soft stuff or the hard to make it easier to keep track of what youre spending and drinking many cruise lines now offer a variety of prepaid drinks packages that can be bought on board or often prebooked on the cruise lines websites for a fixed amount per day or per cruise you can imbibe with abandon the packages are structured in a few ways and may cover one type of drink bottled water or just soda or a combination of drinks beer wine and soda the options include a prepaid debit card for a fixed cash amount from which drink purchases are subtracted theres also a prepaid card or a sticker on your cruise keyid card that gives you access to unlimited beverages sometimes drinks packages come in the form of a coupon booklet that can be redeemed for a set number of drinks ten or 20 drinks most lines also bundle bottles of wine so you can buy three or six bottles of wine to consume on the ship at generally a 10 to 15 discount off the individual bottle prices the beverage packages appeal to people who want the ability to have whatever they want whenever they want it with the convenience of knowing its already paid for at a fair price says scott steenrod associate vice president of food and beverage operations for celebrity cruises  wwwcelebritycruisescom  the first cruise line to come up with an extensive menu of drinks packages beverage packages can be a good way to keep track of what youre consuming so there are no surprises when its time to settle your account but are these drinks packages actually a good deal weve done the math and figured out when it makes financial sense to buy the drinks package rather than individual drinks and dont forget that some cruise lines allow you to share drinks so doublecheck before buying a beverage package for each traveler unless stated otherwise cruise lines add on an automatic 15 service charge for all drinks also prices may vary slightly on ships with different currencies for example princess cruises ships sailing in australia sell drinks packages in australian dollars while the currency aboard costa cruises ships is the euro cheers carnival  wwwcarnivalcombottomless
