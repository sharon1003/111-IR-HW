trolling for trout the ultralight wayby dexter the anticipation for the trout opening weekend has come and gone and youve got the rest of the season to fish your heart out youve caught limits upon limits at your local stomping grounds or lakes and youre feeling as though fishing is starting to get a little boring youve been trolling with the same gear every year since grandpa taught you how how about mixing things up a slight alteration to your trolling and fishing perspectives when fishing for trout in the many lakes in washington can yield many more hours of enjoyment sure you can use just about any rod and reel combo to troll a myriad of lures but when it comes to the quality of really feeling a fight regardless of the size of trout theres only one way to go  an ultralight setup ultralight fishing isnt anything new however when you start to put your own twist to this specific way of fishing it feels all the more satisfying when i first realized that trolling for trout was effective i started to tinker with my selection of gear at this point catching limits isnt my goal i decided that i wanted to enjoy the first reason why i started to fish  fighting a hooked fish rod and reel most trout rods can be used to troll finding the right one for your own preference is the tricky part first i tried small 5 to 6 foot whippy rods great action but not enough leverage when i hooked the above average stocked trout also i ended up having to hold the rod all the time while trolling because the grip isnt long enough to fit in my rod holder without falling to combat the leverage problem i decided that a long rod would do the trick a long rod also allowed the rig to be trolled away from the sides of the boat i experimented with a fly rod that i salvaged when i broke the tip the rod is a 5 weight and is about 7 foot long it was originally an 86 rod with a small spinning reel i was able to catch and land trout up to 18 inches this particular rod has a fast action and has no problems handling a fight with 4 lb test lines i love the arc that this rod makes when ive got a fish on on the negative side since its a fly rod where the reels are usually on the end i was unable to use my rod holders finally the newest rod im experimenting with is a noodle rod its about 96 spinning rod its got the right type of grip that allows me to put it on a rod holder and its got the right action and leverage  lots of leverage this rod handled the typical stocked trout nicelylots of give and super soft so far so good the only caviat is its not as lightweight as the fly rod as for a reel im currently using a shimano sedona 1000fa its a solid small and compact reel with a great drag system and virtually no play with the bail the only thing that i do not like with spinning gear is when letting line out you can open the bail or set your drag on low and pull line out either way it may cause twists on your line im probably going to end trying out small baitcasting gear thatll be another story lures and hardware most of my trolling is flat lining meaning im mainly fishing the top part of the water column with no added weights im usually fishing with just a lure or sometimes in combination with very small flashers the smallest set of flashers i can find that is readily available is seps mini micro flashers they are available with either a willow or colorado style blades the flasher is only 12 inches in length and hardly weighs anything especially when fighting a fish for lures my staples are vibrax minnow spins panther martin spinners seps kokanee candy spoons luhr jensen needlefish spoons wordens roostertails flatfish f4s mepps spinners small rapalas and flies ive found that the spoons and spinners are effective on bright sunny days with a little chop on the water the flies are deadly on bright sunny days with the water like glass the rapalas and the minnow spins are great for the dark cloudy days one thing i try to do is to change lures as often and as the conditions change work in progress as you can see its a work in progress i dont have any hard and fast rules i just make observations and mental notes for the nuances of each outing and then see where things can be applied its something that im looking forward to perfecting the quality of the experience has gone up a notch and the appreciation for each and every trout caught is remembered who knows when ill finally get to that perfect setup one thing is certain im going to have lots of fun getting there references seps pro fishing
