the biggest tax scam ever some of americas top corporations are parking profits overseas and ducking hundreds of billions in taxes and hows congress responding its rewarding them for ripping us off illustration by victor juhasz by tim dickinson august 27 2014i n july the american pharmaceutical giant abb vie maker of the worlds topselling drug – the arthritis treatment humira – reached a blockbuster deal to acquire european rival shire best known for the attentiondeficit medication adderall the merger was cheered by wall street not for what the deal will do to advance pharmaceutical science but because it will empower the bigger firm abb vie to renounce its u s citizenship related the nonexistent case for never raising taxes at 55 billion the abb vie deal is the largest in a cavalcade of corporate inversions a loophole in american tax law permits companies with just 20 percent foreign ownership to reincorporate abroad which means that if a big u s firm acquires a smaller company located in a tax haven it can then invert – that is become a subsidiary of its foreignbased affiliate – and kiss a huge share of its irs obligations goodbye abb vie shareholders will continue to control 75 percent of the company which will still be managed by executives outside chicago but the merged company will now file its tax returns on the island of jersey – a speck of land in the english channel where shire is incorporated abb vie which racked up more than 10 billion in humira sales last year will slash its effective corporate tax rate from 22 percent to 13 the cost to the u s treasury possibly as much as 13 billion by the year 2020 companies striking deals to become technically foreign can be found in all corners of american business from california computerequipment manufacturer applied materials to minnesota medicaldevice giant medtronic to north carolinabased banana behemoth chiquita little is changing in the core business of these firms they will just pay less in taxes – and to a foreign government often ireland or the netherlands these tax turncoats have drawn the ire of president obama i dont care if its legal he declared this summer its wrong these inverted companies he said dont want to give up    all the advantages of operating in the united states they just dont want to pay for it with congress gridlocked obama is vowing to tackle the problem on his own – as he has done to advance his agenda on lgbt equality and immigration reform in august he threatened quick executive action to at least discourage inversion schemes but pressed for specifics the president conceded the white house has no silver bullet in fact treasury secretary jacob lew had declared only weeks earlier we do not believe we have the authority to address this inversion question through administrative action if we did we would be doing more over the next decade corporate inversions could cost the u s treasury nearly 20 billion – revenues that could otherwise pay for head start programs to rebuild roads and bridges or just bring down the deficit the wave of inversions is threatening to hollow out the u s corporate income tax base lew warned in a july letter to the chief tax writers in the house and senate but inversions are just the tip of the iceberg the crisis of corporate tax avoidance is far more pervasive – and destructive – than either obama or lew is letting on at a moment when congress appears impossibly divided a strong bipartisan consensus has in fact emerged in washington the worlds richest corporations will get away with fleecing hundreds of billions of tax dollars from the rest of us in public democratic politicians blast corporate tax dodgers but the partys most viable comprehensive reform proposals would reward the crooked accounting of u sbased multinationals republicanbacked legislation – no surprise – would only make the crisis worse why its not rocket science its money and politics says jared bernstein former top economic adviser to vice president joe biden concentrated wealth is buying the policy agenda it likes and blocking one it doesnt l ast year the irs finally collected more in tax receipts than it did before the crash in 2007 but dig a little deeper into the numbers and it is clear we havent returned to normal corporations paid nearly 100 billion less in federal income taxes last year than before the great recession – down nearly 40 percent as a share of gdp in fact corporate profits and corporate tax collections are now trending in opposite directions profits were up 93 billion last year – to a high of 21 trillion according to the commerce department yet corporate tax payments actually fell last year by more than 15 billion how is this possible it goes way beyond inversion the top names in american business – from apple to xerox – have joined in the greatest tax dodge in world history using clever accounting games these corporations have siphoned majestic sums out of the country and into taxhaven shell companies – where the money is untouchable by the irs the numbers are staggering more than 2 trillion in u sbased multinational profits currently sit in offshore accounts representing by credible estimates in excess of 500 billion in unpaid taxes if that money were deposited in federal coffers tomorrow it would wipe out the deficit for 2014 and every year that congress dithers on a crackdown america is forfeiting an approximate 90 billion in revenue related the great american bubble machine from tech stocks to high gas prices goldman sachs has engineered every major market manipulation since the great depression  and theyre about to do it again the details of corporate tax avoidance can be dizzyingly complex but the broad strokes are simple for more than a century american corporations have been required to pay taxes on their global income theres no double taxation problem companies receive credit for taxes paid over to other governments the logic of our system is straightforward u s corporate citizens enjoy benefits that arent cabined inside our borders the u s navy secures shipping lanes needed to transport goods from chinese factories to ports around the world the american legal system protects corporate patents and other intellectual property worldwide u s taxpayers fund the rd that makes many of these corporations profitable in the first place there is one odd hitch in our system of global taxation the corporate tax bill – nominally 35 percent – is not due in america until the foreign profits come home in the jargon of the corporate world the taxes are deferred until the profits are repatriated until then the offshore cash can be invested and grow u staxfree not unlike your 401 k the deferral tax break really highlights how broken our tax code is says ron wyden the oregon democrat who chairs the senate finance committee when you park a big chunk of cash overseas you get a huge tax break for it in reality much of the untaxed income is actually earned in the united states before elaborate accounting schemes siphon it overseas the racket is simplest for tech and pharmaceutical companies whose value is tied to intellectual property according to david cay johnston author of perfectly legal the covert campaign to rig our tax system to benefit the super rich – and cheat everybody else pfizer provides a prime example when the company was developing viagra it transferred the economic rights to its intellectual property abroad ultimately to a shell company in liechtenstein – an infamous european tax haven on each sale of the drug here the european subsidiary charged the u s parent company a steep royalty – payment of which moved the profit from hightax america to low to zerotax liechtenstein adding insult to injury this selfdealing creates a phantom business expense in the united states they get a tax deduction in america while they pile up the money in another country taxfree says johnston contrary to what the term offshore might suggest these untaxed profits are not stranded theres this false notion that these funds are locked in a strongbox somewhere says edward kleinbard a former chief of staff for congress joint committee on taxation in reality these untaxed foreign profits are often banked by the offshore subsidiaries themselves in manhattan – where theyre used to invest in stocks and u s treasury bonds the money says kleinbard is already back in the u s economy worse equally convoluted accounting sleights of hand can be used to make the untaxed income – or at least its financial power – available to fund daily corporate operations in the u s or just enrich shareholders the ratings agency standard  poors recently coined a term to describe this practice synthetic cash repatriation take apple which wanted to reward investors last year with a 60 billion stock buyback that would boost the companys share price apple did not have enough cash in its american accounts to complete the deal and the company couldnt legally tap its offshore billions reportedly banked in manhattan without paying u s taxes to sidestep the law apple borrowed the cash using the largest corporate bond offering in history to raise 17 billion in the states thanks to the massive piles of offshored cash and securities on its books – presently more than 137 billion – apples net cost of borrowing was minuscule about 157 percent apple liked this trick so much it repeated it – raising another 12 billion in april this year shareholders got their reward only uncle sam was cut out of the deal t he crisis in multinational corporate tax avoidance is growing exponentially according to an analysis by audit analytics the indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings of the firms in the russell 1000 index surged from 11 trillion in 2008 to more than 21 trillion in 2013 that latter figure is greater than the gdp of russia the analysis reveals that the biggest names in corporate america are boycotting the u s tax system en masse top offenders include giants from hightech microsoft 76 billion big pharma pfizer 69 billion big oil exxon mobil 47 billion investment banks goldman sachs 22 billion big tobacco philip morris 20 billion discount retailers walmart 19 billion fastfood chains mc donalds 16 billion – even heavy machinery caterpillar 17 billion general electric has 110 billion stashed offshore and enjoys an effective tax rate of four percent – 31 points lower than its statutory obligation to the irs the things these companies are doing 20 years ago would almost certainly have been illegal says bob mc intyre president of citizens for tax justice but now youve got so many big powerful corporations doing it that its the norm systematic avoidance helps explain why corporate income taxes – onethird of federal revenue in the 1950s – have now dropped below 10 percent of treasury receipts today many in corporate america justify this rampant tax dodging by arguing that the 35 percent corporate tax rate in the u s is too high in reality our system offers big corporations so many other tax favors that the effective tax multinationals pay on their u s profits is often lower than what the same companies pay in other developed nations the constant corporate whining that theyre overtaxed in the united states mc intyre says is bullshit a merica confronted – and largely dealt with – the issue of international tax loopholes once before a halfcentury ago the kennedy administration understood that american corporations were using accounting gimmicks to shift untaxed profits overseas deferral has served as a shelter for tax escape through the unjustifiable use of tax havens president kennedy said in 1961 congress eventually agreed on new laws that drew a sharp line between active income – earned from selling realworld goods and services – and passive income the easily manipulated paper profits generated from financial transactions the former would still qualify for the deferral tax break the latter would be taxed immediately the kennedyera reforms kept corporate tax avoidance substantially in check through both democratic and republican administrations even reagan cracked down on multinational tax dodgers with the tax reform of 1986 but changes in recent years – including one in 1997 and another in 2006 – have according to a recent senate investigation nearly completely undercut the ability of the treasury to tax the paperwork profits of multinationals the original sin was committed by the clinton treasury – then led by robert rubin later a top executive at citigroup and a major player in the subprime mortgage crisis in 1997 treasury changed regulations to permit corporations to decide for themselves which subsidiaries were relevant for tax purposes simply by ticking off a box on a tax form but these changes intended to simplify the tax code also opened a colossal loophole by telling the irs to treat certain offshore subsidiaries as disregarded entities – aka tax nothings – corporate accountants could divert and mask passive income making it untaxable abroad i dont think they realized how much checkthebox would lubricate international tax avoidance says kleinbard corporate accountants were gleeful tax watchdogs were horrified the stupid clinton treasury mc intyre says bitterly they were warned about this before they put out the regulations then they discovered that all the people who were telling them they were idiots were right for a brief moment treasury sought to reverse course but lobbyists from firms including monsanto morgan stanley ibm and philip morris locked arms to defend their de facto tax cut the clinton treasury backed down soon some administration officials took a spin through the revolving door – raising troubling questions about the relationship between corporate america and its regulators william morris who became the clinton treasurys associate international tax counsel around the time the regulations were enacted jumped to ge where today he orchestrates the firms global tax policy t he great corporate tax dodge exploded under the presidency of george w bush by 2004 american multinationals had siphoned hundreds of billions of dollars offshore far from cracking down the republican congress rewarded corporate tax dodgers with a repatriation tax holiday multinationals were invited to bring home their overseas earnings – to be taxed at a measly 525 percent related the vampire squid strikes again banks are no longer just financing heavy industry they are actually buying it up and inventing bigger bolder and scarier scams than ever this tax giveaway was part of bushs american jobs creation act and sold to the public as a way to provide a shot in the arm to the u s economy more than 300 billion came home – nearly 80 percent of it from locations the u s government considers tax havens but the tax holiday didnt spur investment growth or jobs in fact the top 15 participants after bringing home a collective 150 billion proceeded to slash 20000 jobs the act did little more than make rich investors even richer a huge proportion of each repatriated dollar – between 60 and 92 cents – wound up in the hands of shareholders the bush tax holiday also dangled in front of every cfo in america the expectation that there would be another tax holiday and another after that says kleinbard eager to reassure corporate america that pipelining profits offshore was now kosher congress enacted littledebated legislation in 2006 that codified tax exclusions enabled by the decadeold checkthebox rules the accounting boondoggle was now doubly entrenched – in law and regulation the impact was stark in 2006 corporations held roughly 600 billion offshore that sum would soon double then triple i n his first campaign for president barack obama called for ending tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas – shorthand for repealing tax deferrals on offshored corporate profits but upon taking office in 2009 obama lowered his sights proposing more modest reforms including elimination of checkthebox and a limit on tax deductions linked to offshore profits despite preserving deferral these reforms were still projected to raise 210 billion over a decade and obama continued to talk tough in may of that year he denounced our broken tax system written by wellconnected lobbyists and promised to restore fairness and balance to our tax code but even these proposals ran into a corporate buzz saw around 200 multinationals including top backers of democrats had joined forces in a campaign spearheaded by the business roundtable and the u s chamber of commerce ken kies a top lobbyist for companies including ge and microsoft told reporters this is going to be the biggest fight for the corporate community in the next two years the corporate blitz worked the new president whod won more votes than ronald reagan backed down we were doing the recovery act health care reform and financial reform says bernstein bidens former economic adviser adding a massive fight with multinational corporations just wouldnt have been smart far from ending the abuses of corporate tax avoidance the obama administration has since become complicit the president has twice signed legislation reauthorizing the bush law that effectively codifies checkthebox the provision is among a package of tax extenders – including loopholes favored by both parties – that congress habitually tacks on to other mustpass legislation these corporate giveaways were last rubberstamped in the 2013 bill that pulled america back from the fiscal cliff w ithout meaningful resistance from congress corporations are pressing forward with abusive tax schemes two recent senate investigations offer a window into the dark arts of corporate americas tax avoidance apples tax strategies in particular have come under the microscope on a recent earnings call the silicon valley giant announced it has parked 1377 billion offshore in its own sec filings apple has revealed it would have to pay nearly 33 percent in u s tax – some 45 billion – to repatriate those offshored earnings that would be more than enough to fund nasa for the next two years according to senate investigators apple makes use of ghost companies incorporated in ireland as a conduit for shifting billions of dollars in income from the u s from 2009 to 2012 apple booked 30 billion in income to a subsidiary called apple operations international an entity with no official employees but thanks to overlapping loopholes in irish and american tax law aoi has not been forced to declare itself a tax resident of either country as a result for the past five years it filed no returns and its profits werent taxed by any government apple sought the holy grail of tax avoidance said sen carl levin dmich chairman of the permanent subcommittee on investigations apple for its part insists that its accounting practices are legitimate we pay all the taxes we owe said ceo tim cook testifying before congress in may 2013 while tech firms and big pharma have long made use of accounting tricks to offshore profits big industrial concerns have not historically been able to play games to the same degree thats no longer true starting about 15 years ago heavyequipment manufacturer caterpillar paid accounting firm pricewaterhouse coopers 55 million to create a scheme to migrate profits from the u s to switzerland with no change to its core business caterpillar began booking earnings from its u smanaged parts business in geneva – after first negotiating a deal with swiss authorities to tax those earnings at four to six percent from 2000 to 2012 caterpillar shifted more than 8 billion in taxable income to europe deferring 24 billion in u s taxes in the fantasyland that is international tax law levin said tax lawyers waved a magic wand to make millions of dollars in u s taxes disappear t he real problem with multinational corporate tax avoidance is not that the firms are breaking the law its that the law itself is broken most of what theyre doing is completely legal says a top senate tax staffer the problem is with the system that allows them to do it democratic senate finance chairman ron wyden has long sought to overhaul the corporate tax system wyden talks like a progressive champion likening the current tax code to a rotten carcass that the special interests feast on he has introduced legislation that would eliminate deferral for all international corporate profits which would be a huge victory for taxpayers according to a joint committee on taxation estimate forcing companies to pay taxes on their profits as theyre earned would raise around 600 billion over 10 years if only wyden had stopped there in an attempt to draw support from taxphobic gop lawmakers wyden would actually give away all that revenue – plus 200 billion more over the first decade according to the tax policy center – by slashing the u s corporate tax rate to just 24 percent wyden insists that this low rate would both keep highskill highwage jobs at home and deter companies from manipulating the tax code to set up shop overseas the morons in congress are either unbelievably disingenuous h david rosenbloom who directs the international tax program at nyus law school says or too stupid to understand this theres no way the u s can set its tax rates low enough to compete with taxhaven nations like ireland he says and still run a global superpower wyden has also called for a repeat of the 2004 tax holiday – allowing offshored cash to come at the discounted rate of just 525 percent on 21 trillion in offshored earnings that could give these companies close to a halftrilliondollar tax break wyden calls the corporate giveaway a sensible transition the best that can be said of wydens approach is that by ending deferral and making schemes to offshore u s profits moot it would stop the bleeding in contrast the top republican proposal developed by house ways and means chairman dave camp would rip open new arteries like wyden camp would also slash the overall corporate tax rate – to 25 percent in lieu of a tax holiday he would impose a transition tax on offshore profits from 875 percent to as low as 35 percent camps legislation solves the problem of deferred offshore profits by largely surrendering the united states right to tax corporate earnings booked abroad – making our international tax system even more of a mess than it is now writes mc intyre this is the reality of our political system in 2014 in what should be a titanic battle between multinational corporate power and federal power our elected representatives are hardly putting up a fight obama has been a sharp critic of corporate tax avoidance yet the offshore corporate earnings stash has nearly doubled on his watch senate majority leader harry reid has unleashed blistering attacks on corporations like walgreens that have threatened to renounce their u s citizenship for tax purposes and he has said hes ready to roll on a vote for a suretofail democratic bill that seeks a twoyear moratorium on inversions yet reid has also been shopping a standalone taxholiday proposal rewarding multinational tax avoiders with a 95 percent rate reids partner in this effort kentucky republican rand paul – whos been courting rightwing billionaire david koch rands got good ideas koch told the wichita eagle in july the american people want change twothirds of americans believe large corporations should be paying higher taxes and 80 percent believe corporate loopholes should be closed but washington isnt listening the kidglove treatment of corporate tax offenders by both parties is exhibit a in americas shift from a functioning democracy to a nascent oligarchy it aligns with a recent study conducted by princeton and northwestern that concluded organized groups representing business interests have substantial independent impacts on federal decision making while the interests of average americans appear to have only a minuscule statistically nonsignificant impact corporate tax breaks are beloved by those who take advantage of them says bernstein youre not going to change that without realigning a lot of politics until that day comes well be living with the tax policy that multinational corporations have bought and paid for which means that you and i are stuck with the bills more news obama vs the hawks must read invest offshore profits in u s
