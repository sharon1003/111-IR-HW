votesup vote4down voteaccepted the ford dealer can do it by using your vehicle serial number i have no idea what they charge for the service if you are a regular customer they may be nice and do it for free an alternative is to remove the radio get the serial number off the radio and use one of the online services that provide access codes if you arent comfortable removing the radio the dealer may be the best choice my advice after this is to leave the radio uncoded as the odds of a ten year old radio being stolen are pretty slimshare improve this answeranswered jun 14 13 at 1208mikes172k 2

these are sometimes hand written inside the owners manual or on a a business card that says radio code on it thats placed inside the document holder that was supplied with the vehicle people are also known to write it on the topbottom of the actual radio itself this would require removing the radio dealerships can usually access this information by the vin number if not then theyll pull the radio for you and use the serial number on the radio if its simply just the dealership looking it up via the vin number then there should be no charge and can usually be done over the phone if it requires pulling the radio then i would imagine its a flat fee which is somewhere around a half an hour labor 3040 dollars is an average of what i see in los angelesshare improve this answeranswered jun 17 13 at 929cinelli2977 8 253if youre going to have to pay the dealer 50 or so to pull it and reset the code if youre not completely happy with the stereo this might be a good time to replace it  if you shop around you can probably find a bluetoothusb mp3 stereo for around 100 including installation – johnny jun 17 13 at 1422thats more a matter of personal opinion or going around the problem not resolving the issue – cinelli jun 18 13 at 3544thats why i added it as a comment instead of an answer replacing an 8 year old stereo with a new one is a valid option but whether or not its a solution depends on whether the real problem is my stereo stopped working because i forgot the code how can i play music in my car again or if its i really like my car stereo but i forgot the code how do i make it work again – johnny jun 19 13 at 1946add a commentup vote2down vote i used a code generator downloaded from this site and it worked fine httpwwwfreefordradiocodecouk if you got the right model

4 digit code but if you take some liberties like starting at 7000 you might get lucky this is not the best solution but it certainly is oneshare improve this answeranswered jun 19 13 at 1130captain kenpachi7835 1 13 36if only that were true most radio units ive heard of only allow for 10 incorrect entries before its locked for good and needs to be taken to a dealership to unlock it which makes me wonder what exactly the dealerships do to unlock them – hashim jan 10 17 at 1952so theyre smarter than a satellite tv decoder ah well – captain kenpachi jan 11 17 at 754why satellite tv decoders

immobilizer there is always the option to desolder the eeprom in the radio put it in a programmer dump it and look through it with a hex editor to find where the code is or just modify the firmware to
