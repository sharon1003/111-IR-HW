many scowl at the mention of allergy shots but experts say they can offer lasting relief  freeing people from daily allergy medications by sid kirchheimer web md feature reviewed by michael smith when it comes to allergies the best treatment is obvious to those who administer it  and largely avoided by those who need it an estimated one in three americans suffers from seasonal or yearround allergies caused by pollen mold insects dust mites and other common irritants and allergy shots  medically known as allergen immunotherapy  are considered by most experts to be the most effective way to bring longterm relief of allergy symptoms with each injection patients are given increasingly higher doses of the actual allergy trigger until their body becomes resistant to it  preventing the allergic reaction by comparison antihistamines inhaled steroids and other allergy medications  which usually must be taken daily  treat the resulting symptoms caused by the allergy trigger but not the allergens themselves as good as or better than drugsthere have been no good headtohead study comparisons between immunotherapy and allergy medications says allergist james li md of the mayo clinic most physicians recognize that antihistamines have significant but a fairly modest benefit but the degree of benefit with allergy shots is quite substantial at least equal to or exceeding many medications but despite their effectiveness allergy shots are largely ignored by most patients whom either suffer through the allergy season in silence or pop pills to temporarily ease their misery a survey by the american college of allergy asthma and immunology acaai shows that two in three people with allergies would never consider getting allergy shots why people stay away first theres the allergy testing  multiple scratches into the skin with different allergy triggers to identify what the person is allergic to then theres the time involved  weekly injections for three to five months to gradually build resistance followed by several years of monthly maintenance shots and theres the pain with each allergy shot theres also the time it takes for the allergy shots to show noticeable results usually several months after those weekly building doses are completed relief of symptoms can be seen after a few days of antihistamine pills and theres the biggest reason at least according to most of the allergy sufferers surveyed by the acaai three years ago the cost do the math and a doctors visit  anywhere from 25 to 100 each repeated 25 times or so in the first year alone and then monthly until patients are relatively symptomfree for two years  is a lot more expensive than a bottle of overthecounter claritin right and if insurance doesnt pick up the bill allergy shots may be all but impossible for some people to afford allergy shots may be cheaper its precisely because claritin has gone over the counter that these days taking onceaday medications may be more expensive than allergy shots say experts many of the standard medications used for common allergies like hay fever are no longer paid by medicare medicaid and many private insurance companies says myron zitt md chief of allergy and immunology at the queens long island medical group in babylon n y and clinical associate professor of medicine at the state university of new york stony brook school of medicine the insurance companies say as long as one effective medicine is available over the counter patients should take it  and not more expensive prescription drugs he tells web md so unlike in years past they no longer cover those other drugs the cost has shifted from the insurance companies to the patients meanwhile allergy shots continue to be covered by insurance companies  usually in full or with a modest copay but even before claritin went over the counter and changed the insurers rules allergy shots still seemed to make good economic sense at least in the medical community in april 2000 respiratory reviews published a study indicating that a patients outofpocket drug costs for treating yearround allergic rhinitis was 1200 but researcher timothy j sullivan iii md of emory university calculated that the same patient would pay only 800 for the first year of allergy shots  the most expensive year in following years when allergy shots are done monthly or even less frequently those costs drop to between 290 and 170 over six years that amounts to a 1300 to 2900 savings with allergy shots that study shows and theres the august 1999 study in the new england journal of medicine that shows allergy shots to treat grass pollens can provide up to three years of additional relief after treatment has ended once you stop antihistamines and other drugs youre right back where you started says zitt even a couple of missed doses can do that allergy shots and the triggers they fight allergy shots are effective against all sorts of allergy triggers that float in the air including tree pollens grass pollens weed pollens mold spores dust mites cat dander insect stings but when it comes to other types of allergy triggers  such as food allergies and skin reactions  there is not enough research to support allergy shots according to the american college of allergy asthma and immunology before allergy shots begin allergists identify the specific allergen s with the skin scratch test avoiding a common problem patients who selfdiagnose themselves and may reach for antihistamines under the assumption they have seasonal hay fever when they could also be allergic to yearround dust mites mold or cat dander allergy shots benefit some patients more than others those with hay fever tend to fare best with more than 90 getting significant relief says li allergy shots are also extremely effective for mildtomoderate asthma specifically when attacks are caused by allergies or bee sting and other insect sensitivity allergy shots are also effective for those with cat and dust mite allergy but the challenge there is that there continues to be significant continued exposure  and avoidance of the allergen is the most important factor in preventing symptoms li tells web md thats what makes mold allergies especially difficult you really need to stop leaky pipes and other sources causing mold thats why i personally have less confidence in mold allergy shots compared to the excellent results seen for pollen cat and dust mites danger danger although there is a minimal risk of severe allergic reaction from allergy shots the injections pose little risk as long as they are administered with slowly increasing doses the reason why allergy shots typically take three to five years is because giving more hefty doses in a shorter time frame could trigger potentially lifethreatening anaphylactic shock  an intense reaction to an allergy trigger in which the airway can close who should avoid allergy shots allergy shots are not recommended for those with heart disease or severe asthma in addition allergy shots should not be started during pregnancy but can be continued during pregnancy if they started before conception if theres an adverse reaction during immunotherapy you have to give adrenaline says zitt and you dont want to do that during pregnancy to heart patients or those with severe asthma but if youre not building up resistance theres not that concern and allergy shots are extremely safe welltolerated and highly effective for most people with allergies originally published aug 22 2003 medically updated feb 22 2005 sources myron zitt md
