1 make a list of the chemicals and their chemical formulas involved in airbag deployment based on the reading in the links below 2 sort the chemicals in two ways a by the reaction in which they are involved reaction 1 2 or 3 and b by which side of the equation theyre on reactant or product side 3 once youve finished this sort determine which chemicals are the initial reactants and which are the final products 4 what other chemicals are used in these reactions and why  hint sodium metal and sodium and potassium oxides are highly reactive 6 use the ideal gas equation to calculate how many moles of nitrogen gas are generated when the airbag deploys assume 12 atm 30 degrees celsius and 70l for the airbags fully inflated volume 7 based on your reading what reactants are packed in the airbag module 8 how many moles of sodium azide must the module hold in order to inflate the airbag use the moles of nitrogen gas you calculated above to help you answer this question 9 how many grams of sodium are produced in the first reaction 10 how many grams of potassium nitrate are needed to completely react with the sodium produced 11 discuss the safety of the following reactantsproducts 12 explain why stoichiometry and careful measurement of reactants is important in the chemistryand function of airbags
