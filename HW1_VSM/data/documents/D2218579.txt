tritip steak glory grilled or roasted september 4 2015 by kim labor day weekend is traditionally the last true summer weekend for gathering the family around the grill that and the launch of our sparkling new thermapen ® mk4 inspired us to new heights with this underappreciated cut of beautiful beefiness origin of the cut you’ve likely heard of tritip before but what is it beef tritip is a cut of meat from the bottom of the sirloin primal cut that has only been on the us market since the early 1950s it was first introduced in oakland california by otto schaefer by the late 1950s it had become a local specialty in santa maria california it’s classically prepared rubbed with salt pepper fresh garlic and grilled to mediumrare doneness fresh salsa and beans are classic accompaniments for this cut other nontraditional preparation methods sometimes used are roasted rotisserie smoked and braised tritip is commonly used for fajitas beef stroganoff and can be used in place of flank steak this cut can be difficult to find the farther east you travel but your butcher should be able to special order it for you and he may even know it by a different name a tritip by any other name…we found this great list of other titles the tritip sometimes goes by at thetritipguycom the california cut bottom sirloin tip triangle cut bottom sirloin primal cut santa maria cut newport steak

the image to the left this cut is shaped a bit like a boomerang because of this odd shape it lends itself well to satisfying the varying tastes of a crowd because the finished product will have different degrees of doneness throughout the thinner areas near the tips will be more well done while the thickest area at the center will be beautifully medium rare the protein strands in this cut are larger than in tender lean meat like something cut from the tenderloin thinner more densely packed protein strands hold moisture better than the tritip will so after the meat has cooked and even after it rests be prepared for a fair amount of juices to be lost when carving this particular cut of beef now for our test kitchen experiment interesting discoveries were madetwo cooking methods we tested two different cooking methods for this post— grilled and ovenroasted the first method grilling is primarily a directheat method  conduction  and the other oven roasting primarily an openair heat method  convection  to be precise in an oven the heat transfer begins in the air surrounding the meat but once the surface is heated the meat begins transferring heat energy in the protein fibers through conduction also anytime electric current is used in a heat source it puts out radiant heat so more is going on than meets the eye but for the purposes of our testing we’ll call it conduction vs convection testing temperature with thermapen mk4 before cooking probe placement we used a chef alarm probe thermometer to track the internal temperature with both tritips proper placement is crucial with tritips because of its odd shape you want to be sure to measure the thickest spot in the cut with your chef alarm probe but that can be tricky to find spot testing with a thermapen mk4 helps to give you the exact location of the lowest temperature in the meat and that’s where the probe needs to be placed even if you’ve let your meat rest at room temperature there may be a cold spot lurking and the thermapen mk4 will find it quickly grilling methodology we brought our grilled cut to room temperature before cooking as is so often recommended it took over two hours for the meat to come to 70º75ºf tritip hitting the grill the tritip pictured to the left is prepared simply with olive oil and a light dusting of salt and pepper before grilling no more no less in traditional santa maria fashion you can also rub the meat with fresh garlic the grill was at high heat for 5 minutes before placing the meat on it it was grilled for about 8 minutes on each side and reached 120ºf after 17 total minutes of cooking while grilling we monitored the change in temperature throughout the cook using a thermapen mk4 not only can you check for temperature gradients but it’s also a good indicator in finding hot spots on your grill these spot temperature checks can help guide where to adjust the meat’s position on the grill ovenroasted tritip with fajita rub ovenroasting methodology the ovenroasted tritip was given a generous coating of a fajita dry rub we made from a recipe at simpledailyrecipescom and taken directly from the refrigerator at 38ºf to the oven preheated to 450ºf it only took about 25 minutes for this tritip to reach 130ºfrise in temperature over time the comparison during cooking the grilled cut increased in temperature at a rate of 294ºf per minute and the ovenroasted tritip at a rate of 34ºf per minute after they had each been removed from their heat source the cooking process predictably decreased the grilled steak reached its peak temperature in four minutes at a rate of 17ºf per minute while the ovenroasted cut took twenty minutes to reach its peak temperature for a rate of 11ºf per minute even though the ovenroasted cut was started thirty two degrees lower than the grilled one it had the fastest rate of temperature increasetesting gradient temperatures with thermapen mk4temperature gradients testing areas of the meat closer to grilled tritip resting after reaching 120ºf note the groove around the perimeter of the cutting board to catch juicesthe exterior with a thermapen mk4 we were able to see that the temperature had as much as a fifteendegree temperature increase toward the edges of the meat these variations in temperature are due to gradients or the effect of heat traveling from the highest temperature area to the lowest by the end of the rest the edges of the meat will be medium or medium well while the thickest area is medium rare restingcarryover cooking each was pulled at 120ºf tented with aluminum foil and allowed to rest before their preparation was completed we carefully monitored the change in temperature using a chef alarm probe thermometer  remember that the probe must be placed in the thickest part of the meat one of the chef alarm’s great features is that it automatically records the max and min temperatures so you’ll know the peak temperature your meat reaches during the rest cutting tritip in half crosswise slicing after resting cut in half crosswise then slice into thin strips against the grain for the most tender mouthfeel the grilled meat was plated with the santa maria salsa as pictured at the top of the post and these are our fajitas made with the dryrubbed ovenroasted cut the grilled was more tender but lost far more liquid when cut than the ovenroasted cut why the difference it’s simple proteins shrink less and expel less moisture and fat when cooked at more moderate temperatures than with high direct heat slicing against the grain note all the juices lostabout slicing into your tritip meathead from amazingribscom recommends using a carving board that has deep valleys cut into it or else the juices will run away from you we found this to be very true even after resting there was a large amount of juice that ran out the takeaway your chosen cooking method affects the resting time and the peak temperature rise in carryover cooking we found during the rest the slower cooking method roasting had a slower rise in temperature and reached a higher peak temperature than our grilled meat–even though it was started at a lower temperature knowing this helps in predicting the proper pull temperature to achieve the desired result fast accurate temperature tracking is the surefire way to know what’s going on inside meat during cooking and tracking multiple temperatures was critical with this cut if the cold spots weren’t located correctly we would have pulled them too soon and ended up with undercooked meat chef alarm helps us to track the change in temperature records the max and min and alerts the user when the desired temperature is reached the speed and accuracy of the thermapen mk4 were necessary to help us with proper probe placement and to test the
