with a knife under his left eye to prove himself to shanks so that he could join them in their adventures 19 however later shanks refused to bring luffy stating that he was still too young to join shanks crew 21during a scene with shanks and higuma a local mountain bandit that insulted shanks and his crew luffy accidentally ate a devil fruit known as the gomu gomu no mi and unwittingly turned himself into a rubber human initially this situation affected luffy badly as it means he will never be able to swim again which is a great weakness to anyone who wishes to journey the seas this however does not deter luffys dream and he continued aspiring to become a pirate 22later luffy stood up to higuma on behalf of shanks however he was easily defeated and became a hostage his captors were easily defeated by the redhaired pirates but the bandit leader higuma had fled out to sea with luffy 23shanks loses his left arm while saving luffy while out at sea higuma threw luffy in the ocean only to be attacked by a sea king moments later while he was laughing at luffy higuma was eaten though shanks managed to save luffy he paid a high price his left arm was lost to the sea king

that telling him he can stay at their hideout or starve to death luffy took a look at the meateating ace asking if he can have a piece he then got scolded by dadan telling him he can do fine with just rice and water but he saw ace leave and followed him luffy said to ace that he was not angry at ace for spitting on him since it was not something to get worked up about and he is also thinking about shanks behavior and wanted to be friends ace responded by knocking a tree down at luffy luffy then followed ace across a bridge ace noticed him and knocked him off of the bridge luffy returned to dadans house a week later and told dadan that he was being chased by wolves and fell off a cliff luffy got sent to bed without any treatment for his wounds the next day ace went out again and luffy followed wanting to start a friendship only to get shunned by ace after three months of persistently trying to follow ace luffy eventually came across the gray terminal luffy overheard ace and sabo s conversation about buying a pirate ship luffy showed up to them and said that he wanted to be a pirate too ace and sabo then tied luffy to a tree and decided that they should kill luffy to keep their secret safe while luffy panicked ace and sabo have a hard time deciding who should kill luffy since both ace and sabo have never killed anyone before they heard someone coming and they untied luffy and hid in the bushes porchemy of the bluejam pirates arrived searching for stolen money luffy then wandered off and got caught by porchemy luffy yelled out aces name porchemy recognizing that name took luffy away for interrogation 27porchemy then dragged luffy into a small house and tied him up luffy stated that he was not going to say anything porchemy then hit luffy with a giant hammer and discovered luffys devil fruit powers that prevent him from getting harmed by the hammer porchemy then used spiked gloves that are effective against luffy however luffy refused to yield porchemy lost his patience drew a sword and was about to kill luffy when ace and sabo arrived they cut luffy loose and defeated porchemy out in the woods ace asked luffy why he did not tell porchemy about the whereabouts of ace and sabos treasure luffy then told ace that he wanted a friend that he had no parents who can take care of him and most importantly that he did not want to be alone after that ace and sabo started to trust luffy and he joined the two and the trio started making a name for themselves 28 29luffy ace and sabo sharing sake to become sworn brothers later on luffy was shown fighting ace with the former losing for the 50th time after that along with sabo they went to hunt gators look for trash in the gray terminal and eat and run however while they were running from the restaurant they saw a man that called out sabos name after they escape ace and luffy started questioning him by choking him and forcing him to tell them who the man was sabo said that the man who called out to him was his dad a noble he told ace and luffy that at the time when he was a noble even though he had parents he was still lonely he later joined ace and luffy when they shout out their dreams and said that he wanted to draw a map of the world however the trio soon realized that they could not agree to be subordinates of the brother who might become captain on their pirate ship ace came up with an idea telling luffy and sabo that they all could become brothers by exchanging sake that he stole from dadan as long as they have this bond it will not matter where they are 30 the trio had many misadventures together 31the sabo incident edit one day the bluejam pirates captured the trio and bluejam told the trio that sabos father hired captain bluejam to get rid of ace and luffy and bring sabo back to him sabo pleaded with his father to stop hurting his brothers he said that he will do whatever his father commanded him to do if they stop hurting ace and luffy ace and luffy protested but his father agreed to the deal and ordered sabo to come home sabo agreed to the deal as he walked away ace and luffy begged him to stay as sabo walked away with his father tears were running down his face 32luffy and ace were carried away by the pirates and they agreed to a deal that the bluejam pirates will let them go if they carried cargo to a marked location in gray terminal 33 after a nights rest bluejam later revealed to luffy and ace that the cargo that they had carried was oil and gunpowder and that the gray terminal will be engulfed with flames luffy and ace reacted angrily but were quickly apprehended by the pirates while bluejam asked ace where the brothers treasure was stored 34 later that night the flames started and luffy and ace managed to cut themselves loose after being tied up 35 luffy and ace then ran for their lives 36while trying to escape the two ran into bluejam once more bluejam decided that if he was to die that he will take the two with him however he first asked ace one last time to reveal the location of their treasure while luffy was against it ace was willing to let the pirates have the treasure to ensure luffys safety however after ace told bluejam where the treasure was bluejam had his crew restrain ace and luffy as bluejam began to badmouth sabo ace verbally retaliated spurring luffy to bite his captors arm the pirate responded by slashing him across the face with his sword before the pirate could finish luffy off though ace let out a scream of rage unbeknown to everyone there including himself that he was wielding haki the blast knocked everyone out aside from luffy and bluejam bluejam almost killed ace but then dadan appeared to rescue the two boys although she said that they should all run away ace refused to run from his enemy luffy decided to stay and fight as well but dadan forbad it remaining in his place luffy was then taken back by the bandits to recover at home 37luffy awoke the next day crying and saying that he wanted to know if ace dadan and sabo were all right 38 after dogura went to check the remaining ashes of gray terminal luffy was very upset for not being allowed to go look for ace and dadan

luffy on his head ace told how he and dadan got out of the burning terminal after beating bluejam and dadan rested while getting healed with the medicines ace stole from the town 40 later that day

went to the city and saw sabo setting sail on a boat and then get shot by a ship 42 ace attacked dogura accusing him for lying but he replied hes not lying nor dreaming and he saw it with his own eyes luffy realized that sabo was not happy at all for coming back to the city and started to cry ace tried to go to the city to avenge him but was stopped by dadan because she was afraid of ace being killed blaming the country for killing sabo not only the nobles since ace was still too angry he was tied up to a tree while luffy cried the whole night 43a while later luffy still mourning sabo asked ace to never die to which ace made the promise to luffy that he would not leave his crybaby brother alone luffy then decided that he wanted to become stronger 44 after years of training stealing food

and zoro were about to leave gonzo told them that it would cost them for all the oden they ate and they so happened not to have any money on them at all so they were stuck with the bill and gonzo tied them in chains 95then while tobio was daydreaming in the soars of the island they believed woonan disappeared to a small breeze threw luffys hat to him then tobio argued with his grandfather and ran in the forest with luffys hat as a result luffy while chained with zoro ran after tobio and when they found him they were all lost in the forest meanwhile el drago who usopp and nami as hostages found

then explained themselves to luffy and asked him to take sanji along with him 128 luffy however refused to take sanji along unless he agreed to go by his own free will just as luffy and the chefs were discussing a half eaten yosaku came barging into the restaurant 129after luffy freed yosaku from the panda shark yosaku explained to luffy that the others needed his abilities to deal with the

ruled by a fishman named arlong arlong was originally under one of the great lords of the sea jinbe a fishman shichibukai who was very strong compared to don krieg luffy however did not pay much attention to what yosaku was saying and instead attempted to draw some interpretations of what a fishman would look like being unable to grasp the situation fully any further luffy then simply just stated that they will understand it when they get there with that luffy decided to join in a meal prepared by sanji 132 as luffy and company were enjoying the meal a giant sea cow called mohmoo

to come back to his crew nami however refused luffys pleas and told him and the rest of his crew to get out before it is too late unable to reason any further luffy simply then decided to fall asleep in the middle of the road with the intention of not leaving the island without nami 138 after a while luffy woke up to find out that usopp was alive and in actuality saved by nami luffy and crew were then greeted by namis sister nojiko who decided to tell them why nami was with arlongs crew this she hoped would explain things to them so they could then leave 139 luffy however refused to listen to

the majority of arlongs fishmen were all completely knocked out 146 while the attack was able to take out most of the fishmen it left luffy unable to move due to his feet being stuck in the ground as luffys crew attempted to protect him from the fishmens attacks arlong approached towards luffy arlong pulled up luffy while still stuck in the cement block and announced he was aware of the devil fruit weakness he threw luffy into the pool knowing that luffy would be unable to move in the water luffy immediately tried to stop arlong before the fishman could throw him in his efforts were in vain however and luffy was thrown into the water with the cement block encasing his feet by arlong 147unable to do anything but hold his breath luffy sank to the bottom of the pool as the rest of his crew were forced to deal with their fishman opponents fortunately however genzo and nojiko decided to dive in after luffy in order to rescue him 148 initially they could not do anything to help luffy because of the cement block however through quick thinking they were able to at least keep luffy from drowning by pulling his head up to the surface this way they could get the water out of luffys system as they figured out a way to free him from the block 149 after several incidental events with luffys crew 150 151 152 sanji then dove into the water 153 and broke the block encasing luffys feet with his feet freed luffys neck snapped back to normal and his body was catapulted into the air with himself saved luffy immediately saved zoro from arlong and began pummeling the fishman with several of his attacks arlong however merely got back up from the attacks and the battle between luffy and arlong began 154arlong as he attacked explained to luffy that humans are completely inferior to fishmen due to what they are incapable of doing luffy however countered by stating that he himself is incapable of doing certain things but he has friends who he can depend on for such problems as the argument continued luffy was able to smash arlong in the face and broke the fishmans teeth arlong however rectified the situation by pulling out his broken set of teeth and growing a new one the fishman then pulled out two sets of his teeth and attacked luffy with them luffy managed to grab a nearby fishman and use him as a shield as luffy witnessed this he came up with a good idea 155 the next moment that luffy got an opportunity he kicked a set of teeth out of arlongs mouth and began fighting with them in his mouth like arlong while luffy then got a good shot and bit arlong with his own teeth the attack however did not do much damage and arlong countered instead by biting luffys arm fortunately however luffy slammed arlong onto the ground before he could do any real damage 156as luffy stood up to recover from that last attack from arlong he noticed that arlong had dove into the pool nearby luffy then found himself dodging arlongs high speed attacks using his nose like a spear after several attacks the fishman dove back to the water to repeat his barrage of attacks on luffy 157 luffy however countered arlongs attacks by catching him with his hands positioned like a net and kicked the fishman in the chest onto the ground this attack however angered the fishman and arlong began to attack luffy more viciously with kiribachi a massive sword with a saw for a blade arlong then chased luffy up across arlong tower the two then ended up in the highest room of the tower the room where nami was forced to draw maps for arlong 158luffy wrecks the cartography room where arlong had used nami in within the room luffy was then explained by arlong what the room was used for and how nami had been used for the last eight years to fulfill the fishmans desires luffy remained relatively calm until arlong said that luffy could not use nami like he could which enraged luffy with this luffy broke arlongs kiribachi 159 and started wrecking the room arlong angered by this grabbed luffy and bit him luffy however then countered by breaking arlongs nose stating that he did not care if the fishmen are so great or about charts but that he now knew how to help nami luffy then said that she hated being in the room and he was gonna destroy it for her although arlong lunged at luffy with a spinning bite attack and bit deep into luffy he managed to swing his outstretched leg down and send him straight to the bottom of the tower through several floors of concrete with that luffy had defeated arlong that last attack however broke the stability of the entire tower and the whole thing collapsed with luffy still inside it 160with arlong and his gang defeated and arlong park completely destroyed luffy rose from the wreckage and proclaimed nami his friend before they could celebrate for long the marine captain nezumi decided to take everything that arlong had stolen although the marine was beaten up and sent packing away with his men he took out his vengeance by reporting luffy in to his higher ups 161after the whole commotion at arlong park luffy was sent to dr nako to heal his wounds along with the others who were injured as luffy watched the doctor restitch zoros wounds the doctor gave luffy the idea that his crew should have a doctor 162 for the next several days luffy and his crew then celebrated alongside the people of commi island over being finally freed from arlong as luffy was looking for some more meat to eat in the party he came across genzo at bellmères grave there luffy promised to genzo that he would take care of nami and not hurt her feelings 163after all the partying luffy and crew were ready to set sail once again they thus bid their farewell to the villagers of cocoyasi village as well as johnny and yosaku nami came running

going merry fortunately luffy was able to grab the whales tooth and jump on to its back before it could swallow him along with his ship and his crew as luffy desperately tried to persuade the whale to spit out his ship and his crew while on its back luffy found a hatch on the whales back leading into the very whale itself 179unable to do anything else from the outside luffy entered the whale from the hatch while inside the whale luffy accidentally bumped into two strangely dressed characters and into the whales stomach as the whale began thrashing at the red line from the outside within the

ramming the mountain itself in a futile attempt to reunite with them seeing laboons loyalty luffy decided to ease the lonely whales pain by ramming the going merrys mast into an open wound having caught the whales attention luffy and the whale began to battle in the middle of it however luffy told laboon that theyd have to put on hold since hes planning to circle the grand line with this statement luffy touched laboons feelings and the whale in response agreed having given hope once again to laboon luffy painted a crudely drawn painting of his jolly roger on laboons scars as symbol of their pact to meet once again 181after rekindling laboons hopes once again luffy and the rest of his crew suddenly realized that their compass does not work with that matter at hand luffy and the rest

one another that they completely ignored and defeated two other characters in same scene mr 5 and miss valentine who were apparently distracting them for some reason it was only however when nami stepped in and interrupted their fight that the two calmed down to listen to reason 185having been subdued luffy learned everything that happened while he was asleep he also learned that one of the

changed his hostilities towards them once he recognized vivi and offered them shelter for the night 219as the rest took up totos offer luffy however decided to help toto in his desperate search for water to restore the oasis of yuba though slightly incapable of digging and falling asleep midway in digging luffys efforts however helped toto dig up some water the next day as luffy and the others

explained to them his reasons he explained to them that even if they stopped the rebels crocodile will not be stopped to completely solve the matter luffy explained that crocodile himself must be defeated as luffy surprised everyone in his insight over the entire situation luffy told vivi that her desire to save everyone was naïve as people die this little statement started an argument between the two of them which escalated in small battle as vivi explained herself and told luffy that risking her life to save everyone was the only thing she could risk luffy asked her why she will not risk the straw hats lives as well since they were her friends having stated this luffy moved vivi to tears by his statement of trust and friendship seeing her in this state and seeing how she was the one who wanted crocodile to be beat up luffy asked her where they could find him 220meeting crocodile at rainbase edit having understood each other vivi tells luffy and his crew where to find crocodile

commotion was caused with luffy and his crew being chased all around by the marines regardless of the commotion however luffy and some of his crew managed to escape from the pursuing marines and headed into crocodiles casino rain dinners 221though luffy and his crewmates with him managed to get into the casino they however entered without vivi to help them identify what crocodile really

trap door by the casino having fallen for the trick luffy and the others including smoker found themselves trapped in a seastone cage as they were pondering their current predicament they were greeted by crocodile luffy his crew and smoker captured by crocodile having finally met the one who orchestrated the whole mess in alabasta luffy and the others with him were unable to do get at crocodile because of the cage they were in as the situation developed with vivi being brought before crocodile by miss all sunday and the powers of the devil fruit crocodile ate the suna suna no mi were revealed luffy and the rest learned of crocodiles awful master plan as he mockingly explained it before them as it went further luffy and the others found themselves being placed in a little game the shichibukai decided to challenge vivi in 222the shichibukai explained before luffy and the rest that due to events being carried out they needed to get to alubarna the capital of alabasta fast in order to stop the upcoming war however due to the situation luffy and those encaged with him vivi would have to get a key that crocodile presented and threw into a pit where it was eaten by a bananawani explaining further that he deciding to self destruct the room they were in crocodile presented before vivi in front of luffy and the rest the choice between getting to alubarna in time or saving luffy and those with him before the room completely floods as crocodile was explaining this challenge to vivi luffy overheard toto being mentioned by the shichibukai and soon learned that it was crocodile that was causing the sandstorms that plagued yuba angered by crocodiles cruelty luffy urged vivi to get the key so that he and the rest can beat crocodile despite luffys encouragement a single bananawani proved too much for vivi as it and the rest of group entered the slowly flooding room though all seems lost amidst the ensuing chaos luffy and everyone heard a den den mushi ring recognizing sanjis voice calling from the den den mushi luffy and the others realized that there was still hope as sanji and chopper werent captured as events unfolded with this new development luffy and the rest found themselves depending on vivi finding someone from the outside to get them out in an attempt to free themselves luffy and the others tried to coax one of the bananawani into biting open the cage though their attempt at breaking the cage through this failed their hopes were however revived as sanji finally showed up at the scene with him the key that crocodile was found alongside a familiar foe mr 3 though the baroque works agent that came out of the bananawani threw the key luffy and the others with him were however still able to escape the cage via mr 3s wax powers escaping just in the nick of time luffy and the others were able to get out as the room flooded and they escaped luffy told zoro to grab smoker along with them 223having saved the marine luffy and his companions were allowed to go free to get alubarna as they were thinking of a way to get to alubarna fast they were greeted by chopper who brought scissors a giant crab friend of eyelashes whom they can ride on however just as they were getting aboard vivi was literally hooked by crocodile fortunately luffy freed her just in time as she was taken away with vivi safe luffy told his crew to go on as he faced off the shichibukai by himself as luffy prepared to face crocodile he was told that the shichibukai would humor him for three minutes after that crocodile would leave for alubarna to complete his scheme with the time limit in mind luffy fought ferociously against his opponent though he attacked the best he could it was however apparent that no matter how much luffy attacked he could not damage crocodile as they continued to fight one another luffys arm was dehydrated by crocodile using the water given by toto however luffy was able to restore himself remembering the old man luffy declares that no matter how much crocodile attacks yuba with sandstorms it will never be destroyed as luffy declared this his three minutes were up 224as the three minutes ended luffy witnessed crocodile decide to do something horrible spurred on by luffy crocodile created a massive sandstorm and sent it towards yuba seeing this new development luffy desperately tried to stop crocodile unfortunately in midst of all this luffy was impaled by the shichibukai and left for dead in the sand despite being heavily wounded and buried in the sand however luffy still struggled with the will to fight as he struggled in a surprise turn of events luffy was suddenly pulled out by miss all sunday having been pulled out from his sandy grave luffy was left in the care of pell the hero of

himself up the walls to face crocodile again 226luffy dehydrated and defeated by crocodile once again at the palace during his previous fight luffy noticed that water made crocodile unable to turn into sand as he and the water barrel that toto gave were pierced by crocodiles hook realizing this he brought a huge barrel of water to aid him in his rematch against the shichibukai as luffy thus fought crocodile again he soon realized that his barrel of water could easily be jeopardized figuring this out luffy decided to switch tactics by drinking all of his water and storing it within himself essentially become what he dubbed mizu luffy while this new tactic infuriated his opponent it however proved effective for luffy though luffy was aided greatly by water this time around the fight however just made his opponent really mad having landed some good hits on crocodile and angering the shichibukai as well luffy had incurred the shichibukai to use his most powerful technique though luffy was able to evade crocodiles devastating powers of erosion he unfortunately got caught by his opponent as crocodiles hand held luffy he was severely dehydrated and was once again left for dead fortunately however some water bubbles that luffy misfired earlier revived him from his near death state rejuvenated once again luffy set off in search of his foe learning from tashigi while on

giant snake appears interrupted their fight and eats luffy in the snakes stomach luffy sees mountains of gold and ruins but cannot seem to find his way out under the assumption that hes in a cave later gan fall his horse pierre nami and aisa joined luffy inside the snakes stomach nami finds out from luffy that his attacks within the snake are responsible for the its erratic behavior and comically beats him up in anger after enel blasts the surface that the snake zoro and wiper were on the three fell towards the hidden ruins of shandora gan fall and nami managed to escape the snake but accidentally left luffy aisa and pierre behind with the snake remembering the city from long ago from which she came and gave a triumphant roar enel silences it with a thunderbolt powerful enough to knock it unconscious later that day luffy aisa and pierre managed to escape the unconscious snake but at the moment they escaped they noticed the destruction that enel has caused after a barely conscious robin explains the situation and enels intentions to eradicate skypiea aisa explains to luffy that she can use her mantra to lead him to enel following aisas direction luffy decided to stop enel facing off against a god edit luffy vs enel luffy finally reaches enel and challenges him as luffy charges enel fires electrical attacks at him only to find that they have no effect on a rubber luffy not only that but luffy can neutralize the invulnerability from his logia fruit power after this unexpected turn of event enel switches to a different mode of attack by reforming his staff into a trident and using his mantra to predict luffys moves luffys hand is stuck inside the golden ball enel created while luffy and enel duel continues the maxim starts to rise and enel activates maxims secret function deathpeia to produce thunderclouds into the atmosphere allowing him to attack the island from an islandscale range luffy manages to hit enel a few more times despite his mantra hence enel decides to incapacitate the rubber boy by attaching a large ball of gold to his arm instead of defeating him he then can get rid of luffy by knocking him off the ship back onto upper yard with the help of aisa luffy tries to get the golden ball off him as the two try to give chase to enel and his rising ship maxim luffy manages to recover in the ruins of shandora and along with aisa and pierre runs towards the beanstalk with the golden ball still attached to his arm seeing robin made it with the others on giant jack luffy tosses aisa and pierre onto them to look after the two as he chases enel luffy makes it to the top of the beanstalk and grabs onto the maxim only for enel to kick him off and destroy the top of the beanstalk before using the thunderclouds to form a giant sphere with his power called raigou to annihilate another sky island luffy is eventually met by nami who tried to convince him to leave but he replies that he has to ring the bell so montblanc cricket and everyone else will know that the city of gold is in the sky using the wavers full power nami and luffy blast up the plant and are sent flying towards enel however luffy pushes nami onto a cloud and makes a detour into enels raigou  luffy defeating enel and ringing the golden bell luffy swings the gold ball around with gomu gomu no hanabi ougan botan to draw the electricity from the raigou into him and eventually destabilizes it clearing the sky despite enel unleashing his full power luffy manages to kick him only falling back when the weight of the golden ball allows enel to pierce him with the tridents luffy jumps back using the cloud nami was on and fire gomu gomu no ougan rifle at enel with such such speed that he cannot dodge it and sends him crashing into the shandorian golden belfry bell sending a ring that could be heard everywhere thus ending the war between skypieans and shandia and informing cricket that the bell was always in the sky in jaya luffys shadow in the sky is seen by cricket masira and shoujou which let them conclude that the city of gold is in the sky after enels defeat luffy his crew and the rest of the inhabitants of skypiea had an enormous party at

sails or crew luffy and his crew reached the next island in their journey as luffy along with usopp and chopper decided to explore the island they noticed that the animals and plant life were all very long in appearance 241as luffy and his two companions explored the island more they encountered a nomad named tonjit who had been stuck on his stilts for 10 long years after getting acquainted with the old man and reuniting him with his horse shelly luffy and his companions felt that they had done small accomplishment however in the midst of their enjoyment shelly was suddenly shot learning immediately that the shot was fired by the pirate foxy who was nearby luffy momentarily get angry at this foe before luffy could fight foxy however he was suddenly challenged to an official davy back fight 242from usopp luffy learned that this sudden challenge was a set of three games between pirate crews in which the crew members were at stake despite usopps warnings however and much to the dismay of the rest of his crew luffy accepted the challenge from foxy and his crew to hold a davy back fight on long ring long land what happened next was a festivallike event set up by foxys pirates in lieu of the davy back games after the formalities of the beginning of the games luffy and his crew decided who would participate in which game taking the final and most climatic game combat luffy awaited for his turn as he watched the rest of his crew participate in the other games the first two games of the davy back fight proved to be both surprising and emotional for luffy and his crew in the first game donut race they witnessed foxy and his crews cheating tricks and foxys exploit of his devil fruit powers of the noro noro no mi due to these luffy lost chopper to foxy fortunately luffy was able to win chopper back as his crew won the second game groggy ring despite the gigantic odds stacked against them after watching these two grueling games luffy was pumped up for his turn in the final game luffy defeats foxy with the third game approaching luffy with the help from usopp decided to dress appropriately for the match donning an afro and boxing outfit luffy was ready to face against the sly foxy aboard his ship the sexy foxy throughout the whole match luffy was constantly tricked by his smarter opponent as they battled all around the ship with foxys tricks and devil fruit powers it seemed like luffy would lose despite this luffy persevered to not lose one of his crew forever in the climax of the battle luffy was able to thwart foxy by using a mirror shard obtained from the battle to reflect foxys powers back to himself having slowed foxy down luffy delivered the final blow and won the game 243after a lot of rest luffy wakes up being told he indeed did win the fight foxy comes to congratulate luffy on how he fought in the match giving a handshake gesture then attempting to throw him overhead forgetting his arm is rubber as luffy won he gets to choose a crew member from the foxy pirates but instead choose their flag but as the sail is their flag luffy opts to redesign the flag then give it back luffys poorly drawn jolly roger is given to them officially ending the davy back fight although obviously grateful foxy vows revenge on luffy for losing the match the straw hats return to tonjit giving him the foxy pirates old flag as a sign of their defeat chopper uses it as a bandage for shelly the horse encounter with admiral aokiji edit luffy being frozen by admiral aokiji just as luffy and his crew were done with the dealing with the matter with foxy and his pirates they soon came across another one sleeping beside tonjits house was the admiral aokiji initially aokiji was nonhostile to luffy and his crew despite him being a marine and causing luffy some fear when he told him that he knew his grandfather aokiji even helped tonjit in finding a way to get back to the rest of the old mans nomad clan with his hie hie no mi however when hostilities began between aokiji and nico robin luffy and his crew faced off against this new foe despite their best efforts luffy and those who fought alongside him against aokiji were utterly

broken keel as the keel is the most vital part of the ship they cannot fix it luffy refuses to believe that merry was truly irreparable but iceburg coldly states with that sort of stubbornness he might as well sink with it he also tell them to return once theyve decided on getting a new ship and with the 300000000 they have they easily buy the best they have to offer as a scheming government

using his new dials usopp manage to hit luffy but it wasnt enough to stun him for too long and the captain finished usopp off with gomu gomu no bullet ending the duel with luffy winning he told usopp he could not have won anyway however out of pity and respect to their former friendship he tells usopp that he can have the going merry and orders everyone out by the following morning as they take

just as aqua laguna about to hit the two along with chopper and zoro just barely avoid getting caught in the first wave though the second nearly catches them 246 luckily they are rescued by paulie and pulled to higher ground after recovering from nearly being drowned luffy asks for a boat to chase after robin but kokoro tells him its impossible due to the aqua laguna storm however seeing that he is determined to rescue robin no matter what she leads him to a hidden area where a second prototype sea train is kept iceburg is already there having anticipated what luffy was going to do and readied the train for departure luffy stocks up on provisions before heading out but is confronted by the franky family who beg luffy to take them along as their leader franky was captured by the cp9 as well luffy agrees to let them come before boarding the sea train with the remaining straw hats and kokoro and setting off as they leave the franky family hook their ship up to the train just as it about to

at one point they come upon a wave that threatens to derail the train luffy and zoro combine their attacks together to blow a hole through it to allow safe passage for everyone later on they come across a detached compartment from puffing tom the first train which was due to the actions of franky sanji and usopp going by his sogeking persona luffy slingshots himself onto it and checks to see if his friends are inside but finding only government agents jumps back on board the rocketman as zoro cuts the compartment in half to allow the train to continue soon the group pick up sanji and usopp after their failed attempt to rescue robin and franky luffy assures sanji they will rescue her he gushes after he meets sogeking not realizing who he really is everyone save for chopper realize though after which enies lobby is in sight and the last ditch rescue of robin begins enies lobby arc edit arrival and takedown edit as they were approaching enies lobby luffy before hearing any plans the others can come up with rushes on ahead straight into enies lobby climbing through with his gomu gomu abilities and begins a rampage across the island taking out any marines and government agents in his path indeed in the 10 minute headstart luffy gave himself he was able to defeat up to 500 world government and marine personnel before reaching the courthouse of justice causing a crisis on the island all by himself even without his crew let alone the alliance forged by them luffy was soon confronted by blueno of cp9 on the courthouse of justice who explained that luffys presence on the island has already caused an incident on a global scale and that the invasion meant he has offended the world government itself and the retribution will likely be severe blueno continues that their last encounter demonstrated that he was no match for a user of rokushiki himself and the rest of cp9  luffy fighting blueno however luffy rebuffs this statement saying that this time will be different it seemed from his initial attack that luffy wasnt just bluffing unlike the battle on water 7 however luffy is a completely different fighter he is able to keep up and avoid most of bluenos rankyaku attacks and even manage to break through his tekkai defense luffy states he does not care about the world government and simply wants robin back after a pause during the battle luffy reveals he is thankful for meeting the cp9 as he now learnt a few new techniques to keep his crew safe he then reveals the new technique which he calls gear second an ability which is noted by the steam coming off luffys body and radically increases his power and his speed this shows when not only is luffy fast enough to keep up even with bluenos soru but is more than strong enough to easily break through his tekkai blueno is eventually overwhelmed by luffys new power leaving luffy free to call out to robin these turn of events force the other cp9 members to come out and confront him the straw hat captain is soon joined by his fellow crew and the group prepare to face off against the rest of cp9 luffy and lucci clash it is here the dramatic confrontation takes place and they learn of robins true

after defeating the other members of cp9 and successfully releasing robin luffy was the only one remaining to have yet defeated his opponent rob lucci luffy begins his fight with lucci and seemed to be on equal terms with him but was still no match for his great strength and his rokushiki techniques later franky shows up and helps luffy fight lucci but luffy urges franky to forget about him and save robin when franky was about to leave he gets cornered by lucci but luffy goes into gear second and strikes lucci with a gomu gomu no jet pistol lucci then goes into his leopard form and fights

gigant axe he misses and he instead crushes the ship below him lucci lands on the mast and luffy uses gomu gomu no gigant whip to hit him he misses and lucci then goes into his second leopard form and bites luffy on the shoulder but luffy forces him to get away from him by using bone balloon lucci hits him with a tobu shigan and surprises luffy by going behind him he now understands that luffys speed has decreased tremendously lucci strikes luffy on the ground and uses rankyaku gaicho to kill luffy but luffy barely dodges and goes in his chibi form due to the side effects of gear third lucci was about to finish off luffy but due to the considerable damage given to him by luffys gigant pistol he couldnt do so allowing luffy to revert back to his normal form luffy ready to resume his long battle with lucci enters gear second luffy struck by sai dai rin rokuogan luffy and luccis battle continues with luffy having the advantage over rob lucci using the techniques gomu gomu no jet pistol jet bullet and twin jet pistol and his brute strength lucci now taking luffy seriously uses rokushikis secret technique called rokushiki ogi rokuogan luffy is hit hard by the power of its attack but he still mangages to stand up luffys speed soon starts to decrease and lucci lands another rokuogan on luffy luffy falls to the ground still in gear second and conscious but defeated later usopp shows up and tells luffy that he needs to get back on his feet he also tells him that enies lobby isnt hell luffy still in pain by the rokuogan stands on his feet and tells lucci that until he defeats him

along in order to have him guide them to the rest of their friends as luffy left the room the zombies told him to be scared of moriahs wrath for what luffy and his friends did in the dining hall luffy in response merely replied that he will kick moriahs ass after walking awhile with buhichuck as their hostage luffy robin and franky suddenly noticed that zoro was missing too 257 the situation was beginning to become suspicious later luffy found a suit of armor and decided to don it after a while the three came upon an arena like area there luffy and robin witnessed a bout between franky and a general zombie after witnessing it for while luffys group were suddenly trapped in the room by buhichuck there they were forced to fight a large group of general zombies 258 in the middle of the battle luffy found himself face to face with a general zombie with three swords like zoro before luffy could get a clear answer from jigoro he was caught off guard by some spider mice zombies luffy

this information luffy is even more decided to have the skeleton join their crew with this luffy and his crew decided to take back from moriah what he stole from them and their friends 261with the determination to get everything back before dawn arrives luffy and his crew split into two teams with part of his team headed to save nami and himself headed to defeat moriah luffys team purified several zombies with some salt from usopp as they rampaged through and purified moriahs zombie hoard luffy and sanji unfortunately got subdued by more of peronas ghosts fortunately however they were saved by the rest of the team before the zombies could get to them just as things were getting chaotic enough oars the zombie with luffys shadow came crashing into the part of the building luffys team was in and separated part of the building as well as part of luffys team with only robin and chopper left with him luffy and the two decided to continue towards moriah seeing that the others would not be beaten so easily 262 as the three continued onwards they were stopped in moriahs dance hall by hogback and cindry fortunately however robin and chopper were able to hold those two off long enough for luffy to slip pass them luffy meets gekko moriah and demands him to return all of the shadows he stole luffy finally reached moriah 263 and after a short conversation started attacking the shichibukai however as soon as luffy threw a punch moriah used his own shadow doppelman to fight in his stead undeterred by this seemingly invincible being luffy was still able to land a hit on moriah himself by attacking the shichibukai from an indirect place 264 however despite using this tactic for some time luffy was still unable to land a direct clean hit on moriah this continued until oars came back to the freezer and started obeying moriahs orders fully once moriah gave oars the order to completely annihilate all of the straw hats the zombie began to attack luffy luffy dodged the blow and started to chase after moriah who had decided to run away from the chaos that was about to ensue 265as luffy chased after moriah he was led deep within the forest of thriller bark however as luffy was chasing moriah the shichibukai tricked luffy into chasing doppelman upon realizing what happened luffy was left stranded in the middle of forest seeing that dawn was fast approaching luffy immediately tried to find his way back to the mast mansion 266 however while running around lost in forest luffy encountered the group that the old man spoil was head of the thriller bark victims association with some convincing by members of the association the risky bros of the rolling pirates luffy was told that they knew a way to beat moriah 267through some explanations by the risky brothers captain lola luffy was told of the process of using captured shadows to power oneself up for ten minutes luffy was implanted with one hundred shadows that the thriller bark victims association had collected over the years and became a vastly larger blue being that was dubbed  nightmare luffy  with his newfound strength and skills bestowed by the shadows luffy rushed off to mast mansion where oars and moriah were battling against his crew and brook 268nightmare luffy saves nami and usopp from oars and joins the fight arriving just in the nick of time to save both nami and usopp from oars luffy immediately started battling against the zombie he easily overpowered him with his devastating attacks wounding moriah as a result as well with the execution of his final move gomu gomu no storm luffys ten minute limit was up however luffy had inflicted so much damage onto oars that the behemoth completely toppled over onto the mast mansion 269though luffy was exhausted by having so many shadows implanted within him the battle was still not over for oars rose back up to continue battling on despite their wounds luffy his crew and brook rose back up as well and started one last combined attack against the zombie while the rest of his crew began to restrict oars movements luffy was brought to top of thriller bark with help from brooks high jumps and robins ability at the top luffy was then thrown down towards a restricted oars as luffy fell he activated gear third and landed a crippling blow to oars shattering the zombies spine and rendering him incapable of moving anymore 270luffy using gomu gomu no gigant jet shell to defeat moriah despite luffys strong will within him oars was no longer able to move however while oars was indeed finally defeated luffy and the other shadowless victims still had to get moriah to return all of their shadows before the rising dawn incinerated them unfortunately despite receiving the blunt of luffys attack gekko moriah managed to rise back up again and instead of giving back their shadows the shichibukai replied with his horrifying technique shadows asgard despite moriahs transformation into a giant monstrosity time getting dangerously over before dawn and all the fatigue and wounds from earlier however luffy readied himself to fight moriah one last time as luffy battled against moriah to the limit with gear second techniques that made moriah spew out some shadows dawn was quickly approaching eventually with time practically almost over luffy decided to stack his gear transformations on top of one another in order to perform a reckless move gomu gomu no gigant jet shell to use against moriah as luffy attacked moriah with this move and just as the first signs of dawn started to incinerate both luffy and the others luffy asked his own shadow to come back to him if it wanted to become pirate king then with one last use of gomu gomu no gigant jet shell luffy was able to topple down moriah unable to hold his stolen shadows any longer with this luffys shadow and all of the other shadows of those on thriller bark returned to their original just in time to save them 271just escaping the tyrants clutches and finally getting a musician edit kuma takes luffys pain with everyones shadows finally returned and moriah finally defeated luffy collapsed from all the fatigue and pain he experienced from the night beforehand while things seemed finally over the celebration was however cut short with the arrival of bartholomew kuma in the scene the second shichibukai having seen and reported the whole event to the world government was ordered to take out luffy as well eliminate everyone else on the island who witnessed luffys victory over moriah a battle for an unconscious luffy thus then ensued between the second shichibukai and everyone else left standing willing to protect luffy in the end zoro asked if he could exchange his life for luffys impressed by zoros loyalty kuma pushed all of the pain from the battle from luffys body with his ability and implanted it into zoro to make him feel luffys pain 272during the victory celebration luffy asks brook once again to join his crew after kuma left and a day of rest went by an energetic luffy decided to celebrate their victory with everyone as party went on luffy noticed brook playing a familiar song on a piano remembering that this was a song that shanks and his crew used to sing all the time luffy got into a conversation with brook as brook played and the conversation went on luffy once again asked brook to join his crew brook once again turned down luffys offer since the skeleton had still some things to do knowing what he was talking about luffy revealed to brook that not only did he learn about the skeletons relationship with laboon but also told him that laboon was alive and well having told brook this luffy touched brooks heart and made the skeleton burst into tears of joy as the party got more joyous with brook bringing out a tone dial with the last musical performance of the rumbar pirates on it luffy was asked by brook if he could join his crew for this luffy casually agreed much to the shock to most of his crew the straw hat crew as they cheer on their ship for their new member brook with this very casual acceptance luffy finally got the musician he so longed for since his journey as a pirate began after two days of recuperation luffy and his crew decided to leave thriller bark for fishman island as they were about to leave they were introduced to the concept of the vivre card by lola remembering the piece of paper that ace gave to him luffy took out the vivre card that his brother gave to him upon taking it out however luffy noticed that aces vivre card was burning a little and becoming smaller

powers luffy lands onto a jungle island remembering rayleighs vivre card luffy decides to follow it in hopes of reuniting with his crew after some unsuccessful trekking through the jungle luffy finds some mushrooms unfortunately one of the mushrooms was not edible as he laid unconscious three kuja amazons found him and took him to their village and while treating him their elder reveals the shocking truth luffy is what one would call a man 292after several misunderstandings luffy finds himself being chased by the amazons as he ran all over the place he learned that one of the amazons that saved him marguerite had taken rayleighs vivre card while fixing his clothes due to the situation luffy took marguerite and jumped over the mountain walls surrounding the village into the jungle there luffy was able to talk things out and learned that the island he was on amazon lily was ruled by the pirate empress boa hancock and her two sisters luffy sees hancocks back still pursued by the others amazons luffy figures from marguerites explanation about the kuja having no other boats than the one used by hancock he would need to ask her help in getting off the island in his search for hancock luffy accidentally crash lands into the middle of her bath upon her back he saw something that looked familiar 293having seen hancocks secret luffy is captured and sentenced to be executed in the battle arena before hancock and the rest of the kuja marguerite and the two other amazons that originally saved him desperately try to reason with hancock to spare his life instead however the three are turned to stone by hancock insulting the empress with his impudence and his resistance to her charms hancocks sisters boa sandersonia and boa marigold were sent to deal with luffy 294luffy faces off against marigold and sandersonia in their humansnake forms fighting against these two luffy finds that they are more than just simple devil fruit users as they displayed techniques that seemingly nullified his own rubber body among other things as the fight rages on the two sisters decide to torment luffy by breaking marguerites petrified stone body angered by this luffy shouts with all his might for them to stop releasing unconsciously a power that not only stunned both the sisters but also knocked out several of the amazons in the audience in a manner similar to rayleigh the kuja warriors identify that power as haōshoku haki the ability of the chosen that appears only to one person from a million having saved marguerites body for the moment luffy decided to take it up at notch and enters gear second luffy defeats the gorgon sisters with gomu gomu no jet gatling gun powered up luffy is able to best the two sisters in the midst of the battle however luffy sees that sandersonia caught on fire from one of her sisters technique exposing her back knowing that what was on hancocks and her sisters was something that they did not want others to see luffy covers sandersonias back before the audience in the stands could see it with luffy showing his true character to hancock and her sisters the amazons in the audience are dismissed and luffy is approached by hancock herself as a thank for saving her sister boa hancock returns the three petrified amazons to normal and invites luffy to reexamine what was on her back seeing it more clearly luffy realized that despite looking like the mark on hatchans forehead it is something completely different with that realization elder nyon comes before luffy and hancock and reveals to hancock luffys actions against the celestial dragon in sabaody archipelago having been told of his actions hancock promptly reveals to luffy her and her sisters past the meaning of the mark on their backs and why it resembled the mark on hatchan and other fishman moving hancock with his actions and his hate for the celestial dragons luffy is promised her ship to use 295luffy makes the tough decision of putting his brothers life before reuniting with his crew having been promised with a ship to travel on luffy enjoys a party courtesy of the amazons despite all the festivities he learns from elder nyon that ace is soon to be publicly executed finding this out and seeing the almost burnt out state of aces vivre card luffy decides to put reuniting with his crew on hold to save his brother who was then being held at impel down and desperately asked nyon for a way to get there 296with this he learns that the fastest way to the great prison was to sail there using a marine battleship through the current beyond the gates of justice finding out also that his only way to use such a ship was to stow away with hancock if she answers the shichibukai summons to protect marineford he and nyon seek her out to ask her of such a favor before luffy could ask hancock of such a thing he learns that she had contracted an unknown disease despite her condition luffy is still approached by hancock to hear his pleas telling her his case hancock surprisingly agrees to help luffy in his endeavor though this delights luffy unknown to him was that hancocks disease was something called love sickness and hancock having been moved by luffys selfless brave and kind nature has fallen madly in love with him after some fond farewells with his new friends from the island luffy secretly boards vice admiral momongas ship with hancock and her snake and sails for impel down 297impel down arc edit on the loose in the world governments greatest prison edit as boa hancock and monkey d luffy came on board of the marine ship marigold and sandersonia are left in charge of the island in hancocks absence hancock requests she is taken to impel down to the vice admiral and at his wishes she reverts the petrification placed on the marine sailors during their first meeting luffy is shown to be stowing away on the marine ship by hiding under the large robe hancock is wearing 298on the ship hancock makes seemingly outrageous demands to the marines such as 100kg of food a meal for five meals a day when the food is taken in to the room shes staying in it is shown it is simply needed to feed luffy hancock also forbids anyone from peeking into her room lest they find luffy luffy is later shown looking at whats left of aces vivre card as he gets ever closer to impel down 299when luffy arrives at impel down he hides under hancocks robe once more however hancock warns him that she will be searched 300before hancock receives a fullbody check by the vice jail head domino hancock immediately petrifies her and the vigilant denden mushi luffy comes out but hancock explains that she cannot accompany him further into the prison she begs him to promise not to make a ruckus inside impel down luffy complies then climbs up to the ceiling and prepares to leave after the room is opened by impel downs vicechief hannyabal while hancock leaves with momonga to marineford luffy navigates his way through impel down by following aces vivre card and going through any open doors after he enters level 1 of the prison luffy encounters an old pal fighting against the blugori guardians buggy is shocked when he realizes that luffy entered impel down on his own accord they then decide to team up in order to defeat their common enemies 301luffy and buggy teaming up together luffy manages to defeat all of the guards in an instant much to buggys surprise as his special combo did not even faze them after hearing luffy wants to go to level 5 where ace is kept buggy initially decides to leave him and escape until hearing luffy tell him about the battleships outside instead choosing to stay buggy suddenly spots the arm band that luffy is wearing and immediately identified it as the map to captain johns treasure although luffy insists he goes to level 5 buggy states he has to go down each level which houses more dangerous criminals the lower they go buggy explains that he himself has only reached level 4 he makes a deal with luffy he will escort him to level 4 of impel down but in return luffy has to give him the treasure without hesitation luffy agrees and even decides to give him the arm band in advance for helping him buggy feels guilty for lying to luffy but nonetheless decides to escape from luffy but crashes into the prisoners room and towards the crimson hell luffy grabs hold onto buggy as they fall luffy throws buggys feet into the ground as told and they fly towards a giant hole buggy explains that the hole leads to level 2 luffy immediately jumps down and heads towards level 2 302upon reaching level 2 luffy and buggy who fell into the hole as well are chased by a giant monster chicken called a basilisk finally luffy gets fed up and activates gear third to defeat the basilisk and the other guards chasing them buggy decides to release the prisoners to start a riot inside and told luffy that he lied about knowing where the other floors are to make an escape angering luffy then luffy finds out that one of the prisoners released is mr 3 303 luffy buggy and mr 3 are defeating and been chased by the bizarre wild beasts of level 2 before confronting the sphinx buggy and mr 3 knowing that theres a staircase plan to ditch luffy as he goes down level 3 while they go up to escape however while trying to smash the wax statues made by mr 3 in order to escape it the sphinx makes the floor collapse sending itself and the trio down to level 3 304after falling to level 3 luffy is told by buggy that they are in the starvation hell with the sphinx knocked out luffy wants to head to level 4 but he and buggy who wants to get out of impel down argue about where to go before they can separate though a net made of steel reinforced with seastone captures luffy buggy and mr 3 the guard and commander of the blugori saldeath walks up and claims theres no escape however the sphinx wakes up and breaks the net luffy looks up to see buggy and mr 3 climbed to the rafters as they tell him that they are betraying him luffy however merely thanks them for taking him so far luffy then begins to beat up several blugori and guards in his way as he heads to level 4 305 as luffy continues to head on the sphinx is still chasing him but a man in a prison outfit looking like zoro kicks the sphinx off luffy it turns out to be mr 2 after a happy reunion they team up to go further down as there is someone bon kurei would like to see as well luffy teams up with mr 2 bon kurei to rescue someone in the lower levels after defeating the army of blugori mr 2 and luffy meet a minotaur the jailer beast minotaur gives two a good fight almost killing mr 2 they then climb up a wall and are literally standing above level 4 bon kurei warns luffy that level 4 is the blazing hell and on the lower parts of the floor is a vat of boiling blood and blazing fire luffy uses gomu gomu no jet bazooka to defeat minotaur however they meet up with mr 3 and buggy who are being chased by the same jailer beast which was sent flying the four decide to team up together in order to beat him successful the four celebrate as they make their way to level 4 306 the four of them fall through to level 4 because the floor collapsed beneath them thanks to their fight with the minotaur luckily the falling debris allowed them to jump off the boiling pot as soon as luffy smells food he runs towards the kitchen on level 4 while charging the guard on his way he notices a blob of poison as chief warden magellan leaps towards the group and confronts them 307 mr 2 bon kurei warns him that the man that is in front of them is chief warden magellan who has eaten the doku doku no mi and thus his entire body is poison magellan tells luffy he knows he broke into impel down to rescue portgas d ace and demands to know exactly how he did this a neardeath experience edit luffy sacrificing his arms to poison and attacking magellan with jet bazooka thinking of hancock luffy refuses to tell magellan anything unable to touch the chief warden without being deadly poisoned luffy tries to avoid the attacks as much as he can desperate and already half poisoned luffy sacrifices his hands with a gomu gomu no jet bazooka to magellan saving ace being more important than his safety 308 but the multiple poisons start to take effect weakening luffys senses ultimately he lies down defeated while magellan sentences him to death in level 5 the freezing hell 309luffy defeated by magellan he is later seen incarcerated in a level 5 cell where despite dying is still determined to rescue ace and is only living on despite the poison through sheer willpower fortunately he was later released by bon kurei who returned to help luffy and hopes to get rid of the poison slowly killing him by bringing him to iva the kingqueen of kamabakka kingdom with his body being dragged by bon the two wandered throughout level 5 but later encountered a pack of wolves intent on eating them bon managed to fight off a few but was later overwhelmed by their numbers to his surprise luffy suddenly got up and after biting off one of the wolves attacking bon lets out a surge of haki that repelled the wolves away he is shown afterward to have passed out along with bon kurei where they are approached by inazuma 310luffy and bon kurei are revealed to have been saved by the okama prisoners whove managed to create a small refuge in between levels 5 and 6 the former queen of kamabakka kingdom now king of new kama land on level 55 emporio ivankov took bon clay and luffy in after being impressed by luffys selflessness in begging himher to save bon clay when he was himself dying iva placed him in a locked room and chained him to a slab to help heal him however he warned luffy that the process will cost him ten years of his life if he does survive luffy decided to go through it anyway and iva injected some of his healing hormones into luffy to boost his immune system to counteract the poison giving luffy intense pain iva expected the healing to take two days in which he will surely miss aces execution bon clay decided to cheer luffy on for the duration of his struggle with the poison bon clays support through the hours along with iva and the natives of new kama land help luffy recover in only twenty hours much to ivas astonishment but just two hours before aces transport from impel down 311 after eating massive amounts of food luffy finally emerges from the room he thanks bon clay and iva for helping him heal and immediately tries to set out to save ace whose transport is minutes away however in an ensuing conversation with iva he reveals that dragon is his father much to ivas surprise iva being a former comrade of dragons realizes that both luffy and ace are dragons sons after injecting luffy with tension hormones acting as a temporary adrenaline rush iva sets out with luffy and inazuma to level six to save ace 312escape from the great prison edit luffy jinbe and crocodile rampaging their way through the levels to freedom luffy does not make it in time and is cut off from level 1 due to the elevator shaft being flooded with sleeping gas he is then recommended by iva to let aces safety be in the hands of whitebeard assuring the boy that the yonko will not let any harm befall his 2nd dividsion commander but never one to be deterred luffy then resolves to go to marineford to rescue ace despite ivas protests crocodile becomes interested and offers to help luffy escape after he is convinced by ivankov to free crocodile jinbe begs luffy to free him as well luffy is convinced despite inazumas objection and allows jinbe to join as well 313luffy along with jinbe and crocodile are heading up impel down and realize that they only have five hours before aces execution while passing through level 4 crocodile frees his former subordinate mr 1 having caught up with the new kama natives and mr 2 314 luffy and the army of prisoners continue to blast through the goalers sadi then appears with her jailer beasts with the three beasts brutalizing the army from new kama land luffy crocodile and jinbe decide to blast through all defeating the jailer beasts with a single blow 315sadichan uses her koufun no geki akamauchi attack on several prisoners and cuts the bridge in half as well luffy charges at her but is thrown by a now female ivankov as luffy makes his way towards the stairs he is stopped by a stubborn hannyabal who despite being severally injured by luffys attacks cannot in the name of justice permit a pirate to go further luffy attacks blackbeard using gomu gomu no jet pistol however hannyabals good words are instantly crushed down by an incoming blackbeard who has entered impel down when luffy recognizes blackbeard from jaya and discovers he was the one responsible of ace arrest he could not hold back anymore and attacks bleackbeard straight away the fight was stopped by jinbe who reminded him about the rescue of ace which should be his priority as luffy then made his way to level 2 magellan closes in on the prison escapees 316 317as they realized that magellan was following them luffy became worried about ivankov and inazuma who tried to stop magellan so the rest of them can escape however as soon as they united with the bunch of prisoners lead by buggy magellan confronted them again as magellan used his hydra on luffy and the other prisoners they were saved by mr 3s candle wall while luffy and mr 3 combine to slow down magellan 318 319 jinbe goes on ahead to secure a marine ship unfortunately magellan switches to a new poison called kinjite so corrosive that it even cancels out mr 3 wax power luffy and the other are forced to flee eventually the group make it to the entrance where bon clay and the others wait for jinbe crocodile mr 1 and buggy to procure a ship luffy and the prisoners finally escape on whale sharks that jinbe summoned however magellan is closing in fast on the bunch and with nowhere left to run the escapees are trapped iva suddenly comes crashing through the floor having used his face growth hormones jinbe then calls luffy informing him that theyve captured a ship but due to the distance will not make it in time before magellan reaches them instead jinbe tells luffy and the other to jump into the sea using iva wink and grabbing the gigant head everyone is propelled just in time away from magellan out into the sea just as theyre about to land whale sharks catch them and take the bunch to the captured marine ship 320luffy escaped impel down with the help of the whale sharks jinbe called out to and was on his way to marineford with the 241 other prisoners who had escaped with him when he realized that the gates of justice were still closed suddenly they opened for an unknown reason it turned out that bon clay had disguised himself as magellan using his devil fruit power and ordered the men in the communications room to open the gates by using magellans face realizing mr 2s sacrifice luffy and all of the prisoners all said a tearful goodbye marineford arc edit the fight rages without him edit luffy and the other impel down prisoners finally arrive at marineford after their escape their ship was contacted by a marine officer from marineford who informed them that they were trapped inside the tarai current and that luffy and buggy were considered the masterminds behind the jailbreak luffy defiantly proclaimed that he was going to rescue ace no matter what before hanging up 321when luffy arrived before the gates of justice he was excited that they had reached their destination so quickly while jinbe stated that they were a little late and was more concerned with how to open the doors later when whitebeards fleet arrived the gates of justice inexplicably opened on their own 322when ivankov asked luffy if dragon would come to save his other son luffy revealed that he knew that aces dad was gol d roger 323 tsunami waves were created and frozen by whitebeard and aokijis powers luffy tried to talk the others into pushing the boat down the frozen wave as the battle in marineford began luffy and the impel down escapees found themselves trapped atop one of the frozen waves so that it would slide down the back of the wave before they could though the den den mushi on board intercepted the order to ignore the schedule and execute ace prematurely panicking luffy told the others that they need to hurry ivankov performed hell wink in hopes of shoving the battleship off of the wave but instead of sliding down it was knocked forward flipping upside down and sending all of the inmates plummeting towards the sea through an act of pure fortune the battleship landed in one of the few spots of ocean that remained unfrozen although the impact split the boat in two luffy and the others on board fell into the ocean unharmed jinbe dove underwater to rescue luffy and the other fruit users tossing him onto the wreckage as luffy made his way out of the water he and ace spotted each other ace called out to luffy who happily responded that he was happy to see ace again 324before the two could talk any longer though crocodile decided to attack whitebeard luffy instantly activated gear second and intercepted the blow soaking his leg in water and knocking crocodile away crocodile reminded luffy that they had a deal to which luffy responded that because whitebeard was important to ace he would not let crocodile touch him luffys act caused marco to remark that he wasnt half bad as whitebeard observed luffy he recognized the straw hat as the one that shanks used to wear when he told luffy that he had seen the hat with red hair luffy said that shanks had let him borrow it luffy beside the great pirate whitebeard whitebeard told luffy that he had no chance in the battle apparently to deter him luffy snapped back at whitebeard saying that he would definitely save ace he even went so far as to challenge whitebeard outright to the title of pirate king stunning everyone within earshot amused by and in admiration of luffys tenacity whitebeard cracked a grin before telling luffy not to get in his way luffy snapped back again saying that he would do as he pleased 325objective save ace edit before charging into the battle luffy informs whitebeard that he had heard the marines plan to execute ace early as whitebeard thanks luffy for the information luffy bolts towards ace however kizaru attempts to stop him by launching a kick of light at him ivankov used his death wink to propel luffy out of the line of fire when luffy thanks him ivankov states that it is his duty to make sure luffy does not go and kill himself hina reappears to capture luffy transforming her arms into long iron fences luffy manages to jump out of the ring using gear second before it ensnares around hinas marine allies ace suddenly cries out to luffy to stay away berating his brother for getting involved with his own affairs he states that he would be too humiliated if a weakling like luffy were to rescue him but his true reason for wanting to keep luffy at bay was so that he would not drag his brother down with him luffy replies by shouting out that they are brothers and that he does not care about any rules about pirates as moriah sends zombies that he produced from the earth after luffy they are drowned and purified in a burst of seawater fired by jinbe hancock protecting luffy from smoker much to the shock of the marines as well as luffys and whitebeards subordinate crews sengoku reveals that luffys father is none other than the revolutionary dragon not even fazed by the fact that his lineage was revealed to everyone at marineford as well as the whole world due to the reporters watching luffy smashes his way through more of the marines with gear third including a giant claiming that he does not care if ace objected and that he would rescue ace even if it killed him he presses forward only to be attacked and subdued by commodore smoker however boa hancock intervenes on his behalf angrily threatening smoker for attacking luffy she then gives luffy the key to aces handcuffs to which he hugs her in gratitude he stops his advance when he sees ivankov fighting kuma as doflamingo explains that kuma has been fully converted into a cyborg making him little more than a killing machine ivankov keeps kuma busy and tells luffy to press forward luffy however then meets mihawk who is drawing his sword contemplating whether or not fate will keep luffy safe from his blade although mihawk stands before him luffy knows he has no time to fight mihawk and bursts past him with his superhuman speed however hawkeye peering through the crowd manages to point out luffy and swings his blade forward slashing luffy as well as all those between the two after sending luffy careening into a wall mihawk pursues after him attempting to impale him however two newkama soldiers get in the way of mihawk who brushes them aside with little effort luffy attempts to attack mihawk again but realizing that the shichibukai would slice his arm off halts his attack at the last moment instead choosing to run away mihawk comments that luffy was unusually composed as he slices horizontally at the rubber man although luffy dodges it the attack slices the remaining frozen wave in two causing the upper half to come crashing down on marineford luffy uses gomu gomu no jet migawari to dodge mihawks attack as luffy and mihawk continue their battle the latter notes on how luffy is moving away from the execution platform in a move of desperation luffy grabs onto buggy and uses him as a shield against mihawks attack although buggy is angry at luffy luffy continues to use him as a shield seeing as luffy is in trouble marco calls on 5th division commander vista to help him having finally gotten a break luffy dashes back towards the platform mihawk comments on how luffy has the strange ability to make anyone around him an ally an ability that is the most dangerous in the world 326kizaru kicks luffy at the speed of light as more battleships begin to appear from behind luffy recognizes the twenty pacifista on board as well as sentomaru as luffy keeps moving toward the platform kizaru attacks him and is sent flying fortunately jinbe catches him and luffy complains how strong kizaru was to which jinbe replied that no matter how strong their enemy seemed they expected that from the beginning then the squad captains who jinbe said were as strong as 100 men come to break through kizaru asking luffy if he lost all his strength and luffy said that they could handle it 327 luffy is seen looking in shock as whitebeard is stabbed 328luffy is later seen joining the charge to the execution platform after whitebeard finally entered the battle himself while he was charging he got hit by one of whitebeards attacks asking if whitebeard knew his friends from foes which jinbe just stated that his crew knew to stay back he attempted to make his way to the platform but the wall that formed around the bay interfered and he is currently trapped with the rest of the invading force of pirates as the admirals unleash their powers to destroy them 329luffy faces the three admirals luffy attempts to charge in through the gap in the wall made by little oars jr though is blasted back by cannon fire he then has jinbe launch him through a jet of water where he lands right in front of the execution platform with the three admirals standing before him all commenting on his boldness true to their comment luffy shows no sign of fear and yells that hes going to save ace and then tries to attack with a mast he had carried with him but it is frozen by aokiji but this was part of his plan and broke off his hold on the mast a splitsecond right before he himself gets frozen along he then uses gomu gomu no stamp gatling to shatter the frozen mast and sending the chunks of frozen debris at the three admirals who only passively used their respective powers to nullify the attack 330 luffy then activates gear second and attempts to speed past the three admirals but is quickly intercepted and kicked away by kizaru luffy expresses great shock and horror as ace is nearly executed but is then surprised by the fact that crocodile saved ace aokiji later appears before him and stabs him with an ice saber and says that while he owes a favour to garp luffy chose the path of death for himself and proceeds to kill him only to be kicked across the island by marco of the whitebeard pirates 331 luffy attempts to charge at the plaza again but this time vice admiral momonga intercepts him as he slashes him with his sword luffy tries to counterattack but momongas speed allows him to evade his attacks and attack him again as luffy activates gear second vice admiral dalmatian a zoan user in humandalmatian hybrid form attacks him with shigan with all his fingers critically injuring him followed by a light beam from kizaru who descends and tells him his willpower alone will not be enough to save him as he delivers a lightspeed kick to him and is caught by whitebeard leaving him unconscious kizaru derides whitebeard saying that it was a poor choice to have trash like luffy to lead the charge whitebeard seems to silently agree while luffy gains consciousness yells for him to let go of him whitebeard merely toss him to the side and says he has done his part and asks for a doctor to take care of him luffy gets up and says he does not want one and yells at whitebeards crew that ace is his only brother he has and has to save him however he succumbs to his injuries and collapses again whitebeard says guys like him are stubborn and are all talk but has spirit like luffy as he reenters battle a little later he asked emporio ivankov to give him more tension hormones by saying he would rather die fighting and that if he did nothing it would make him want to die anyway and after getting the tension hormones he gets up and screams as they run iva tells him that if he were to collapse he will not be returning to this world again 332luffy defeats coby with gomu gomu no bullet after his second wind he briefly faces off against coby whom he beats with a single punch to the face when sengoku orders that ace be executed luffy screams at the executioners to stop releasing a burst of haōushoku haki this knocks out a number of both the whitebeard pirates and the marines including jango aokiji whitebeard ace and especially sengoku are visibly stunned to learn that luffy had such an ability ivankov then comments on this recent development and luffy then replies to continue where he left off  and that is saving ace 333 as luffy continues running towards the platform to save ace everyone is still visibly stunned about the sudden surge of hidden power being released haoshoku haki luffy is still unaware of his power as ivankov notes luffy and ivankov pummel their way through the marines with several of the whitebeard pirates subordinate crews assisting in clearing the way he once again encounters mihawk who is stopped by daz bones who is in turn saved by crocodile from mihawks sword as luffy closes in on the platform inazuma appears and creates a way up to the platform for luffy to meet ace kizaru makes one ditch effort to stop him only to be halted by whitebeard garp allowing luffy to strike him in order to rescue ace luffy then encounters his grandfather monkey d garp whom he tells to move aside but garp tells luffy that as a vice admiral he cannot allow him to pass 334 as the bridge both of them are on begins to collapse due to garps sudden weight he tells luffy that hes been fighting pirates all his life and that if he wants to rescue ace he will have to kill him with grandfather and grandson thinking of their past together luffy refuses to do so garp states that luffy is now his enemy and prepares to attack luffy enters gear second and does the same at the moment of impact garp suddenly relents and lets luffy hit him falling off the makeshift bridge into the plaza much to the shock of the vice admirals and sengoku who is showing sympathy stating that garp could not shed his fatherly love against luffy with garp out of the way luffy reaches the platform and prepares to use the key hancock gave him sengoku suddenly reveals his devil fruit power transforming into a buddhalike figure that towers over him and ace luffy quickly goes to insert the key into aces cuff but a shot from kizaru cuts it in half just as all seems lost one of the guards reveals himself to mr 3 in disguise recovering from luffys haki sengoku prepares to execute all three of them prompting luffy to go to gear third while he tells mr 3 to protect ace with a candle wall luffy blocks sengokus punch with gomu gomu no gigant balloon luffy activates gear third and uses gomu gomu no gigant balloon as sengoku strikes barely blocking the attack and protecting ace and mr 3 however the impact still hurts luffy spitting up a mouthful of blood the attack destroys the scaffold they are on sending everyone plummeting off it mr 3 quickly make a new key asking luffy if he will laugh at him for doing it to avenge a fallen comrade referring to bon kurei luffy of course shouts he will not as mr 3 tosses him the key the vice admirals meanwhile aim at the falling trio and fire for a moment it looks like the shots have hit until a fire tunnel suddenly appears from the explosion ace scolds luffy for being reckless and overdoing things as he reveals luffy mr 3 and himself to be unscathed ace is now free of the seastone cuffs uncontrollable anguish luffy collapses edit luffy and ace battle against the marines ace and luffy now fight side by side enjoying being finally together luffy and ace are later seen reacting with stunned horror to whitebeards declaration that he is staying behind 335 luffy appears to be worn out and tries to get ace to leave along with the other whitebeard pirates as ace faces off against akainu who had called whitebeard a failure while chasing them luffys mind collapses from aces death akainu then provokes ace before attempting to strike luffy but he can only stare in shock as ace takes akainus blow through the chest to protect him 336 knowing that his end is near he thanks his family and friends for loving him although ace dies with a smile on his face luffy is overcome with tremendous pain and grief for the loss of his brother 337ivankov notes that luffy has become mentally broken and that his life is now in danger akainu taking advantage of the situation charges in and tries to finish luffy off as well but marco intercepts the attack marco tells jinbe to take luffy with him and swears that they will protect luffy as if he were ace 338 jinbe rushes to the whitebeard pirate ship to escape from marineford hounded by the admirals which are countered by whitebeard pirates and crocodile heavily wounded by akainu jinbe and luffy are somehow caught by buggy in midair when trafalgar law suddenly appears in a submarine of the heart pirates claiming he wants to save luffy 339 though reluctant at first buggy gladly turns over luffy and jinbe to law when kizaru starts attacking luffy and jinbe are brought inside but kizaru refuses to let law escape cobys speech about the needless death caused by the war followed by shanks unexpected arrival momentarily distracts him which law uses in an attempt to escape shanks picks up luffys straw hat and claims he is here to end the war he tells buggy to deliver the hat back to luffy not wanting to break their promise by meeting earlier than intended kizaru and aokiji try to stop the leaving submarine but despite their best efforts it manages to escape luffy is shown laying on a table with laws crew caring for him inside the sub postwar arc edit laws aid memories messages and a two year training edit luffy was next seen being treated for his injuries on laws submarine as he was being treated on laws submarine law ivankov boa hancock and jinbe commented on how much damage he had accumulated and jinbe worried about his reaction to all that had happened when he awakened 340luffy cries over the death of his brother ace after two weeks of recovering from his injuries luffy awakens in amazon lily and goes on a rampage blindly asking where ace is after remembering aces death little by little while still destroying the rocks and the trees in the forest he stops for a moment as jinbe tries to explain to him that the war is over and ace is dead luffy states he has realized that it wasnt a dream by pinching his cheek very hard and starts to finally cry and mourn over his loss while weeping he thinks back to when he first met ace after the flashback he begins to doubt his abilities and starts to think about how he could possibly become the pirate king if he is too weak 341 after that luffy has a little verbal and physical struggle against jinbe who told him not to regret his brothers death and that he has not lost everything yet luffy then remembers that he still has something priceless his crew and then declares that he wants to go to sabaody archipelago to meet his crewmates again 342soon after that he meets silvers rayleigh and learns about his and shakkys relationship with nyon boa hancock and her sisters luffy asks if any of his crew had returned to sabaody archipelago to which rayleigh replied that they probably had not after rayleigh explained how he learned luffy was on amazon lily rayleigh explains that if luffy went back to sabaody the same tragic events he suffered would occur again luffy then starts to listen to a proposition rayleigh has for him 343 although no word left from luffy and rayleigh the word about luffy being alive is being spread throughout the world however there is something lingering within the newspaper regarding actions of luffy 344the article about luffys return to marineford with a hidden message for his crew the  3d 2y tattoo on his right arm with the 3 and d crossed out the article revealed that luffy actually infiltrated marineford a second time accompanied by jinbe and rayleigh after they stole a marine ship they circled marineford once which according to lieutenant commander brannew is a custom for burials at sea luffy then went into the plaza alone and rang the ox bell sixteen times threw a bouquet of flowers into the rubble and then bowed his head in silent prayer leaving promptly after his goal from this was to send the message 3d2y to the other straw hats meaning that they would meet in sabaody archipelago not in three days but in two years luffy is later seen on the kuja pirates ship resting so he can recover from his injuries the other kuja pirates are all at his bedside watching him under hancocks orders while playing with his stretchy skin luffy then says that he hopes that his message reached his crewmates rayleigh then assured him that it would since it was highly unlike him jinbe eventually left the kuja ship while riding a whale shark after luffy and jinbe gave their thanks to each other and jinbe tells him that he will continue to aid luffy later on in the future and that he looks forward to meeting luffy and his crew 2 years from now luffy eventually arrives on rusukaina a deserted island northwest of amazon lily with the kuja and rayleigh where he will train with rayleigh alone rayleigh explains the three forms of haki while demonstrating them on a rampaging elephant the demonstration excites luffy and makes him eager to learn them luffy then puts his hat on a stone which is the only safe spot on the dangerous island with the vivre card while saying that he will take a vacation from being a pirate for sometime the story continues two years later references edit↑ one piece manga and anime — vol 1 chapter 1 p 5 and episode 4  luffy is first
