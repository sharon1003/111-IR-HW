here are 10 things every twentysomething woman and beyond should look for and work on in a relationship twenty20  burnningbridges1 maintain a relationship that’s built on mutual trust it’s important that he trusts you it’s important that he does not question you when you tell him where you were or what you were doing it’s important that he believes you when you tell him how you are feeling it’s important that when you tell him you love him he does not doubt you but it’s equally important for you to trust him it’s important for you to be with a guy who you know will be honest with you always and once you find him it’s important for you to never question to never let your insecurities get in the way of the mutual trust and respect that you’ve built with one another2 find someone who is proud of you for your accomplishments but loves you unconditionally whether or not you’re successful it’s a wonderful feeling – being with someone who encourages you and is proud and supportive of everything that you do you should feel like they will never be intimidated by the goals or ambitions that you have but more importantly you should be with someone who loves you unconditionally someone who loves you because of who you are not what you’ve done when you find someone who loves you because of who you are you avoid the terrible misunderstanding of thinking that you need to accomplish something in order to be loved being with someone who loves you for who you are provides a safety net for you to land in whenever you fail because you know without a doubt that they will love you for who you are and what you’re trying to do not what you’ve done3 understand that the two of you are going to differ in opinion on a lot of different things he needs to respect your opinion he needs to acknowledge that you have the right to believe whatever you want to believe but you also need to respect his opinion you need to embrace the fact that sometimes he will say things or think things that will baffle you this is part of being in a relationship if you agreed on everything you would be dating yourself and that would get boring really quickly as long as his opinion isn’t something that is completely against your moral or ethical values it can actually make for a very interesting although challenging relationship being with someone who thinks and believes differently than you can teach you things and bring you to realizations that you may have never come to otherwise4 be with a man who knows that sometimes the little things are just as important as the big ones birthday gifts and anniversary dinners and valentine’s day can be a lot of fun they’re relationship cliches and sometimes when you’ve found the right guy it can be fun to indulge in those cliches a little bit but what usually ends up being most memorable are the seemingly ordinary moments the ones that sort of sneak right into the relationship without you even noticing like when you wake up with a mean hangover and he’s there with some advil or when he goes to the grocery store with you just for fun just to keep you company they’re very small ordinary moments in time but those little moments are the ones when you fall in love5 remember that it’s okay to be a little bit bored sometimes falling in love is a whirlwind you’re dizzy and overthemoon and exhausted and exhilarated all at the same time but eventually after the falling part is over and you’re just in love it becomes more of a solid deeplyrooted contentedness that doesn’t mean it’s no longer exciting or exhilarating it just means that your relationship has become a much more stable deep and special part of your everyday life and sometimes the days blend together a little bit sometimes you become so comfortable with him that the butterflies become less of a foreign and overwhelming feeling and more of a steady and controlled existence running through your veins sometimes point blank you become a little bored and that’s okay you’re not bored with him you’re not bored with the relationship you’re just used to it you’ve grown accustomed to feeling loved and supported and taken care of – it is now just something that has become part of your everyday life expect to become a little bored sometimes but don’t let it scare you know that it will go away eventually as long as you remember how lucky you are and remember to never take for granted the happiness that you’ve found6 find someone that isn’t trying to change you yes he can inspire you he can make you want to be better he can bring out things within you that you never knew you had things you never knew you were capable of but at the same time it’s important to make sure he’s not trying to change you he may believe that you’re capable of a lot and he may therefore encourage you to keep trying and keep growing and keep pushing yourself and that’s okay – that’s wonderful just as long as he’s not trying to change your very nature the very essence of who you are be with someone who loves you and adores you and appreciates you just the way you are and be that very same person for him love him challenge him encourage him support him but don’t ever try to change him7 expect to feel safe when you reveal your vulnerabilities the fastest way to become close with someone and to form a bond with them that feels indestructible is to reveal to them all the different parts of yourself especially the parts that you don’t like it’s important to be with someone who makes you feel like you don’t have to hide anything like you don’t have to put forward your most appealing self there’s no freer feeling in love than the feeling of him knowing everything  everything about you being with someone and knowing that you don’t have anything to hide gives you a feeling of release that you’ll be hard pressed to find anywhere else8 know that he doesn’t have to necessarily share your passions as long as he supports them and understands them if he loves the same kinds of things that you love – fantastic you’re lucky but it’s much more likely that you’re going to be with a guy who doesn’t really feel the same way that you do about books or photography or house of cards or organic cooking or cross fit and that’s okay because most of the time that keeps things more interesting anyway he’s going to have a lot of hobbies or passions that you don’t really care for either it’s not necessary for either one of you to take up one another’s interests in order for your relationship to last what’s necessary is that you each acknowledge the things that are important to one another and appreciate them instead of trying to force one another to do things differently he doesn’t have to like hiking or typography as long as he learns to make room for it in your relationship because he knows that it brings you joy or fulfillment9 remember that indifference is worse than anger don’t be afraid to argue don’t be afraid to have fights don’t be afraid to disagree with each other as long as you’re communicating in an effective way where both of you are sharing how you feel and listening to how the other feels it’s okay to feel angry sometimes it’s okay to get upset or annoyed or mad it’s okay for him to feel that way with you your relationship isn’t in trouble when you’re mad at each other your relationship is in trouble when you feel indifferent about one another so fight in a healthy way get mad in a healthy way yell at each other in a healthy way a controlled way and a way where you’re not screaming over one another all that means is that you’re working out kinks in your relationship you’re not in trouble until someone stops feeling or caring or having any kind of desire to fix the problem10 be with someone who you can honestly talk to about the things that are on your mind a handsome guy is great a successful guy is great a hardworking guy is great but at the end of the day those things eventually become meaningless if you can’t honestly and genuinely connect on the most basic level eventually that fun carefree guy you’re dating could become your life partner in the beginning it’s fun to be carefree and lighthearted with him it’s fun to enjoy his looks it’s nice to be with a guy who can take you out to a fancy dinner every once in a while if you’ve found a guy with any or all of those qualities good for you but they aren’t absolutely necessary – you can still find happiness with him even if he’s missing some of the traits you usually look for because ultimately when you try to create a life with someone it’s going to be damn near impossible if you don’t know how to talk to them when you’re coming home from a long day or when you’re experiencing one of the more difficult challenges of your life you’re not going to care about coming home to someone that’s handsome or wealthy or powerful you’re going to care about coming home to a guy who can talk to you a guy who can help you work through what you need to work through a guy who knows how to listen and how to make you feel heard and understood and cared about that’s worth more than all the money in the world read this to every person who’s convinced
