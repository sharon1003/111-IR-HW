combustion reactions combustion reactions always involve molecular oxygen o2 anytime anything burns in the usual sense it is a combustion reaction combustion reactions are almost always exothermic ie they give off heat for example when wood burns it must do so in the presence of o2 and a lot of heat is produced wood as well as many common items that combust are organic ie they are made up of carbon hydrogen and oxygen when organic molecules combust the reaction products are carbon dioxide and water as well as heat for example consider the combustion of methanol rubbing alcohol of course not all combustion reactions release co2 and water eg the combustion of magnesium metal
