a curious adult from great britain april 5 2012neither parent gets to decide almost everyone has around a 50 chance of having a boy and a 50 chance of having a girl what we can say is that dads sperm determines whether a baby will be a boy or a girl about half of his sperm will make a boy and half a girl the sex of the baby depends on which sperm gets to the egg first in a perfect world it would all be up to chance both types of sperm would have an equal chance of reaching the egg first and once fertilized each type of egg would have an equal chance of developing fully into a baby but as you know the world is not perfect certain factors can influence the sex of the child as youll see below there is much more evidence of this happening in the animal world but it happens in people too for example more boys are born each year than girls one theory for this has to do with the y or male sex chromosome being so much smaller than the x or female one the idea is that sperm that carry a y are slightly speedier and so are a bit more likely to make it to the egg first how mom or dad lives can affect the sex of their baby too a number of studies have suggested that factors like nutrition wealth and even where the parents live can affect the odds of having a boy or a girl but none of these effects is very large for example moms that ate cereal every morning had a boy 59 of the time while moms that rarely ate cereal had boys only 43 of the time however this doesnt mean that you should change your diet to increase your odds either way we dont know for certain that cereal is the cause of the difference perhaps women who tend to eat cereal have other shared qualities and its one of these that affects whether theyll have a boy or not and as you can see whatever the reason the effect is tiny this is true of most outside factors like this in people for us the sex of the child is mostly determined by which of dads sperm makes it to the egg first lets look a little closer at how the x and y chromosomes determine sex then well explore why we see differences in the numbers of girls and boys in many families
