march 22 2017 blog the carbon dioxide fire extinguisher is a staple in our portable extinguisher line up at all florida fire equipment carbon dioxide also known as co2 is a natural colorless odorless gas along with the fact that carbon dioxide co2 is a vital part of life on earth it is also an effective fireextinguishing agent the carbon dioxide fire extinguisher contains carbon dioxide gas or  co2 and is defined by a few unique characteristics for starters co2 fire extinguishers are designed for very specific hazards in addition carbon dioxide operates at a much higher pressure than the average extinguisher carbon dioxide extinguishers are also one of the only two types whose agent is selfexpelling carbon dioxide used as an extinguishing agent extinguishers containing carbon dioxide are used on class b fires flammable liquid and class b fires in conjunction with class c energized electrical equipment fires co2 is effective as an extinguishing agent because it lowers the oxygen level to such an extent that combustion is no longer possible co2 acts inertly to lower the oxygen in the space it occupies and oxygen is required for combustion to occur once a fire is successfully extinguished using carbon dioxide you should continue the discharge onto the burn surface as co2 has a cooling effect and its continued use will help prevent a from reignite because co2 gas is so ‘light’ the range of the co2 discharge is restricted by air currents and easily dissipated it should be used at a safe but close distance co2 extinguishers are most effective when directed at the base of a fire or overhead if carbon dioxide is being concentrated at the base of a fire the operator should sweep the extinguisher back and forth starting at the closest edge and move to the farthermost corner the overhead method is a technique that is unique to the carbon dioxide fire extinguisher the overhead approach involves discharging the co2 above the fire with the discharge horn aimed at a 45degree angle toward the center this causes the carbon dioxide discharge to concentrate centermost and plume out towards the outer edges when using co2 extinguishers on flammable liquid spill fires the base method should be used carbon dioxide works by being kept under high pressures in excess of 850 psi when carbon dioxide is under such immense pressure it liquefies making it selfexpelling as it is under its own pressure when a co2 extinguisher is discharged the carbon dioxide rapidly changes from a liquid back into its gaseous form expanding and directed through the discharge horn of the extinguisher this process allows for the fire and the surrounding space to be permeated with carbon dioxide carbon dioxide vs ammonium phosphate there are two reasons for using carbon dioxide as opposed to using monoammonium phosphate on a fire involving electrical equipment the monoammonium phosphate agent found in most extinguishers will damage electrical equipment and makes a devastating mess carbon dioxide gas is not abrasive or corrosive on sensitive electrical components and makes no mess co2 does not conduct electricity however when using a carbon dioxide extinguisher for electrical equipment fires it is advised to deenergize the equipment to avoid reignition all florida fire equipment services and recharges all types of carbon dioxide containers including fire extinguishers recreational co2 products such as paintball guns beveragedispensing cylinders and any other product that uses co2 cartridges we can also do hydrostatic testing of your co2 equipment and our mobile units can come to your location at all florida fire equipment our only business is the protection of your business home or boat from fire it’s what we’ve been doing since 1999 and it’s what we’ll be doing in 2039 we offer a quality service at a fair price and we are proud to stand behind what we sell and service if you are anywhere in the tampa st petersburg clearwater lakeland largo sarasota or bradenton areas we are just a phone call or email away call us at 7275255950 or email us at serviceallfloridafirecom if you prefer fill out our easy contact us form and we’ll reach out to you facebook twitter linked in pinterest google email share1 comment braden bills may 31 2017reply there was a fire scare in my home and i ended up having to use the fire extinguisher i had no idea that they were supposed to be refilled it’s a good thing that there are professionals that can take care of it recent posts oval fire extinguishers are changing the face of fire suppression december 21 2017what do the letters and numbers mean on your fire extinguisher october 17 2017how to clean up after using a fire extinguisher september 4 2017all website tagsfire extinguisher inspection leave a comment
