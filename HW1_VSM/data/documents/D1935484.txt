biology stack exchange is a question and answer site for biology researchers academics and students join them it only takes a minute sign up heres how it works anybody can ask a question anybody can answer the best answers are voted up and rise to the top atp required for cell processes closedup vote2down votefavorite i havent been able to find anything that tells me how much atp is needed for dna replication transcription and translation in humans just papers that mention atp used in those processes i need to know how much atp is needed for these processes because once my cell from scratch is alive i feed each cell 50 nanograms of glucose which yields 5 trillion atp if i use these numbers plus the numbers for other metabolic processes i get roughly the amount of atp needed per cell before mitosis if i know this then i will know if i need to feed my cells more glucose or if 50 nanograms is enough so how much atp is needed for dna replication transcription and translation i want it in terms of per nucleotide and per amino acid so that i can multiply that by the amount of dna total amount of dna in any given gene and amount of amino acids in any given proteintranscription

question to limit it to a specific problem with enough detail to identify an adequate answer avoid asking multiple distinct questions at once see the how to ask page for help clarifying this question if this question can be reworded to fit the rules in the help center please edit the question1this is difficult to answer do you wish to include the atp required to synthesize nucleobases nucleoside triphosphates amino acids charged t rna etc – canadianer jun 1 15 at 4181i have given a rough answer and you can go into finer details like accounting for nad you have not done any research towards the question and i am inclined to close the question – wysiwyg ♦ jun 1 15 at 504the information you provide is not nearly enough to figure out the energy needs of a cell before mitosis you need to measure at least glucose uptake lactate release and oxygen consumption and do growth curves every cell line is different so you need data on your cells see ncbinlmnihgovpubmed14697210 and ncbinlmnihgovpubmed5817088 but you dont need to know this just to culture cells  as long as they grow and look healthy and the medium p h is not to low they have enough glucose – roland jun 1 15 at 540culture media for mammalian cells usually contain 1 to 4 graml for example when 106 cells are seeded on a 10 cm dish you could grow them to about 107 for several days using 10 ml culture medium for some cells you might have to replace medium with fresh one once before they reach 107 cells you could know how much cells need glucose practically when you have pyruvate in media it goes tca cycle so that glucose is not only the source of atp – 243 jun 1 15 at 558in addition atp is required for sugar modification of proteins protein phosphorylation and probably amino acid and lipid synthesis as well as mechanical cell movement vesicle transport chromosome segregation and  what else – 243 jun 1 15 at 605show 2 more comments1 answer active oldest votesup vote2down vote for dna replication and transcription you need ntps in a ds dna purine content will be same as pyrimidine content i am considering that all nucleotides are synthesized de novo which would consume more atp than getting nucleotides from the salvage pathway fig 1 pyrimidine synthesis taken from wikipedia fig 2 purine synthesis taken from wikipedia ctp synthesis requires one extra atp utp  glutamine  atp  h 2 o → ctp  adp  p i utp synthesis requires 2 step 1 fig 1  1 step 5 fig 1 prpp requires 1 atp to form  2 ump → utp  5 atps ctp requires 6 atps gtp requires 8 atps fig 2 atp synthesis would also require 8 atps but for simplicity let us assume that atp is already present conversion of d ntp from ntp requires thioredoxin which in turn requires nadp but let us forget that assuming a 50 gc content one base pair of dna would require in an average 10 atps assume a stretch of 4nt — actg this would require 1658 atps ie 5 atps per nt 10 atp per bpfor rna the atp consumption would be 5 atps per nt for protein synthesis for every codon the elongation factor requires one molecule of gtp and aminoacylt rna synthetase requires 1 molecule of atp so the net consumption per amino acid would be 9 atps i am ignoring the initiation reaction that also requires atp to phosphorylate the initiation factor also i assume that amino acids are obtained from diet and are not synthesized by the organismshare
