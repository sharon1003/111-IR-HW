portuguese dutch british 2 3 and other european men who settled in sri lanka 4 5 and developed relationships with native sri lankan women 6 the portuguese and dutch had held some of the maritime provinces of the island for centuries before the advent of the british empire 7 8 9 with the establishment of ceylon as a crown colony at the end of the 18th century most of those who retained close ties with the netherlands departed however a significant community of burghers remained and largely adopted the english language 8 during british rule they occupied a highly important place in sri lankan social and economic life 9portuguese settlers on ceylon were essentially traders but wished to form colonies and lisbon did nothing to discourage european settlement—even to the extent of advocating intermarriage with the sinhalese this was not encouraged by the sinhalese it was not the policy of the dutch east india company to endorse similar unions although a number of unofficial liaisons between its employees and local women occurred in the late eighteenth century 8burghers may vary from generation to generation in physical characteristics some intermarried with the british 9 and produced descendants with predominantly european phenotypes including fairer skin and a heavier physique while others were almost indistinguishable from sinhalese or tamils 7 most burgher people have preserved european customs especially among those of portuguese ancestry who retained their european religion and language with pride 10 11contents  hide 1 demographics2 legal definition3

portuguese burghers and dutch burghers in the census of 1981 the burgher population of sri lanka was 39374 persons about 02 of the total population the highest concentration of burghers is in colombo 072 and gampaha 05 there are also significant communities in trincomalee and batticaloa with an estimated population of 20000 burgher descendants are spread throughout the world families with surnames such as foenandes a variation of the portuguese fernandes  mirano and van dort are of dutch ancestry legal definition  editthe burghers were legally defined in 1883 by the chief justice of ceylon sir richard ottley given before the commission appointed in connection with the establishment of a legislative council in ceylon burghers were defined as those whose father was born in sri lanka with at least one european ancestor on ones direct paternal side regardless of the ethnic origin of ones mother or what other ethnic groups may be found on the fathers side because of this definition burghers almost always have european surnames mostly of portuguese dutch and british origin but sometimes german french or russian 13history  editmain articles portuguese period in ceylon dutch period in

outsiders then called ceylon since there were no women in the portuguese navy the portuguese sailors married local sinhalese and tamil women this practice was encouraged by the portuguese the dutch first made contact and signed a trade agreement with the kingdom of kandy in 1602 from 1640 on the dutch east india company voc had a governor installed and conquered more and more fords from the portuguese until in 1658 the last portuguese were expelled however they permitted a few stateless persons of portuguesejewish  marrano descent and of mixed portuguesesinhalese ancestry to stay many people having a portuguese name were a result of forced conversions of localnative people in order to work for the portuguese as a result burghers with portuguese names are most likely to be of sinhalese ancestry with a very small portion being portuguese or mixed portuguesesinhalese ancestry those of a portuguesejewish background can be traced in various forms or surmised from their surname most burghers of eurasian descent with portuguese surnames are of sinhalese and dutch british german swedish andor other european descent during the dutch period all dutch colonial operations were overseen by the voc vereenigde oostindische compagnie or united east india company  virtually all burghers from this period were employees of the voc the voc employed not only dutch nationals but also enlisted men from the southern netherlands the german states sweden denmark and austria it is therefore not unusual to find ancestors from these countries in many dutch burgher family trees the term burgher comes from the dutch word burger meaning citizen or town dweller and is cognate with the french and english word  bourgeois  at this time in europe there had emerged a middle class consisting of people who were neither aristocrats nor serfs these were the traders and businessmen who lived in towns and were considered free citizens in europe they were called burghers and they were encouraged to migrate to the colonies in order to expand business horizons dutch ceylon had two classes of people of european descent those who were paid by the voc and were referred to as company servants ie employees and those who had migrated of their own free will the latter were not referred to as burghers in ceylon but rather by their rank position or standing during british colonial rule they were referred to by the british as dutch burghers and formed the europeandescended civilian population in ceylon to some degree the term of burgher was used in a derogatory way to divide and conquer the population as it distinguished between british and other races or positions the dutch burgher community took pride in its own achievements and prized their european ancestry a number of dutch burgher union journals have been created over a period of time to record family histories they were not only of dutch origin but incorporated european dutch german hungarian italian french swedish etc  united kingdom portuguese mix and sinhalese lines when the british took over in 1796 many voc employees chose to leave however a significant number chose to stay mostly those of mixed descent some chose to go to batavia which was the headquarters of the voc reportedly about 900 families both free citizens and united east india company employees decided to remain in ceylon the british referred to them all as dutch burghers one condition of their being allowed to stay was that they had to sign a treaty of capitulation to the british many dutch burghers can find their ancestors names in this treaty at the time of the british conquest the 900 dutch burgher families residing in ceylon were concentrated in colombo galle matara and jaffna the burghers included members of the swiss de meuron regiment a mercenary unit employed by the voc in diplomatic negotiations in europe count de meuron pledged allegiance to the british in exchange for back pay and information this allowed the british to get detailed fortification information and reduce the fighting strength of ceylon prior to 1796 the de meuron regiment refused to fight the dutch due to relationships forged on the island of ceylon and south africa post 1796 members of the de meuron regiment stayed in ceylon whilst the regiment itself went off to fight and distinguish itself in india and later in canada culture  edituntil the early 20th century many burghers spoke english and a form of portuguese creole even those of dutch descent portuguese creole had been the language of trade and communication with sri lankans it is now only spoken in parts of the coastal towns of trincomalee and batticaloa while much vocabulary is from portuguese its grammar is based on that of tamil and sinhalese burgher culture is a rich mixture of east and west reflecting their ancestry they are the most europeanised of the ethnic groups in sri lanka most of them wear modern contemporary clothing although it is not uncommon for a man to be seen wearing a sarong or for a woman to wear a sari a number of elements in burgher culture have become part of the cultures of other ethnic groups in sri lanka for example baila music which has its origin in the music of 16thcentury portugal has found its way into mainstream popular sinhalese music lacemaking which began as a domestic pastime of burgher women is now a part of sinhalese culture too even certain foods such as love cake bol fiado layered cake ijzer koekjes frikkadels savoury meatballs and lamprais have become an integral part of sri lankan national cuisine burghers are not physically homogeneous it is possible to have a blond pale whiteskinned burgher as well as a burgher with a very dark complexion and black hair a burgher with complexion from brown to light brown and black hair and a burgher with fairer complexion and black hair paleskinned and darkskinned children can even appear as brother and sister in the same family of the same parents burghers share a common culture rather than a common ethnicity burghers have a very strong interest in their family histories many old burgher families kept stamboeken from the dutch for clan books these recorded not only dates of births marriages and deaths but also significant events in the history of a family such as details of moving house illnesses school records and even major family disputes an extensive multivolume stamboek of many family lineages is kept by the dutch burgher union individual families often have indigenous european traditions reflecting their specific family origins burghers of dutch origin sometimes celebrate the feast of saint nicholas in december and those of portuguesejewish origin observe customs such as the separation time of a woman after childbirth see leviticus 1225 the redemption of the firstborn  pidyon haben  and the purification bath  taharah after a daughter’s first period see niddah  most of the latter burgher families being unaware of the jewish origins of these customs have given them a catholic slant catholic and episcopal churches had services for the churching of women after childbirth from ancient times however some traditions attributed to judaism can also be explained as borrowings or retention from the tamil and sinhalese communities with whom many burgher families also share ancestry and culture for example the purification bath after a girl’s first period is a common cultural feature of the tamil and sinhalese communities of sri lanka and neighboring india hence its prevalence amongst some burghers families of sri lanka is not necessarily of jewish origins some commentators believe that the burghers’ own mixed backgrounds have made their culture more tolerant and open while intercommunal strife has been a feature of modern sri lankan life some burghers have worked to maintain good relations with other ethnic groups in 2001 the burghers established a heritage association
