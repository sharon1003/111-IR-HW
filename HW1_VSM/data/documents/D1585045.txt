pilaf if youre still spreading peanut butter and jelly on colorless wonder bread or heaping your stirfry on top of a pile of uncle bens its time to wean yourself off the refined stuff and explore whole grains kudos to you if youve already made this tradein whole grains are higher in nutrients and will raise your blood glucose less than their refined counterparts do plus unlike refined grains they may protect your heart and help you maintain weight loss the reason for the nutritional disparity between refined carbohydrates and whole grains lies in the processing whole grains contain an outer bran layer a middle endosperm and inner germ but refined grains are stripped of everything—including protein and many key nutrients—save for the endosperm because theyre less processed whole grains have a lower glycemic index value than refined grains another point in the wholegrains column is their relatively high fiber content which can help lower cholesterol levels control blood glucose and keep you feeling full long after eating its really important to eat foods that are going to fill you up and not leave you hungry an hour later so you dont binge postmeal says elisa zied ms rd cdn a registered dietitiannutritionist and author of the book nutrition at your fingertips zied suggests gradually replacing your current processed foods such as regular pretzels with whole grains

learn that many packaged products claim the health benefits of whole grains but remember just because a brand advertises whole grains doesnt mean youre getting any benefit plenty of products use the expression made from whole grains as a marketing ploy when they really contain insignificant amounts another buzzword you can forget multigrain the term may be describing a product made with a handful of different refined grains to know youre truly getting a wholegrain product look for the words whole grain before the first ingredient listed if a product says its made with 100 percent whole wheat

over life is boring enough already without limiting your food youd be surprised with how different all of the grains taste and how different they are if you dont know buckwheat from bulgur read on for information about some of the lesserknown grains and a few pseudocereals that youll love to cook with amaranth the burgundy amaranth plant was a major crop of the ancient aztecs but it virtually vanished until the 1970s today the plants tiny blond seeds are reappearing as an alternative to cereal grains like wheat and oats amaranth is a pseudocereal but thanks to its high protein content and similar use its often grouped in the same category the slightly grassy earthy flavor is somewhat stronger than that of rice so it helps to use flavorful spices when cooking with amaranth you can toast it to bring out a more nutty toasted flavor just swirl it in a dry skillet before cooking says asbell • key nutrients the seeds are between 14 and 16 percent protein packed with the amino acid lysine and have about 8 grams of fiber per cooked cup theyre also gluten free • how to cook with it amaranth seeds can often be sticky so theyre not ideal for a pilaf dish instead asbell suggests using them as a thickener in soups or cooking them as a breakfast porridge she also creates a halfamaranth polenta mixing it with millet or corn you can pop the seeds to create a smallerthanpopcorn snack or try amaranth flour in cookies breads and muffins—just be sure to mix it with wheat flour since the grain is gluten free and wont rise buckwheat its likely you first tasted buckwheat flour in a pancake but the crop—a pseudocereal thats really part of the rhubarb family—is also what gives japanese soba noodles french crepes and the russian porridge kasha their wheaty taste its got a really strong flavor

grams of protein per cup it is also gluten free • how to cook with it next time you bake bread or muffins or cook waffles substitute half of your recipes whole wheat flour with buckwheat flour buckwheat groats—the plants seeds—are perfect for pilaftype dishes asbell suggests sautéing the groats in a pan before cooking to amplify the flavor substitute them freely for rice in almost any recipe says rebecca wood author of the splendid grain who uses the groats in stirfries bulgur a favorite in the middle east bulgur is a type of cracked wheat kernel that has been precooked and dried the resulting grain is light tan in color slightly chewy with a mild flavor that works well with many dishes • key nutrients bulgur packs a lot of fiber per cup about 8 grams and close to 6 grams of protein • how to cook with it bulgur is very versatile you can pretty much use it in anything says asbell its a classic for tabbouleh and salad for a quick pilaftype meal asbell suggests adding sautéed onion to bulgur cooked in chicken stock or top a green salad with a heaping portion of fluffy bulgur millet millet is a staple in much of the world but in america its typically used as bird feed that said the grain is making a resurgence with humans who appreciate its high protein content and versatility its very mild and soft its yellow its very pretty says asbell • key nutrients millet

pronounced keenwah was used centuries ago by the incas and continues to be a staple of the south american diet it only started gaining traction in the united states about three decades ago since then the united nations has praised the crops ample protein content and americans have fallen for its mild nutty flavor and quick preparation if youve yet to cultivate a fondness for ancient crops try quinoa—a pseudocereal thats a relative of swiss chard and beets—which is a great gateway grain • key nutrients quinoa packs about 8 grams of protein per cooked cup and because it contains all nine essential amino acids its a complete protein its also gluten free • how to cook with it if you can whip up a bowl of rice you can cook quinoa—its often eaten as a pilaf and cooks just as quickly in

prewashed to avoid the inconvenient step you can get creative by trying a recipe asbell created which substitutes quinoa for typical breadcrumbs dip shrimp in egg coat with partially cooked quinoa and
