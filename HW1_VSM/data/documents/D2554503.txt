muscle gains possible from deca durabolin or do you just want to answer the inevitable beginners question of what is deca here are all the facts you need to know about this incredibly popular bodybuilding drug nandrolone which is commonly known by its decanoateester brand name deca durabolin deca for short is one of the mostpowerful musclebuilding and strengthboosting steroids available of course in order to unlock the true explosive massbuilding potential of a deca cycle it helps immensely to know the facts that said keep reading to see how many of the following 33 facts that you know about deca durabolin1 nandrolone is great for adding size and strength deca is definitely one steroid thats withstood the test of time having even been used by bodybuilding legends like arnold schwarzenegger and sergio oliva in the 1960s and theres a great reason why its remained so popular over the decades nandrolone is excellent at adding lean muscle mass and strength over a long period of time many deca durabolin reviews rave about this drug claiming that its helped them gain 2030 pounds of lean muscle in a cycle a 16week study performed on hiv patients whod lost 515 of their body weight proved decas massbuilding potential even at a low dose of 100mg every two weeks the average patient gained 014kg 03lb per week during the study 12 nandrolone helps your muscles retain nitrogen which promotes major growth one of the biggest benefits of deca durabolin is that it helps muscle cells store more nitrogen as a 1999 study on aids patients proved 2 and this is huge because muscle cells assimilate more protein when theyre in a positive nitrogen state however its also worth noting that you cant expect mass building and a positive nitrogen balance to occur if youre only eating kale salads and smoothies every day your body needs calories and protein to make sure that your muscles are retaining nitrogen on deca and growing at a rapid pace3 deca will have you craving lots of food luckily you wont have to worry about only eating that kale salad on a deca durabolin cycle because your appetite will feel out of control of course this isnt an excuse to stop eating clean and gorge on the pizza hut buffet every day for lunch however the appetite stimulation on deca is certainly welcome to bodybuilders who have trouble packing on size due to their small appetite4 this drug raises your igf1 levels insulinlike growth factor 1 igf1 is a hormone that closely resembles insulin and plays a very important role in the musclebuilding process so it goes without saying that if you can raise your igf1 levels you stand a better chance to build lean muscle mass and deca does exactly this as a 2000 study showed when nandrolone decanoate raised igfi m rna expression levels in mice 35 deca durabolin has some incredible therapeutic benefits for joints joint pain is pretty common in people as they age andor in bodybuilders who engage in intense workouts this being said it should be little surprise that the latter group really appreciates the positive deca durabolin effects on joint paint research has shown that even when dosed at 50mg once every three weeks nandrolone decanoate can stimulate type iii collagen synthesis in joints 4 so at higher doses its easy to understand how bodybuilders and powerlifters with joint pain suddenly feel better after running a deca cycle6 this drug improves bone density back in 1983 the fda approved nandrolone decanoate for treating osteoporosis so it should be no surprise that deca increases bone density a 1984 study examined the effects of treating women suffering from metabolic bone derangement with a 50mg deca durabolin injection once every three weeks for two years the end result was that the drug boosted both intestinal calcium absorption and bone mineral content 57 deca increases your red blood cell count nandrolone decanoate can increase the size and amount of red blood cells in your body this is very beneficial in improving your bodys oxygencarrying capabilities which in turns helps your musclebuilding efforts too8 nandrolone will raise your progesterone levels a lot of deca durabolin reviews warn that this drug can raise progesterone levels and rightfully so because this female pregnancy hormone converts to estrogen progesterone is also found in men and can cause major problems like an enlarged prostate and erectile dysfunction when levels are too high seeing as how erectile dysfunction isnt exactly a thrilling proposition to most guys increased progesterone is one of the worst deca durabolin side effects9 many beginning bodybuilders dont understand what deca durabolin is if you were to ask what is deca to even the greenest of aas users chances are that theyd know its a popular bulking steroid furthermore theyll probably also know that its nickname is deca however what many beginners dont realize is that deca is more than just a shortened drug name its the name of a specific ester which is a steroid molecule with a carbon chain attached to it the decanoate ester form of nandrolone aka deca durabolin actually has the secondlongest carbon chain of all the main esters behind undecanoate meaning its half life discussed in fact 22 is one of the longest acting10 deca durabolin is not nandrolone phenylpropionate given that deca durabolin is a version of nandrolone some people get it confused with nandrolone phenylpropionate npp and its easy to understand why since deca and npp are esentially the same drug just in different esters npps phenylpropionate ester has a shorter active half life 45 days and acts much faster than the decanoate ester in turn nandrolone phenylpropionate allows bodybuilders to get more gains on shorter cycles and the drug leaves their system far quicker however the big advantage that nandrolone decanoate has is that you dont have to stick yourself in the butt with a needle every other day like with npp instead you can take 12 deca injections each week okay so nandrolone has some incredible musclebuilding capabilities and overall health benefits but here are some of the side effects11 deca durabolin aromatizes at a moderate rate unlike steroids such as anadrol dianabol and testosterone deca doesnt aromatize convert to estrogen at a very high rate meaning many users wont experience as much water retention or gynecomastia gyno however this doesnt mean that one should completely avoid using an aromatase inhibitor ai like arimidex or aromasin with this drug  especially when you consider that deca interacts with both estrogen and progesterone receptors in the breast tissue so if youre really prone to gyno or just terrified of getting it dont underestimate the moderate aromatization rate of nandrolone12 nandrolone can shut down natural testosterone production as mentioned above the aromatizing deca side effects arent as harsh as other anabolic steroids theres a big but here though because deca does have the ability to hamper natural testosterone production even at small doses furthermore deca doesnt break down into dihydrotestosterone dht and it actually competes with dht for receptors because dht is a sex hormone thats crucial to attaining and keeping erections one of the nandrolone decanoate side effects is low libido or what bodybuilders commonly refer to as deca dick additionally drugscom points out that men can experience decreased ejaculatory volume too so in order to avoid this problem many bodybuilders run a nandrolone decanoate cycle with testosterone and hcgenerate13 nandrolone can have a longterm effect on your libido as if the above isnt scary enough one of the worst side effects of deca durabolin is that it can suppress your luteinizing hormone lh and follicle stimulating hormone fsh levels these two hormones are the primary catalysts to stimulating the testes leydig cells to secrete testosterone a study by swedens karolinska institutet showed that those who use the deca steroid for long time periods can suppress lh and fsh levels for over one year after usage 6 so again oncycle support along with a testosterone base is very important for any deca cycle14 some women use deca but at their own risk although not the toprecommended steroid for women some ladies do use deca to pack on muscle and strength recommended deca durabolin dosage for women is typically 25mg100mg with the lower end being a great starting point however the problem here is definitely the deca durabolin side effects which vary greatly from woman to woman even at low doses some females will experience virilization developing masculine side effects which can lead to more acne clitoral enlargement more body and facial hair and deepening of the voice so if youre a woman on deca and your voice starts sounding like morgan freeman its best to get off this drug as soon as possible better yet you should consider a more femalefriendly steroid like anavar15 deca wont make your hair fall out on the bright side nandrolone wont cause typical steroid side effects like bad skin and hair loss the latter is because of the aforementioned fact that nandrolone decanoates metabolites compete with dht for receptors dht is a male sex hormone that as medical news todaycom points out gets to the dermal papilla and undermines the absorption of vital nutrients required for healthy hair follicles16 this drug was really popular among older bodybuilding generations dating back to the 1960s bodybuilders have been using deca durabolin to add size and muscle this of course means that many of our heroes from the golden age of bodybuilding used deca to take the sport to new heights 7time mr olympia arnold schwarzenegger is no doubt the mostfamous bodybuilder to admit deca use the late mike mentzer another notable bodybuilder and mr olympia competitor also discussed his nandrolone decanoate use in a december 2000 interview with iron magazine i took 400mg of deca durabolin every 1014 days and no more than five dianabol a day he recalled a huge reason why oldschool bodybuilders used this drug was because of its incredible massbuilding effects combined with mild deca side effects the latter was really important in this era because ais and selective estrogen receptor modulators serms werent around17 deca isnt as harsh on your organs as other steroids as web mdcom explains deca durabolin side effects dont normally include severe stomach liver or kidney problems this is one advantage to using injectables like deca testosterone equipoise and primobolan since they arent very toxic to organs methylated oral steroids like anavar dianabol and winstrol on the other hand are far more harmful to your liver and kidneys18 a good pct is still important while nandrolone side effects dont include many estrogenic or organ problems its still very important that you run a solid postcycle therapy this is especially the case when considering what deca side effects can do to your natural testosterone production and sex drive since most knowledgeable bodybuilders cycle deca with other drugs your specific pct will depend upon the cycle as a whole19 nolvadex is not very good for deca pctone drug that youll want to leave out of your pct following a deca durabolin cycle is nolvadex the reason why is because nolva upregulates prolactin hormone enabling women to produce milk and progesterone receptors which is bad because deca also interacts with these receptors since the point of pct is to bring your hormone levels back to normal after a cycle nolva will keep your progesteroneprolactin levels off balance heres an elite fitness thread where the subject is discussed in depth weve covered the benefits and risks of deca durabolin so how should you run a deca cycle20 deca is cycled with a large variety of other steroids deca durabolin stacks well with a number of steroids including testosterone cypionate testosterone enanthate testosterone propionate anadrol dianabol and sustanon 250 one great thing about deca is that it goes nicely with testosterone which is used as the base for many cycles at higher doses testosterone aromatizes converts to estrogen much worse so rather than adding larger doses of testosterone to a cycle one could add a weekly deca dosage of 300mg400mg for more mass and strengthbuilding results below you can see a test deca cycle w dianabol kickstarter from an elite fitnesscom thread that also includes some constructive criticism week testosterone depot deca durabolin dianabol1 500mg 200mg 20mg2 500mg 200mg 20mg3

safely dosed up to 600mg per week deca durabolin dosage should be dependent upon your experience men who are new to deca should start at 300400mg per week while experienced users can safely dose up to 600mg bodybuilders who are really experienced with aas will dose over 1000mg per week but this certainly isnt recommended for the average user thanks to decas long half life some people who use this drug merely administer a single deca durabolin injection per week however others will do two weekly injections especially at higher doses22 deca durabolin has an incredibly long active half life nandrolone decanoate has an active half life of 15 days giving it the secondlongest active half life of all steroid variations behind equipoises undecanoate ester at 165 days the decanoate ester is very slowacting meaning you probably wont see gains from deca durabolin for at least 34 weeks but once the effects do kick in youll notice some very strong musclebuilding results because deca takes so long to act a short deca cycle does very little for users23 experienced bodybuilders quit deca use before stopping testosterone in a cycle because of nandrolones long active half life many experienced steroid users stop using it before they quit testosterone in a test deca cycle this is done to ensure that testosterone and deca both leave your system before beginning postcycle therapy some bodybuilders preach that the minimum point to quit using deca ahead of testosterone in a cycle is two weeks below you can see a cycle from an elite fitness thread where the user is advised to quit using deca four weeks before stopping testosterone usage week testosterone cyp equipoise deca hcg sustain alpha 51 600mg 600mg 300mg2 600mg 600mg 300mg3 600mg 600mg 300mg4 600mg 600mg 300mg 500ui5

alone some beginning steroid users want to run deca for their firstever cycle and given the publicity that nandrolone has gained through athletes use discussed later its little surprise why however a deca durabolin cycle is not exactly a great way to welcome yourself to the world of aas due to the fact that it can shut down your testosterone production and kill your libido here is an elite fitness forum thread where you can see a beginner propose deca for a first cycle only to scolded on the matter25 many bodybuilders like to cycle testosterone and deca at a certain ratio one good way to minimize the testosterone and hpta function shutdown that can happen with deca is to ensure that youre running it at lower doses in a cycle than testosterone for example some bodybuilders will run testosterone at 300mg per week and deca at 200mg this works out to a 21 ratio in favor of testosterone however theres no set ratio because someone might run 500mg test per week and 300mg deca 161 ratio while a really experienced user could run 1000mg test and 600mg deca 1671 ratio26 bodybuilders can inject nandrolone into various areas if youre wondering how to take deca durabolin its given as a deep injection into a muscle such as the buttock upper leg or upper arm it is also recommended that you get a deca durabolin injection from a trained doctor or nurse but since deca is illegal for muscleenhancing purposes in most countries the majority of bodybuilders inject themselves obviously this isnt something that one wants to go into blind so heres a discussion at the elite fitness forums on how to take deca durabolin and other injectables27 deca can be stored for 57 years nandrolone has a relatively long shelf life and can be stored between five and seven years if done properly according to xpil medicinesorg the temperature at which deca is stored needs to be below 30Â°c 86Â°f however one should not store this drug in a refrigerator or freezer and it should be kept in the original package until use to protect from sunlight deca works the many athletes whove been busted for using it can tell you this28 deca durabolin offers some major athletic benefits due to incredible deca durabolin effects on athletic performance this drug is very popular among those looking to add muscle mass strength drop weight andor heal injuries of course like any other anabolic steroid deca is not welcome in sports and will result in a suspension for athletes if theyre caught and due to the incredibly long half life of deca the chances of passing an inseason steroid test are incredibly low when on it29 marion jones used deca durabolin as a threetime olympic gold medalist and former wnba player marion jones is one of the greatest female athletes ever however her legacy instantly became tainted when she was linked to the infamous balco scandal along with her firstchilds father and fellow goldmedalist tim montgomery jones later admitted to using performanceenhancing drugs such as nandrolone decanoate and tetrahydrogestrinone aka the clear during her athletic career she was stripped of her gold medals and spent six months in prison for lying under oath and for being involved in a checkfraud scheme30 barry bonds tested positive for nandrolone  twiceanother name that is synonymous with the balco scandal is barry bonds the homerun king who mysteriously packed on 20 pounds of lean muscle one year and belted a record73 homers in 2001 but as this espn report revealed the former san francisco giants slugger tested positive twice for deca 2000 and 01 the deca durabolin before and after effects can really be seen in bonds homerun stats since hed only hit over 40 homers three times in his first 14 seasons then turned out these marvelous power stats in a fiveyear span2000 mlb season 49 home runs 2001 mlb season 73 home runs 2002 mlb season 46 home runs 2003 mlb season 45 home runs 2004 mlb season 45 home runs lucky for bonds major league baseball had no clearset rules against using steroids at the time however he did get in minor legal trouble for perjury and obstruction of justice stemming from his testimony in the balco trial oh yeahand theres also the whole thing about his legacy being in tatters31 plenty of athletes have been suspended for deca use jones certainly isnt the only athlete to have received a harsh punishment for using the deca steroid a wide range of athletes have tested positive for deca steroids including spanish footballer pep guardiola oneyear suspension former nba player juan dixon oneyear suspension cricketer shoaib akhtar twoyear ban overturned tennis player petr korda oneyear suspension british sprinter and gold medalist lindford christie twoyear suspension and mma fighter royce gracie license suspension whats interesting here is that you can see deca use in sports like basketball soccer football and tennis where anabolics arent very common32 olympic committee allows nandrolone in athletesto a degree the international olympic committee ioc cant ban every athlete whom they find to have small traces of nandroloine in their system otherwise theyd be suspending everybody from goldmedalwinning track stars to midlevel ping pong players after all the 19norandrosterone metabolite a byproduct of nandrolone is often naturally present in human urine so as wikipedia points out the ioc allows up to 20 Î¼gl of 19norandrosterone in urine samples before suspecting anybody of doping33 deca is illegal without a prescription not only does nandrolone draw suspensions in the sports world but it is also illegal in most countries to buy deca durabolin in the united states for example deca is in the schedule iii class of drugs meaning firsttime offenders could draw a maximum penalty of up to a 250000 fine andor three years in prison luckily these types of penalties are pretty rare for those using this drug which is why people continue to buy deca durabolin online from countries where its legal but given the legality issues here people should be careful when they search for deca durabolin for sale what are your thoughts heres a link to discuss 33 crazy deca durabolin facts that you may or may not know on
