party level to different ridings andor to different parties are also all counted as separate contributors electoral expense reimbursement  editwhen an election takes place perhaps the most significant source of public funding for the federal political parties is the election expenses reimbursement which subsidizes 50 of the national campaign expenses of any party that obtains at least 2 per cent support or at least 5 per cent in the ridings electoral districts in which they presented candidates in addition to this the parties riding organizations are also reimbursed 60 of all expenses incurred by their candidates in each riding where they obtained at least 10 of the votes plus 100 of allowable personal expenses the reimbursements are also referred to as government rebates government transfers or election rebates 7under this subsidy the more a party spends the more they are subsidized the subsidy therefore magnifies the public funds allocated by tax credits on political contributions and by the pervote subsidies it also means that loans to political parties and their candidates can play a significant role in determining how much public money is received by the parties 7during the 2008 election the conservatives spent the most and as a result received the largest reimbursements under this public subsidy in 2009 7breakdown of paid election expenses by expense

federal parties in 2009cost of fundraising  editin order to solicit political monetary contributions fundraising is a major focus for many parties that involves hiring fundraising experts and employing sophisticated database systems email lists newsletters and telemarketing 8 13 22 23the conservative party for example is reported to make phone calls or send letters to about 200000 people a month and conducts surveys to collect and feed information on the views of individuals into its database referred to as cims an acronym for constituent information management system the information stored in the database is then used to customize mailings and phone calls for each targeted donor to appeal to them specifically on issues that they are known to react more strongly to 22 23other

joe volpe had received a total of 108000 in contributions from 20 individuals that were all in some way connected to the top corporate executives of apotex pharmaceuticals each of the 20 individuals  which included 11yearold twin boys and a 14yearold boy  gave exactly 5400 the maximum allowed at the time 5 25according to political financing expert louis massicotte a political scientist from université laval political systems that rely heavily on political contributions from individuals can encourage corruption in 20102011 it was discovered that corporations had been funnelling money to major provincial political parties by disguising the corporate funds as individual political contributions made by their employees circumventing the political fundraising laws former employees of one corporation flatly admitted that political contributions had illicitly been made in their name 26at the provincial level in quebec the farreaching influence of fundraisers over everything from the selection of judges to the distribution of construction contracts fuelled widespread demand for a public inquiry into political corruption and caused the jean charest liberal government and other major political parties to agree to increase the provincial pervote subsidy as a way to reduce the influence of party bagmen  influence peddling political fundraisers over government decisions and policies 26lack of transparency  editpolitical parties are only required to report the identities of contributors that have given a total of over 200 to one riding association or the central organization for donations of 200 or less receipts must be kept by the individual riding associations but elections canada has no way to keep track of them completely anonymous contributions of 20 or

john manley only disclosed the identities of individuals and corporations who contributed 10150 and 15800 respectively to his reelection campaign however he did not disclose where 74664  received through his riding association  had originally come from 5 30in july 2002 paul martin refused to reveal the names of donors to his leadership campaign claiming that new disclosure rules brought in a month earlier applied only to current cabinet and not to a former cabinet minister as he was and that he did not think it would be fair to name people who had donated to his campaign before the new disclosure rules were in effect 25in october 2002 stephen harper initially did not reveal the names of anyone who had donated to his leadership campaign while he later quietly posted a few names  those of 54 donors who had given more than 1075 each  he continued to keep secret the identities of 10 other large donors and the names of more than 9000 donors who each gave sums of less than 1000 each 25in 2009 an annual report by global integrity an independent nonprofit organization that tracks corruption trends around the world said that canada posted a slight downward tick based on secrecy surrounding political financing and gaps in government accountability 31according to global integrity canada is a really interesting case in that while it had a generally positive rating there are unique gaps in the system that are strange including the fact that political financing loans to candidates are confidential 31according to ottawabased democracy watch government integrity continues to be undermined by loopholes that allow secret donations to some candidates 31loopholes in contributions limits  editelections canada confirmed in 2007 that individuals could illegally contribute as much as 60500 over the 1100 limit and not be detected  simply by donating 200 to each of a partys 308 riding associations 27 28 29elections canada claimed that it currently cannot track donations of 200 or less because we do not get the receipts from the individual riding associations 28 under current regulations a partys individual riding associations are only required to report the identities of contributors with total contributions to the riding of over 200 contributions of 200 or less are allowed to be reported in aggregate with no breakdown by contributor required that would allow for proper crosschecking across a partys ridings associations 27 28 29at the time the ndp called for the loophole to be plugged the conservative government responded that this is no more a loophole than the fact that someone can break the law by fraudulently misstating their income on their income tax it rejected calls by the opposition for elections canada to be given new measures and tools to be able to detect multiple donations across a partys ridings that exceed the contribution limit 29debate over the subsidies  editthe conservative party has targeted the pervote subsidy for elimination while favouring the generous public subsidy of private political contributions all of the other major canadian parties  the liberals ndp bloc and green party  oppose the elimination of the pervote subsidy 3 6 12 13 32 33the conservative government first tried to eliminate the pervote subsidy in november 2008 just after the federal election of october 14 2008 he had not brought up the issue before canadian voters during the election campaign but on november 27  only days into his new mandate that began november 18  he attempted to eliminate the pervote subsidy through a provision tucked within a fiscal update  and designated the update as a confidence motion that would trigger the fall of the government and the prospect of another election unless passed 13 33 34 35 36 37 38the conservative governments move was seen by opposition members and other observers as a partisan attempt to bankrupt the other political parties and further increase his own partys financial advantage and as a direct attack on the democratic process 2 6 8 13 16 26 33 36 37 38the move and its packaging as a confidence motion prompted the liberals and the ndp to take steps toward forming a coalition government in the event the confidence motion was defeated suddenly faced with losing power harper sought the prorogation of canadas parliament 13 26 33 34 35 36 37 38canadas parliament was shut down from december 4 2008 to january 26 2009 allowing the conservative government to avoid the confidence vote that it would have lost and it backtracked on its attempt to eliminate the subsidy 36 37 38 39 40 41 42his reputation as a peerless political chessmaster is now somewhat in tatters following what most perceive as an atypical nearfatal miscalculation over a fall economic and fiscal statement that lacked economic credibility and proposed the elimination of per vote subsidies for political parties faced with an opposition revolt harper first unusually retreated on the latter proposal and then bought time by proroguing parliament on december 4 to avoid a loss of confidence vote on december 8 — january 2 2009 diplomatic cable from the u s embassy in ottawa 36in january 2011 however the conservative government again brought back its aim to eliminate the pervote subsidy over the opposition of all the other major parties while continuing to favour the generous public subsidy of political contributions prime minister harper stated there are already generous credits and incentives in the tax system to encourage people to give to political parties today he vowed that he would make the elimination of the pervote subsidy a campaign pledge in the next federal election 12green party leader elizabeth may spoke against the attempt to eliminate the pervote subsidy saying that doing so would once again concentrate influence in the hands of those with deeper pockets instead of giving voters a voice and she stated her belief that the 2004 campaign finance reforms that introduced the pervote subsidy are the one area weve gotten really right compared with the united states liberal deputy leader ralph goodale stated mr harper’s position is essentially let the big and the wealthy and the most privileged run the show and all the other voices should simply be silenced 12in spite of the clear opposition by the other parties in a campaign pledge in april 2011 stephen harper vowed to unilaterally eliminate the pervote subsidy if he wins a majority 32 34 he stated canadian political parties already have enormous tax advantages there are credits when you donate to political parties there are rebates when political parties do spending 16bloc québécois leader gilles duceppe accused harper of seeking to cripple all other parties stating its runs against democracy parties trying to break through like the greens would have practically no means that guy would be happy with no opposition and no parliament 43do we want to go back to the days where money and those who can finance campaigns determine the nature of our democracy — ndp leader jack layton april 2011 32other observers  including canadas former chief electoral officer jeanpierre kingsley  have suggested that the subsidy of political contributions and subsidy of election expenses should also be examined since both  to a far greater extent  have the effect of forcing taxpayers to fund parties they do not personally support 5 6 8 34 44level of participation in determining funding  editin 2009 a national total of 181858 individuals out of 23677639 registered voters in 2008 made political contributions to a federal political party organization resulting in a 077 fraction of registered voters directing over 33 million in subsidized contributions  almost twothirds of it publicly funded  toward their preferred parties over 55 of these individuals were conservative party supporters 10a national total of 96762 individuals also made political contributions at the riding association level to a federal political party resulting in a 04 fraction of registered voters directing over 12 million in subsidized contributions  over 60 of it from public funds  toward their preferred parties 10combined the number of unique individuals that made political contributions in 2009 to a federal political party either at the national party organization level or riding level or both is somewhere between 196186 and 278620 individuals  representing between just 08 and 12 of the number of registered voters from 2008 10rounding to the nearest percentage only 1 of registered voters directed 46 million  representing over 62 of the primary funding received by parties  toward their preferred party with nearly twothirds of that  28531 million  in public funds directed without the consent of 99

citizens over the age of 18 that voted in the preceding federal election and numbered 13675146 canadians in 2009 with political contributions the participants  numbering only a nationwide total of between 196186 and 278620 unique individuals in 2009 and representing less than 12 of the number of registered voters  tend to be individuals that have more disposable income the poor by and large do not make political contributions and according to university of calgary political finance expert lisa young people that have more comfortable means and that can expect to obtain a larger tax credit against their income are more likely to make political contributions 4 13 32according to mc master university political scientist henry jacek political contributions tend to come from the wealthy and not the poor it is also clear from other jurisdictions in the world that political donors typically are people that have more disposable income 13 32while political contributions can only be made by canadian citizens there is no age restriction in place which allows political contributions to be made in the name of children to bypass contribution limits in 2006 liberal leadership candidate joe volpe returned 27000 in political contributions that had been made in the name of children  after it was revealed that his campaign donors included 11yearold twin boys and a 14yearold boy who donated 5400 each the allowed maximum the children and several other donors that had contributed the maximum allowable 5400 each  for a total of 108000  were all in some way connected to the top corporate executives of one pharmaceutical company no law was broken 5 25magnification of the choices of contributors  editwhile only a tiny fraction of registered voters make political contributions their net contributions get magnified several times over by the public subsidy of political contributions and the public subsidy of election expenses 7 10over half of all the public funding for federal parties in 2009 was effectively directed by less than 12 of the number of registered voters in canada without participation by 99 of registered voters 7 10overall the subsidy of political contributions resulted in 642 of all of the funding in 2009 being directed according to the partisan preferences of less than 12 of registered voters 7 10consequences of eliminating the pervote subsidy  editelimination of the pervote subsidy with all other things remaining equal would mean that a very small number of individuals  somewhere between 08 and 12 of registered voters in 2009  would control and direct 100 of all the funding to their preferred political parties and candidates 10by the same token approximately 9899 of all registered voters would no longer have any participation in how any of the funding is directed  including having no say at all in how any of the taxpayer money involved gets allocated 10 16in april 2011 canadas former chief electoral officer jeanpierre kingsley who served in the position for 17 years stated that if the pervote subsidy were to be eliminated there would be an increased risk of canadas political parties turning back toward corporations to obtain money also to the detriment of canadian democracy 5parties will have to find ways of getting money and there may well be pressure to come back to funding from corporate sources—the very things weve attempted to eliminate and have successfully eliminated which would bring us back to a regime where donations not by individuals but through other interests political parties would be beholden to other than normal canadians — former chief electoral officer jeanpierre kingsley april 6 2011 5the elimination of the pervote subsidy could also have the effect of further reducing an already low voter turnout by removing an incentive that encourages many canadian citizens to vote under the firstpastthepost system the pervote subsidy ensures that a voters participation at the ballot box will at least still make a difference even if their preferred riding candidate has very little chance of winning or is assured of a win 3announced elimination of the pervote subsidy  editon may 25 2011 just three weeks after the election that gave them majority power the conservatives announced that their june 6 federal budget would include the elimination of the pervote subsidy 37 38 45 46ndp leader jack layton voiced his opposition to the plan saying that its wrong and opens the door for big money to come back into politics and he worried about the impact this will have on democracy in canada 37 45 47the conservative governments move was seen by many as motivated by a desire to destroy the liberal party and cripple all other parties not by concern over taxpayer dollars according to university of ottawa professor errol mendes you can see whats happening here theyre moving toward a process of eventually cutting the feet out from all the major opposition parties 17 47 48 49 50interim liberal leader bob rae stated i can’t think of anything more wrong than a spirit of vindictiveness at the heart of a majority government he said the liberals would oppose the plan and stated the notion that there’s public support for the political process and political parties is widely accepted in a great many democratic countries around the world 17 47 48 49it is a meanspirited attempt by the harper government to limit the resources of other parties and to create a situation where the wealthiest will have the most influence the simple and very inexpensive pervote subsidy is a very fair way to ensure that parties would be funded based on their popular support allowing them the resources to represent those that support their respective views — glen hodgson green party may 2011 17according to political scientist ned franks of queens university the elimination of the pervote subsidy will mean that political parties with a rich support base will now be far better off than parties whose supporters are poorer or who are not the type to make political donations he stated that the move greatly favours the conservative party theres only one party who benefits and — surprise surprise — its the conservatives layton stated the move was antidemocratic since it would benefit parties with access to rich people and handicap parties with a lowerincome voting base i think that our democracy is better served if ideas have equal opportunity in the competition for canadians consideration and thats what public financing is designed to do take away public financing and what youre basically saying is those with the best ability to raise money get to have their ideas heard and i dont think thats helpful for a democratic society 45 51— ndp mp jack harris may 25 2011 17see
