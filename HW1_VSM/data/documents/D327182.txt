inhabited for more than 12000 years by kumeyaay also called diegueno and ipaitipai luiseño cupeño and cahuilla indians and their local predecessors 12in 1542 the explorer juan rodríguez cabrillo who may have been born in portugal but sailed on behalf of spain claimed san diego bay for the spanish empire and he named the site san miguel 13 in november 1602 sebastián vizcaíno surveyed the harbor and what are now mission bay and point loma and named the area for saint didacus a spaniard more commonly known as san diego 14 european settlement in what is now san diego county began with the founding of the san diego presidio and mission san diego de alcalá by spanish soldiers and clerics in 1769 15 this county was part of alta california under the viceroyalty of new spain until the mexican declaration of independence from 1821 through 1848 this area was part of mexico san diego county became part of the united states as a result of the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo in 1848 ending the mexican–american war this treaty designated the new border as terminating at a point on the pacific ocean coast which would result in the border passing one spanish league south of the southernmost portion of san diego bay thus ensuring that the united states received all of this natural harbor san diego county was one of the original counties of california created at the time of california statehood in 1850 16 221at the time of its establishment in 1850 san diego county was relatively large and included all of southernmost california south and east of los angeles county it included areas of what are now inyo and san bernardino counties as well as all of what are now riverside and imperial counties 16 221during the later part of the 19th century there were numerous changes in the boundaries of san diego county when various areas were separated to make up the counties mentioned above the most recent changes were the establishments of riverside county in 1893 16 207 and imperial county in 1907 16 113 imperial county was also the last county to be established in california and after this division san diego no longer extended from the pacific ocean to the

than the combined states of rhode island and delaware 18san diego county has a varied topography on its western side is more than 70 miles 110 km of coastline 19 most of san diego between the coast and the laguna mountains consists of hills mesas and small canyons snowcapped in winter mountains rise to the east with the sonoran desert farther to the east cleveland national forest is spread across the central portion of the county while the anzaborrego desert state park occupies most of the northeast although the countys western third is primarily urban the mountains and deserts in the

climate classification system the urban and suburban san diego area straddles areas of mediterranean climate csa to the north and semiarid climate bsh to the south and east 21 as a result it is often described as arid mediterranean and semiarid steppe farther east arid desert conditions prevail western san diegos climate is characterized by warm dry summers and mild winters with most of the annual precipitation falling between november and march the city has mild mostly dry weather with an average of 201 days above 70 °f 21 °c and low rainfall 9–13 inches 23–33 cm annually summer temperatures are generally warm with average highs of 70–78 °f 21–26 °c and lows of 55–66 °f 13–19 °c temperatures exceed 90 °f 32 °c only four days a year most rainfall occurs from november to april winter temperatures are mild with average high temperatures of 66–70 °f 19–21 °c and lows of 50–56 °f 10–13 °c the climate in the san diego area like much of california often varies significantly over short geographical distances resulting in microclimates in san diegos case this is mainly due to the citys topography the bay and the numerous hills mountains and canyons frequently particularly during the may gray june gloom  period a thick marine layer will keep the air cool and damp within a few miles of the coast but will yield to bright cloudless sunshine approximately 5–10 miles 80–161 km inland this happens every year in may and june 22 even in the absence of june gloom inland areas tend to experience much more significant temperature variations than coastal areas where the ocean serves as a moderating influence thus for example downtown san diego averages january lows of 48 °f 9 °c and august highs of 77 °f 25 °c 23 the city of el cajon just 10 miles 16 km northeast of downtown san diego

the cooler months of december through april though there are few wet days per month during the rainy period rainfall can be heavy when it does occur however the rainfall is greater in the higher elevations of san diego some of the higher areas of san diego such as palomar mountain and the laguna mountains receive 20–40 inches 51–102 cm of rain per year supporting lush forests similar to the sierra nevada and california coast range the colorado desert portion of the county lies to the east of the mountains which receives the least amount of precipitation borrego springs the largest

supervisor can serve an additional two terms before being termed out 55 that pattern was broken in 2013 when slaterprice retired she was replaced by democrat dave roberts who won election to the seat
