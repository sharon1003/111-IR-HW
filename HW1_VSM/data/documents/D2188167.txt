bradycardia in children author frank zimmerman md section editor john k triedman md deputy editor carrie armsby md mphintroductionbradycardia is defined as a heart rate below the normal range for age  table 1  bradycardia is caused by intrinsic dysfunction or injury to the hearts conduction system or by extrinsic factors acting on a normal heart and its conduction system children who have bradycardia with poor perfusion or shock need immediate medical attention  algorithm 1  in patients with nonlifethreatening symptoms the management is dependent upon the severity of symptoms the specific conduction defect and whether there is underlying congenital heart disease chd the causes evaluation diagnosis management and outcome of bradycardia in children will be discussed here other forms of irregular heart rate in children and principles of pediatric advanced life support are discussed separately see irregular heart rate arrhythmias in children and pediatric advanced life support pals  definitionthe normal range for heart rate varies with age  table 1  1  younger patients have higher heart rates that decrease to adult values by the late teenage years the threshold used to define bradycardia varies somewhat based upon the criteria used for the purpose of this topic review we consider bradycardia to be defined as a heart rate measured in the awake state that is below the normal range for age  table 1  alternate definitions are as follows to continue reading this article you must log in with your personal hospital or group practice subscription subscribe log in
