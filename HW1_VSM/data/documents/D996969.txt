asinterface actuator sensor interface asi is an industrial networking solution physical layer data access method and protocol used in plc dcs and pcbased automation systems it is designed for connecting simple field io devices eg binary onoff devices such as actuators sensors rotary encoders analog inputs and outputs push buttons and valve position sensors in discrete manufacturing and process applications using a single 2conductor cable asinterface is an open technology supported by a multitude of automation equipment vendors according to asinternational association there are currently 2013 over 24 million asinterface field devices installed globally growing at about 2 million per year 1asinterface is a networking alternative to the hard wiring of field devices it can be used as a partner network for higher level fieldbus networks such as profibus device net interbus and industrial ethernet for whom it offers a lowcost remote io solution it is used in automation applications including conveyor control packaging machines eg schuberts process control valves bottling plants electrical distribution systems airport baggage carousels elevators bottling lines and food production lines eg 2sfg asinterface provides a basis for functional safety in machinery safetyemergency stop applications safety devices communicating over asinterface follow all the normal asinterface data rules the required level of data verification is provided by dynamic changes in the data this technology is called safety at work and allows safety devices and standard nonsafe devices to be connected to the same network using appropriate safe input hardware eg light curtains estop buttons and door interlock switches asinterface can provide safety support up to sil safety integrity level 3 according to en 62061 cat 4 according to en9541 as well as performance level e pl e according to en iso 138491 the asinterface specification is managed by asinternational a member

higher level industrial network or a plc backplane carda number of network slaves in most cases input and output modulesexactly one power supply used to power the network slaves and enabling communication with the network master and the wiring infrastructure in most case accomplished using the yellow flat cable using these components an asinterface segment can be constructed the underlying communication procedure is a masterslave method by which the master initiates data exchange with a slave and requires the slave to respond within its defined maximum time making asinterface a deterministic networking solution conformance testing by an independent certification lab assures that certified products from all manufacturers will communicate on a given network suppliers wishing to have their products conformance tested must contact asinternational asinterface data exchanges are based on a mastercall where the data frame consists of a 5bit device addresses 4bit data packets eg digital output information and framing bits the total length of the mastercall is 14 bit the resulting slaveresponse is 7 bit long containing 4 bit of user information eg the values of slaves inputs voltage levels on the network range between 295  316 v dc and data protection in addition to the framing bits is accomplished via manchesterii coding a highly symmetrical floating layout with alternating pulse modulation the networks bit time is 6 µs segment length is limited to 100 meters 2 multiple segments can be combined to form longer networks in this case it is necessary to assure that every slave is only two repeaters away from the network master this is required due to the time delay introduced when a message packet transitions the repeater under certain conditions a socalled terminator andor tuner can be used to extend the allowable segment length to 200 m or 300 m respectively history  editasinterface was developed during the late 1980s and early 1990s by a group consortium of 11 companies mostly known for their offering of industrial noncontact sensing devices like inductive sensors photoelectric sensors capacitive sensors and ultrasonic sensors once development was completed the consortium was resolved and a member organization asinternational was founded the first operational system was shown at the 1994 hanover fair  hannover messe  original specification 1994 version 204  editin its original form the network was capable of supporting up to 31 binary io devicesmodules where each device could exchange 4 bit of input and 4 bit of output data resulting in a total of 124 inputs and 124 outputs on a single network important features like automatic single node replacement were already part of the system the network update time is easily calculated by multiplying the number io nodes with the deterministic update time for each node approximately 150 µs for a maximum update time of 5 ms this simplified calculation does not include the management phase which is negligible for typical installations it also does not include any communication retries enhancements 1998 version 211  editfollowing its introduction users quickly adopted asinterface driving the demand for additional functionality and features as a consequence these demands were addressed with certain specification enhancements allowing the creation of analog inputoutput devices and increasing the number of possible binary io devices to 62 diagnostics functionality was also enhanced by the creation of the peripheral fault bit in order to retain full forward and backward compatibility the size of the data frame exchanged between the network master  scanners and gateways was not increased instead one of the four output bits was used to select between the socalled a and b nodes this enabled each of the 31 addresses to be used twice the address space was increased to 1a to 31a plus 1b to 31b as a consequence of using an output bit as the ab selector the fourth output bit was not available to the user and binary io nodes built to this profile offered a maximum of 4 inputs and 3 outputs increasing the total amount of io on a single network to 248 inputs and 186 outputs the maximum update time of a fully loaded network is 10 ms additional capabilities 20052007 version 30  editby 2005 it became necessary to address additional user requirements also the increased usage of ethernetbased industrial protocols called for a low level solution that overcame the inherent shortcomings of ethernet eg restricted topology large data frame costly usage of switches  this specification addressed the users requirements by defining new communication profiles for binary and analog data plus the introduction of a serial data transmission profile the following is an incomplete list of the new capabilities binary io nodes supporting ab addressing with 4 inputs and 4 outputs binary io nodes supporting ab addressing with 8 inputs and 8 outputs configurable 8 12 or 16 bit fast analog channel full duplex bit serial data channel with these new capabilities asinterface becomes the ideal partner network for any of the currently available ethernetbased industrial protocols gateways to ether netip tm profinet modbustcp sercos iii and others are available some controls experts have voiced the opinion that within the next 10 years networking solutions positioned between asinterface and ethernet will not be used in any new installation  citation needed in a worstcase scenario using 62 nodes with 4 inputs and 4 outputs each the update time is 10 ms for the inputs and 20 ms for the outputs components  editan asinterface network requires only a few basic components falling into the following general categories scanners  gateways also called masterspower supplies and repeaters modules also called slavesnetwork cable installation hardware and useful tool infrastructurescanners and gateways  editthe scannergateway performs two functions with respect to the asinterface network it is a master performing the data exchange with the modules and updating its internal io image the functionality of the master is defined in the master profile of the asinterface specification as part of specification version 30 the m4 master profile has been defined any given network can only have one scannergateway with respect to a connected plcdcs or pc the scannergateway is a slave the asinterface community typically uses the word gateway when the asinterface master connects to an upperlevel network like device net profibus or any of the industrial ethernet flavors on the other hand if it resides on the backplane of a plc it is usually referred to as a scanner since asinterface communication is based on the masterslave communication method any network must have only one master at a time power supply  editany asinterface segment must be powered this is typically accomplished connecting an asinterface power supply these supplies have certain unique characteristics regarding internal circuitry and output voltage standard 24 v dc power supplies cannot be used to directly power a segment 315 v dc must be used instead the total length asinterface network cable in a single segment must be no more than 100 m if the total network length must be longer repeaters can be used as the repeater galvanically isolates any two segments a new power supply must be used on the far side of the repeater a common misconception exists concerning the number of repeaters in a network it has been stated that the maximum length of an asinterface network can be 300 m created by using two repeaters this is not the case what matters is not how many repeaters are using but rather how many repeaters any data packet originating at a scanner or gateway has to cross before reaching the io node due to the tight timing constraints defined each packet can at most travel across two repeaters before reaching an asinterface node this has the following consequences linear networks with the scannergateway mounted at one end can be 300 m long linear network with 500 m length can be constructed when the scannergateway is mounted in the middle segment star shaped networks with virtually no length limitation are possible modules  editthis is by far the largest group of components and includes binary and analog io modules stack lights push buttons sensors with integrated asic valve control boxes estops light curtains in general any device that can exchange data with the plc each module on the network must have a unique address for asinterface the address space ranges from 0 to 31 where 0 cannot be used but is reserved for automatic single node replacement since adoption of specification 211 this address space is further divided into a and b extended addresses as a result using a module designed to support this addressing mode it is possible to have two modules at each address one at the a half and one at the b half ex 1a and 1b 17a and 17b the current specification version 30 has added the ability to construct many new types of io combinations including binary modules with 4 inputs and 4 outputs supporting ab addressing network cable  editthe vast majority of asinterface installations utilize the asinterface flat cable defined as part of the asinterface specifications a relatively small number of industries eg valve control in process automation use a round cable mostly because it is easier to pull through conduit while the shape of the cable does not matter any other cable can be used the electrical characteristics of the selected cable matters greatly to prevent problems due to improper cable most professionals suggest the asinterface flat cable this cable is designed to make use of a cable piercing technology when an asinterface module is installed on the network piercing needles penetrate the cable jacket and displace the internal copper strands without cutting them this allows asinterface modules to be installed anywhere on the network without cutting and preparing ie removing cable jacket stripping insulation and possibly applying a ferule the cable first the result is a faster installation without the chance of inadvertent shorts between the leads here is a flat cable drawing there are several types of cables available yellow cable is usually used to power asinterface modules and enable communication between the field devices and the scanner or gateway this cable is offered in several jacket materials to address specific applications needs the asinterface black cable is typically used to supply modules with 24 v dc aux power no communication takes place on this cable similar to the yellow cable the black cable is also produced using various jacket material to address the specific needs of the application a redjacketed cable has been defined but is virtually unused its intended use was in applications where ac power is supplied to the field nodes the two leads inside the asinterface cable are brown  lead and blue − lead independent of material makeup and outer jacket color designing a network  editan asinterface network is a collection of network segments there are very few rules that need to be satisfied when designing an asinterface network there can be no duplicate addresses on a network each segment must be 100 m or less in total cable length unless a tuner is used in which case the segment cable length must not exceed 200 m each network must power exactly one master each segment must power exactly one asinterface power supply when repeaters are used a slave can not be more than two repeater transitions from the master the shape ie topology of a segment is arbitrary unrestrictedusing these basic rules it should be clear that a linear network with the master at one end of the network can be 300 m long a linear network with the master in the middle of the network can be 500 m long in some applications longer networks are desirable eg process automation applications this is possible through the installation of terminator and tuners terminator and tuner  editterminators are fixed value devices that must be added at the physical end of a network and are designed to reduce signal reflections in most cases terminators will only work reliably if the segment is essentially linear this is a significant limitation as most asinterface networks make extensive use of the fact that any arbitrary network topology can be used a tuner is used in much the same way as a terminator again segments have to be linear but differs in its electrical characteristic a tuner must after connecting it to the segment be activated or tuned during this process the tuner actively varies the values of it internal termination components and determines the optimal settings for the segment ie those that minimize the number of network errors even though this optimization process is the strength of the tuner and the sole reason for its ability to allow even longer networks it is also its greatest disadvantage while a terminator allows the addition or subtraction of modules without additional work a tuner must be retuned whenever the network is changed ie removingadding modules and addingremoving network cable when using terminators and tuners in conjunction with repeaters the signal propagation time along the wire and across repeaters must be considered higher speed repeaters have been developed to address this issue other components  editpassive taps flattoround cable adapters handheld addressing tools and many other accessories are designed to further assist in the installation of asinterface networks references  edit binder kai 20121109 einfach – sicher  international sps magazin
