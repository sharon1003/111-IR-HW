have no difference in meaning but nope is more informal only used in a sense of opposite to yes or yup  also nope is not used often in writing you wouldnt say there were nope errors for exampleshare improve this answeredited apr 13 17 at 1238community ♦1answered jan 23 13 at 2122renan3397 15 3116i would note that nope is very informal it is almost never written  just spoken – j t grimes jan 23 13 at 21286youve added another point in your answer  nope cant be used as a modifier only as an independent statement – barbara beeton jan 26 13 at 13356im not convinced nope is more emphatic in fact i could easily convince myself there are contexts where its less emphatic the most defining characteristic of nope is that it tends to be used to convey a relaxed attitude in an informal setting such as an argument in a pub for example if some big aggressive guy asks you if you want a punch in the mouth you say no  not nope using the latter would probably get you beaten up simply because it would sound as if you were making light of the situation – fumble fingers jan 27 13 at 22342nope is more of an opposite to yep or yup since they are both in the same register – robusto jan 31 13 at 1451ill reverse my downvote now youve removed the less emphatic stuff which of course was the main reason i posted an answer in the first place so most of that might as well be removed now as well but im going to keep my answer because youve missed a subtle point you linked to j rs answer on elu but notice his  you might use it to answer a yesorno question implying other ways you might but john lawler the other answer echoes it as occurs only as a oneword answer to yn definitely no other possibilities there – fumble fingers feb 1 13 at 313show 2 more commentsup vote22down vote the first and most important point to note it that its very informal more so than using contractions such as my its there for example the main reason for using it at all stems from that extreme informality it normally conveys a relaxed attitude on the part of the speaker depending on context it can be more or less emphatic than no you only use nope to mean my answer is no – it never replaces no in any other contexts and you wouldnt normally use it where you want to be very emphatic shouting no at the top of your voice which example illustrates a defining characteristic – nope isnt often followed by an exclamation markfinally id echo john lawlers words nope occurs only as a oneword answer to yn questions thats to say a written form such asnope i dont want todoesnt look right we expect a full stop or at the very least a comma after nope because in realworld speech there always would be a pause there but that doesnt happen withno i dont want to because its perfectly possible to speak those words without pausing appreciably after no without necessarily placing extra stress on dont either i just italicised it as one possible enunciationshare improve this answeredited apr 13 17 at 1238community ♦1answered jan 27 13 at 2257fumble fingers39k 1 41 1013i think it is not so much emphatic as terminal or dismissive its not actually a distinct word its just no pronounced with a conclusive closing of the mouth which produces an effect like an unaspirated p its a gesture no and thats all i have to say – stoney b feb 24 13 at 2151stoney b well it seems to me that a terminaldismissive negative response is effectively the same thing as an emphatic one its a moot point whether no and nope are the same word given that op is asking what differences might exist between them and apart from the informality i think its significant youd rarely if ever shout nope at the top of your voice as a oneword rejection – fumble fingers feb 24 13 at 22001i agree that you dont shout nope  shouting is a challenge nope always has so to speak a period at the end your interlocutor may take offense at the dismissal you may even intend him to do so but you are affecting a posture of disinclination to pursue the matter further or as you say youre making light of the situation – stoney b feb 24 13 at 2228i disagree no i dont want to requires a comma after no just as much as nope i dont want to requires it after nope omitting the comma would be informal at best in either case – kyralessa jan 9 at 1106kyralessa im not really interested in orthographic conventions  im talking about language here which is essentially spoken perhaps i should have given my example as no i dont since that would still illustrate my substantive point that nope i dont is nonidiomatic without getting bogged down in how acceptable it is to omit that comma in the written form – fumble fingers jan 9 at 1436show 1 more commentup vote8down votenope is informal you wouldnt usually want to use it for example

14 21add a commentup vote4down vote in my opinion nope is a dismissive and slightly rude version of no nope should never be used in a professional context eg it should never be used as an option for web site or search engine users to select as a response to a question because it makes the company using it look unprofessional and rude to their customers the use of the word nope by google and others makes me cringe so much that i will never click on it in response to a questionshare improve this answeranswered sep 9 14 at 912richard bell49 1by being less professional they probably intended to come across as friendly rather than rude – dan getz may 28 15 at 1519add a commentup vote3down vote nope is used informally normally during chat where you want to give a quick fluid answer to a question without halting it like no would they both mean the same thing and nope is very rarely writtenshare improve this answeranswered jan 23 13 at 2130liam w836 5 17add a commentup vote2down vote i think theres another nuance in meaning beyond the informal vs formal for instance you dont think im pretty if someone responds no it is because he is disagreeing with the statement  he actually does think the speaker is pretty if someone responds nope it is because he agrees with the implication  he really does not think the speaker is pretty its a subtle difference but one to noteshare improve

at 1837add a commentup vote2down vote i think the context has a lot to do with how the word nope is perceived somebody asks you for something will you do something for me  nope  rude somebody asks for information is your name sam  nope  playful  informal maybe the word nope implies a casual relaxed attitude which in some cases may come off as dismissiveshare improve this answeredited feb 22 at
