body 10 when this process begins there may be no or only vague symptoms 1 symptoms become more noticeable as the cancer progresses 1 11 these symptoms may include bloating pelvic pain abdominal swelling and loss of appetite among others 1 common areas to which the cancer may spread include the lining of the abdomen lymph nodes lungs and liver 12the risk of ovarian cancer increases in women who have ovulated more over their lifetime this includes those who have never had children those who begin ovulation at a younger age and those who reach menopause at an older age 3 other risk factors include hormone therapy after menopause fertility medication and obesity 4 5 factors that decrease risk include hormonal birth control tubal ligation and breast feeding 5 about 10 of cases are related to inherited genetic risk women with mutations in the genes brca1 or brca2 have about a 50 chance of developing the disease 3 the most common type of ovarian cancer comprising more than 95 of cases is ovarian carcinoma 3 there are five main subtypes of ovarian carcinoma of which highgrade serous carcinoma is the most common 3 these tumors are believed to start in the cells covering the ovaries 3 though some may form at the fallopian tubes 13 less common types of ovarian cancer include germ cell tumors and sex cord stromal tumors 3 a diagnosis of ovarian cancer is confirmed through a biopsy of tissue usually removed during surgery 1screening is not recommended in women who are at average risk as evidence does not support a reduction in death and the high rate of false positive tests may lead to unneeded surgery which is accompanied by its own risks 14 those at very high risk may have their ovaries removed as a preventive measure 4 if caught and treated in an early stage ovarian cancer is often curable 1 treatment usually includes some combination of surgery radiation therapy and chemotherapy 1 outcomes depend on the extent of the disease the subtype of cancer present and other medical conditions 15 3 the overall fiveyear survival rate in the united states is 45 6 outcomes are worse in the developing world 3in 2012 new cases occurred in 239000 women 3 in 2015 it was present in 12 million women and resulted in 161100 deaths worldwide 8 7 among women it is the seventhmost common cancer and the eighthmost common cause of death from cancer 3 the typical age of

absent or subtle in most cases symptoms exist for several months before being recognized and diagnosed 16 17 symptoms can be misdiagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome 18 the early stages of ovarian cancer tend to be painless symptoms can vary based on the subtype 16 low malignant potential lmp tumors also known as borderline tumors do not cause an increase in ca125 levels and are not identifiable with an ultrasound the typical symptoms of an lmp tumor can include abdominal distension or pelvic pain particularly large masses tend to be benign or borderline 19 16the most typical symptoms of ovarian cancer include bloating abdominal or pelvic pain or discomfort back pain irregular menstruation or postmenopausal vaginal bleeding pain or bleeding after or during sexual intercourse loss of appetite fatigue diarrhea indigestion heartburn constipation nausea feeling full and possibly urinary symptoms including frequent urination and urgent urination  17later symptoms  editthe growing mass may cause pain if ovarian torsion develops symptoms can be caused by a mass pressing on the other abdominopelvic organs or from metastases 16 20 21 if these symptoms start to occur more often or more severely than usual especially after no significant history of such symptoms ovarian cancer is considered 16 19 metastases may cause a sister mary joseph nodule 21 rarely teratomas can cause growing teratoma syndrome or peritoneal gliomatosis 21 some experience menometrorrhagia and abnormal vaginal bleeding after menopause in most cases other common symptoms include hirsutism abdominal pain virilization and an adnexal mass 22children  editin adolescents or children with ovarian tumors symptoms can include severe abdominal pain irritation of the peritoneum or bleeding 23 symptoms of sex cordstromal tumors produce hormone s that can affect the development of secondary sex characteristics sex cordstromal tumors in prepubertal children may be manifested by early puberty abdominal pain and distension are also common adolescents with sex cordstromal tumors may experience amenorrhea as the cancer becomes more advanced it can cause an accumulation of fluid in the abdomen if the malignancy has not been diagnosed by the time it causes ascites it is typically diagnosed shortly thereafter 16 advanced cancers can also cause abdominal masses lymph node masses or pleural effusion 21risk factors  editovarian cancer is related to the amount of time spent ovulating thus not having children is a risk factor for ovarian cancer likely because ovulation is suppressed via pregnancy during ovulation cells are constantly stimulated to divide while ovulatory cycles continue therefore people who have not borne children are at twice the risk of ovarian cancer than those who have a longer period of ovulation caused by early first menstruation and late menopause is also a risk factor 19 24 25 both obesity and hormone replacement therapy also raise the risk 16the risk of developing ovarian cancer is less for women who have fewer menstrual cycles no menstrual cycles breast feeding take oral contraceptives have multiple pregnancies and have a pregnancy at an early age the risk of developing ovarian cancer is reduced in women who have had tubal ligation colloquially known as having ones tubes tied both ovaries removed or hysterectomy an operation in which the uterus and sometimes the cervix is removed 17 age is also a risk factor 16 15hormones  edituse of fertility medication may contribute to borderline ovarian tumor formation but the link between the two is disputed and difficult to study 18 fertility drugs may be associated with a higher risk of borderline tumors 21 those who have been treated for infertility but remain nulliparous are at higher risk for epithelial ovarian cancer however those who are successfully treated for infertility and subsequently give birth are at no higher risk this may be due to shedding of precancerous cells during pregnancy but the cause remains unclear 19 the risk factor may instead be infertility itself not the treatment 24hormonal conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome and endometriosis are associated with ovarian cancer but the link is not completely confirmed 18 postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy hrt with estrogen likely increases the risk of ovarian cancer the association has not been confirmed in a largescale study 19 26 but notable studies including the million women study have supported this link postmenopausal hrt with combined estrogen and progesterone may increase contemporaneous risk if used for over 5 years but this risk returns to normal after cessation of therapy 24 estrogen hrt with or without progestins increases the risk of endometrioid and serous tumors but lowers the risk of mucinous tumors higher doses of estrogen increase this risk 21 endometriosis is another risk factor for ovarian cancer 24 as is pain with menstruation endometriosis is associated with clearcell and endometrioid subtypes lowgrade serous tumors stage i and ii tumors grade 1 tumors and lower mortality 21before menopause obesity can increase a persons risk of ovarian cancer but this risk is not present after menopause this risk is also relevant in those who are both obese and have never used hrt a similar association with ovarian cancer appears in taller people 24genetics  editfurther information hereditary breastâ€“ovarian cancer syndrome people with ovarian or breast cancer in a pedigree chart of a family a family history of ovarian cancer is a risk factor for ovarian cancer people with hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer lynch syndrome and those with brca1 and brca2 genetic abnormalities are at increased risk the major genetic risk factor for ovarian cancer is a mutation in brca1 or brca2 dna mismatch repair genes which is present in 10 of ovarian cancer cases only one allele need be mutated to place a person at high risk the gene can be inherited through either the maternal or paternal line but has variable penetrance 16 19 though mutations in these genes are usually associated with increased risk of breast cancer they also carry a substantial lifetime risk of ovarian cancer a risk that peaks in a persons 40s and 50s the lowest risk cited is 30 and the highest 60 18 16 19 mutations in brca1 have a lifetime risk of developing ovarian cancer of 15â€“45 21 mutations in brca2 are less risky than those with brca1 with a lifetime risk of 10 lowest risk cited to 40 highest risk cited 16 21 on average brcaassociated cancers develop 15 years before their sporadic counterparts because people who inherit the mutations on one copy of their gene only need one mutation to start the process of carcinogenesis whereas people with two normal genes would need to acquire two mutations 19in the united states five of 100 women with a firstdegree relative with ovarian cancer will eventually get ovarian cancer themselves placing those with affected family members at triple the risk of women with unaffected family members seven of 100 women with two or more relatives with ovarian cancer will eventually get ovarian cancer 19 27 in general 5â€“10 of ovarian cancer cases have a genetic cause 19 brca mutations are associated with highgrade serous nonmucinous epithelial ovarian cancer 21a strong family history of endometrial cancer colon cancer or other gastrointestinal cancers may indicate the presence of a syndrome known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer also known as lynch syndrome which confers a higher risk for developing a number of cancers including ovarian cancer lynch syndrome is caused by mutations in mismatch repair genes including msh2 mlh1 mlh6 pms1 and pms2 16 the risk of ovarian cancer for an individual with lynch syndrome is between 10 and 12 percent 16 19 people of icelandic descent european jewish descent  ashkenazi jewish descent and hungarian descent are at higher risk for epithelial ovarian cancer 19 estrogen receptor beta gene  esr2 seems to be a key to pathogenesis and response to therapy 28 other genes that have been associated with ovarian cancer are brip1 msh6 rad51c and rad51d 29 cdh1 chek2 palb2 and rad50 have also been associated with ovarian cancer 30several rare genetic disorders are associated with specific subtypes of ovarian cancer peutzâ€“jeghers syndrome a rare genetic disorder also predisposes people to sex cord tumour with annular tubules 18 16 ollier disease and maffucci syndrome are associated with granulosa cell tumors in children and may also be associated with sertolileydig tumors benign fibromas are associated with nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome 16environmental factors  editindustrialized nations with the exception of japan have high rates of epithelial ovarian cancer which may be due to diet in those countries caucasian are at a 30â€“40 higher risk for ovarian cancer when compared to black and hispanic people likely due to socioeconomic factors white women tend to have fewer children and different rates of gynecologic surgeries that affect risk for ovarian cancer 19cohort studies have found a correlation between dairy consumption and ovarian cancer but casecontrol studies do not show this correlation there is mixed evidence regarding the effect of red meat and processed meat in ovarian cancer 21tentative evidence suggests that talc pesticides and herbicides increase the risk of ovarian cancer 31 the american cancer society notes that as of now no study has been able to accurately link any single chemical in the environment or in the human diet directly to mutations that cause ovarian cancer 32other  editalcohol consumption does not appear to be related to ovarian cancer 21 33 other factors that have been investigated such as smoking low levels of vitamin d in the blood 34 presence of inclusion ovarian cysts and infection with human papilloma virus the cause of some cases of cervical cancer  have been disproven as risk factors for ovarian cancer 18 21 the carcinogenicity of perineal talc is controversial because it can act as an irritant if it travels through the reproductive tract to the ovaries 21 19 24 casecontrol studies have shown that use of perineal talc does increase the risk of ovarian cancer but using talc more often does not create a greater risk 21 use of talc elsewhere on the body is unrelated to ovarian cancer 24sitting regularly for prolonged periods is associated with higher mortality from epithelial ovarian cancer the risk is not negated by regular exercise though it is lowered 35increased age up to the 70s is a risk factor for epithelial ovarian cancer because more mutations in cells can accumulate and eventually cause cancer those over 80 are at slightly lower risk 19smoking tobacco is associated with a higher risk of mucinous ovarian cancer after smoking cessation the risk eventually returns to normal a diet high in animal fats may be associated with ovarian cancer but the connection is unclear diet seems to play a very small role if any in ovarian cancer risk 24 higher levels of creactive protein are associated with a higher risk of developing ovarian cancer 21protective factors  editsuppression of ovulation which would otherwise cause damage to the ovarian epithelium and consequently inflammation is generally protective this effect can be achieved by having children taking combined oral contraceptives and breast feeding all of which are protective factors 16 a longer period of breastfeeding correlates with a larger decrease in the risk of ovarian cancer 24 each birth decreases risk of ovarian cancer more and this effect is seen with up to five births combined oral contraceptives reduce the risk of ovarian cancer by up to 50 and the protective effect of combined oral contraceptives can last 25â€“30 years after they are discontinued 19 24 regular use of aspirin or acetaminophen paracetamol may be associated with a lower risk of ovarian cancer other nsaids do not seem to have a similar protective effect 21tubal ligation is protective because carcinogens are unable to reach the ovary and fimbriae via the vagina uterus and fallopian tubes 16 tubal ligation is also protective in women with the brca1 mutation but not the brca2 mutation 21hysterectomy reduces the risk and removal of both fallopian tubes and ovaries bilateral salpingooophorectomy dramatically reduces the risk of not only ovarian cancer but breast cancer as well 18 this is still a topic of research as the link between hysterectomy and lower ovarian cancer risk is controversial the reasons that hysterectomy may be protective have not been elucidated as of 2015 24a diet that includes large amounts of carotene fiber and vitamins with low amounts of fatâ€”specifically a diet with nonstarchy vegetables eg broccoli and onions â€”may be protective 19 though research is still ongoing in this area 24 higher caffeine intake and consumption of more than two cups of tea a day have both been associated with lower ovarian cancer risk 21 smoking tobacco is protective for sex cordstromal tumors

take their place cancer starts when new cells form unneeded and old or damaged cells do not die as they should the buildup of extra cells often forms a mass of tissue called a growth or tumor these abnormal cancer cells have many genetic abnormalities that cause them to grow excessively 37 when an ovary releases an egg the egg follicle bursts open and becomes the corpus luteum this structure needs to be repaired by dividing cells in the ovary 24 continuous ovulation for a long time means more repair of the ovary by dividing cells which can acquire mutations in each division 19overall the most common gene mutations in ovarian cancer occur in nf1 brca1 brca2 and cdk12 type i ovarian cancers which tend to be less aggressive tend to have microsatellite instability in several genes including both oncogenes most notably braf and kras and tumor suppressors most notably pten  18 the most common mutations in type i cancers are kras braf erbb2 pten pik3ca and arid1a 21 type ii cancers the more aggressive type have different genes mutated including p53 brca1 and brca2 18 lowgrade cancers tend to have mutations in kras whereas cancers of any grade that develop from low malignant potential tumors tend to have mutations in p53 19 type i cancers tend to develop from precursor lesions whereas type ii cancers can develop from a serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma 21 serous cancers that have brca mutations also inevitably have p53 mutations indicating that the removal of both functional genes is important for cancer to develop 19in 50 of highgrade serous cancers homologous recombination dna repair is dysfunctional as are the notch and foxm1 signaling pathways they also almost always have p53 mutations other than this mutations in highgrade serous carcinoma are hard to characterize beyond their high degree of genomic instability brca1 and brca2 are essential for homologous recombination dna repair and germline mutations in these genes are found in about 15 of people with ovarian cancer 18 the most common mutations in brca1 and brca2 are the frameshift mutations that originated in a small founding population of ashkenazi jews 19almost 100 of rare mucinous carcinomas have mutations in kras and amplifications of erbb2 also known as her2neu  18 overall 20 of ovarian cancers have mutations in her2neu 16serous carcinomas may develop from serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma rather than developing spontaneously from ovarian tissue other carcinomas develop from cortical inclusion cysts which are groups of epithelial ovarian cells inside the stroma 19diagnosis  editexamination  edita very large ovarian cancer as seen on ctmicrograph of serous carcinoma a type of ovarian cancer diagnosed in peritoneal fluid diagnosis of ovarian cancer starts with a physical examination including a pelvic examination  a blood test for ca125 and sometimes other markers and transvaginal ultrasound 16 sometimes a rectovaginal examination is used to help plan a surgery 19 the diagnosis must be confirmed with surgery to inspect the abdominal cavity take biopsies tissue samples for microscopic analysis  and look for cancer cells in the abdominal fluid this helps to determine if an ovarian mass is benign or malignant 16ovarian cancers early stages iii are difficult to diagnose because most symptoms are nonspecific and thus of little use in diagnosis as a result it is rarely diagnosed until it spreads and advances to later stages iiiiv 38 additionally symptoms of ovarian cancer may appear similar to irritable bowel syndrome in patients in whom pregnancy is a possibility bhcg level can be measured during the diagnosis process serum alphafetoprotein neuronspecific enolase and lactate dehydrogenase can be measured in young girls and adolescents with suspected ovarian tumors as younger patients are more likely to have malignant germ cell tumors 16 21a physical examination including a pelvic examination and a pelvic ultrasound transvaginal or otherwise are both essential for diagnosis physical examination may reveal increased abdominal girth andor ascites fluid within the abdominal cavity while pelvic examination may reveal an ovarian or abdominal mass 18 an adnexal mass is a significant finding that often indicates ovarian cancer especially if it is fixed nodular irregular solid andor bilateral 13â€“21 of adnexal masses are caused by malignancy however there are other benign causes of adnexal masses including ovarian follicular cyst leiomyoma endometriosis ectopic pregnancy hydrosalpinx tuboovarian abscess ovarian torsion dermoid cyst cystadenoma serous or mucinous diverticular or appendiceal abscess nerve sheath tumor pelvic kidney ureteral or bladder diverticulum benign cystic mesothelioma of the peritoneum peritoneal tuberculosis or paraovarian cyst ovaries that can be felt are also a sign of ovarian cancer in postmenopausal women other parts of a physical examination for suspected ovarian cancer can include a breast examination and a digital rectal exam palpation of the supraclavicular axillary and inguinal lymph nodes may reveal lymphadenopathy which can be indicative of metastasis another indicator may be the presence of a pleural effusion which can be noted on auscultation 21when an ovarian malignancy is included in a list of diagnostic possibilities a limited number of laboratory tests are indicated a complete blood count and serum electrolyte test is usually obtained 39 when an ovarian cancer is present these tests often show a high number of platelets 20â€“25 of people and low blood sodium levels due to chemical signals secreted by the tumor 19 a positive test for inhibin a and inhibin b can indicate a granulosa cell tumor 21a blood test for a marker molecule called ca125 is useful in differential diagnosis and in follow up of the disease but it by itself has not been shown to be an effective method to screen for earlystage ovarian cancer due to its unacceptable low sensitivity and specificity 39 ca125 levels in premenopausal people over 200 um l may indicate ovarian cancer as may any elevation in ca125 above 35 um l in postmenopausal people ca125 levels are not accurate in early stage ovarian cancer as fully half of stage i ovarian cancer patients have a normal ca125 level 21 19 ca125 may also be elevated in benign noncancerous conditions including endometriosis pregnancy uterine fibroids menstruation ovarian cysts systemic lupus erythematosus liver disease inflammatory bowel disease pelvic inflammatory disease and leiomyoma 21 40he4 is another candidate for ovarian cancer testing though it has not been extensively tested other tumor markers for ovarian cancer include ca199 ca724 ca153 immunosuppressive acidic protein haptoglobinalpha ovx1 mesothelin lysophosphatidic acid osteopontin and fibroblast growth factor 23 21use of blood test panels may help in diagnosis 21 39 the ova1 panel includes ca125 beta2 microglobulin transferrin apolipoprotein a1 and transthyretin ova1 above 50 in premenopausal people and 44 in postmenopausal people indicates a high risk for cancer 19 a different set of laboratory tests is used for detecting sex cordstromal tumors high levels of testosterone or dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate combined with other symptoms and high levels of inhibin a and inhibin b can be indicative of an scst of any type 22current research is looking at ways to consider tumor marker proteomics in combination with other indicators of disease ie radiology andor symptoms to improve diagnostic accuracy the challenge in such an approach is that the disparate prevalence of ovarian cancer means that even testing with very high sensitivity and specificity will still lead to a number of false positive results which in turn may lead to issues such as performing surgical procedures in which cancer is not found intraoperatively  citation needed genomics approaches have not yet been developed for ovarian cancer 21ct scanning is preferred to assess the extent of the tumor in the abdominopelvic cavity though magnetic resonance imaging can also be used 18 ct scanning can also be useful for finding omental caking or differentiating fluid from solid tumor in the abdomen especially in low malignant potential tumors however it may not detect smaller tumors sometimes a chest xray is used to detect metastases in the chest or pleural effusion another test for metastatic disease though it is infrequently used is a barium enema which can show if the rectosigmoid colon is involved in the disease positron emission tomography bone scans and paracentesis are of limited use in fact paracentesis can cause metastases to form at the needle insertion site and may not provide useful results 19 however paracentesis can be used in cases where there is no pelvic mass and ascites is still present 19 a physician suspecting ovarian cancer may also perform mammography or an endometrial biopsy in the case of abnormal bleeding to assess the possibility of breast malignancies and endometrial malignancy respectively vaginal ultrasonography is often the firstline imaging study performed when an adnexal mass is found several characteristics of an adnexal mass indicate ovarian malignancy they usually are solid irregular multilocular andor large and they typically have papillary features central vessels andor irregular internal septations 21 however scst has no definitive characteristics on radiographic study 22to definitively diagnose ovarian cancer a surgical procedure to inspect the abdomen is required this can be an open procedure  laparotomy incision through the abdominal wall or keyhole surgery  laparoscopy  during this procedure suspicious tissue is removed and sent for microscopic analysis usually this includes a unilateral salpingooophorectomy removal of a single affected ovary and fallopian tube fluid from the abdominal cavity can also be analyzed for cancerous cells if cancer is found this procedure can also be used to determine the extent of its spread which is a form of tumor staging  16risk scoring  edita widely recognized method of estimating the risk of malignant ovarian cancer is the risk of malignancy index rmi calculated based on an initial workup 18 41 an rmi score of over 200 or 250 is generally felt to indicate high risk for ovarian cancer 18 21the rmi is calculated as rmi  ultrasound score x menopausal score x ca125 level in uml 18two methods can be used to determine the ultrasound score and menopausal score with the resultant scores being referred to as rmi 1 and rmi 2 respectively depending on what method is used feature rmi 1 18 rmi 2 21 42ultrasound abnormalitiesmultilocular cystsolid areasascitesintraabdominal metastases0  no abnormality1  one abnormality3  two or more abnormalities0  none1  one abnormality4  two or more abnormalities menopausal score1  premenopausal3  postmenopausal1  premenopausal4  postmenopausal ca125 quantity in uml quantity in uml another method for quantifying risk of ovarian cancer is the risk of ovarian cancer algorithm roca observes levels over time and determines if they are increasing rapidly enough to warrant transvaginal ultrasound 19 the risk of ovarian malignancy algorithm uses ca125 levels and he4 levels to calculate the risk of ovarian cancer it may be more effective than rmi the iota models can be used to estimate the probability that an adnexal tumor is malignant 43 they include lr2 risk model the simple rules risk srrisk calculation and assessment of different neoplasias in the adnexa adnex model that can be used to assess risk of malignancy in an adnexal mass based on its characteristics and risk factors the qcancer ovary algorithm is used to predict likelihood of ovarian cancer from risk factors 21pathology  editovarian cancers in women aged 20 with area representing relative incidence and color representing fiveyear relative survival rate 44ovarian cancers are classified according to the microscopic appearance of their structures  histology or histopathology  histology dictates many aspects of clinical treatment management and prognosis the gross pathology of ovarian

carcinoma surface epithelialstromal tumour also known as ovarian epithelial carcinoma is the most common type of ovarian cancer representing approximately 90 of ovarian cancers it includes serous tumour endometrioid tumor and mucinous cystadenocarcinoma less common tumors are malignant brenner tumor and transitional cell carcinoma of the ovary epithelial ovarian cancers develop from the epithelium a layer of cells that covers the ovary 45serous carcinoma  editmost people with epithelial ovarian carcinoma about twothirds have a serous carcinoma 18 though this proportion is estimated as high as 80 21 46 lowgrade serous carcinoma is less aggressive than highgrade serous carcinomas though it does not typically respond well to chemotherapy or hormonal treatments 18 serous carcinomas are thought to begin in the fallopian tube 45 histologically serous adenocarcinomas have psammoma bodies lowgrade serous adenocarcinomas resemble fallopian tube epithelium whereas highgrade serous adenocarcinomas show anaplasia and nuclear atypia 1950 of the time serous carcinomas are bilateral and in 85 of cases they have spread beyond the ovary at the time of diagnosis most have a diameter over 15 cm 46smallcell carcinoma  editsmallcell ovarian carcinoma is rare and aggressive with two main subtypes hypercalcemic and pulmonary it is typically fatal within 2 years of diagnosis hypercalcemic small cell ovarian carcinoma overwhelmingly affects those in their 20s causes high blood calcium levels and affects one ovary pulmonary small cell ovarian cancer usually affects both ovaries of older women and looks like oatcell carcinoma of the lung 19primary peritoneal carcinoma  editmain article primary peritoneal carcinoma primary peritoneal carcinomas develop from the peritoneum a membrane that covers the abdominal cavity that has the same embryonic origin as the ovary they are often discussed and classified with ovarian cancers when they affect the ovary 45 47 they can develop even after the ovaries have been removed and may appear similar to mesothelioma 19clearcell carcinoma  editclearcell ovarian carcinomas do not typically respond well to chemotherapy and may be related to endometriosis 18 they represent approximately 5 of all endometrial cancers japanese women develop clearcell ovarian cancer more frequently than other groups of women 21clearcell adenocarcinoma  edithobnail cells seen in a clear cell carcinoma sample clearcell adenocarcinomas are histopathologically similar to other clear cell carcinomas with clear cells and hobnail cells they represent approximately 5â€“10 of epithelial ovarian cancers and are associated with endometriosis in the pelvic cavity they are typically earlystage and therefore curable by surgery but advanced clearcell adenocarcinomas approximately 20 have a poor prognosis and are often resistant to platinum chemotherapy 19endometrioid  editendometrioid adenocarcinomas make up approximately 15â€“20 of epithelial ovarian cancers because they are typically lowgrade endometrioid adenocarcinomas have a good prognosis these tumors frequently cooccur with endometriosis or endometrial cancer 19malignant mixed mÃ¼llerian tumor carcinosarcoma  editmixed mÃ¼llerian tumors make up less than 1 of ovarian cancer they have epithelial and mesenchymal cells visible and tend to have a poor prognosis 19mucinous  editmucinous tumors include mucinous adenocarcinoma and mucinous cystadenocarcinoma 19mucinous adenocarcinoma  editmain article mucinous adenocarcinoma mucinous adenocarcinomas make up 5â€“10 of epithelial ovarian cancers histologically they are similar to intestinal or cervical adenocarcinomas and are often actually metastases of appendiceal or colon cancers advanced mucinous adenocarcinomas have a poor prognosis generally worse than serous tumors and are often resistant to platinum chemotherapy though they are rare 19pseudomyxoma peritonei  editmain article pseudomyxoma peritonei pseudomyxoma peritonei refers to a collection of encapsulated mucous or gelatinous material in the abdominopelvic cavity which is very rarely caused by a primary mucinous ovarian tumor more commonly it is associated with ovarian metastases of intestinal cancer 19undifferentiated epithelial  editundifferentiated cancers  those where the cell type cannot be determined  make up about 10 of epithelial ovarian cancers and have a comparatively poor prognosis 19 45 when examined under the microscope these tumors have very abnormal cells that are arranged in clumps or sheets usually there are recognizable clumps of serous cells inside the tumor 19malignant brenner tumor  editmain article brenner tumor malignant brenner tumors are rare histologically they have dense fibrous stroma with areas of transitional epithelium and some squamous differentiation to be classified as a malignant brenner tumor it must have brenner tumor foci and transitional cell carcinoma the transitional cell carcinoma component is typically poorly differentiated and resembles urinary tract cancer 19transitional cell carcinoma  editmain article transitional cell carcinoma transitional cell carcinomas represent less than 5 of ovarian cancers histologically they appear similar to bladder carcinoma the prognosis is intermediate  better than most epithelial cancers but worse than malignant brenner

tumor or arrhenoblastoma accounts for 7 of ovarian cancers they occur most frequently in women between 50 and 69 years of age but can occur in women of any age including young girls they are not typically aggressive and are usually unilateral 16 they are therefore usually treated with surgery alone sex cordstromal tumors are the main hormoneproducing ovarian tumors 22several different cells from the mesenchyme can give rise to sexcord or stromal tumors these include fibroblasts and endocrine cells the symptoms of a sexcord or stromal ovarian tumor can differ from other types of ovarian cancer common signs and symptoms include ovarian torsion hemorrhage from or rupture of the tumor an abdominal mass and hormonal disruption in children isosexual precocious pseudopuberty may occur with granulosa cell tumors since they produce estrogen these tumors cause abnormalities in menstruation  excessive bleeding infrequent menstruation or no menstruation or postmenopausal bleeding because these tumors produce estrogen they can cause or occur at the same time as endometrial cancer or breast cancer other sexcordstromal tumors present with distinct symptoms sertolileydig cell tumors cause virilization and excessive hair growth due to the production of testosterone and androstenedione which can also cause cushings syndrome in rare cases also sexcord stromal tumors occur that do not cause a hormonal imbalance including benign fibromas which cause ascites and hydrothorax 16 with germ cell tumors sex cordstromal tumors are the most common ovarian cancer diagnosed in women under 20 22granulosa cell tumor  editgranulosa cell tumors are the most common sexcord stromal tumors making up 70 of cases and are divided into two histologic subtypes adult granulosa cell tumors which develop in women over 50 and juvenile granulosa tumors which develop before puberty or before the age of 30 both develop in the ovarian follicle from a population of cells that surrounds germinal cells 22adult granulosa cell tumor  editadult granulosa cell tumors are characterized by later onset 30 years 50 on average these tumors produce high levels of estrogen which causes its characteristic symptoms menometrorrhagia endometrial hyperplasia tender enlarged breasts postmenopausal bleeding and secondary amenorrhea the mass of the tumor can cause other symptoms including abdominal pain and distension or symptoms similar to an ectopic pregnancy if the tumor bleeds and ruptures 22juvenile granulosa cell tumor  editsertolileydig cell tumor  editsertolileydig tumors are most common in women before the age of 30 and particularly common before puberty 22sclerosing stromal tumors  editsclerosing stromal tumors typically occur in girls before puberty or women before the age of 30 22germ cell tumor  editmain article germ cell tumor germ cell tumors of the ovary develop from the ovarian germ cells 45 germ cell tumor accounts for about 30 of ovarian tumors but only 5 of ovarian cancers because most germcell tumors are teratomas and most teratomas are benign malignant teratomas tend to occur in older women when one of the germ layers in the tumor develops into a squamous cell carcinoma 16 germcell tumors tend to occur in young women 20sâ€“30s and girls making up 70 of the ovarian cancer seen in that age group 23 germcell tumors can include dysgerminomas teratomas yolk sac tumorsendodermal sinus tumors and choriocarcinomas when they arise in the ovary some germcell tumors have an isochromosome 12 where one arm of chromosome 12 is deleted and replaced with a duplicate of the other 16 most germcell cancers have a better prognosis than other subtypes and are more sensitive to chemotherapy they are more likely to be stage i at diagnosis 22 overall they metastasize more frequently than epithelial ovarian cancers in addition the cancer markers used vary with tumor type choriocarcinomas are monitored with betahcg and endodermal sinus tumors with alphafetoprotein 16germcell tumors are typically discovered when they become large palpable masses however like sex cord tumors they can cause ovarian torsion or hemorrhage and in children isosexual precocious puberty they frequently metastasize to nearby lymph nodes especially paraaortic and pelvic lymph nodes 16 the most common symptom of germ cell tumors is subacute abdominal pain caused by the tumor bleeding necrotizing or stretching the ovarian capsule if the tumor ruptures causes significant bleeding or torses the ovary it can cause acute abdominal pain which occurs in less than 10 of those with germcell tumors they can also secrete hormones which change the menstrual cycle in 25 of germcell tumors the cancer is discovered during a routine examination and does not cause symptoms 22diagnosing germ cell tumors may be difficult because the normal menstrual cycle and puberty can cause pain and pelvic symptoms and a young woman may even believe these symptoms to be those of pregnancy and not seek treatment due to the stigma of teen pregnancy blood tests for alphafetoprotein karyotype human chorionic gonadotropin and liver function are used to diagnose germ cell tumor and potential cooccurring gonadal dysgenesis a germ cell tumor may be initially mistaken for a benign ovarian cyst 22dysgerminoma  editmain article dysgerminoma dysgerminoma accounts for 35 of ovarian cancer in young women and is the most likely germ cell tumor to metastasize to the lymph nodes nodal metastases occur in 25â€“30 of cases 23 22 these tumors may have mutations in the kit gene a mutation known for its role in gastrointestinal stromal tumor people with an xy karyotype and ovaries  gonadal dysgenesis or an x0 karyotype and ovaries  turner syndrome who develop a unilateral dysgerminoma are at risk for a gonadoblastoma in the other ovary and in this case both ovaries are usually removed when a unilateral dysgerminoma is discovered to avoid the risk of another malignant tumor gonadoblastomas in people with swyer or turner syndrome become malignant in approximately 40 of cases however in general dysgerminomas are bilateral 10â€“20 of the time 16 22they are composed of cells that cannot differentiate further and develop directly from germ cells or from gonadoblastomas dysgerminomas contain syncytiotrophoblasts in approximately 5 of cases and can therefore cause elevated h cg levels on gross appearance dysgerminomas are typically pink to tancolored have multiple lobes and are solid microscopically they appear identical to seminomas and very close to embryonic primordial germ cells having large polyhedral rounded clear cells the nuclei are uniform and round or square with prominent nucleoli and the cytoplasm has high levels of glycogen inflammation is another prominent histologic feature of dysgerminomas 22choriocarcinoma  editmain article choriocarcinoma choriocarcinoma can occur as a primary ovarian tumor developing from a germ cell though it is usually a gestational disease that metastasizes to the ovary primary ovarian choriocarcinoma has a poor prognosis and can occur without a pregnancy they produce high levels of h cg and can cause early puberty in children or menometrorrhagia irregular heavy menstruation after menarche 22immature solid teratoma  editmain article immature teratoma immature or solid teratomas are the most common type of ovarian germ cell tumor making up 40â€“50 of cases teratomas are characterized by the presence of disorganized tissues arising from all three embryonic germ layers ectoderm mesoderm and endoderm immature teratomas also have undifferentiated stem cells that make them more malignant than mature teratomas dermoid cysts the different tissues are visible on gross pathology and often include bone cartilage hair mucus or sebum but these tissues are not visible from the outside which appears to be a solid mass with lobes and cysts histologically they have large amounts of neuroectoderm organized into sheets and tubules along with glia the amount of neural tissue determines the histologic grade immature teratomas usually only affect one ovary 10 cooccur with dermoid cysts and usually metastasize throughout the peritoneum they can also cause mature teratoma implants to grow throughout the abdomen in a disease called growing teratoma syndrome these are usually benign but will continue to grow during chemotherapy and often necessitate further surgery unlike mature teratomas immature teratomas form many adhesions making them less likely to cause ovarian torsion there is no specific marker for immature teratomas but carcinoembryonic antigen cea ca125 ca199 or afp can sometimes indicate an immature teratoma 22stage i teratomas make up the majority 75 of cases and have the best prognosis with 98 of patients surviving 5 years if a stage i tumor is also grade 1 it can be treated with unilateral surgery only stage ii though iv tumors make up the remaining quarter of cases and have a worse prognosis with 73â€“88 of patients surviving 5 years 22mature teratoma dermoid cyst  editmain article dermoid cyst mature teratomas or dermoid cysts are rare tumors consisting of mostly benign tissue that develop after menopause the tumors consist of disorganized tissue with nodules of malignant tissue which can be of various types the most common malignancy is squamous cell carcinoma but adenocarcinoma basalcell carcinoma carcinoid tumor neuroectodermal tumor malignant melanoma sarcoma sebaceous tumor and struma ovarii can also be part of the dermoid cyst they are treated with surgery and adjuvant platinum chemotherapy or radiation 22yolk sac tumorendodermal sinus tumor  editmain article yolk sac tumor yolk sac tumors formerly called endodermal sinus tumors make up approximately 10â€“20 of ovarian germ cell malignancies and have the worst prognosis of all ovarian germ cell tumors they occur both before menarche in onethird of cases and after menarche the remaining twothirds of cases half of people with yolk sac tumors are diagnosed in stage i typically they are unilateral until metastasis which occurs within the peritoneal cavity and via the bloodstream to the lungs yolk sac tumors grow quickly and recur easily and are not easily treatable once they have recurred stage i yolk sac tumors are highly treatable with a 5year disease free survival rate of 93 but stage iiiv tumors are less treatable with survival rates of 64â€“91 22their gross appearance is solid friable and yellow with necrotic and hemorrhagic areas they also often contain cysts that can degenerate or rupture histologically yolk sac tumors are characterized by the presence of schillerduval bodies which are pathognomonic for yolk sac tumors and a reticular pattern yolk sac tumors commonly secrete alphafetoprotein and can be immunohistochemically stained for its presence the level of alphafetoprotein in the blood is a useful marker of recurrence 22embryonal carcinoma  editmain article embryonal carcinoma embryonal carcinomas a rare tumor type usually found in mixed tumors develop directly from germ cells but are not terminally differentiated in rare cases they may develop in dysgenetic gonads they can develop further into a variety of other neoplasms including choriocarcinoma yolk sac tumor and teratoma they occur in younger people with an average age at diagnosis of 14 and secrete both alphafetoprotein in 75 of cases and h cg 22histologically embryonal carcinoma appears similar to the embryonic disc made up of epithelial anaplastic cells in disorganized sheets with glandlike spaces and papillary structures 22polyembryoma  editmain article polyembryoma polyembryomas the most immature form of teratoma and very rare ovarian tumors are histologically characterized by having several embryo like bodies with structures resembling a germ disk yolk sac and amniotic sac syncytiotrophoblast giant cells also occur in polyembryomas 22squamous cell carcinoma  editprimary ovarian squamous cell carcinomas are rare and have a poor prognosis when advanced more typically ovarian squamous cell carcinomas are cervical metastases areas of differentiation in an endometrioid tumor or derived from a mature teratoma 19mixed tumors  editmixed tumors contain elements of more than one of the above classes of tumor histology to be classed as a mixed tumor the minor type must make up more than 10 of the tumor 21 though mixed carcinomas can have any combination of cell types mixed ovarian cancers are typically serousendometrioid or clear cellendometrioid 19 mixed germ cell tumors make up approximately 25â€“30 of all germ cell ovarian cancers with combinations of dysgerminoma yolk sac tumor andor immature teratoma the prognosis and treatment vary based on the component cell types 22secondary ovarian cancer  editovarian cancer can also be a secondary cancer the result of metastasis from a primary cancer elsewhere in the body 16 about 7 of ovarian cancers are due to metastases while the rest are primary cancers  citation needed common primary cancers are breast cancer colon cancer appendiceal cancer and stomach cancer primary gastric cancers that metastasize to the ovary are called krukenberg tumors  16 krukenberg tumors have signet ring cells and mucinous cells 19 endometrial cancer and lymphomas can also metastasize to the ovary 46low malignant potential tumors  editlow malignant potential ovarian tumors also called borderline tumors have some benign and some malignant features 19 lmp tumors make up approximately 1015 of all ovarian tumors 21 45 they develop earlier than epithelial ovarian cancer around the age of 40â€“49 they typically do not have extensive invasion 10 of lmp tumors have areas of stromal microinvasion 3mm 5 of tumor lmp tumors have other abnormal features including increased mitosis changes in cell size or nucleus size abnormal nuclei cell stratification and small projections on cells papillary projections serous andor mucinous characteristics can be seen on histological examination and serous histology makes up the overwhelming majority of advanced lmp tumors more than 80 of lmp tumors are stage i 15 are stage ii and iii and less than 5 are stage iv 19 implants of lmp tumors are often noninvasive 45staging  editovarian cancer is staged using the figo staging system and uses information obtained after surgery which can include a total abdominal hysterectomy via midline laparotomy removal of usually both ovaries and fallopian tubes usually the omentum pelvic peritoneal washings assessment of retroperitoneal lymph nodes including the pelvic and paraaortic lymph nodes  appendectomy in suspected mucinous tumors and pelvicperitoneal biopsies for cytopathology 18 16 21 48 around 30 of ovarian cancers that appear confined to the ovary have metastasized microscopically which is why even stagei cancers must be staged completely 16 22 of cancers presumed to be stage i are observed to have lymphatic metastases 21 the ajcc stage is the same as the figo stage the ajcc staging system describes the extent of the primary tumor t the absence or presence of metastasis to nearby lymph nodes n and the absence or presence of distant metastasis m 49 the most common stage at diagnosis is stage iiic with over 70 of diagnoses 16figo  editovarian adenocarcinoma deposit in the

normal tissue and are the ones with the best prognosis grade 2 tumors are also called moderately welldifferentiated and they are made up of cells that resemble the normal tissue grade 3 tumors have the worst prognosis and their cells are abnormal referred to as poorly differentiated 50metastasis in ovarian cancer is very common in the abdomen and occurs via exfoliation where cancer cells burst through the ovarian capsule and are able to move freely throughout the peritoneal cavity ovarian cancer metastases usually grow on the surface of organs rather than the inside they are also common on the omentum and the peritoneal lining cancer cells can also travel through the lymphatic system and metastasize to lymph nodes connected to the ovaries via blood vessels ie the lymph nodes along the infundibulopelvic ligament the broad ligament and the round ligament the most commonly affected groups include the paraaortic hypogastric external iliac obturator and inguinal lymph nodes usually ovarian cancer does not metastasize to the liver lung brain or kidneys unless it is recurrent disease this differentiates ovarian cancer from many other forms of cancer 19screening  editthere is no simple and reliable way to test for ovarian cancer in women who do not have any signs or symptoms screening is not recommended in women who are at average risk as evidence does not support a reduction in death and the high rate of false positive tests may lead to unneeded surgery which is accompanied by its own risks 14 the pap test does not screen for ovarian cancer 17ovarian cancer is usually only palpable in advanced stages 19 screening is not recommended using ca125 measurements he4 levels ultrasound or adnexal palpation in women who are at average risk risk of developing ovarian cancer in those with genetic factors can be reduced those with a genetic predisposition may benefit from screening this high risk group has benefited with earlier detection 18 16 51ovarian cancer has low prevalence even in the highrisk group of women from the ages of 50 to 60 about one in 2000 and screening of women with average risk is more likely to give ambiguous results than detect a problem which requires treatment because ambiguous results are more likely than detection of a treatable problem and because the usual response to ambiguous results is invasive interventions in women of average risk the potential harms of having screening without an indication outweigh the potential benefits the purpose of screening is to diagnose ovarian cancer at an early stage when it is more likely to be treated successfully 16 51screening with transvaginal ultrasound pelvic examination and ca125 levels can be used instead of preventive surgery in women who have brca1 or brca2 mutations this strategy has shown some success 19prevention  editpeople with strong genetic risk for ovarian cancer may consider the surgical removal of their ovaries as a preventive measure this is often done after completion of childbearing years this reduces the chances of developing both breast cancer by around 50 and ovarian cancer by about 96 in people at high risk women with brca gene mutations usually also have their fallopian tubes removed at the same time salpingooophorectomy since they also have an increased risk of fallopian tube cancer however these statistics may overestimate the risk reduction because of how they have been studied 16 51people with a significant family history for ovarian cancer are often referred to a genetic counselor to see if they if testing for brca mutations would be beneficial 19 the use of oral contraceptives the absence of periods during the menstrual cycle and tubal ligation reduce the risk 52 there may an association of developing ovarian cancer and ovarian stimulation during infertility treatments endometriosis has been linked to ovarian cancers human papillomavirus infection smoking and talc have not been identified as increasing the risk for developing ovarian cancer 18management  editonce it is determined that ovarian fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer is present treatment is scheduled by a gynecologic oncologist a physician trained to treat cancers of a womanâ€™s reproductive system gynecologic oncologists can perform surgery on and give chemotherapy to women with ovarian cancer a treatment plan is developed 53treatment usually involves surgery and chemotherapy and sometimes radiotherapy regardless of the subtype of ovarian cancer 45 54 surgical treatment may be sufficient for welldifferentiated malignant tumors and confined to the ovary addition of chemotherapy may be required for more aggressive tumors confined to the ovary for patients with advanced disease a combination of surgical reduction with a combination chemotherapy regimen is standard borderline tumors even following spread outside of the ovary are managed well with surgery and chemotherapy is not seen as useful 55secondlook surgery and maintenance chemotherapy have not been shown to provide benefit 19surgery  editsurgery has been the standard of care for decades and may be necessary in obtaining a specimen for diagnosis the surgery depends upon the extent of nearby invasion of other tissues by the cancer when it is diagnosed this extent of the cancer is described by assigning it a stage the presumed type and the grade of cancer the gynecological surgeon may remove one unilateral oophorectomy or both ovaries bilateral oophorectomy the fallopian tubes salpingectomy uterus hysterectomy and the omentum omentectomy may also be removed typically all of these organs are removed 56for lowgrade unilateral stageia cancers only the involved ovary which must be unruptured and fallopian tube will be removed this can be done especially in young people who wish to preserve their fertility however a risk of microscopic metastases exists and staging must be completed 18 if any metastases are found a second surgery to remove the remaining ovary and uterus is needed 55 tranexamic acid can be administered prior to surgery to reduce the need for blood transfusions due to blood loss during the surgery 21if a tumor in a premenopausal woman is determined to be a low malignant potential tumor during surgery and it is clearly stage i cancer only the affected ovary is removed for postmenopausal women with low malignant potential tumors hysterectomy with bilateral salpingooophorectomy is still the preferred option during staging the appendix can be examined or removed this is particularly important with mucinous tumors 19 in children or adolescents with ovarian cancer surgeons typically attempt to preserve one ovary to allow for the completion of puberty but if the cancer has spread this is not always possible dysgerminomas in particular tend to affect both ovaries 8â€“15 of dysgerminomas are present in both ovaries 23 people with lowgrade welldifferentiated tumors are typically treated only with surgery 16 which is often curative 45 in general germ cell tumors can be treated with unilateral surgery unless the cancer is widespread or fertility is not a factor 22in advanced cancers where complete removal is not an option as much tumor as possible is removed in a procedure called debulking surgery this surgery is not always successful and is less likely to be successful in women with extensive metastases in the peritoneum stage iv disease cancer in the transverse fissure of the liver mesentery or diaphragm and large areas of ascites debulking surgery is usually only done once 18 more complete debulking is associated with better outcomes women with no macroscopic evidence of disease after debulking have a median survival of 39 months as opposed to 17 months with less complete surgery 16 by removing metastases many cells that are resistant to chemotherapy are removed and any clumps of cells that have died are also removed this allows chemotherapy to better reach the remaining cancer cells which are more likely to be fastgrowing and therefore chemosensitive 19interval debulking surgery is another protocol used where neoadjuvant chemotherapy is given debulking surgery is performed and chemotherapy is finished after debulking 55 though no definitive studies have been completed it is shown to be approximately equivalent to primary debulking surgery in terms of survival and shows slightly lower morbidity 19there are several different surgical procedures that can be employed to treat ovarian cancer for stage i and ii cancer laparascopic keyhole surgery can be used but metastases may not be found for advanced cancer laparoscopy is not used since debulking metastases requires access to the entire peritoneal cavity depending on the extent of the cancer procedures may include a bilateral salpingooophorectomy biopsies throughout the peritoneum and abdominal lymphatic system omentectomy splenectomy bowel resection diaphragm stripping or resection appendectomy or even a posterior pelvic exenteration 19to fully stage ovarian cancer lymphadenectomy can be included in the surgery but a significant survival benefit to this practice may not happen 18 this is particularly important in germ cell tumors because they frequently metastasize to nearby lymph nodes 16if ovarian cancer recurs secondary surgery is sometimes a treatment option this depends on how easily the tumor can be removed how much fluid has accumulated in the abdomen and overall health 18 it can be helpful in people who had their first surgery done by a generalist and in epithelial ovarian cancer 21 secondary surgery can be effective in dysgerminomas and immature teratomas 22the major side effect of an oophorectomy in younger women is early menopause which can cause osteoporosis after surgery hormone replacement therapy can be considered especially in younger women this therapy can consist of a combination of estrogen and progesterone or estrogen alone estrogen alone is safe after hysterectomy when the uterus is still present unopposed estrogen dramatically raises the risk of endometrial cancer 18 estrogen therapy after surgery does not change survival rates 21 people having ovarian cancer surgery are typically hospitalized afterwards for 3â€“4 days and spend around a month recovering at home 57 surgery outcomes are best at hospitals that do a large number of ovarian cancer surgeries 19it is unclear if laparoscopy or laparotomy is better or worse for figo stage i ovarian cancer 58 there is also no apparent difference between total abdominal hysterectomy and supracervical hysterectomy for advanced cancers approximately 28 of people having a first surgery for advanced ovarian cancer die within two weeks of the surgery 28 perioperative mortality rate 21 more aggressive surgeries are associated with better outcomes in advanced stage iii or iv ovarian cancer 19chemotherapy  editchemotherapy has been a general standard of care for ovarian cancer for decades although with variable protocols chemotherapy is used after surgery to treat any residual disease if appropriate in some cases there may be reason to perform chemotherapy first followed by surgery this is called neoadjuvant chemotherapy and is common when a tumor cannot be completely removed or optimally debulked via surgery though it has not been shown to increase survival it can reduce the risk of complications after surgery if a unilateral salpingooophorectomy or other surgery is performed additional chemotherapy called adjuvant chemotherapy can be given 18 21 adjuvant chemotherapy is used in stage 1 cancer typically if the tumor is of a high histologic grade grade 3 or the highest substage stage 1c provided the cancer has been optimally staged during surgery 21 55 bevacizumab may be used as an adjuvant chemotherapy if the tumor is not completely removed during surgery or if the cancer is stage iv it can extend progressionfree survival but has not been shown to extend overall survival 21 chemotherapy is curative in approximately 20 of advanced ovarian cancers 19 it is more often curative with malignant germ cell tumors than epithelial tumors 22chemotherapy in ovarian cancer typically consists of platins a group of platinum based drugs combined with nonplatins common therapies can include paclitaxel cisplatin topotecan doxorubicin epirubicin and gemcitabine carboplatin is typically given in combination with either paclitaxel or docetaxel the typical combination is carboplatin with paclitaxel 18 21 carboplatin is superior to cisplatin in that it is less toxic and has fewer side effects generally allowing for an improved quality of life in comparison though both are similarly effective 21 threedrug regimens have not been found to be more effective 18 and platins alone or nonplatins alone are less effective than platins and nonplatins in combination 21 chemotherapy can be given intravenously or in the peritoneal cavity 16 though intraperitoneal chemotherapy is associated with longer progressionfree survival and overall survival it also causes more adverse side effects than intravenous chemotherapy 21 it is mainly used when the cancer has been optimally debulked intraperitoneal chemotherapy can be highly effective because ovarian cancer mainly spreads inside the peritoneal cavity and higher doses of the drugs can reach the tumors this way 19chemotherapy can cause anemia intravenous iron has been found to be more effective than oral iron supplements in reducing the need for blood transfusions 21 typical cycles of treatment involve one treatment every 3 weeks repeated for 6 weeks or more 59 fewer than 6 weeks cycles of treatment is less effective than 6 weeks or more 21 germcell malignancies are treated differently than other ovarian cancers â€” a regimen of bleomycin etoposide and cisplatin bep is used with 5 days of chemotherapy administered every 3 weeks for 3 to 4 cycles 16 22 chemotherapy for germ cell tumors has not been shown to cause amenorrhea infertility birth defects or miscarriage 22 maintenance chemotherapy has not been shown to be effective 21in people with brca mutations platinum chemotherapy is more effective 18 germcell tumors and malignant sexcordstromal tumors are treated with chemotherapy though dysgerminomas and sexcord tumors are not typically very responsive 16 23platinumsensitive or platinumresistant  editif ovarian cancer recurs it is considered partially platinumsensitive or platinumresistant based on the time since the last recurrence treated with platins partially platinumsensitive cancers recurred 6â€“12 months after last treatment and platinumresistant cancers have an interval of less than 6 months secondline chemotherapy can be given after the cancer becomes symptomatic because no difference in survival is seen between treating asymptomatic elevated ca125 and symptomatic recurrences  medical citation neededfor platinumsensitive tumors platins are the drugs of choice for secondline chemotherapy in combination with other cytotoxic agents regimens include carboplatin combined with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin gemcitabine or paclitaxel 16 carboplatindoublet therapy can be combined with paclitaxel for increased efficacy in some cases another potential adjuvant therapy for platinumsensitive recurrences is olaparib which may improve progressionfree survival but has not been shown to improve overall survival 21  olaparib a parp inhibitor was approved by the us fda for use in brcaassociated ovarian cancer that had previously been treated with chemotherapy 60 for recurrent germ cell tumors an additional 4 cycles of bep chemotherapy is the firstline treatment for those tho have been treated with surgery or platins if the tumor is determined to be platinumresistant vincristine dactinomycin and cyclophosphamide vac or some combination of paclitaxel gemcitabine and oxaliplatin may be used as a secondline therapy 22for platinumresistant tumors there are no highefficacy chemotherapy options singledrug regimens doxorubicin or topotecan do not have high response rates 18 but singledrug regimens of topotecan pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or gemcitabine are used in some cases 16 21 topotecan cannot be used in people with an intestinal blockage paclitaxel used alone is another possible regimen or it may be combined with liposomal doxorubicin gemcitabine cisplatin topotecan etoposide or cyclophosphamide 59  see also palliative care below radiation therapy  editdysgerminomas are most effectively treated with radiation 23 though this can cause infertility and is being phased out in favor of chemotherapy 16 radiation therapy does not improve survival in people with welldifferentiated tumors 16in stage 1c and 2 cancers radiation therapy is used after surgery if there is the possibility of residual disease in the pelvis but the abdomen is cancerfree radiotherapy can also be used in palliative care of advanced cancers a typical course of radiotherapy for ovarian cancer is 5 days a week for 3â€“4 weeks common side effects of radiotherapy include diarrhea constipation and frequent urination 61hormonal therapy  editdespite the fact that 60 of ovarian tumors have estrogen receptors ovarian cancer is only rarely responsive to hormonal treatments estrogen alone does not have an effect on the cancer and tamoxifen and letrozole are rarely effective 18 some women with borderline malignancy ovarian cancer and stromal ovarian cancer may receive hormonal therapy 56immunotherapy  editimmunotherapy is a topic of current research in ovarian cancer in some cases the antibody drug bevacizumab though still a topic of active research is used to treat advanced cancer along with chemotherapy 55 it has been approved for this use in the european union 62followup  editspecific followup depends on for example the type and stage of ovarian cancer the treatment and the presence of any symptoms usually a checkup appointment is made about every 2 to 3 months initially followed by twice per year for up to 5 years 63 for epithelial ovarian cancers the most common test upon followup is ca125 level however treatment based only on elevated ca125 levels and not any symptoms can increase side effects without any prolongation of life so the implication of the outcome of a ca125 test can be discussed before taking it 64 the recommendation as of 2014 is recurrent cancer may be present if the ca125 level is twice normal 18 treating a recurrence detected by ca125 does not improve survival 21for women with germcell tumors followup tests generally include alphafetoprotein afp andor human chorionic gonadotropin for women with stromal cancers tests for hormones like estrogen testosterone and inhibin are sometimes helpful 64 inhibin can also be useful for monitoring the progress of sexcord tumors along with mullerian inhibiting substance afp can also be used to monitor sertolileydig tumors 16 in dysgerminomas lactate dehydrogenase and its two isozymes  ldh1 and ldh2 are used to test for recurrence 22women with ovarian cancer may not need routine surveillance imaging to monitor the cancer unless new symptoms appear or tumor markers begin rising 65 imaging without these indications is discouraged because it is unlikely to detect a recurrence improve survival and because it has its own costs and side effects 65 however ct imaging can be used if desired though this is not common 18 if a tumor is easily imaged imaging may be used to monitor the progress of treatment 66palliative care  editpalliative care focuses on relieving symptoms and increasing or maintaining quality of life this type of treatments purpose is not to cure the cancer but to make the woman more comfortable while living with cancer that can not be cured it has been recommended as part of the treatment plan for any person with advanced ovarian cancer or patients with significant symptoms 67 in platinumrefractory and platinumresistant cases other palliative chemotherapy is the main treatment 19 56palliative care can entail treatment of symptoms and complications of the cancer including pain nausea constipation ascites bowel obstruction edema pleural effusion and mucositis especially if the cancer advances and becomes incurable treatment of symptoms becomes one of the main goals of therapy palliative care can also entail helping with decisionmaking such as if or when hospice care is appropriate and the preferred place for the patient at end of life care 21bowel obstruction can be treated with palliative surgery  colostomy ileostomy or internal bypass or medicine but surgery has been shown to increase survival time 18 21 palliative surgery may result in short bowel syndrome enterocutaneous fistula or reobstruction or may not be possible due to the extent of obstruction 19 other treatments of complications can include total parenteral nutrition a lowresidue diet palliative gastrostomy and adequate pain control 18 bowel obstruction can also be treated with octreotide when palliative surgery is not an option cancer can also block the ureters which can be relieved by a nephrostomy or a ureteric stent ascites can be relieved by repeated paracentesis or placement of a drain to increase comfort 68 pleural effusions can be treated in a similar manner with repeated thoracentesis pleurodesis or placement of a drain 19radiation therapy can be used as part of the palliative care of advanced ovarian cancer since it can help to shrink tumors that are causing symptoms 56 palliative radiotherapy typically lasts for only a few treatments a much shorter course of therapy than nonpalliative radiotherapy 61 it is also used for palliation of chemotherapyresistant germ cell tumors 22psychosocial care  editovarian cancer has a significant effect on quality of life psychological health and wellbeing interventions are available to help with the needs and social support many ovarian cancer survivors report a good quality of life and optimism others reported a spiritual change that helped them find meaning during their experience others have described their loss of faith after their diagnosis with ovarian cancer those who have gone through treatment sometimes experience social isolation but benefit from having relationships with other survivors frustration and guilt have been described by some who have expressed their inability to care for their family 69selfesteem and body image changes can occur due to hair loss removal of ovaries and other reproductive structures and scars there is some improvement after hair grows in sexual issues can develop the removal of ovaries results in surgicallyinduced menopause that can result in painful intercourse vaginal dryness loss of sexual desire and being tired though prognosis is better for younger survivors the impact on sexuality can still be substantial 69anxiety depression and distress is present in those surviving ovarian cancer at higher rates than in the general population 69 70 the same psychosocial problems can develop in family members emotional effects can include a fear of death sadness memory problems and difficulty in concentrating when optimism was adopted by those at the beginning of their treatment they were less likely to develop distress those who have fear of the cancer recurring may have difficulty in expressing joy even when diseasefree the more treatments that a woman undergoes the more likely the loss of hope is expressed women often can cope and reduce negative psychosocial effects by a number of strategies activities such as traveling spending additional time with family and friends ignoring statistics journaling and increasing involvement in spirituall ybased events are adaptive 69prognosis  editrelative fiveyear survival of invasive epithelial ovarian cancer by stage 71ovarian cancer usually has a relatively poor prognosis it is disproportionately deadly because it lacks any clear early detection or screening test meaning most cases are not diagnosed until they have reached advanced stages 65 18ovarian cancer metastasizes early in its development often before it has been diagnosed highgrade tumors metastasize more readily than lowgrade tumors typically tumor cells begin to metastasize by growing in the peritoneal cavity 16 more than 60 of women presenting with ovarian cancer have stageiii or stageiv cancer when it has already spread beyond the ovaries ovarian cancers shed cells into the naturally occurring fluid within the abdominal cavity these cells can then implant on other abdominal peritoneal structures including the uterus urinary bladder bowel lining of the bowel wall and omentum forming new tumor growths before cancer is even suspected the fiveyear survival rate for all stages of ovarian cancer is 46 the oneyear survival rate is 72 and the tenyear survival rate is 35 72 for cases where a diagnosis is made early in the disease when the cancer is still confined to the primary site the fiveyear survival rate is 927 73 about 70 of women with advanced disease respond to initial treatment most of whom attain complete remission but half of these women experience a recurrence 1â€“4 years after treatment 16brain metastasis is more common in stage iiiiv cancer but can still occur in cancers staged at iii people with brain metastases survive a median of 82 months though surgery chemotherapy and whole brain radiation therapy can improve survival 21ovarian cancer survival varies significantly with subtype dysgerminomas have a very favorable prognosis in early stages they have a fiveyear survival rate of 969 23 around twothirds of dysgerminomas are diagnosed at stage i 22 stageiii dysgerminomas have a fiveyear survival of 61 when treated with bep chemotherapy after incomplete surgical removal dysgerminomas have a 95 twoyear survival rate sexcordstromal malignancies also have a favorable prognosis because they are slowgrowing even those with metastatic disease can survive a decade or more 16 low malignant potential tumors usually only have a bad prognosis when there are invasive tumor implants found in the peritoneal cavity 19complications of ovarian cancer can include spread of the cancer to other organs progressive function loss of various organs ascites and intestinal obstructions which can be fatal intestinal obstructions in multiple sites are the most common proximate cause of death 18 intestinal obstruction in ovarian cancer can either be a true obstruction where tumor blocks the intestinal lumen or a pseudoobstruction when tumor prevents normal peristalsis 74 continuous accumulation of ascites can be treated by placing a drain that can be selfdrained 18prognostic factors  editthere are a number of prognostic factors in ovarian cancer positive prognostic factors  those indicating better chances of survival  include no residual disease after surgery stage iiiiv complete macroscopic resection stage iv brca2 mutations young age under 45 years nonserous type low histologic grade early stage cooccurrence with endometrial cancer and low ca125 levels there is conflicting evidence for brca1 as a prognostic factor conversely negative prognostic factors  those that indicate a worse chance of survival  include rupture of the ovarian capsule during surgery older age over 45 years mucinous type stage iv high histologic grade clear cell type upper abdominal involvement high ca125 levels the presence of tumor cells in the blood and elevated cyclooxygenase2 21expression of various m rnas can also be prognostic for ovarian cancer high levels of drosha and dicer are associated with improved survival whereas high levels of let7b hif1a eph a1 and poly adpribose polymerase are associated with worse survival cancers that are positive for wt1 carry a worse prognosis estrogenreceptor positive cancers have a better prognosis 21survival rates  editoverall fiveyear survival rates for all types of ovarian cancer are presented below by stage and histologic grade 16stage survival i 90â€“95ii

96iv 77recurrence rates  editovarian cancer frequently recurs after treatment overall in a 5year period 20 of stage i and ii cancers recur most recurrences are in the abdomen 19 if a recurrence occurs in advanced disease it typically occurs within 18 months of initial treatment 18 months progressionfree survival  recurrences can be treated but the diseasefree interval tends to shorten and chemoresistance increases with each recurrence 18 when a dysgerminoma recurs it is most likely to recur within a year of diagnosis and other malignant germ cell tumors recur within 2 years 90 of the time germ cell tumors other than dysgerminomas have a poor prognosis when they relapse with a 10 longterm survival rate 22 low malignant potential tumors rarely relapse even when fertilitysparing surgery is the treatment of choice 15 of lmp tumors relapse after unilateral surgery in the previously unaffected ovary and they are typically easily treated with surgery more advanced tumors may take up to 20 years to relapse if they relapse at all and are only treated with surgery unless the tumor has changed its histological characteristics or grown very quickly in these cases and when there is significant ascites chemotherapy may also be used relapse is usually indicated by rising ca125 levels and then progresses to symptomatic relapse within 2â€“6 months 19 recurrent sex cordstromal tumors are typically unresponsive to treatment but not aggressive 22it is the most deadly gynecologic cancer 19epidemiology  editagestandardized death from ovarian cancer per 100000 inhabitants in 2004 75no

per 100000 in developing countries 18 globally about 160000 people died from ovarian cancer in 2010 this was an increase from 113000 in 1990 76 the number of new cases per year in europe is approximately 5â€“15 per 100000 women 21 in europe lithuania latvia ireland slovakia and the czech republic have the highest incidences of ovarian cancer whereas portugal and cyprus have the lowest incidences 21 in 2008 the fiveyear survival rate was 44 this has increased since 1977 when the survival rate was 36 69united states  editovarian cancer cases diagnosed by age group in the us 73in 2010 in the united states an estimated 21880 new cases were diagnosed and 13850 women died of ovarian cancer around 1800 of the new diagnoses were sexcord or stromal tumors 16in 2014 over 220000 diagnoses of epithelial ovarian cancer were made yearly 18 the overall lifetime risk in the us is around 16 16 21 in the us ovarian cancer affects 13â€“14 and is the cause of death of about 1 of women 19 77 in the united states it is also the fifthmost common cancer in women but the fourthmost common cause of cancer death 21 this decrease made it the ninthmost common cancer in women 19the risks from developing specific types of ovarian cancer varies germ cell tumors and sex cordstromal tumors are less common than epithelial tumors the number of new cases a year in the us is 04 per 100000 women and 02 per 100000 women respectively in young people sexcord stromal tumors and germ cell tumors total 1 of overall ovarian cancer 22 ovarian cancer represents approximately 4 of cancers diagnosed in women 21united kingdom  editit is the 5th most common cancer in uk women 21 24 in the uk the incidence rate over the whole population is 216 per 100000 in the united kingdom as of 2014 approximately 7000â€“7100 yearly diagnoses with 4200 deaths 18 24 the risk in the uk is similar at 17 ashkenazi jewish women carry mutated brca alleles five times more often than the rest of the population giving them a higher risk developing ovarian cancer 18 it is the fifthleading cause of cancerrelated deaths in the us in 2008 and estimated to be 15000 16 77 ovarian cancer is the fifthmost common cancer in women in the uk around 7100 women were diagnosed with the disease in 2011 and it is the fifthmost common cause of cancer death in women around 4300 women died in 2012 78ethnicity  editblack women have twice the risk for sex cordstromal tumors compared to nonblack women 22older women  editin the us the incidence rate in women over 50 is approximately 33 per 100000 79 the rate of ovarian cancer between 1993 and 2008 decreased in women of the 40â€“49 age cohort and in the 50â€“64 age cohort 18 ovarian cancer is most commonly diagnosed after menopause 24 between the ages of 60 and 64 ninety percent of ovarian cancer occurs in women over the age of 45 and 80 in women over 50 21 older women are more likely to present with advanced ovarian cancer 15in pregnancy  editmalignant germ cell tumors are the type of ovarian cancer most likely to occur during pregnancy they are typically diagnosed when an adnexal mass is found on examination in 1â€“2 of all pregnancies a tumor is seen on ultrasound or the parents level of alphafetoprotein is elevated dermoid cysts and dysgerminomas are the most common germ cell tumors during pregnancy germ cell tumors diagnosed during pregnancy are unlikely to have metastasized and can be treated by surgery and in some cases chemotherapy which carries the risk of birth defects yolk sac tumors and immature teratomas grow particularly quickly and are usually treated with chemotherapy even during pregnancy however dysgerminomas that have been optimally debulked may be treated after childbirth 22other animals  editovarian tumors have been reported in equine mares reported tumor types include teratoma 80 81 cystadenocarcinoma 82 and particularly granulosa cell tumor 83 84 85 86 87research  editscreening  editscreening by hysteroscopy to obtain cell samples obtained for histological examination is being developed this is similar to the current pap smear that is used to detect cervical cancer 88 the uk collaborative trial of ovarian cancer screening is testing a screening technique that combines ca125 blood tests with transvaginal ultrasound 18 other studies suggest that this screening procedure may be effective 62 however its not yet clear if this approach could actually help to save livesâ€”the full results of the trial will be published in 2015 89 one major problem with screening is no clear progression of the disease from stage i noninvasive to stage iii invasive is seen and it may not be possible to find cancers before they reach stage iii another problem is that screening methods tend to find too many suspicious lesions most of which are not cancer but malignancy can only be assessed with surgery 18 the roca method combined with transvaginal ultrasonography is being researched in highrisk women to determine if it is a viable screening method it is also being investigated in normalrisk women as it has shown promise in the wider population 19 studies are also in progress to determine if screening helps detect cancer earlier in people with brca mutations 62prognosis research  editresearch into various prognostic factors for ovarian cancer is also going on recent research shows that thrombocytosis predicts lower survival and higher stage cancer 18 ongoing research is also investigating the benefits of surgery for recurrent ovarian cancer 62immunotherapy  editwhile an active area of research no immunotherapy has been shown to be effective as of 2013 90 however trials of the antibody and vegf inhibitor bevacizumab which can slow the growth of new blood vessels in the cancer have shown promising results especially in combination with pazopanib which also slows the process of blood vessel growth bevacizumab has been particularly effective in preliminary studies on stageiii and iv cancer 18 and has been cited as having at least a 15 response rate 16 it is being investigated particularly in mucinous ovarian cancers 62pharmacology  editm tor inhibitors were a highly investigated potential treatment in the 2000s and 2010s but the side effects of these drugs particularly hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia were not well tolerated and the survival benefit not confirmed pi3 kinase inhibitors have been of interest but they tend to be highly toxic and cause diarrhea another investigated drug is selumetinib a mapk inhibitor it improved survival but did not correlate with any mutations found in tumors 18bevacizumab can also be combined with platinum chemotherapy a combination that has had positive preliminary results in pfs but equivocal results regarding overall survival one disadvantage to these treatments is the side effect profile which includes high blood pressure and proteinuria the drug can also exacerbate bowel disease leading to fistulae or bowel perforation vintafolide which consists of an antifolate conjugated with vinblastine is also in clinical trials it may prove beneficial because folate receptors are overexpressed in many ovarian cancers 18 another potential immunotherapy is trastuzumab which is active against tumors positive for her2neu mutations 16 other angiogenesis inhibitors are also being investigated as potential ovarian cancer treatments combretastatin and pazopanib are being researched in combination for recurrent ovarian cancer trebananib and tasquinimod are other angiogenesis inhibitors being investigated the monoclonal antibody farletuzumab is being researched as an adjuvant to traditional chemotherapy another type of immunotherapy involves vaccines including tro vax 62an alternative to bep chemotherapy a regimen of 3 cycles of carboplatin and etoposide is a current topic of research for germ cell malignancies 22intraperitoneal chemotherapy has also been under investigation during the 2000s and 2010s for its potential to deliver higher doses of cytotoxic agent to tumors preliminary trials with cisplatin and paclitaxel have shown it is not well tolerated but does improve survival and more tolerable regimens are being researched 18 cisplatin and paclitaxel are both being researched as intraperitoneal chemotherapy agents a specific chemotherapy regimen for rare clearcell cancers is also under investigation irinotecan combined with cisplatin 62parp inhibitors have also shown promise in early trials particularly in people with brca gene mutations since the brca protein interacts with the parp pathway it is also being studied in recurrent ovarian cancer in general where preliminary studies have shown longer pfs specifically olaparib has shown greater survival compared to doxorubicin though this treatment is still being investigated it is not clear yet which biomarkers are predictive of responsiveness to parp inhibitors 18 rucaparib is another parp inhibitor being researched in brcapositive and brcanegative recurrent advanced ovarian cancer niraparib is a parp inhibitor being tested in brcapositive recurrent ovarian cancer 62tyrosine kinase inhibitors are another investigational drug class that may have applications in ovarian cancer angiogenesis inhibitors in the receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor group including pazopanib cediranib and nintedanib have also been shown to increase progression free survival pfs but their benefit for overall survival has not been investigated as of 2015 18 preliminary research showed that cediranib combined with platins in recurrent ovarian cancer increased the time to second recurrence by 3â€“4 months and increased survival by 3 months 62 mk1775 is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is being used in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin in platinumsensitive cancers with p53 mutations nintedanib is being researched as a potential therapy in combination with cyclophosphamide for people with recurrences 62hormones and radiation  edithormone therapies are a topic of current research in ovarian cancer particularly the value of certain medications used to treat breast cancer these include tamoxifen letrozole and anastrozole preliminary studies have showed a benefit for tamoxifen in a small number of people with advanced ovarian cancer letrozole may help to slow or stop growth of estrogen receptor positive ovarian cancer anastrozole is being investigated in postmenopausal people with estrogen receptorpositive cancer 62research into mitigating side effects of ovarian cancer treatment is also ongoing radiation fibrosis the formation of scar tissue in an area treated with radiation may be relieved with hyperbaric oxygen therapy but research has not been completed in this area treatment of ovarian cancer may also cause people to experience psychiatric difficulties including depression research is ongoing to determine how counseling and psychotherapy can help people who have ovarian cancer during treatment 62inflammation  editthere are some indications that pelvic inflammatory disease may be associated with ovarian cancer especially in nonwestern countries it may be due to the inflammatory process present with pelvic inflammatory disease 91clinical trials  editclinical trials are monitored and funded by us governmental organizations to test treatment options to see if they
