bicycles are divided into a seemingly endless number of categories and subcategories the following list will help you understand all the various styles and features mountain bike mountain bikes usually have 26” or 29″ wide knobby tires which allow them to be ridden in loose dirt and over obstacles these bikes have flat handlebars and rugged frames and components mountain bikes often have suspension to help any cyclist navigate rocky mountain trails many people ride mountain bikes on roads as well as trails this does the bike no harm it could be likened to one driving an suv on the highway the vehicle will operate fine–it is simply not the most efficient choice while mountainstyle bikes come in all price ranges the lower end recreational versions are not suited for aggressive mountain biking but work great for trips on smooth dirt paths hybridcomfort bike hybrids and sport comfort bikes share the same comfort features but are distinguished by wheel size traditionally hybrids have a larger road bike sized wheel with a slightly thinner compared to the comfort bikes which yield smaller mountain style wheels both bikes are loaded with comfort features and will work equally well on smooth dirt paved trails and family cycling trips these bikes have a very upright position meant for comfort road bike road bikes can be identified by their skinny tires and downturned or “drop” handlebars these bikes rule the road due to their extreme efficiency and speed the larger thin tires help it glide along the road with little effort while the multiposition handlebar offers grip variations from upright to more aggressive a road bike is the supreme choice for anyone whose intent is to ride on pavement especially for longer rides it is our great fortune to live in an area with an abundance of great roads for cycling triathlontime trial bike bicycles built specifically for triathlon or time trial events are basically specialized road bikes these machines have forward bullhorn shaped handlebars and aero bars aero bars allow the rider to lean forward in an aerodynamic position the shifters on these bikes are located at the end of the aero bars the geometry of the bicycle frame is designed to suit triathlon or time trial racing both heavily focused on aerodynamics bmxtrick bike bmx stands for bicycle motor cross because these singlespeed bikes are raced around

are a lot of fun and the bikes are versatile so they are a great doanything bike track bikefixed gear a track bike is a road bike with a single gear that does not freewheel or coast this means the cyclist cannot coast on this style of bike in fact true track bikes do not even have brakes so the athlete must use their leg strength to stop the cranks from turning which stops the motion of the bike track racing is done in an indoor track with banked turns called a velodrome fixed gear bikes are the outdoor version of a track bike they have a single fixed gear but may have brakes and different styles of handlebars these bikes are often used for racers in training because they force the athlete to spin their legs in a consistent circle and run a higher cadence they are also used in cities or as foul weather bikes because there are so few moving parts on a fixed gear they are inexpensive and little can go wrong finally many individuals ride “fixies” for the noblest of all reasons fun fun coupled with a deep rooted nostalgic connection to the early years of cycling when all bikes were fixed gears tandem a tandem is a bicycle built for two they come in many styles and are the great leveler of the cycling world two riders of different abilities can enjoy a ride at the same pace when riding a tandem they work well with younger riders new cyclists or the blind tandems do not require any special skill to ride and can be great fun…as long as you don’t argue about who is pedaling more adult trike an adult trike is exactly what it sounds like a three wheeled bike designed for an adult these bikes come in many different configurations trikes can be used by people who have difficulty balancing as industrial transportation vehicles or by someone who simply enjoys fun on three wheels folding bike a folding bike can be a great travel companion because they fold they fit easily on a subway in the trunk of a car or on a boat when traveling by air one can avoid the additional

beach cruiser is a bicycle designed for riding short distances on flat terrain like a boardwalk cruisers are identifiable by high handle bars and usually have fenders and chain guards typically these bicycles only have a few speeds since they are not designed to be ridden in hilly areas recumbent recumbent bicycles are nontraditional looking bicycles where one sits lower to the ground in a seat that looks like a chair they come in many different configurations consisting of long to short wheelbases above and under seat steering two three and four wheel varieties tandem recumbents and many other variations the back rest of the seat allows the rider to turn a larger gear since they have something to brace against similar to doing a seated leg press however when riding a recumbent one cannot stand as they pedal up a challenging hill share this
