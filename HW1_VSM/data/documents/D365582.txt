michel foucault what is an author michel foucault is not a freudian a marxist a structuralist a phenomenologist a sociologist or a historian but his work draws on ideas and assumptions and methods from all of these areas or disciplines rather think of foucault like derrida and like freud as the founder of his own school of thought he is a poststructuralist thinker with affinities to most all the other theorists weve read so far but he is enough unlike them that we should think of him in a category all his own foucault starts off this essay what is an author by discussing criticisms of a previous book the order of things in this book foucault had started an investigation into the conditions of possibility under which human beings become the objects of knowledge in certain disciplines what we might call the human sciences or the social sciences he was working to discover and explain the rules and laws of formation of systems of thought in the human sciences which emerge in the nineteenth century his main method for looking at these disciplines and how they constitute the objects of their study was through examining discourses or discursive practices for foucault a discourse is a body of thought and writing that is united by having a common object of study a common methodology andor a set of common terms and ideas the idea of discourse thus allows foucault to talk about a wide variety of texts from different countries and different historical periods and different disciplines and different genres for example the discourse on blindness would include writings by schools for the blind writings by doctors who work with vision and blindness novels with blind characters and autobiographies of blind people as well as writing about blindness from other disciplines in the order of things foucault discussed several naturalists including buffon a french 18th century writer and charles darwin a british 19th century writer as belonging to the same discourse or discursive family critics questioned this association asking foucault how he could put two authors who were so different in time and place together in one grouping foucault responds in this essay by asking why we are concerned with the idea of authors at all rather than seeing discourse as the groupings of texts and ideas why foucault asks do we always want to trace ideas back to specific authors why do we insist that ideas or concepts or even literary works are the creation of a single individual foucault makes a list on p 139a of some questions about authorship which he will not address directly rather he wants to discuss the relationship between an author and a text and the manner in which the text points to the author as a figure who is outside the text and who precedes the text and creates it eventually foucault will talk about the author as a derridean center of the text the place which originates the text yet remains outside it then of course he will deconstruct that centerauthor but before he does that foucault talks about samuel beckett the modernist novelist and playwright and particularly about a line from beckett what matter whos speaking foucault sees this sentence as an expression of some of the major principles of contemporary writing or what foucault calls ecriture this ecriture is related to the french feminist idea of lecriture feminine but foucault doesnt choose to give it a gender one of the hallmarks of ecriture is the interplay of signifiers language in this kind of writing is not about reference to a signified but rather its about the play among signifiers the ecriture that foucault is discussing tends toward the monologic rather than the dialogic in bakhtins terms it is writing that is selfreferential writing about writing or about language itself rather than writing forabout social communication as such this writing is always working against the grammatical rules and structures within which meaning or sense is made because of this foucault concludes such ecriture is not about the exalted emotions related to the act of composition writing is not the vehicle for the authors expression of hisher emotions or ideas since writing isnt meant to communicate from author to reader but rather writing is the circulation of language itself regardless of the individual existence of author or reader it is primarily concerned with creating an opening where the writing subject endlessly disappears p 139b another major theme or principle of ecriture that foucault sees expressed in the beckett quote is the idea of a connection between writing and death throughout most of western cultural history writing has been a means of staving off death of becoming immortal foucault points to the greek epic where the hero can die young because his epic feats have guaranteed his immortality and also to a nonwestern text the arabian nights where scheherazades storytelling night after night kept her from being killed in modern times however writing  ecriture reverses the equation rather than guaranteeing immortality or keeping death away writing kills the author why foucault says that a writers particular individuality is canceled out by the text by writing because we now see writer or author as the function of language itself in the humanist model the categories of author text and reader seemed selfevident and separate an author is someone who produces a text which is then read by a reader the author was the source and origin of some creative power which was unique to him or her and out of which she created something entirely new in the poststructuralist view however relations between author text and reader are replaced by an understanding of the relations between language as a structure and subjects positions we inhabit within the structure of language althusser showed us how we are interpellated as subjects into ideological structures and we discussed how that applies to literature as readers each of us becomes an interpellated subject within one or more textual ideologies foucault uses the same premises to conclude that author like reader is the name of a subject position within language or more specifically within a text or textual ideology so why does foucault say the author is dead its his way of saying that the author is decentered shown to be only a part of the structure a subject position and not the center in the humanist view remember authors were the source and origin of texts and perhaps of language itself like derridas engineer and were also thus beyond textshence authors were centers in declaring the author dead foucault follows nietzsches declaration at the end of the nineteenth century that god is dead a statement which derrida then reads as meaning that god is no longer the center of the system of philosophy which nietzsche is rejecting by declaring the death of the author foucault is deconstructing the idea that the author is the origin of something original and replacing it with the idea that the author is the product or function of writing of the text foucault also borrows the idea of the death of the author from poststructuralist literary critic roland barthes his essay the death of the author appears in a collection of barthes essays entitled imagemusictext  an author only exists as the product of a text or of writing that is primarily what foucaults article explores what an author produces according to foucault is a work the task of humanist criticism used to be to trace the ties between an author and the work she created by reading the work as an illustration of the authors individual life history of his or her particular concerns thematics etc foucault says that once we throw the idea of author as individual creator into question what do we mean by work another way of putting this is to ask once we have an author does everything she wrote belong to the idea of herhis work for example think of that writing we discussed with bakhtin two pounds ground beefseedless grapesloaf bread if we knew that this was written by t s eliot would it count as one of his works would it matter whether we thought it was a poem or a grocery list why or why not foucault says that we need to have some sort of theory to explain or analyze questions about what counts as an authors work a related question is whether anonymous writings can be considered works even though they have no specific author foucault then takes a bit of a digression pp 140b141a to discuss how ecriture in emphasizing the play of signification over any fixed or stable meaning doesnt really get rid of the idea of authorship completely but rather makes authors transcendental rather than historically real dont worry about this part on 141b foucault takes up the question of author as product of work again asking how the name of the author serves a function within literarysocial relations the name of the author not to be confused with lacans nameofthefather is first of all a proper name a signifier that designates a specific and discrete historical individual just as your name designates you as a specific historical individual but an authors name does more than that when we say aristotle or shakespeare or even foucault we mean more than just the guy who livedwe also mean the thoughts he is attributed with the mode of thinking the objects of contemplation the methodology andor the writings or forms of discourse associated with that name the proper name of an author oscillates between two poles between designation which refers to the person and description which refers to the ideas the work associated with the name designation and description are not the same not isomorphous the proper name as a signifier can have either the signified of the actual person the designation or the signified of the workideas in each case the relation between signifier and signifiedbetween proper name and what it either designates or describesis arbitrary and separable for example shakespeare can refer to the guy who lived in stratfordonavon in the seventeenth century or it can refer to the numerous plays and poems linked under the name shakespeare the idea of the separability of designation and description becomes clear when someone argues that shakespeare did not write the plays of shakespearemeaning that the historical figure is not actually the guy responsible for the body of works called the plays of shakespeare such a sentence makes sense only if shakespeare signifies two separate things this shows that the authors name serves as a means of identification not simply as an element of speech the name shakespeare groups together a number of texts and differentiates them from others shakespeare marks what is not g eliot and what is not t s eliot etc the authors name according to foucault characterizes a particular manner of existence of discourse the texts attributed to an author are given more status more attention and more cultural value than texts which have no author we would read the grocery list we talked about last week differently if we knew it was written by t s eliot the authors name thus remains at the contours of texts foucault says separating one from another and characterizing their mode of existence the name of the author is thus a variable a signifier which accompanies only certain texts to the exclusion of others there are four features of texts or books which have authorsor in foucaults terms texts which create the author function1 such texts are objects of appropriation forms of property speeches and books were assigned to real authors foucault argues only when the authors became subjected to punishments for what the speech or book said when the writingspeech said something transgressive something that broke rules then systems of authority like althussers rsas had to find some locus from which the transgressive speech came the cops and courts had to find someone to punish foucaults example is that of heresy when heresy was uttered there had to be a heretic behind the utterance since you cant punish words or ideas but only the people who author those words or ideas from this idea of locating authorship in someone held responsible for writing or speech came also the idea of ownership of works and the idea of copyright rules associated with ownership2 the author function is not a universal or constant feature of every text some texts dont require or create an author myths fairy tales folk stories legends jokes etc it used to be that literary texts could be anonymous whereas scientific texts had to be attached to a name to an author function because the credibility of the scientific text came from the name of the author associated with it pliny says aristotle says hippocrates says etc in the 17th and 18th centuries foucault says this situation was reversed scientific texts began to speak for themselves to be objective and thus to be judged on the basis of the arguments presented and the reproducibility of results and not on the authority of an individual authors name literary works in this era began to be evaluated on the basis of the notion of the authorhence the emergence of the idea of shakespeare as author function not just as some guy who hung out in london theaters in the elizabethan era in contemporary society we see this illustrated in the idea of an anonymous literary work like primary colors where the goal is to find out who really wrote itto be able to associate the text with an author function3 the author function is not formed spontaneously through some simple attribution of a discourse to an individual rather it results from various cultural constructions in which we choose certain attributes of an individual as authorial attributes and dismiss others thus in creating melville as an author function it is important to his status as author that he actually did go on a whaling voyage it is irrelevant to his status as author that he worked in a bowling alley in hawaii although both are historically true foucault says that philosophers and poets are not constructed as authors in the same way but that there are some transhistorical constants in how authors are culturally constructed he looks to st jerome as author function for these constants examining how several texts are attributed to a single authora texts are eliminated from the list of belonging to a particular author if they are markedly superior or inferior to other texts on the list hence the author function is a label of a certain standard level of quality this would keep the grocery list from being part of t s eliots work ie a text which generates an author function because the grocery list is not as good as the wastelandb a text is eliminated from the list of belonging to a particular author when the ideas in that text contradict or conflict with the ideas presented in other texts thus the author function denotes a field of conceptual or theoretical coherencec a text is eliminated from belonging to a particular author when the style is different from that of other texts belonging to that author when it uses words and phrases not found in other texts hence author function requires a stylistic uniformityd texts are eliminated which refer to events after the death of the author hence author function means a definite historical figure in which a series of events converge foucault reiterates these ideas on p 144a and modifies them only slightly the authors biography explains the presence of certain events in the text the author is a principle of unity the author neutralizes contradictions the author is a particular source of expression manifested equally well in texts letters fragments grocery lists etc4 the text always bears signs that refer to the author or create the author function the most easily recognizable of these signs is a pronoun i though we know better than to assume that the i of a narrator is identical to the i of an author foucault suggests that the author function arises out of the difference and separation between the author function and the writer signified in the text this is most easily seen in narrative fiction but is true of any form of discourse according to foucault at the end of the article foucault talks about the idea of a transdiscursive position people who are initiators of discursive practices not just individual texts such figures as marx and freud and foucault radically shift an entire mode of thinking the discourses they initiate make them more than just authors or author functions in the ways weve been talking about i wont go into the details of foucaults argument about this here it takes us further into foucaults own position as the initiator of analysis of discourses he ends his essay with some questions about the relations of subjects to discourse so we can end by looking at how foucault transforms the question of any subjects relation to language via bakhtins notion of discourse ie the idea that language s are socialhistorical formations rather than ahistorical structures as in saussures view in this sense look over the questions foucault poses on p 148 where he asks first about the relation of subject to discourse and then rewrites humanist questions about authors into discursive questions about author functions all
