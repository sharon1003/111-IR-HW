david schwimmer is among the cast of the audio thriller homecoming © jeff scheargetty images save fiona sturges november 25 2016 1until recently the words “audio drama” always struck dread into my soul aside from the odd bigbudget radio play most seemed to involve overwrought acting expositionary dialogue and some poor sap creaking door hinges next to a microphone now though not only are audio dramas enjoying a new lease of life online they have a new name fiction podcasts in this brave new world the production is sharp and nuanced the writing fresh and the cast are not plucked from the nearest amdram production but from hollywood brooklyn’s gimlet media best known for nonfiction gems such as heavyweight and reply all has leapt on this growing trend and just released its first thriller series homecoming complete with an impressively starry cast catherine keener oscar isaac david schwimmer and amy sedaris appear in this sixparter set in florida about a case worker and an army veteran who take part in a shady government programme known as the “homecoming initiative” keener plays heidi bergman a nervy kindhearted soul whose desire to help soldiers returning from conflict is being thwarted by her boss colin played by schwimmer who barks at her to be “surgically precise in identifying their experiences we need to get really granular with all that shit” when heidi proposes a more holistic approach he is unimpressed “what we’re seeking here is information not relationships not rapport”homecoming which comes in 25minute episodes and will be delivered box setstyle in seasons flips between past and present thus we meet heidi five years later now working as a waitress in a diner and tending to her elderly mother who is concerned about her daughter’s state of mind heidi clearly left the homecoming initiative in a hurry and both her mother and a visiting government official are suspicious and keen to find out more two episodes in and the thriller aspect of homecoming hasn’t quite heated up but there’s still time for that currently the tension lies in the building relationships the exchanges between heidi and colin in particular constructed around stressed phone calls in which colin is forever in transit his temper ready to detonate are expertly done meanwhile the selfharming fantasies of oscar isaac’s former soldier — “i saw the desk and i just imagined leaning way back and slamming my forehead into the corner” — make for unsettling listening realism and storytelling are at the heart of homecoming it’s about believable writing and smart performances not narrative signposts and creaking doors thanks heavens for that those who like their fiction podcasts with a hint of menace will enjoy limetown about a tennessee town whose inhabitants have gone missing told from the perspective of a visiting reporter this longrunning series requires dedication but in blending serial style reportage with the creepy drama of the xfiles it’s quite the thrill ride copyright the financial times limited 2018 all rights reserved follow the topics in this article gimlet media inc add to my ftfiona sturges add to my ftlife  arts add to my ftarts add to my ftoscar isaac add to my ft
