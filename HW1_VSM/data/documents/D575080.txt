sunako nakahara 中原 スナコ nakahara sunako is the female protagonist who usually locks herself away inside her room and chooses to live without any desire for life after a traumatic experience when she was rejected and told that she was hideous by her first love sunako is a lover of solitude gory movies murder anatomical dolls and objects that reflect the ugly side of life as she puts it her interests resulted in her distorted view of reality and isolation contributed to her low selfesteem contents  showpersonality edit the character of sunako is very selfconscious and has a fairly bad selfimage of herself she frequently calls herself ugly and never acknowledges herself as a beautiful person most of the time she can be found in dark spaces or areas that are believed to be haunted at the same time the author shows that sunako also has very strong convictions this could range anywhere from defending her fellow characters to refusing to do anything she dislikes such as making a collage of pineapples on her wall it is frequently shown in both the anime and manga however that sunako has no problem compromising some values ie dressing up in order to further her own ends sunakos fascination with all things dark and morbid resembles that of the storys creator albeit in a more extreme form in instance a constant theme of sunakos personality is her view of beautiful and ugly people she sees herself as ugly while viewing characters such as kyohei or noi as incredibly beautiful sunakos belief appears to be that while beautiful people can become ugly ugly people can never become beautiful in the manga sunako often reacts violently to the presence of beauty believing that ugly people such as her should stay in the darkness however the problems with sunakos retreat from the world is that it limits her capacity for life as well as keeping her from fairly viewing all that is around her it can be suggested that by sunako adopting such a severe viewpoint on ugly and beautiful people she has become exactly the type of person that she despises one such character similarity can be seen by comparing the person who rejected sunako at the beginning of the manga and sunako herself assuming that kyohei couldnt understand her due to his beauty surprisingly she is also an excellent cook and also very athletic intelligent and a good pianist she is also very beautiful with long black hair fair skin and a great body when in regular anime form however sunako changes becoming ugly with dry cracked skin pimples and all in chibi form she refers to beautiful people as creatures of light and ugly people such as herself as creatures of darkness in the translation in america whenever she sees a creature of light she gets nosebleeds and theyre usually severe when she sees kyohei despite her negative attitude once she is driven to do something sunako is quite capable of doing things that no one expects her to complete there is also a possibility that she may have supernatural abilities ie plants wilting near her and windows shattering by an unseen force she is also seen to be loyal to her friends especially towards noi and tamao as she shown to care about them more then the boys an example was in chapter 102 when kyohei yuki ranmaru and noi accidently ate mushrooms that changed their personalities and she wasnt interested in getting the antidote for the boys but quickly changed her mind when seeing noi might do something pervert to takenaga while still cheering for her in becoming closer to takenaga another was in chapter 111 when both sunako and ranmaru were kidnapped and was held for a 1 billion dollar ransom the kidnapper plans to cut and torture ranmaru which excites sunako but when tamao barges in with the ransom money she quickly shows more concern for her safety and urges her to get out while she still can also despite how she acts sunako seems to deeply care about her housemates going so far as trying to kill anyone who mess with them despite the fact that she tried to kill kyohei many times herself appearance edit most of the time sunako can be seen in super deformed mode however whenever she is in a situation where her inner beauty comes forth she almost magically transforms into a beautiful young woman much to the surprise of many onlookers sunakos inner beauty frequently emerges whenever her characters viewpoint is challenged causing her to change her belief system about beauty and humanity in general when sunako is not in a deformed mode she has dark long straight black hair she is very tall for a average japanese girl sunako looks like a model when not in chibi form she is considered to be beautiful but doesnt consider herself as one due to her lowself esteem sunako has lavender purple eyes with fair skin she is usually seen wearing a grey sweater with her weird floral skirt or her grey sweater with red jogging pants background edit sunako was born as the only child of mrs and mr nakahara after she was rejected by her first love sunako developed an obsession with darkness and a morbid fascination with blood horror movies and similarly dark things she hates excessive light exposure and also does poorly in hot weather though the latter is because she grew up in northern japan she has three friends a skeleton called josephine with husband sergeant george and two anatomical figures named hiroshikun and akirakun while she suffers from severely low selfesteem she is actually beautiful and a frighteningly tough fighter being able to lift someone twice her size with one hand she is portrayed mostly throughout the manga and anime in super deformed form or chibi form plot edit at the beginning of both the anime and the manga sunako is seen confessing her love to a faceless classmate only to have him rebuff her cruelly stating that he hated ugly girls since then sunako has thrown off any scraps of femininity that she may have possessed believing that it is a waste of time throughout the series so far sunako has held to the belief that she is ugly and is a creature of the darkness her aunt fearing that sunakos unladylike ways are not only limiting her at life but also at love bribes four young men with a promise of free rent if they can perform a pygmalionesque makeover on sunako for most of the manga and anime sunakos time is spent both avoiding yet caring for these young men as it is shown that they are almost completely incapable of performing everyday maintenance as the storyline progresses sunako begins to recognize beauty even remarking that roses are pretty so far in the manga sunakos back story has yet to be fully revealed but it is unsure if her fascination with the morbid and dark began with her transformation or if it was a hobby she had even before in the anime it is hinted that her fascination with things morbid began as a junior high student perhaps some time after she was rejected by the mystery boy her mother however has let her daughter do whatever she wants even going as far as helping sunako hide her disturbing collection from her horrified father as sunako progresses in her unwilling makeover she begins to realize her own selfworth and beauty as well as the effect her actions have on other people such as her aunt in chapter 62 she was finally able to confront her past and her friends at a school reunion who apologized for abandoning her when she became depressed including the cruel classmate and she realized he was a horrible person and called her ugly just to be cruel sunako got her revenge when she pleasantly said goodbye to her old classmates and they all saw how beautiful she was and the cruel classmate was shocked as well with another classmate telling him he dropped the ball on this one meaning him being cruel to sunako costed him his chance with sunako and she lost all affections for him and made him and her former classmates look like fools with that confrontation she is finally able to move on realizing that she has a new life and new friends relationships edit kyohei takano edit main article kyohei and sunakos relationship when they first met kyohei was actually the only one out of the four to be brave enough to confront sunakos gloomy aura kyoheis main priority and same for the rest was to transform sunako into a lady and if so her aunt their land lady would lower their rent sunako has a tendency of once she sets her eyes on kyohei she has an urge to want to kill him her reason is that  shes the only person who can kill him  she has not however thought of or mentioned killing kyohei for many chapters not even after kyohei kissed sunako recent chapters have seen her forget her first crush and she is now more open to other people including her peers and teachers at school shes also having less and less nosebleeds and though protests at first doesnt greatly mind spending time with kyohei in the manga sunako and kyoheis relationship begins to head in a romantic direction although they are both completely inexperienced with those feelings and dont realise their connection so far in the manga kyohei has kissed sunako three times the first two where either accidental or to rid her of an evil spirit but the third was entirely kyoheis choice although he unfortunately later decides he was just confused but even though their relationship is considered unclear it is obvious that the two of them developed romantic feelings for one another but just cant admit that they do have it kyohei and sunako deeply cares for each other and treasures one another noi kasahara edit noi is the first female friend of sunako in the series making her the closest one with her at school since most other people are scared of her she never really gets it or denies it when she does when noi implies she and kyohei would make a good couple noi in turn admires sunako for her toughness when they first met sunako gets a nosebleed as she sees noi as another creature of light at first
