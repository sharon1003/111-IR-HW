parliamentary procedure is present during the vote but does not cast a ballot 1 abstention must be contrasted with  blank vote  in which a voter casts a ballot willfully made invalid by marking it wrongly or by not marking anything at all a blank or white voter has voted although their vote may be considered a spoilt vote depending on each legislation while an abstaining voter hasnt voted both forms abstention and blank vote may or may not depending on the circumstances be considered to be a protest vote also known as a blank vote or white vote an abstention may be used to indicate the voting individuals ambivalence about the measure or mild disapproval that does not rise to the level of active opposition abstention can also be used when someone has a certain position about an issue but since the popular sentiment supports the opposite it might not be politically expedient to vote according to his or her conscience a person may also abstain when they do not feel adequately informed about the issue at hand or has not participated in relevant discussion in parliamentary procedure a member may be required to abstain in the case of a real or perceived conflict of interest 2 3abstentions do not count in tallying the vote negatively or positively when members abstain they are in effect attending only to contribute to a quorum white votes however may be counted in the total of votes depending on the legislation the noshow paradox the noshow paradox occurs when a voter has a more desirable outcome by not voting rather than voting according to hisher preferences in a hypothetical scenario with three candidates imagine if you did not vote your first favorite candidate is eliminated in the first stage of the voting but your secondfavorite candidate ends up winning the election againts your least favorite candidate if you did vote your favorite candidate might have made it through the first round of voting but would have then lost to your leastfavorite candidate in the next round you could achieve a better result by not voting than you would have by voting your true preferences so without any cost your benefitting by your second favorite candidate winning this is an instance of what fishburn and brams termed the noshow paradox contents  hide 1 active abstention2 international and national parliamentary procedures3 abstention campaigns4 justification5 criticisms6 see also7 references8 external links active abstention  editan active abstention can occur where a voter votes in a way that balances out their vote as if they had never voted this has occurred many times in the house of commons of the united kingdom during a division a process where a yesno vote occurs to agree or disagree to a motion a member of parliament may actively abstain by voting both yes and no this is effectively the same as not voting at all as the outcome will not be changed by the active abstention 4 however in the house of lords of the united kingdom active abstention is not possible as a lord voting both ways will be removed from the list of votes 5in another manner an intentionally spoilt vote could be interpreted as an active abstention  by whom an intentionally spoilt vote is caused by a voter who turns to an election and invalidates the ballot paper in some way because of the nature of an abstention only intentionally spoiled ballots could be counted as an active abstention  citation neededinternational and national parliamentary procedures  editcomparative results of canadian federal election with or without abstention in the united nations security council representatives of the five countries holding a veto power the united states united kingdom france russia and china sometimes abstain rather than vetoing a measure about which they are less than enthusiastic particularly if the measure otherwise has broad support by convention their abstention does not block the measure despite the wording of article 273 of the united nations charter if a majority of members of the united nations general assembly or one of its committees abstain on a measure then the measure fails in the council of the european union an abstention on a matter decided by unanimity has the effect of a yes vote on matters decided by qualified majority it has an effect of a no vote in the united states house of representatives and many other legislatures members may vote present rather than for or against a bill or resolution which has the effect of an abstention in the united states senate the presiding officer calls each senators name alphabetically and if abstaining the senator must give a reason for the abstention members may decline to vote in committee or on the floor on any matter which he or she believes would be a conflict of interest 6abstention campaigns  editthere have been a number of instances around the world where popular movements have boycotted elections in south africa there is a strong presence of abstention campaigns that make the structural argument that no political party truly represents the poor the  no land no house no vote  campaign which was started by the landless peoples movement in 2004 is the largest of such campaigns 7 8 these campaigns have been met with significant repression 9in 1999 a human rights activist was convicted in belarus for calling not to participate in the local elections he considered to be undemocratic in 2004 the united nations human rights committee found the conviction to violate freedom of expression 10other social movements and civil society organisations in other parts of the world also have similar campaigns or nonvoting preferences these include the naxalites in india the zapatista army of national liberation in mexico and various anarchist and left communist oriented movements in mexicos mid term 2009 elections there was strong support for nulo—a campaign to vote for no one 11 12 13 in india poor peoples movements in singur nandigram and lalgarh have rejected parliamentary politics as well as the ngo and maoist alternatives 14there have also been no vote campaigns in canada 15 and spain in september 2011 the new york times argued that there was a growing scorn for voting around the world 16justification  editin support for this nonpolitical strategy some nonvoters claim that voting does not make any positive difference if voting changed anything they’d make it illegal is an oftcited sentiment attributed to anarchist emma goldman 17in addition to strategic nonvoters there are also ethical nonvoters those who reject voting outright not merely as an ineffective tactic for change but moreover because they view the act as either a grant of consent to be governed by the state a means of imposing illegitimate control over ones countrymen or both thus this view holds that through voting one necessarily finds themselves violating the nonaggression principle herbert spencer noted that whether a person votes for the winning candidate votes for a losing candidate or abstains from voting he will be deemed to have consented to the rule of the winning candidate 18criticisms  editmurray rothbard while a libertarian himself criticized the new libertarian manifesto  s arguments that voting is immoral or undesirable 19“ lets put it this way suppose we were slaves in the old south and that for some reason each plantation had a system where the slaves were allowed to choose every four years between two alternative masters would it be evil and sanctioning slavery to participate in such a choice suppose one master was a monster who systematically tortured all the slaves while the other one was kindly enforced almost no work rules freed one slave a year or whatever it would seem to me not only not aggression to vote for the kinder master but idiotic if we failed to do so of course there might well be circumstances—say when both masters are similar—where the slaves would be better off not voting in order to make a visible protest—but this is a tactical not a moral consideration voting would not be evil but in such a case less effective than the protest but if it is morally licit and nonaggressive for slaves to vote for a choice of masters in the same way it is licit for us to vote for what we believe the lesser of two or more evils and still more beneficial to vote for an avowedly libertarian candidates”samuel edward konkin iii responded 20“ can you imagine slaves on a plantation sitting around voting for masters and spending their energy on campaigning and candidates when they could be heading for the “ underground railway ” surely they would choose the countereconomic alternative surely dr rothbard would urge them to do so and not be seduced into remaining on the plantation until the abolitionist slavemasters’ party is elected ”see also  editabstentionism apolitical criticisms of electoralism direct democracy election boycott elections electoral fraud electronic voting liberal democracy
