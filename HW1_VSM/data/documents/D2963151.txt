gymnosperms nakedseeds include plants that usually bear their seeds in conelike structures as opposed to the angiosperms flowering plants that have seeds enclosed in an ovary modern gymnosperms include the following extant divisions pinophyta ginkgophyta cycadophyta and gnetopyta pteridosperms or seed ferns represent early forms of gymnosperms ginkgophyta cycadophyta and pteridospermatophyta are explored in separate articles pinophytes more commonly known as conifers range from the carboniferous to recent times cordaitales and voltziales are wellknown extinct orders of pinophyta formerly coniferophyta the order pinales formerly coniferales has both extinct and extant genera pinales includes such familiar plants as pine spruce douglasfirs firs cypresses cedars junipers larches sequoias and yews yews use to be in a separate order taxales progymnosperms progymnosperms division progymnospermophyta range from the devonian to the carboniferous and are thought to represent the plant group from which all seed plants evolved progymnosperms were trees which reached heights of 8 meters and diameters up to 15 meters willis  mc elwain 2005 p 110 in 1960 the american paleobotanist charles beck published a paper describing the connection between the foliage known as archaeopteris and the wood callixylon archaeopteris was believed to be a fern while callixylon was thought to represent a gymnosperm the work of beck demonstrated that the foliage and wood belonged to the same plant archaeopteris is a true missing link between fernlike plants and coniferlike plants the trunk  callixylon of this tree was constructed of coniferlike wood while the branches were adorned with fernlike fronds  archaeopteris  the underside of the fronds had saclike sori that contained spores for reproduction it is easy to understand why the fernlike fronds and coniferlike wood of this tree were considered to be separate organisms until the fossils connecting the foliage and wood were discovered beckâ€™s observations led to the discovery of an extinct group of plants intermediate between ferns and conifers which are now grouped together as the progymnosperms kenrick  davis 2002 p 41 progymnosperms are well represented in the fossil record with three orders recognized aneurophytales archaeopteridales and protopityales willis  mc elwain 2005 p 110 archaeopteris could be referred to as the first modern tree as it made up a significant portion of the canopy of early devonian forests murphy 2006 archaeopteris page seeds  dry climates gymnosperms produce very small gametophytes within male and female cones the male gametophyte is the pollen and the female gametophyte are the eggs in the ovule the sperm of gymnosperms do not swim through water to reach the ovules  ginkgo biloba and cycads are the exception see taylor taylor and krings 2009 p 744 wind carried pollen transports the sperm when pollen lands near an ovule a pollen tube grows towards the ovule sperm travel down the pollen tube to the eggs in the ovule after fertilization the female cone closes up to seal the developing seeds seeds encase the developing plant embryo providing them with nutrients and protection from the surrounding environment seeds allow embryos to remain dormant during unfavorable conditions pollen frees gymnosperms from the need to have water for fertilization seeds allow gymnosperms to delay germination until favorable conditions exist these reproductive strategies gave gymnosperms a distinct advantage over the spore producing plants in dry environments cordaitales cordaites order cordaitales are conifer like plants that range from the pennsylvanian to the permian cordaites grew as shrubs and trees cordaite trees possessed a slender trunk adorned with a branching crown of leaves cordaite stems were eusteles that possessed a rather large pith as the tree grew the pith broke down to create a hollow area artisia is the pith cast of cordaites the stem was composed of secondary wood surrounded by bark cordaites had long leathery straplike leaves with many parallel veins the leaves were spirally arranged around the stem cordaites had loosely compacted cones with heartshaped pendulous seeds cones are given the name cordaianthus and individual seeds are known as cordiacarpus tidwell 1998 pp 103104 cordaites populated mangrovelike and dry upland habitats cordaite trees were among the tallest in the late carboniferous and permian forests willis  mc elwain 2002 p 114 voltziales voltziales order voltziales commonly known as walchias range from the carboniferous to the triassic the habit and wood structure of voltziales was different from that of cordaites voltziales were large trees that possessed needlelike leaves pollen and seeds were organized in cones at the end of leafy branches voltziales are traditionally viewed as an evolutionary transition between cordaites and modern families of conifers order pinales bhatnagar  moitra 1996 p 167 taylor taylor  krings 2009 p 828 the reproductive structures of voltziales are intermediate between cordaitales and coniferales in overall appearance however they were much like the araucaria of the coniferales kenrick  davis 2004 p 95 some of the earliest conifers belong to the voltziales family utrechtiaceae formerly known as lebachiaceae and walchiaceae utrechia is a wellknown permian aged member of this family ultrechia was a 5meter tree or shrub like most conifers it had a eustele stem needlelike leaves arranged spirally and branches in whorls male cones were very much like extant conifers however female cones possessed a structure between that of cordaites and modern conifers pinales pinales originated from members of voltziales which in turn have their origins within the cordaitales willis  mc elwain 2002 p 150 the fossil record of modern pinales families dates back to the triassic taylor taylor  krings 2009 p 870 pinales can be found in just about any environment in the world in some biomes such as the taiga conifers are the dominant plant roughly 700 extant species represent pinales modern day conifers grow as shrubs or trees arborescent conifers exhibit a pyramidal growth form leaves are usually needlelike but can also show a broad flat shape conifers bear seeds in woody cones except for junipers which have a berrylike structure most conifers are monoecious but bear male and female reproductive structures in different cones on different parts of the tree conifers have eustele stems arranged in whorls conifer stems are woody cylinders made of interconnected tubes of xylem for water conduction impregnated with lignin this type of stem is resistant to buckling and can support profuse branching and large crowns kenrick  davis 2004 p 70 conifers possess a branching tap root system a new age of plants conifers increased in numbers during the permian and underwent a major radiation during the triassic this major radiation came with a climate that was warm and seasonal with alternating wet and dry conditions willis  mc elwain 2002 p 149 conifers came to dominate the canopy of forests during the triassic and jurassic periods the diversification of conifers during the mesozoic helps to mark a significant change in the worlds flora paleozoic flora was dominated by ferns and clubmosses paleophytic flora the paleophytic flora gave way to a mesophytic flora during the triassic period woody seedbearing plants and their relatives dominated mesophytic flora thus the change from paleophytic to mesophytic represented a change in reproductive strategy from spore producers to seed producers conifers cycads and ginkgos diversified during this time and dominated the landscape kenrick  davis 2004 p 143 araucarioxylon arizonicum is a conifer found in the triassic chinle formation and is the state fossil for arizona metasequoia leaves from eocene deposits are the state fossil for oregon teredo petrified wood contains the borings of the teredo bivalve mollusc the borings are known as teredolites ichnofacies  teredo wood is the state fossil for north dakota teredo petrified wood specimens represent both conifers and angiosperms petrified wood in general is the state gem for washington many types of conifers and angiosperms are represented by mioceneaged fossil wood from washington science olympiad fossil event the 2016 science olympiad fossil list inludes the genus metasequoia within the phylum pinophyta petrified wood listed under other could also fit within this category
