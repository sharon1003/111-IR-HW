to exotic car dealership specializing in ferrari lamborghini and porsche  serving seattle wa and go to the finance page and enter the price interest of around 68 and you will get the monthly price

invest the money somewhere that it will make a higher rate of return than the interest you pay example you pay 8 interest on a car loan but invested the cash in your business and made 20 with it 6

do a search i sleep better when i dont owe anyone money i dipped into my home equity line 3 and tax deductible to make the purchase but that should be paid off in a couple months if you manage your finances well you should be able to afford your lambo and all the other important things in life best of luck to you 7  permalink 07052011 0358 pmkev647senior member join date oct 18 2010location portland orposts 356gallery 0purchase fully with cash my recommendation not only for the interest rate but because if you can save up that amount of money while still holding everything together you get a better understanding if you can afford it trying to finance it may give an impression that you can afford it when in reality something may come up and now a significant part of your cashflow is committed where if you had saved that sum up in a separate account with a rainyday fund and paid for it in cash you would know exactly where your cash flow is and how you will use it granted this method may delay the purchase if you have to save up but it will be for peace of mind and you can really enjoy the car good luck if you wait to be fed you wont learn how to hunt 8  permalink 07052011

when you can borrow someone elses money assuming attractive financing terms and a higher return on the cash invested elsewhere many additional factors can justify financingleasing such as reducing high sales tax or financing through a business so many factors to consider certainly operating costs are always something to research talk to current owners to get a feel and read these forums as many above have noted having no financial burden looming over the car can allow you greater peace of mind to know that if any unexpected expense should arise you not overwhelmed with a monthly payment as well life is short yesterday is history tomorrows a mystery and today is a gift thats why they call it present my rule of thumb in life is if i have to alter what ive committed to saving for retirement roughly 30 of my gross than i cant afford it always remember to pay yourself first there not unaffordable they may just require compromise in other areas woodside credit does longer term financing with at least 25 down youll get raped on interest but many finance longer than 60 months my advice with a longer term loan is to commit to paying more than the minimum payment to pay it off early the reality of it is according to multiple lamborghini dealerships in the us is that 80 say they paid cash when in actuality only 20 truly did 9  permalink 07052011 0855 pmkev647senior member

would have my fund for the payoff amount ready but finance it to keep those funds for emergencies thats also one way to go kind of a hybrid if you wait to be fed you wont learn how to hunt 10
