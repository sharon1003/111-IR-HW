named constitutional conversations and included very interesting and diverse perspectives on the role of constitutional freedom in contemporary american culture since then it has changed to a more general discussion on topics relevant to the us today including politics economics racial justice or injustice and more i highly recommend this podcast to anyone who is genuinely interested in understanding others viewpoints on american society and culture more digital debatesby joest one of the best podcasts out there although i wish the subject matter did not revolve around authors selling their books quite so much the general level of discourse is exceedingly high and of great interest to anyone interested in constitutional history or the great issues of the day the recent discussion by slade gordon and richard benveniste of the 911 commission on the status of their recommendations as well as their observations on katrina was fascinating these podcasts are typically an hour but an hour that flies by more the entire seriesby bob unger congratulations on a great program and your vision in moving fast to allow people like me sitting in a mountain cabin with a wifi
