mar012004articles  advisories publication the nassau lawyer focus on business and corporate law is there a fiduciary relationship between franchisor and franc in franchise litigation it is not uncommon for franchisees to argue that a fiduciary relationship exists between them and their franchisors such an argument is most often advanced in an attempt to impose upon the franchisor duties that do not appear in the franchise agreement including unwritten disclosure obligations in connection with the sale of the franchise a fiduciary duty requires the fiduciary to act with “the highest kind of loyalty”1 and generally speaking does not result from an armslength business relationship applying that principle the appellate division second department2 as well as the vast majority of state and federal courts have held that a franchise relationship generally is not fiduciary in nature recently two nassau supreme court judges reached the same conclusion in ahmed v getty petroleum marketing inc3 a franchisee asserted claims relating to the franchisor’s alleged failure to disclose information to her and for fraudulently inducing her to enter into a franchise agreement for an unprofitable service station justice burton s joseph dismissed the action addressing the claim for breach of fiduciary duty the court reiterated the general new york rule as follows in support of this claim ahmed relies solely on the theory that “a franchisor is in the capacity of a quasi fiduciary in its relationship with its franchisee” ms ahmed herein new york courts however have specifically rejected that proposition in this case there is nothing in the complaint which indicates the existence of a fiduciary relationship with ahmed the relationship between her and getty was purely an armslength business relationship in the absence of a special relationship between two parties to a contract no duty to disclose exists4even more recently in di domenico et al v long beach plaza corp et al 5 justice zelda jonas dismissed a franchisee’s claim for breach of fiduciary duty against carvel corporation and a related company the action involved allegations of environmental contamination at a shopping center at which a carvel ice cream store was located in dismissing the breach of fiduciary duty claim the court made clear that “there is no fiduciary relationship between a franchisee and franchisor the relationship between plaintiffs and carvel defendants was purely an armslength business relationship”6like any general rule however there are exceptions to this one and a distinct minority of courts have found that a fiduciary relationship exists between a franchisor and franchisee the only reported new york case to do so however has been limited to its facts by virtually every court that has analyzed it in sbarro holding inc v yuan7 the plaintiff entered into a franchise agreement with a family of taiwanese immigrants who had no business background8 the court described the relationship between the two parties as “awesome    sbarro’s representatives convinced their franchisees there was nothing to worry about sbarro would handle all”9 the court further noted that the franchisor had served as the “developer architect builder lawyer supplier and guidance counselor” to the franchisees10 importantly the franchisees in sbarro recent immigrants “had no legal counsel and apparently were discouraged by sbarro officials from seeking independent legal advice”11 in those extraordinary circumstances the court found that a fiduciary relationship existed between the parties the court’s conclusion in that regard appears to be merely dictum however inasmuch as the issue before the court was whether an arbitration proceeding should be stayed as against the petitioner a sbarro entity on the grounds that a different sbarro entity had entered into the arbitration agreement with the respondents12 the court held that the petitioner could be compelled to arbitrate by reason of the interrelation between the various sbarro entities as well as the special relationship that existed between those entities and the respondents13in any event the sbarro case has been limited to its facts by every court that has analyzed it indeed research has not disclosed a single new york case following sbarro for example two new york federal cases mc donald’s corp v hinksman14 and adiel v cocacola bottling co of n y inc 15 recognized sbarro as representing a limited exception to the general new york rule however neither case found the exception applicable likewise in fashion boutique of short hills inc v fendi usa inc 16 a federal judge dismissed the franchisee’s claim for breach of fiduciary duty the fashion boutique court discussed sbarro noting that “ other than this exceptional case new york courts have not found the franchisorfranchisee relationship to be a fiduciary one”17 in addition the court cited numerous new york federal cases as well as authority from other jurisdictions concluding that “ federal courts interpreting new york law have also held that a franchisee has no claim for breach of fiduciary duty against a franchisor” and that the “‘vast majority’ of federal and state courts in other jurisdictions have held that the existence of a franchise agreement does not give rise to a fiduciary duty”18the franchisorfranchisee relationship borne out of a franchise agreement is an armslength business relationship it is contractual in nature as such the rights and responsibilities of the parties are or should be clearly spelled out in the franchise agreement and applicable statutory law the general new york rule clarifies these principles serving to remove from the equation questions regarding common law duties not contemplated by the parties themselves or included in their written agreement eric w penzer is associated with the firm of farrell fritz p c and is a member of the nassau county bar association’s
