collect storm runoff when it rains these typically run directly into a nearby creek stream or river and are not treated you would certainly not want to put antifreeze down such a drain i would also not put it into a septic tank youd probably kill a bunch of the good bacteria and contaminate the soil in your yard top629263  090704 0649 pmre what to do with old antifreeze tkeith registered 012004

posts 174 loc ct i can sympathize with all of you that have limited disposal sites but the down the toilet method is really harmful to the wastewater treatment processhaving little or no regard for the consequences for your actions is dispicible to say the least the job at the other end of your toilet is not easy and the ultimate outcome of failed treatment processes is dirty riversoceans and lakes give a hoot dont pollute top629270  090904 0630 amre what to do with old antifreeze anonymous unregistered quote originally posted by sewerman but the down the toilet method is really harmful to the wastewater treatment processhaving little or no regard for the consequences for your actions is dispicible to say the least again many cities specifically tell you to dump it down the toilet obviously it isnt that bad and as you said a few gallons down the toilet will have absolutely no effect in the billions of gallons of sewage down the line top page 1 of 2 1 2 previous topic index next
