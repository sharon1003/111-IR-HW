abnormal change  metaplasia in the cells of the lower portion of the esophagus it is characterized by the replacement of the normal stratified squamous epithelium lining of the esophagus by simple columnar epithelium with goblet cells which are usually found lower in the gastrointestinal tract  the medical significance of barretts esophagus is its strong association 01 per 1 cm prague cm total segment length per patientyear with esophageal adenocarcinoma a very often deadly cancer 1 2 because of which it is considered to be a premalignant condition the main cause of barretts esophagus is thought to be an adaptation to chronic acid exposure from reflux esophagitis 3 the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma has increased substantially in the western world in recent years 1 the condition is found in 5–15 of patients who seek medical care for heartburn  gastroesophageal reflux disease  although a large subgroup of patients with barretts esophagus do not have symptoms 1 diagnosis requires endoscopy more specifically esophagogastroduodenoscopy a procedure in which a fibreoptic cable is inserted through the mouth to examine the esophagus stomach and duodenum and biopsy the cells of barretts esophagus after biopsy are classified into four general categories nondysplastic lowgrade dysplasia highgrade dysplasia and frank carcinoma highgrade dysplasia and early stages of adenocarcinoma can be treated by endoscopic resection and new endoscopic therapies such as radiofrequency ablation whereas advanced stages submucosal are generally advised to undergo surgical treatment nondysplastic and lowgrade patients are generally advised to undergo annual observation with endoscopy with radiofrequency ablation as a therapeutic option in highgrade dysplasia the risk of developing cancer might be at 10 per patientyear or greater 1the condition is named after the australianborn british thoracic surgeon norman barrett 1903–1979 who described it in 1950 4those with the eating disorder bulimia are more likely to develop barrett’s esophagus because bulimia can cause severe acid reflux and because purging also floods the esophagus with acid 5 6contents  hide 1 signs

odynophagiathe risk of developing barretts esophagus is increased by central obesity vs peripheral obesity 7 the exact mechanism is unclear the difference in distribution of fat among men more central and women more peripheral may explain the increased risk in males 8pathophysiology  editmicrograph of barretts esophagus alcian blue stain barretts esophagus occurs due to chronic inflammation the principal cause of the chronic inflammation is gastroesophageal reflux disease gerd uk gord in this disease acidic stomach bile and small intestine and pancreatic contents cause damage to the cells of the lower esophagus recently bile acids were shown to be able to induce intestinal differentiation in gastroesophageal junction cells through inhibition of the epidermal growth factor receptor egfr and the protein kinase enzyme akt 9 this results in the eventual upregulation of the p50 subunit of protein complex nfκb  nfkb1  and ultimately activation of the homeobox gene cdx2 which is responsible for the expression of intestinal enzymes such as guanylate cyclase 2c 10 this mechanism also explains the selection of her2neu also called erbb2 and the overexpressing lineageaddicted cancer cells during the process of carcinogenesis and the efficacy of targeted therapy against the her2 receptor with trastuzumab  herceptin in the treatment of adenocarcinomas at the gastroesophageal junction researchers are unable to predict who with heartburn will develop barretts esophagus while no relationship exists between the severity of heartburn and the development of barretts esophagus a relationship does exist between chronic heartburn and the development of barretts esophagus sometimes people with barretts esophagus have no heartburn symptoms at all in rare cases damage to the esophagus may be caused by swallowing a corrosive substance such as lye diagnosis  editmicrograph of barretts esophagus left of image and normal stratified squamous epithelium right of image alcian blue stain highmagnification micrograph of barretts esophagus showing the characteristic goblet cells alcian blue stain both macroscopic from endoscopy and microscopic positive findings are required to make a diagnosis barretts esophagus is marked by the presence of columnar epithelia in the lower esophagus replacing the normal squamous cell epithelium—an example of metaplasia the secretory columnar epithelium may be more able to withstand the erosive action of the gastric secretions however this metaplasia confers an increased risk of adenocarcinoma 11screening  editscreening endoscopy is recommended among males over the age of 60 who have reflux symptoms that are of long duration and not controllable with treatment 12 among those not expected to live more than 5 years screening is not recommended 12intestinal metaplasia  editthe presence of goblet cells called intestinal metaplasia is necessary to make a diagnosis of barretts esophagus this frequently occurs in the presence of other metaplastic columnar cells but only the presence of goblet cells is diagnostic the metaplasia is grossly visible through a gastroscope but biopsy specimens must be examined under a microscope to determine whether cells are gastric or colonic in nature colonic metaplasia is usually identified by finding goblet cells in the epithelium and is necessary for the true diagnosis many histologic mimics of barretts esophagus are known ie goblet cells occurring in the transitional epithelium of normal esophageal submucosal gland ducts pseudogoblet cells in which abundant foveolar gastric type mucin simulates the acid mucin true goblet cells assessment of relationship to submucosal glands and transitionaltype epithelium with examination of multiple levels through the tissue may allow the pathologist to reliably distinguish between goblet cells of submucosal gland ducts and true barretts esophagus specialized columnar metaplasia use of the histochemical stain alcian blue p h 25 is also frequently used to distinguish true intestinaltype mucins from their histologic mimics recently immunohistochemical analysis with antibodies to cdx2 specific for mid and hindgut intestinal derivation has also been used to identify true intestinaltype metaplastic cells the protein agr2 is elevated in barretts esophagus 13 and can be used as a biomarker for distinguishing barrett epithelium from normal esophageal epithelium 14the presence of intestinal metaplasia in barretts esophagus represents a marker for the progression of metaplasia towards dysplasia and eventually adenocarcinoma this factor combined with two different immunohistochemical expression of p53 her2 and p16 leads to two different genetic pathways that likely progress to dysplasia in barretts esophagus 15epithelial dysplasia  editafter the initial diagnosis of barretts esophagus is rendered affected persons undergo annual surveillance to detect changes that indicate higher risk to progression to cancer development of epithelial dysplasia or  intraepithelial neoplasia  16 among all metaplastic lesions around 8 were associated with dysplasia particularly a recent study demonstrated that dysplasic lesions were located mainly in the posterior wall of the oesophagus 17 considerable variability is seen in assessment for dysplasia among pathologists recently gastroenterology and gi pathology societies have recommended that any diagnosis of highgrade dysplasia in barrett be confirmed by at least two fellowshiptrained gi pathologists prior to definitive treatment for patients 18 for more accuracy and reproductibility it is also recommended to follow international classification system as the vienna classification of gastrointestinal epithelial neoplasia 2000 19management  editmany people with barretts esophagus do not have dysplasia medical societies recommend that if a patient has barretts esophagus and if the past two endoscopy and biopsy examinations have confirmed the absence of dysplasia then the patient should not have another endoscopy within three years 20 21 22endoscopic surveillance of people with barretts esophagus is often recommended although little direct evidence supports this practice 1 treatment options for highgrade dysplasia include surgical removal of the esophagus  esophagectomy or endoscopic treatments such as endoscopic mucosal resection or ablation destruction 1the risk of malignancy is highest in the u s in caucasian men over fifty years of age with more than five years of symptoms current recommendations include routine endoscopy and biopsy looking for dysplastic changes  although in the past physicians have taken a watchful waiting approach newly published research supports consideration of intervention for barretts esophagus balloonbased radiofrequency ablation invented by ganz stern and zelickson in 1999 is a new treatment modality for the treatment of barretts esophagus and dysplasia and has been the subject of numerous published clinical trials 23 24 25 26 the findings demonstrate radiofrequency ablation has an efficacy of 90 or greater with respect to complete clearance of barretts esophagus and dysplasia with durability up to five years and a favorable safety profile 23 24 25 26proton pump inhibitor drugs have not been proven to prevent esophageal cancer laser treatment is used in severe dysplasia while overt malignancy may require surgery radiation therapy or systemic chemotherapy additionally a recent fiveyear randomcontrolled trial has shown that photodynamic therapy using photofrin is statistically more effective in eliminating dysplastic growth areas than sole use of a proton pump inhibitor 27 there is presently no reliable way to determine which patients with barrett esophagus will go on to develop esophageal cancer although a recent study found the detection of three different genetic abnormalities was associated with as much as a 79 chance of developing cancer in six years 28endoscopic mucosal resection has also been evaluated as a management technique 29 additionally an operation known as a nissen fundoplication can reduce the reflux of acid from the stomach into the esophagus 30in a variety of studies nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs  nsaids  like aspirin have shown evidence of preventing esophageal cancer in people with barretts esophagus 31 32 however none of these studies have been randomized placebocontrolled trials which are considered the gold standard for evaluating a medical intervention in addition the best dose of nsaids for cancer prevention is not yet known prognosis  editbarrettʼs cancer adenocarcinoma poorsignetringcellbarretts esophagus is a premalignant condition its malignant sequela oesophagogastric junctional adenocarcinoma has a mortality rate of over 85 33 the risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma in people who have barretts esophagus has been estimated to be 6–7 per 1000 personyears 34 35 however a cohort study of 11028 patients from denmark published in 2011 showed an incidence of only 12 per 1000 personyears 51 per 1000 personyears in patients with dysplasia 10 per 1000 personyears in patients without dysplasia 36 the relative risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma is approximately 10 in those with barrets esophagus compared to the general population 37 most patients with esophageal carcinoma survive less than one year 38epidemiology  editthe incidence in the united states among caucasian men is eight times the rate among caucasian women and five times greater than african american men overall the male to female ratio of barretts esophagus is 101 39 several studies have estimated the prevalence of barretts esophagus in the general population to be 13 to 16 in two european populations italian 40 and swedish 41  and 36 in a korean population 42history  editbarrett first described the columnar metaplasia in 1950 4 an association with gastroesophageal reflux was
