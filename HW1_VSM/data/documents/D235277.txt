when michael was 11 and lincoln his older brother was 15 their mother then aged 31 supposedly died of a brain aneurysm brought on by a brain tumor she is later found to be alive though it was initially thought to be liver cancer lincoln became his guardian and tried his best to take care of him having lost both their parents lincoln descended into a deep life of crime however lincoln worked hard to prevent michael from taking his own path and suffering the same fate this became one of michaels reasons for hatching an escape plan to help his brother  1x5 1x16following the death of his mother he and lincoln moved in with the family of lincolns friend veronica donovan this situation was shortlived afterwards michael and lincoln both traveled in and out of different foster home situations though they were usually kept together there were periods of time when circumstances required them to be placed separately one such instance occurred when lincoln did a sixmonth sentence stretch in juvenile hall on an assault charge when michael was 11 michael was placed with an abusive foster father in the pershing section of chicago who routinely locked michael and his other charges in a small storage shed six months into michaels stay his foster father was found dead in his home a victim of a violent attack killed by aldo where he rescued michael for better or worse young michael repressed all memory of what had occurred and was not able to help police in their investigation to this day the murder investigation itself remains unsolved when michael would wake up in the mornings not knowing where his brother was there would be an origami crane next to his bed a sign his brother was watching out for him in morton east high school in cicero illinois michael took an elective survey class in arts and crafts which had a large section devoted to the japanese art of origami he was immediately drawn to the precision and patience that the practice required this fascinated him to an extent that he began constructing a number of cranes out of any material he could find michael was so fond of his habit that his practice of making paper cranes carried over and continued into his adulthood michael was a gifted student and finished his secondary education at morton east high school with an impeccable record he graduated magna cum laude with a bachelor of science b s degree and a master of science m s degree in civil engineering from loyola university in chicago after which he went on to become successful as a structural engineer at the prestigious

state penitentiary and michaels plans on how to safely escape three years before lincoln was imprisoned at fox river state penitentiary in joliet michael and lincolns relationships had grown strained because of their differing lives michael proud and successful looked down on his brother and both viewed and thought lincoln as irresponsible and became tired of being the older brother to his older brother after lincoln was arrested for terrence steadman s murder michael initially thought lincoln was guilty however upon discovering that his brother had taken a 90000 debt to pay for his education michael realized that his brother was not the man he thought he was and started to see his brother differently michaels discovery of his misperception of his brother and his brothers sacrifice for him prompts him to change apologizes to his brother and decides to help lincoln as remembering how lincoln had always looked after him when he was a child michael swore to do the same this would become the reason why michael would go to such extreme lengths to save his brother from his death sentence michael begins to investigate his case fulltime his feeling of guilt and familial obligation causing him to devote fulltime to it however all the evidence pointed to lincoln as the murderer of steadman over the next three years michael reviewed lincolns case countless times but found he couldnt help his brother via any legal means after lincolns last appeals are denied michael decided to take matters into his own hands coincidentally michaels firm had been responsible for retrofitting fox river the prison where lincoln is incarcerated and being held until his execution retrieving the blueprints of the facility which the firm and michael himself had access to from this information michael spent a year creating an elaborate plan to break out his brother  1x16over the course of four months michael had specific sections of the prison tattooed onto his upper body by the tattoo artist syd  1x1 hidden within gothic imagery of battling angels and demons his chest features an image of a demon slaying an angel and contains blueprints of the prisons underground tunnels and passageways his back has the angel attacking and killing the demon and hides an overhead view of the layout of the prison his right arm has an image of the demons and the left the image of the angels as well as numerous clues and reminders eg chemical formulae phone numbers and names of necessary parts he must procure within the prison 1 his arm also contains the miage of a native american moaning man tattoo though there are not explanations provided for this tattoo michael also analyzed every detail of the prison and the people inside inmates he needed to recruit for his plan and prison staff members he needed to manipulate to form relationships with in order to manipulate them after urging his brother to swear that he is innocent he paid a visit to syd who finished tattooing michaels design onto his body that night he returned to his apartment near the chicago river and tore off the newspaper clippings and destroyed his computer season 1main article michael scofield on season 1 the opening scene of the series shows michaels final preparation of his plan to infiltrate fox river the tattooist is applying the finishing touches to michaels tattoo in order to get into fox river michael staged an armed bank robbery in which he attempted to steal over half a million dollars from the downtown chicago branch of united savings bank pled no contest at his trial and requested that he be sent to the level 1 prison facility nearest to his chicago home to serve his time that facility was fox river michael began his sentence on april 11 exactly a month before lincoln was set to be executed his inmate number was 94941  1x1michael scofield in season 1once in fox river he scrutinized every detail regarding the prison and its inhabitants given michaels educational background inmates and correctional officers alike focused a great deal of attention on michael and were very interested in what michael was all about they would often wonder why a man of michaels credentials would have thrown such a privileged life away to end up in a state penitentiary what was even more intriguing were his habits as he was often seen conversing discreetly with his brother lincoln both during prison industry time and chapel time and the fact that he tended to execute a highly defined stare around fox rivers boundaries immediately from the point he got incarcerated as well as being called personally on command by the prisons warden henry pope  michael put his plan into action while overcoming various obstacles he began by having specific objectives he must accomplish in order to build an escape route out of the prison one the way michael needed to recruit a number of people to aid in the escape his cellmate fernando sucre to help him dig mob henchman john abruzzi to get him on prison industries pi  which is the maintenance crew and provide air transport once they escaped and charles westmoreland who he believed to be d b cooper and can help finance their lives as fugitives with his hidden 15 million dollars in cash later revealed to be actually 5 million dollars michael also had to feign type 1 diabetes which gave him daily access to the infirmary the escapees exit point from the prison and allow him to build a relationship with doctor sara tancredi who happens to be the daughter of frank tancredi the governor of illinois after agreeing to help warden pope finish his taj mahal replica in his office michael also forms a friendship with pope scofields trademark stare however not everything went according to plan more people join the escape team than michael had speculated this coupled with other obstacles michael faces forces him to reformulate the plan time and time again these obstacles begin when two of michaels toes were cut off by abruzzi a mafia boss who wants to extract the location of mob informant otto fibonacci from michael when michael refused to divulge the information or crack for abruzzi he struck a deal abruzzi would supply an escape plane in exchange for fibonaccis address in addition to this a portion of a section of michaels tattooed blueprint on his back is burned off and lost after coming into contact with a steaming hot piece of metal as he hid from a guard  1x15 compromising the plan and eventually landing him in solitary confinement for a period of time when he refused to disclose information as to how he received the burn dealing a severe blow to his motivation and morale he later stages brief insanity to gain access to the penitentiarys psych ward premises to gain contact with one of its insane inhabitants gifted with photographic memory in order to reacquire the portion of the tattooed blueprint these however are only a few setbacks he faced in his attempt to break his brother out of prison and so michaels cool facade also began to wear off michaels relationships with warden pope and sara deepened over time but he eventually and regretfully  demonstrated when he threatened the warden in his office manipulated both of them in the end to save his brothers life most prominently with sara who was part of michaels secondary plan when his original plan failed michael pleaded sara to talk to her father also he later relied on their relationship as when he fails to steal the key to the infirmary from her and she finds out about his motive for being in the infirmary michael revealed his escape plan and asked sara to leave the infirmary door unlocked on the night of the escape sara decides to help michael and does so and with the aid of an unlocked infirmary door michael finally succeeded in helping his brother escape from fox river through the window of the infirmary and escaped over the walls of fox river with his brother in the nick of time but also aided in the escape of six other prisoners however michael and the others were left stranded at the airfield after the plane took off before their arrival season 2main article michael scofield on season 2the story continues to follow michael his brother and other escapees as they try to evade the authorities pursuing them away from the prison the level of intricacy of michaels plan is demonstrated once again prior to his incarceration at fox river michael prepared an alternate escape route outside the prison in the even that he and his brother fail to board abruzzis getaway plane this becomes useful as michael leads his brother sucre cnote and abruzzi to his hidden cache in oswego and obtains a fresh change of clothes furthermore michael retrieves a backpack which contained money a mobile phone prepaid phone cards and fake passports michael and lincoln travel together after the fugitives separate to accomplish each of their individual goals unfortunately for michael an fbi agent named alexander mahone had

treat him while lincoln and sucre go after scylla sara stays with michael and watches over him while he undergoes surgery with help from the company however the procedure that the company doctors use on michael is nothing like anything sara has seen before general krantz tells her that while the procedure is experimental it has been used once before on a patient who ended up living a long and happy life because of the surgery all of michaels senses become active at the same time causing him to have his life flash before his eyes he suddenly sees himself back in his old cell at fox river

to do so once again enlisting lincoln sucre and mahones help michael faced another government conspiracy  this one centered on him as the fbi and other law enforcement officials unhappy with michael and his allies exoneration hoped to get any evidence to incriminate and reimprison michael despite mahone being pressured to report michaels activities on the escape in exchange for reinstatement to the fbi michael kept the plan going and he and lincoln enlisted the aid of tbag in the escape when michael had mahone who was purposely misleading the agents deliberately divulged michaels plot to parachute into the prison and rescue sara michaels trust in him eventually leads to michael giving mahone a piece of paper and a dvd which he says to give to sara in the event of his death with wheatley and the other armed officers distracted with the dummy parachute plan michael snuck out from under wheatleys car and ran into the prison where he finally met sara having figured tbag would reveal the plan michael and sara escaped through the underground passageway beneath the administrative building though it is at the last door which is electronically locked they discover a roadblock michael scofields grave with the date retconned knowing that this was a possibility from the beginning michael asked sara to run as soon as the door opens and leave him behind since the only way to open the door is to manually cause a power surge that will certainly kill him  it is revealed that michael planned to sacrifice himself in order to allow sara to escape from prison sara refused to leave if michael cannot go with her but he emphasized that there was no other way touching her stomach where their baby was he said i am going with you in one final act of sacrifice michael caused the surge and the fuse box exploded in a shower of sparks seemingly killing michael sara then ran out with lincoln sucre and mahone waiting with a van just outside stunned sara was unable to describe to lincoln what just happened mahone revealed that he knew of michaels plan from a previous discussion and simply told lincoln hes gone lincoln was prepared to run back into the prison to find michael and refused to believe he was dead they got into the van and drove away still shocked over michaels fate in the end michael had indeed succeeded in rescuing her embarrassing and landing the government in a world of trouble in the process mahone finally gave sara the paper and the dvd which michael left for her the paper was revealed to be a medical exam which michael recently underwent with bloodwork revealing that the brain tumor was not removed the company had only slowed it down and it had returned and that his condition was terminal finally lincoln and sara sail out to sea and view the dvd it is a prerecorded message in which michael explained his motivation for sacrificing himself michael said it would prevent him from having any regrets michael told sara and lincoln that he loves them and asked them to watch over each other and his child the video and the entire series culminates in michaels final proclamation that they are all finally free his recorded date of death was november 4 2005  eight months had passed since he set his plan into motion the date in which he committed his original bank robbery was march 9 2005 and freeing sara however season 5 retconned this date to november 4 2010 michael scofield season 5main article michael scofield on season 5one year later jacob ends up recruiting david martin to work with michael to break people out of prison seven years later michael is incarcerated in ogygia prison using the alias kaniel outis he had been sent to ogygia by poseidon to break out abu ramal for the past several years scofield had been working in 21 void with whip breaking out of prisons in colombia and egypt as isil approach ogygia michael breaks out with whip ramal ja and sid determined to make it back home to the united states and be reunited with sara and his son with whip and lincolns help michael is able to defeat jacob and bring him to justice for his crimes in doing so he resumes his normal life with sara and michael jr characteristics michael is described as always scanning the surroundings and has the silky voice of a sociopath and the resigned stance of a longdistance runner and projected an unflappable determination that confounded his fellow prisoners as being close to abruzzi or tbag or bellick he could not afford to be vulnerable or even appear human later following the escape michael now off with his brother around whom michael was willing to show a side of himself that he was not with the others began showing a side of himself something that is lighter and more colorful however michael often is outwardly taciturn and stoic rarely allowing the dangerous element hes frequently surrounded by to penetrate his thoughts michael has been clinically diagnosed with low latent inhibition a condition in which his brain is more open to incoming stimuli in the surrounding environment as a result of this condition he is unable to block out periphery information and instead processes every aspect and detail of any given stimulus this combined with a high iq as a psychiatrist explains theoretically makes him a creative genius his intelligence is well noticed even by his enemies eg with mahone in season 2 making various comments about michaels intelligence even holding a certain admiration to him after successfully breaking out of 2 prisons fox river  sona he is even offered a place in the company due to a feeling of abandonment and abuse during childhood michael developed and has very low or absolutely no sense of selfworth with the low latent inhibition this has made him become very attuned to all the suffering around him as a result of being unable to block out other peoples suffering he is extremely empathetic and altruistic towards other peoples emotions this explains michaels desire to make huge sacrifices to help others  he is more concerned with other peoples welfare than his own this particular attribute is apparently the product of his detrimental experience during childhood where as a child his abusive foster father would often beat him and have him locked up inside a closet and by doing so michaels eyes begin to adjust to the darkened environment allowing him to scan objects around him which he can use for his own convenience michael had a very strong moral sense and was cool and reasonable he knew that if he or his allies turn to kill rather than subdue their enemies they will gradually lose themselves and eventually everything bellick tbag whistler and overall gretchen all people with much blood on their hands are only alive or survived as long as they did because michael spared them michaels enhanced creative ability allowed him to design a tattoo with a hidden blueprint of fox river penitentiary that normal people couldnt discern over the course of four months michael had specific sections of the prison tattooed onto his upper body hidden within gothic imagery each part of his tattoo had to be precise which provoked the tattooists comment to mahone about michael being a detail nazi and that the tattoo was some sort of inside joke that only he got michael was also shown to be meticulous and wellprepared as he used his knowledge and intellect to achieve each step of his escape plan with time however michael developed or was possibly was born with improvisation techniques tossed into sona he developed an escape plan which ultimately fails the failure leads to another escape plan which michael realizes is a threat to his and lincolns safety and stops it after he escapes sona and brings down the company michael
