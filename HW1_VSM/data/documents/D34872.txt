a generic sold in europe and china as glucobay  bayer ag  in north america as precose  bayer pharmaceuticals  and in canada as prandase  bayer ag  it is cheap and popular in china but not in the u s one physician explains the use in the u s is limited because it is not potent enough to justify the side effects of diarrhea and flatulence 2 however a recent large study concludes acarbose is effective safe and well tolerated in a large cohort of asian patients with type 2 diabetes 3 a possible explanation for the differing opinions is an observation that acarbose is significantly more effective in patients eating a relatively high carbohydrate eastern diet 4it is a starch blocker and inhibits alpha glucosidase an intestinal enzyme that releases glucose from larger carbohydrates it is composed of an acarviosin moiety with a maltose at the reducing terminus contents  hide 1 mechanism of action2 dosing3 sideeffects4 references5 external links mechanism of action  editacarbose inhibits enzymes  glycoside hydrolases needed to digest carbohydrates specifically alphaglucosidase enzymes in the brush border of the small intestines and pancreatic alphaamylase pancreatic alphaamylase hydrolyzes complex starches to oligosaccharides in the lumen of the small intestine whereas the membranebound intestinal alphaglucosidases hydrolyze oligosaccharides trisaccharides and disaccharides to glucose and other monosaccharides in the small intestine inhibition of these enzyme systems reduces the rate of digestion of complex carbohydrates less glucose is absorbed because the carbohydrates are not broken down into glucose molecules in diabetic patients the shortterm effect of these drug therapies is to decrease current blood glucose levels the longterm effect is a reduction in hb a 1c level 5 this reduction averages an absolute decrease of 07 which is a decrease of about 10 in typical hb a 1c values in diabetes studies 6dosing  editsince acarbose prevents the digestion of complex carbohydrates the drug should be taken at the start of main meals taken with first bite of meal moreover the amount of complex carbohydrates in the meal will determine the effectiveness of acarbose in decreasing postprandialhyperglycemia adults may take doses of 25 mg 3 times daily increasing to 100 mg 3 times a day  citation neededsideeffects  editsince acarbose prevents the degradation of complex carbohydrates into glucose some carbohydrate will remain in the intestine and be delivered to the colon in the colon bacteria digest the complex carbohydrates causing gastrointestinal sideeffects such as flatulence 78 of patients and diarrhea 14 of patients since these effects are doserelated in general it is advised to start with a low dose and gradually increase the dose to the desired amount one study found that gastrointestinal side effects decreased significantly from 50 to 15 over 24 weeks even on constant dosing 7if a patient using acarbose suffers from a bout of hypoglycemia the patient must eat something containing monosaccharides such as glucose tablets or gel gluco burst instaglucose glutose level one and a doctor should be called because acarbose blocks the breakdown of table sugar and other complex sugars fruit juice or starchy foods will not effectively reverse a hypoglycemic episode in a patient taking acarbose 8hepatitis has been reported with acarbose use it usually goes away when the medicine is stopped 9 therefore liver enzymes should be checked before and during use of this medicine references  edit international
