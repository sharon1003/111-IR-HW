90000 the sale price would need to be renegotiated with the seller if the seller is not willing to decrease the sale price the seller can decide to walk away from the deal should the buyer decide to go with the purchase at the 100000 price the down payment would be 10 percent of the appraised value of 90000 or 9000 and the new loan amount would be 81000 the buyer would need to pay the 10000
