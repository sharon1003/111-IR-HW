basis by the designer textile design for converse inc by allison bamcat i currently work as a textile pattern designer illustrating and specing silkscreen sublimated and digital prints for textiles i work closely with a materials team to execute new techniques and finishes for footwear — allison bamcat graphics artist for converse inc what training do print designers need as with other art careers weve covered in this ever growing series of articles the training necessary to work as a print designer varies from project to project company to company and artist to artist most i spoke to have some formal training under their belt often in graphic design or illustration while a degree may not be necessary though most i spoke to did have a related bfa designers do have to build up their portfolio to acquire such work regardless of whether theyre working in‑house or on a freelance basis formal schooling allows designers to hone their skills get a feel for various print design projects and build up their portfolio with interaction from other students and professors additionally ideas projects and techniques that may have never occurred to the student could be assigned having the chance to try things out and fail before gunning for proper work is a great experience for artists everywhere however they manage to find it i went to wayne state university for a bachelor of arts in graphic design graduating cum laude in 2007 i started working in a graphic design position in 2005 so a lot of the skills i learned were on the job  i had to learn a lot of digital stuff on my own to keep up with the industry it gave me a unique set of skills though because i know a lot of the print industry and a good amount of the digital as well — julie miller inhouse graphic designer knowing the ins and outs of layout programs like adobe in design and quark xpress is often a musthave for resumes along with image editing vector and assorted digital design programs as most if not all design is created or compiled digitally these days often digital art classes help with learning such programs though that’s also quite circumstantial the point isnt how you learn your craft and the tools necessary to create it but that you do learn it catalogue design by shari coté im a senior in a technical high school in a design  visual communication shop were actually right next to a graphic design shop that handles mostly printing presses and the like basically my shop is graphic design without the manual labor — shari coté print design student where do print designers work and who do they work with much like other graphic design jobs wherever there’s a need for print design there’s hopefully room for a designer to fill that position or be contracted for that project from newspapers and magazines to various consumer products print designers will find their skills are necessary in order to pull a company or brand’s product together and make it consumerready the artists i interviewed have worked at apparel companies book publishers for comics in the greeting card industry for toy companies and more household names like converse and hallmark appear on some of their resumes while many others have worked for smaller companies or indie brands some designers work by themselves bringing a concept to printready status while others work in a team whether inhouse or freelance making sure their part is done effectively so that the project proceeds as planned it’s likely that the larger the company or agency the more teamwork will be needed if you are studying design and aiming to transition into a career after graduation or after building up their skill set and portfolio you may find assignments are constructed to mirror reallife agency projects where youre assigned the roles of layout designer graphic designer or art director and have to navigate the process of bringing your design to life in a printed tangible form bon art product poster design by stephanie moran i work for a fine art publisher known as bon art short for bonartique we print out posters for wall decor many of our prints can be found in walmart kohl’s target etc i am currently the art director — stephanie moran what do designers need to know when designing for print it’s the biggest question and the most important i think when it comes to discussing print design what aspects of the printing process are considered by designers what information does an art director or client need to tell the designer before a project begins how can not having the right information affect a project firstly designers need to know if they’re designing or laying out content to a provided template or one they’re creating themselves knowing what the product is ahead of time is a must for every artist involved designing a magazine spread and finding out later that the margins are wrong or the orientation is wrong can waste time and money and may change an entire design depending on how unique it was in the first place if for instance youre designing a pair of shoes to be manufactured by another company you need to know what the printers color limits are if any and what the best orientation of your design will be for the template later used by the printer and manufacturer in my own experience communication has been key in making sure a printed design sent off to a factory came back to me in sample form as originally envisioned i had to request the templates being used by the factory themselves so i could not only send my print files in the correct format but also show them how the design should be laid out on the template and what the final product should look like comic books from m victoria robados sushi press“i get the original pages from the japanese editorials i make sure they’re the right size and dpi to begin lettering i do all the lettering work in photoshop then lay them out in adobe indesign using the printer requirements and a template i created and package everything so my editor can add the finishing touches page size varies a lot around 6500 px x 9000 px 1200 dpi bw offset printing requests 1200 dpi for the cleanest line art” — m victoria robado when working for seven seas entertainment secondly a designer needs to know a bit about the final printing process if a document needs to be in cmyk but was designed in rgb it can be converted later but the colors may be off additionally if it’s never changed the sample product or final product may present bizarre tones the designer or client didn’t expect knowing the color limits document types expected by the printers and whether gradients or flat colors are acceptable contributes heavily to a wellexecuted project thirdly i mentioned previously that not having the right product or document information before a project begins or during its run where it can be changed easily can waste a lot of time and money correcting that mistake once sent to the printers often it’s wise to request a printing proof before the product is put into production doing so allows those involved in the project to iron out any issues that may have been overlooked or miscommunications with the printer stephanie moran printed wall decal for bon art 300 dpi is the most important thing to remember and working large some standard sizes i use are 20x20 and 24x36 even when the most common size for wall decor is 12x12 and 16x20 sometimes we get a request to make an image large for an “over the couch” piece and it’s nice to know the image will not fall apart if enlarged to the size requested — stephanie moran art director at bon art what are deadlines like to answer this question i asked my interview subjects what their project experiences have been over the years i find having a general understanding of what’s expected of the designer in terms of their role content and deadlines can be helpful when checking out career options or getting into a new facet of commercial art spot illustration by maria sarria“deadlines have come to me in just about every fashion from a comfortable timeframe of a month for a small painting to a grueling and highly unrealistic 2 days for 140 original illustrations … what is really important is to consistently give them updates between start and deadline date” — maria sarria freelance illustrator and designer infographic layout design by stephanie moran the client will request a category and their meeting date sometimes the requests are broad for example they have a meeting for inspirational images and have a week until the meeting this gives me enough time to collect any existing images reach out to artist and get to design a new one myself — stephanie moran art director at bon art advice from print designersdo not give up it took me nearly 10 years to finally make something of my art in the business world and be published — jenifer chetwin of mad mouse media eerie cuties comic with inks and color by m victoria robado aka shouri if you wanna be a comic artistetc learning how booksmagazines are made is a must for me i think it’s a good thing i became a graphic designer first as i have the tools to create the books myself and a lot of insight about marketinglogos etc everything needed to get the comic going — m victoria robado aka shouri i am just starting so really i may be in the same boat as you freelancing is not that easy but it can be worth it when you and the client are both happy with the results — mariana flores freelance designer oilhead press kit 2012 by allison bamcat not everything youre proud of is what makes it to market but when you can be proud of everything you do youll always win there is always more to learn and there is always a better quicker way to do things and when you work with a large team of people staying humble helps — allison bamcat graphics artist for converse inc conclusion so you want to be a print designer there’s a lot more to consider for print design than just how fantastic your artwork or layout will look on screen at your workstation print designers need to know product specifications printing processes and how to get the best print quality from their work whether working on a project in a team or solo designers need to be on their toes to make sure layout art and designs are ready for the next step which is often out of their hands get to know print processes product
