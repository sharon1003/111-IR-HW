noncoding template site of dna damage disrupts the transcription complex to release the transcript and enzyme and recruits the dna excision repair machinery to the site the mechanism of rna release has been illuminated by the discovery that mfd causes forward translocation of rna polymerase using an atpdependent motor that is highly homologous to that of the holliday branch migration protein rec g previous article next article abbreviations mfd mutation frequency decline rnap rna polymerase trcf transcription repair coupling factor introduction mfd is an enzyme that connects the cellular processes of transcription and dna repair its major role in the cell is to recognize rna polymerase rnap that is unable to elongate for example rnap stopped by a noncoding dna lesion such as a cyclobutane dimer and then to express two activities recruitment of dna excision repair machinery to the site of the lesion and release of rnap and its transcript from the dna 1–4 originally identified genetically through its effects on mutagenesis 56 mfd which stands for mutation frequency decline was shown to mediate the process of transcriptioncoupled dna repair and has also been called trcf transcription repair coupling factor recent biochemical genetic and structural studies have contributed important advances in understanding the mechanism of mfd action more broadly mfd provides a cellular mechanism to keep dna clear of an obstruction that would prevent gene expression transcription is inherently as sensitive to dna damage as replication although mechanisms of replication fork recovery at obstructive lesions — including stalled rnap 7 — are more widely appreciated rescue of blocked m rna synthesis requires repair of the dna because unlike a broken or obstructed replication fork that can be reassembled by recombination the loss of gene expression from a truncated transcript can only be recovered by transcription reinitiation at the promoter and complete reading of the gene thus a cellular device such as mfd that targets dna repair to an obstructed rnap and restores the template should be of clear value to the cell’s survival mfd is one of three known transcription termination mechanisms in bacterial cells along with the enzyme rho and the intrinsic terminator which is entirely nucleicacidbased thus the activity of mfd is of interest for insights into the way transcription elongation complexes can be dissociated the discovery and rediscovery of the mfd protein occurred over several decades mutation frequency decline is the loss of ultravioletlightinduced mutations when an irradiated e coli culture is incubated in conditions that inhibit protein synthesis ie it is a repair process that interrupts the pathway from lesion to mutation evelyn witkin isolated and characterized the e coli mutation mfd that prevents such mutationsparing repair 6 mutation frequency decline requires the uvr genes and is thus a mode of nucleotide excision repair 2 the phenomenon of strandspecific transcriptioncoupled repair was discovered first in cultured eukaryotic cells by hanawalt and his collaborators 8 they showed that transcription stimulates excision repair of cyclobutane dimers and that this stimulation is specific to the template strand of a transcribed region 9 the inference was that rnap stalled at the lesion is the sensor for transcriptiondirected repair the coupling process in eukaryotic cells is still obscure although the cockayne’s syndrome protein csb is believed to be a central element 10 • by contrast the bacterial mfd mutant gave rise to a detailed understanding of the process in bacterial cells selby and sancar applied their purified excision repair system the uvr a uvr b and uvr c proteins to a transcription reaction in which rnap was stalled by cyclobutane dimers to determine if the stalled rnap preferentially directed repair to the template strand as had been shown to occur in vivo also in bacteria 11 they found the opposite result the template strand was protected from repair by stalled rnap 12 in extracts however strandspecific repair was found implying the existence of a separate factor that coupled repair to the stalled rnap 13 genetic analysis of the strand specificity of ultraviolet hence pyrimidinetargeted mutagenesis had previously implicated mfd in a strandspecific repair process 1415 the insight that the mfd mutation might inactivate the coupling factor led to the discovery that mfd mutant extracts are incapable of strandspecific repair and to the purification of the coupling factor mfd 13 the cellular functions of mfd clearly a major function of mfd is to direct dna excision repair to transcribed genes in laboratory conditions the quantitative effect of an mfd defect is modest with only a severalfold increased sensitivity to ultraviolet irradiation 1 in more stressed conditions and with a single chromosome and a single copy of essential genes mfd could have a more important role the mfd gene is highly conserved appearing in about 85 of the hundred or so completely sequenced microbial genomes late 2003 as described below mfd dissociates elongation complexes of rnap that are stalled for any reason and thus is not specific to template dna lesions two other known cellular functions of mfd reflect this general ability to cleanse dna of nonfunctional rnap first mfd is the site of mutations isolated in bacillus subtilis to increase expression of an operon controlled by the regulatory protein ccp a which mediates catabolite repression by blocking elongation of rnap at sites well removed from the promoter 1617 the explanation of an mfd effect is that a blocked rnap is removed after some time if mfd is active but in the absence of mfd rnap can wait until the blocking protein diffuses away and then continue elongation second mfd is responsible for release of transcription complexes that are blocked by the bacteriophage hk022 nun protein 18 • a genomespecific termination factor that binds regulatory sites of related phages such as lambda presumably thus acting to exclude other phages from growth when an hk022 prophage is present there is a report that an mfd mutation impairs general recombination in b subtilis perhaps reflecting a role of mfd in preparing the dna substrate for recombination enzymes 19 the biochemical activity of mfd to induce forward translocation of backtracked arrested complexes see below suggests that it could have a similar function in vivo ie as an alternative mechanism to gredependent transcript cleavage for restarting arrested complexes mfd would force the rna 3′ end back into the active center so that elongation could proceed there is no genetic evidence of this putative redundant function of mfd and gre proteins clearly it is possible that other functions of mfd remain to be discovered the mfd protein e coli mfd is a large multifunctional protein of 130 k d molecular weight — in the upper 1 of e coli proteins by mass  figure 1  its major functional elements were determined by selby and sancar 134 first it contains a region bearing motifs characteristic of sfii ‘helicases’ — although as explained later these elements are believed to function as a dna translocase that moves the transcription elongation complex along duplex dna and to have no activity to separate dna strands in particular selby and sancar found that the ‘helicase’ region has close homology to a portion of the bacterial rec g dna repair protein 20 that is believed to be an atpdependent translocase motor acting in rec g to promote migration of holliday junctions second mfd contains a region of homology to the uvr b excision protein a site that is believed to function in both proteins in binding uvr a this segment therefore is likely to be responsible for bringing the excision repair machinery to the stalled rnapmfd complex third there is a domain that binds rnap and in particular a region of the rnap β subunit that is near the rewinding locus of the transcription bubble 21 •• finally there is a ‘trg’ translocation in rec g motif to the right of the ‘helicase’ motifs and also part of the rec g homology region which is required for the translocase activity 22 •23 • download fullsize image figure 1 diagram of the 1148 amino acid e coli mfd protein the leftmost portion contains a uvr b homology segment that is believed to act in recruiting the excision repair complex to rnap but is not required for release of rnap the rid rna polymerase interacting domain binds mfd to rna polymerase and the ‘helicase’ motifs along with the trg translocase in rec g element are believed to induce translocation of rnap along dna leading to its release from the template when elongation is prevented transcript release and repair coupling activities of mfd purified mfd protein alone suffices to dissociate stalled elongation complexes of e coli rnap whether elongation is blocked by a noncoding template lesion such as a pyrimidine dimer by low concentration of nucleoside triphosphate substrate or by physical obstruction for example a downstream dna binding protein 121 •• both rna and rnap are released from the dna mfd has dna binding activity and if the atpase activity is inhibited by the poorly hydrolyzed analog atpγs or by mutation in the atpase motifs it forms a complex with dna that is detectable by bandshift 322 • presumably hydrolysis allows cycling and releases mfd from dna the segment of dna required for mfd to dissociate the transcription complex was determined to be ∼25 base pairs of duplex dna upstream of the transcription bubble 21 •• the possibility also exists that mfd binds dna in the accessible nontemplate strand component of the transcription bubble mfd does not release rnap complexes containing the σ70 initiation factor even a specialized class of σ70containing elongating complexes with a 25 nucleotide transcript 21 •• this result is consistent with the resistance of promoter complexes to transcription coupled repair — a fact that is also true of eukaryotic promoter complexes consistent with its cellular function to mediate strandspecific excision repair coupled to transcription mfd also stimulates the activity of the uvr abc complex to excise pyrimidine dimers in vitro 1 only these purified proteins along with mfd and rnap are required in vitro arguing that the mechanism of repair enhancement is the recruitment of uvr ab through the uvr b homology region in mfd the function of this region has not yet been demonstrated by mutagenesis an indication that the overall pathway is more complex is that mutations in the mismatch repair machinery  mut s and mut l but not mut h impair mfdmediated strandspecific excision repair in vivo 2425 there is no evidence that these proteins act directly in trancription coupled repair the functional and kinetic relation of the release and the repair coupling activities of mfd is of interest because a lesion that obstructs elongation must be well buried within the elongation complex removal of rnap is essential for the excision complex to act thus mfd might remain bound to the template after rnap is released recruiting uvr abc directly to the lesion alternatively mfd might bring the complex to free dna adjacent to the rnapbound lesion from which it could bind the lesion through diffusion along the dna once rnap is released translocase activity of mfd an examination of the effect of the translocation state of rnap on mfdmediated transcript release showed that mfd has rnap translocase activity moving it along dna in the direction of rna synthesis forward 21 •• during the course of transcription through particular dna sequences rnap can reverse translocate backtrack along dna for a few or for many base pairs unwinding dna at the back of the transcription bubble and rewinding it at the front and simultaneously extruding the rna 3′ end through the secondary channel of the enzyme 26–28 this isomerization is the prelude to the wellcharacterized cleavage activity stimulated by the bacterial gre a and gre b proteins 29 certain backtracked complexes which are said to have ‘arrested’ do not spontaneously recover through forward translocation however it was shown that mfd induces forward translocation of such arrested complexes 21 •• this follows from the demonstration that mfd releases rna from arrested complexes efficiently but if substrate ribonucleotide triphosphates ntps are present mfd rescues arrested complexes into productive elongation — an outcome that neither mfd or ntps alone provide rescue could occur only if mfd pushed rnap to a forward position in which the rna 3′ end is in the active site  figure 2  download fullsize image figure 2 effect of the dna translocase activity of mfd on rna polymerase the top drawing depicts a backtracked elongation complex bound by mfd through the rid which is adjacent to the translocase segment the translocase is shown as two domains as determined for the homologous rec g structure 30 translocase activity moves dna in the direction of the arrow pushing rna forward until the rna 3′ end is in the active site red rectangle if ntp is present elongation continues right in the absence of ntps or in other conditions that prevent elongation translocase activity causes collapse of the transcription bubble and leads to transcription complex dissociation left the close homology of portions of mfd to the wellcharacterized ‘helicase’ rec g and to other helicase family members argues that mfd contains a translocase motor that moves it and the attached rnap along dna accounting for its activity on rnap 21 •• this conclusion depends on a structural analysis of a rec g–dna complex that finds the rec g ‘helicase’ to be in fact a dna translocase 30 the rnap binding domain is however unique to mfd as is the holliday junction binding portion of rec g this comparison leads to the model that both proteins use atp energy to translocate along duplex dna rec g moving the duplex dna relative to the holiday junction thus forcing branch migration and mfd moving duplex dna relative to rnap the location of the mfdbinding segment of rnap in a portion of its β subunit near the site of upstream dna rewinding of the transcription bubble 21 •• and thus near the ∼25 base pair upstream segment of the transcription complex that mfd requires for its activity is consistent with this model trg — a segment of the homologous translocase domain of mfd and rec g separate from the classical helicase motifs was shown by mutagenesis to be required for the activity of each protein 22 •23 • the rec g structural model implies that the trg could provide the dna contacts that move to provide the translocase motor function 23 • mfd both binds dna and hydrolyzes atp although with a weak turnover rate of about three atps per minute 1 d atp also suffices to support rnap release and presumably also is hydrolyzed 21 •• nonetheless no dnadependent or transcription complexdependent ntp hydrolase activity has been demonstrated presumably this means that appropriate conditions have not been found to reveal the use of atp or d atp energy in a coupled reaction there is a demonstrable competition between mfdinduced rna release and elongation in vitro at very low concentrations of ntp 1–10 μm range mfd releases elongating rnap at an array of sites in a segment of several hundred base pairs whereas ntp concentrations of the order of 100 μm which is likely to be still less than physiological levels completely suppress release by mfd 21 •• given this competition it is noteworthy that constitutive production of very high mfd levels from a plasmid does not inhibit cell growth 1 whereas it might be expected that a hundredfold increase in mfd concentration would simulate low ntp concentration and cause premature transcript release conceivably rnap is insensitive to mfd during normal elongation and only relaxes into a receptive state when low ntp allows a conformational change the putative eukaryotic transcription repair coupling factor csb also stimulates elongation advancing an rna polymerase ii complex by a nucleotide 31 but unlike mfd the eukaryotic protein does not release transcription complexes 32 it has been suggested that the known pol ii and pol i termination factor ttf2 is the actual release factor in transcription coupled repair 33 like mfd the mammalian csb and its yeast counterpart rad26 as well as ttf2 are atpases with helicase motifs but related more closely to the swisnf family of chromatin remodeling proteins 10 • the more general common feature of these proteins might be described as complex remodeling — that is using atpdependent dna translocase activity to free damaged dna of rnap and other obstructive proteins the activity of mfd could be compared to chromatinremodeling activities 34 with histone binding substituted for rnap binding transcript release activity of mfd and models of transcription termination the activity of an rnaptethered dna translocase function to disrupt the transcription elongation complex has distinct implications for the mechanism of transcription termination although it is possible that other functions of mfd besides the rnap binding segment contribute to the release activity there is strong evidence that translocase activity is the main agent first release requires atp hydrolysis in vitro second mutations in the atpbinding and trg motifs impair release finally it can be rationalized that transcript release by the other two mechanisms rho and intrinsic terminators uses a related pathway the specific hypothesis is that the translocase activity of mfd has two consequences depending on the ability of the active site of rnap to function 21 •• first if elongation is permitted mfd induces forward translocation by pushing rnap as it tracks along the upstream dna presumably this has no particular consequence unless rnap backtracking has occurred in which case mfd would facilitate isomerization to the forward position and continued elongation second if elongation is obstructed the effect of the dna translocase activity is to exert torque on the dna relative to rnap we conjecture that this torque induces transcription bubble collapse from upstream perhaps also forcing the enzyme forward without transcript extension thus initiating dissociation of the transcription complex  figure 2  there is evidence for bubble collapse as a requirement for release base pair substitutions in the nontemplate strand region of the bubble which prevent base pairing upon dna rewinding inhibit mfdmediated transcript release 35 similar evidence implicates bubble rewinding in intrinsic termination 36 and also in rhomediated termination js park and jw roberts unpublished one view is that the mechanisms have in common an activity that induces branch migration of the rear of the transcription bubble with a concerted rewinding of dna and unwinding of the rnadna hybrid mfd does this by promoting dna rewinding whereas the hairpin of the intrinsic terminator and the rnabinding activity of rho act by imposing unwinding force on the hybrid conclusions there is now a clear biochemical model for the activity of mfd in releasing stalled transcription complexes it acts by forcing rewinding of the transcription bubble from upstream and inducing a coordinated bubble collapse and unwinding of the stabilizing rnadna hybrid of the transcription complex the future should provide much more detailed views of this activity in part from further biochemical and genetic analysis but also with luck from structural studies of mfd both alone and in transcription complexes a different and interesting challenge will be to understand exactly how excision repair is coordinated with the release activity of mfd and finally the question arises whether mfd has a broader role in coordinating processes of transcription repair and replication does mfd contribute importantly to normal cell function by removing rna polymerase in other situations than obstruction by dna damage
