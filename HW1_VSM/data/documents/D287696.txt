schools nais which represents hundreds of private schools across the country shows just how much the going rates for a private education vary within the united states the data offers a peek into how private institutions spend the tuition money parents pony up—and the extent to which families in different parts of the country will sacrifice their hardearned cash to sidestep the public school system private schools are the least expensive in the south—particularly the southeast which encompasses states ranging from mississippi to north carolina and where a private elementary school costs

charged 27400 on average this year it would appear then that denser population centers come with higher sticker prices for private schools and that makes sense—but not necessarily because private schools charge more in places where there are more people or a larger demand for private education rather densely populated places tend to have higher costs of living and higher costs of living mean higher costs of doing business says myra mc govern of nais you’re running a nonprofit a small business mc govern said you want to make sure your employees can afford to live in the areas they have to work particularly because independent schools require a pretty big time commitment from staff about threefourths of a private school’s budget typically goes toward salaries and benefits according to mc govern that distribution generally mirrors public school spending with about 80 percent of public education budgets nationwide spent on salaries and benefits during the 201011 school year according to the national center for education statistics that explains why private schools in areas with higher costs of living such as new york city generally cost much more than those in less expensive parts of the country like memphis the tuition has to support the schools’ teachers—teachers who it’s worth noting generally earn less than their public school counterparts there’s a perception that private schools just charge whatever the market will bear it’s not a perfect correlation mc govern acknowledged but it is a clear correlation still other factors unrelated to a region’s local economy could be at play too private schools on the east coast tend to be older and often subscribe to conventional collegeprep pedagogies in other words they can charge more because they’re prestigious long legacies also tend to mean more diverse individualized course offerings—and more programs mean more costs mc govern noted demand for private school education does tell part of the story but it’s ultimately hard to draw comparisons with price according to mc govern the northeast has the highest rate of privateschool attendance 14 percent of its schoolage children were enrolled in private institutions in 2009 the most recent year the national center for education statistics tracked such data but in the west—home to some of the highest tuition figures—just 8 percent of students were enrolled in private schools that year the lowest attendance rate in the country nationally one out of every 10 students was in a private school that year there’s a perception out there that private schools just charge whatever the market will bear mc govern said that’s really not how the majority of schools factor tuition at all share tweet latest video to be inside a safe space a swimming pool becomes a haven for
