chromium by o loss the aluminium is oxidised to aluminium oxide by o gain and the aluminium is the reducing agent ie the o remover these are examples of metal displacement reactions eg the less

chromium iii cr 3 aq the strong reducing power of chromium ii cr 2 aq and the strong oxidising power of chromium vi cr2o72–summary of some complexes–compounds  oxidation states of chromium compared to other 3d–block elements chromium vi oxidation state chemistry the simple hexaaquachromium vi cation cr h 2o 6 6 cannot exist in aqueous media in fact i doubt if the simple cr 6ion can exist in any ionic compound the high charge would theoretically draw over the electron cloud of the negative anion to form a covalent bond note that chromium vi oxide cr o 3 and chromium vi fluoride cr f 6 both compounds have cr in 6 oxidation state are covalent compounds despite the relatively large electronegativity difference between the metal and non–metal if the oxidation state of the central metal ion is over 3 it appears that deprotonation via proton transfer to water is so facilitated that in most cases there may be exceptions all protons are theoretically lost to give the oxyanionie the theoretical cr h 2o 6 6ends up in reality as cr 2o 72–or cr o 42–depending on p h the reason for this situation is that the high charge density of the theoretical central metal ion gives it a high polarising power you can theoretically conceive the situation of imagining the central metal ion pulling on the electrons of the m–oh 2 and m–oh ligand bonds in two stages to leave a mo bond in the oxyanionie considering one co–ordinated water molecule and ignoring the charge on intermediate complexes  m–oh 2proton loss m–oh proton loss mothere is theoretically always an equilibrium between the chromate vi ion and the dichromate vi ion2cr o 42– aq 2h  aqcr 2o 72– aq h 2o ltherefore from le chateliers principle high p h alkaline favours the formation of the chromate vi ion and low p h acid favours dichromate vi ion formation when hydrogen peroxide is added to an alkaline chromium iii solution oxidation occurs to give the yellow chromate vi ion cr o42– 2cr 3 aq 3h 2o 2 aq 10oh – aq 2cr o

used for this cr iii to cr vi conversion what we are looking at here is a case of a p h change producing different halfcell potentials and different species involved in a redox reaction for strongly

more nerdy moments on my website to obtain equation  d  set out below ive kindly left out the state symbols until the end for logic claritycheck out the triple check at each stage in deriving equation

examination but not all the details but you should understand all the principles used in this explanation and appreciate that changing the p h of an oxidant can change both its oxidising power and
