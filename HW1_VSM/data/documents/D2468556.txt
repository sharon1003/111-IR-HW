news donald trump immigration 15 reasons why ending birthright citizenship is a horrible idea like twitter email by latin times  aug 18 2015 0420pm edtdonald trump presented a number of controversial measures in his presidential campaigns presidential plan last sunday while deporting the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country was perhaps the most financially nonviable proposal ending citizenship for children born in the u s might be the most politically impossible task aside from needing to repeal the 14th amendment here are the 15 reasons why ending birthright citizenship is a horrible idea reutersbrendan mc dermid donald trump doesn’t want children born in america to get u s citizenship if their parents are in the country illegally as a part of his 100200 billion dollar deportation plan  birthright citizenship legally known as jus soli guarantees the right of citizenship to people born on american soil birthright is currently guaranteed by the 14th amendment according to legal scholars some opponents of birthright citizenship point out that the amendment ratified in 1868 was intended to prevent discrimination and disenfranchisement of africanamericans they also point out that america’s birthright laws are a minority approach amongst world nations and evoke a set of farfetched hypotheticals that we’ll deal with at the end of the article trump calls birthright citizenship the “ biggest magnet ” for immigration saying that it is the biggest driver of illegal immigration trump is not the only antibirthright candidate in the 2016 presidential race a number of his republican colleagues support ending birthright citizenship  scott walker lindsey graham rand paul chris christie bobby jindal have either said that birthright citizenship should be reconsidered or stated explicitly that they would seek to change the law to exclude certain immigrant children according to huff po  carly fiorina jeb bush mike huckabee and marco rubio have said that would not change it trump does not detail exactly who would be denied citizenship under his plan should citizenship be revoked if just one parent were unauthorized or would it have to be both would the millions of children of unauthorized parents currently in the country be stripped of citizenship retroactively would he pass a law and hope that the supreme court doesn’t strike it down or would he seek to change the 14th amendment below we list the reasons why ending birthright citizenship would be bad or worse depending on how it were carried out the “magnet” argument has never been prove n or even tested this year the idea of immigration policies such as dacadapa serving as a significant draw for migrants has been rejected by u s district courts in two separate cases for being “unscientific” and “ speculative ” conversely there’s little to no empirical evidence that ending citizenship rights would act as a deterrent to unauthorized immigration repealing the 14th amendment might disenfranchise secondgeneration immigrants but it doesn’t mean they won’t be in the country it’s no magic deportation wand the undocumented population in the country would swell the currently number of immigrants living in the shadows would grow to 16 million by 2050 according to the washington post who cites the nonpartisan migration policy institute that’s if the law were limited to children with two parents in the country illegally if it included just on undocumented parent the number would be 25 million  the economy is hurt when immigrants are kept in the shadows according to a study authored by the leftleaning center for american progress one can debate over the positive and negative effects of immigration but no matter where an immigrant is from and what skills they have the ones that are here generally do better and contribute more to society when they have the legal protection of citizenship or a visa ending birthright citizenship is dreamers squared the u s is already torn over the grey area of dreamers  children brought to the u s illegally when they are minors who grow up here why expand the number of people who feel act talk and live like citizens who are not recognized as such like dreamers these babies would be “breaking” immigration law making it difficult for them to “immigrate” to the u s in the future whether it’s african slaves or children of latino migrants the 14th amendment solves the same problem people who are born and raised in america can’t be discriminated against disenfranchised etc immigrant children don’t always learn their parent’s language deporting them to their “native” country is horrendous according to pew  20 percent of secondgeneration immigrants and 60 percent of asian immigrants can’t speak their parents’ language well look at the dominican republic which recently ended birthright citizenship as part of a long history of discriminating against the black population in the d r the country is currently ousting haitian immigrants and their descendents the secondgeneration immigrants often don’t speak haitian creole  black dominicans have faced increased scrutiny when applying for passports  red herring 1 anchor babies opponents of birthright citizenship allege that a significant number of immigrants intentionally give birth in the u s in order to increase their chances of getting permanent residency under our current laws that favor family members in the immigration process in reality it’s a farflung and littleused loophole u s citizens can not sponsor relatives until they are 21 years old  making the anchor baby scheme pretty complex familybased immigration could be changed without repealing the 14th amendment red herring 2 tourism babies hundreds of cases of women traveling to the u s in order to give birth usually from china have been reported this is currently legal it could be prohibited without changing citizenship laws it’s also not a widespread problem red herring 3 terrorism babies “imagine a young man born in the united states of nonimmigrant parents and taken away at a very early age reared in waziristan educated in islamist madrassas and trained in the fundamentals of terror at one of the many camps in southwestern asia” writes antiimmigration think tank cis  the closest example to this that cis cites is anwar alawlaki who never traveled to the u s to commit an attack but allegedly supported others who did so if using his citizenship was such a foolproof plan why didn’t he also note that americans killed anwar alawlaki in a drone strike it doesn’t take an imagination to know who commits terrorism in the u s the majority of terrorismrelated deaths since 911 have been perpetrated by antigovernment nuts and homegrown racists a small minority are immigrants or children of immigrants who were in the country legally the 911 terrorists themselves came to the country legally on a mix of tourism student and other visas bonus harry reid trump and other republicans often cite democratic senate majority leader harry reid as a supporter of ending birthright citizenship he did introduce a bill advocating for such a measure in 1993 what thye dont say is that hes publically regretted the decision calling it the lowpoint of his career according to politifact  i didnt understand the issue im embarrassed that i made such a proposal he said in 1999 as a refresher here’s the 14th amendment stylized with bullet points all persons born or naturalized in the united states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the united states and of the state wherein they reside no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the u s nor shall any state deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws got any more reasons why ending birthright is a bad idea let us
