how medicare covers dme durable medical equipment and oxygen equipment oxygen therapy equipment falls under the category known as “durable medical equipment” dme as do all necessary medical devices covered by medicare many other types of medical equipment also fall under this category things like hospital beds wheelchairs prosthetic equipment and oxygen concentrators are all considered dme with part b original medicare will cover dme when your doctor deems it necessary and provides it for use in your home in this situation nursing homes and hospitals providing you with medicarecovered care will not qualify as your “home” if you are living in a longterm care facility however this facility can count as your home and your oxygen equipment could be covered under medicare also if you are in a nursing home or other hospital setting and they provide you with the equipment the facility is responsible for paying for upkeep repairs and replacements hmo or ppo medicare advantage plans must cover the same items as original medicare the costs will vary depending on which plan you choose depending on the plan the costs might even be cheaper than original medicare if you are already benefiting from a medicare advantage plan contact them and ask how much dme will cost under their plan if you are switching to a new medicare advantage plan be sure to call the new plan and ask for utilization management they will tell you if your specific equipment will be covered and how much it will cost if you are switching to original medicare you can tell your supplier to bill medicare as soon as your medicare advantage plan is up you will also need to ask for a utilization plan if your insurance provider leaves the medicare advantage plan they will tell you what you need to do to get care under the original medicare benefits or if you can switch to a different medicare advantage plan under original medicare your doctor will need to write a prescription for all the dme you will need for some typs of dme they may also have to write a separate letter directly to medicare stating your need for the equipment this certificate must be resubmitted whenever you need new equipment this document is known as a “certificate of medical necessity” your doctor and your supplier will work together to make sure all the proper paperwork is done and submitted to medicare in general under medicare part b you would need to pay 20 of the amount approved by medicare after you have met your deductible for that year for the year of 2015 the deductible is 147 medicare will then pay the remaining 80 medicares approved amount is lower than the cost of the equipment you might be required to pay less because medicare pays for certain types of equipment in different ways sometimes equipment is set up to be rented or treated as a rental from the medical supply company such is the case with oxygen therapy equipment there is often a specific time period attached to the rental period for oxygen therapy equipment this initial period lasts for 36 months after that 36 months you will be done paying for your part of the equipment and the contract will go on for another 2 years if you still need the equipment the medical supply company will still be responsible for the maintenance and any repairs needed on the home oxygen equipment what is “assignment” according to original medicare assignment is the agreement entered into by your caregivers medical suppliers medicare and you for you to receive the care and equipment you need covered under medicare those who are billing medicare who agree to accept the assignment are agreeing to accept the medicareapproved amount as the fully payment for services you must be the 20 coinsurance and the deductible and then medicare will pay the remaining 80 in order to receive the equipment you need you will need to find a supplier who is enrolled in the medicare program enrolled members known as “participating suppliers” are required to accept assignment suppliers who are enrolled but not classified as “participating” have the option of whether to accept assignment or not if they are not enrolled you will need to pay the cost of the dme out of pocket but the equipment will be under your complete control with no restrictions on use you can go to medicaregov to find a list of suppliers in your area who accept assignment lets say youve found a supplier that participates in assignment now you need to find out what dme medicare will pay to rent and what equipment medicare will flat out purchase for you medicare will generally only purchase inexpensive items such as canes or wheelchairs while hightech devices such as oxygen concentrators medicare will pay to rent but will be taken away at the end of the contract and you have to go through the process again if you do own some medicare covered dme medicare will continue to cover 80 of the costs for repairs and replacements if you rent medicare will make monthly payments for the cost of the item and how long this goes on depends on the type of equipment you will have to pay 20 plus the deductible for these costs when you no longer need the rental equipment the supplier will pick it up for you they also be responsible to come and get it if it needs repairs or a replacement please contact us at 18777749271 if you have any questions on medicare and oxygen equipment
