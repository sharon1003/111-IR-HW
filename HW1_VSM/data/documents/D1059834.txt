certain verb forms are classified as auxiliary verbs 1 exact definitions of this term vary an auxiliary verb is generally conceived as one with little semantic meaning of its own which modifies the meaning of another verb with which it cooccurs in english verbs are often classed as auxiliaries on the basis of certain grammatical properties particularly as regards their syntax – primarily whether they participate in subject–auxiliary inversion and can be negated by the simple addition of not after them certain auxiliaries have contracted forms such as d and ll for hadwould and willshall there are also many contractions formed from the negations of auxiliary verbs ending in nt a reduced form of not  these latter contractions can participate in inversion as a unit as in why havent you done it where the uncontracted form would be why have you not done it  and thus in a certain sense can be regarded as auxiliary verbs in their own right for details about the verbs classed as modal

adding grammatical information to it 2 on this basis the auxiliary verbs of english may be taken to includeforms of the verb do  do does did  when used with other verbs to enable the formation of questions negation emphasis etc see do support forms of the verb have when used to express perfect aspectforms of the verb be when used to express progressive aspect or passive voicethe modal verbs used in a variety of meanings principally relating to modality the following are examples of sentences containing the above types of auxiliary verbs do you want tea – do is an auxiliary accompanying the verb want used here to form a question he had given his all – had is an auxiliary accompanying the past participle given expressing perfect aspect we are singing – are is an auxiliary accompanying the present participle singing expressing progressive aspect it was destroyed – was is an auxiliary accompanying the past participle destroyed expressive passive voice he can do it now – can is a modal auxiliary accompanying the verb do however the above understanding of auxiliary verbs is not always strictly adhered to in the literature particularly in the case of forms of the verb be which may be called auxiliaries even when they do not accompany another verb other approaches to defining auxiliary verbs are described in the following sections auxiliaries as verbs with special grammatical behavior  editthere is a group of english verbs which have certain special grammatical  syntactic properties that distinguish them from other verbs this group consists mainly of verbs that are auxiliaries in the above sense – verbs that add grammatical meaning to other verbs – and thus some authors use the term auxiliary verb in relation to english to denote precisely the verbs in this group however not all enumerations of english auxiliary verbs correspond exactly to the group of verbs having these grammatical properties this group of verbs may also be referred to by other names such as special verbs 3the principal distinguishing properties of verbs in this special group are as follows they can participate in what is called subject–auxiliary inversion ie they can swap places with the subject of the clause to form questions and for certain other purposes for example inversion of subject and verb is possible in the sentence they can sing becoming can they sing  but it is not possible in they like to sing – it is not correct to say  like they to sing instead do support is required do they like to sing  4they undergo negation by the addition of not after them for example one can say they cannot sing but not  they like not to sing again do support is required they dont like  5other distinct features of verbs in this group include their ability to introduce verb phrase ellipsis  i can sing can be shortened to i can in appropriate contexts whereas i like to sing cannot be shortened to i like  and the positioning of certain adverbs directly after them compare i can often sing with i often like to sing  the group of verbs with the above properties consists ofthe finite indicative forms of the verb be am is are was werethe finite indicative forms of the verb have have has had principally when used to make perfect verb formsthe finite indicative forms of the verb do do does did when used to provide do supportthe principal modal verbs can could may might must shall should will wouldcertain other verbs sometimes but not always classed as modals ought dare and need in certain uses had in had better and sometimes used in used to see the relevant sections of english modal verbs for details if membership of this syntactic class is considered to be the defining property for auxiliary verbs it is therefore the abovelisted verbs that will be considered as auxiliaries additionally nonindicative and nonfinite forms of the same verbs when performing the same functions are usually described as auxiliaries too even though all or most of the distinctive syntactical properties do not apply to them specifically this concerns be as infinitive imperative and subjunctive being and been and when used in the expression of perfect aspect have having and had the chief difference between this syntactic definition of auxiliary verb and the functional definition given in the section above is that the syntactic definition includes the verb be even when used simply as a copular verb in sentences like i am hungry and it was a cat where it does not accompany any other verb 6 for this and other differences in the sets of words identified as auxiliaries by various authors see the following section sometimes nonauxiliary uses of have follow auxiliary syntax as in have you any ideas and i havent a clue other lexical verbs do not do this in modern english although they did so formerly and such uses as i know not can be found in archaic english differences in listings of auxiliary verbs  editlists or sets of auxiliary verbs in english as given by various authors generally consist of most or all of the verbs mentioned in the above sections though with minor discrepancies 7the main differences between the various proposed sets of auxiliary verbs are noted below for the reasons mentioned above forms of the verb be may or may not be regarded as auxiliaries when used as a copula not accompanying any other verb 8the verb ought is sometimes excluded from the class of auxiliaries specifically the modal auxiliaries on the grounds that unlike the principal modals it requires the to infinitive rather than the bare infinitive 9the verbs dare and need are not always considered auxiliaries or modals 10 their auxiliarylike syntactic behavior and their modallike invariance applies only to some instances of these verbs – see dare and need the verbs had and used in the expressions had better and used to are not always included among the auxiliaries or modals in the case of used to questions and negations are in any case more frequently formed using do support than with auxiliary syntax 11other verbs with modallike or auxiliarylike function may sometimes be classed as auxiliaries even though they do not have auxiliarylike syntactic behavior this may apply to have in the expression have to meaning must 12as mentioned below the contractions of negated forms of auxiliary verbs  isnt shouldnt etc behave in a certain sense as if they were auxiliaries in their own right in that they can participate as a whole in subject–auxiliary inversion meaning contribution  editforms of the verbs have and be used as auxiliaries with a main verbs past participle and present participle respectively express perfect aspect and progressive aspect when forms of be are used with the past participle they express passive voice it is possible to combine any two or all three of these uses the room has been being cleaned for the past three hours here the auxiliaries has been and being each followed by the appropriate participle type combine to express perfect and progressive aspect and passive voice the auxiliary do  does did does not necessarily make any meaning contribution   although it can be used to add emphasis to a clause this is called the emphatic mood in english an example of this use is found in i do go to work on time every day also do does help in the formation of questions negations etc as described in the article on do support some other languages such as german do not have an emphatic mood and such emphasis is given either by the tone of voice of the speaker or by the use of adverbs other auxiliaries – the modal verbs – contribute meaning chiefly in the form of modality although some of them particularly will and sometimes shall express future time reference their uses are detailed at english modal verbs and tables summarizing their principal meaning contributions can be found in the articles modal verb and auxiliary verb for more details on the uses of auxiliaries to express aspect mood and time reference see english clause syntax contractions  editcontractions are a common feature of english used frequently in ordinary speech in written english contractions are used in some semiformal writing and mostly in informal writing 13 they usually involve the elision of a vowel – an apostrophe being inserted in its place in written english – possibly accompanied by other changes many of these contractions involve auxiliary verbs and their negations although not all of these have common contractions and there are also certain other contractions not involving these verbs contractions were first used in speech during the early 17th century and in writing during the mid 17th century when not lost its stress and tone and formed the contraction nt around the same time contracted auxiliaries were first used when it was first used it was limited in writing to only fiction and drama in the 19th and 20th centuries the use of contractions in writing spread outside of fiction such as personal letters journalism and descriptive texts 13certain contractions tend to be restricted to speech and very informal writing such as johnd or maryd for johnmary would compare the personal pronoun forms id and youd which are more likely to be encountered in relatively informal writing this applies in particular to constructions involving consecutive contractions such as wouldntve for would not have contractions in english are generally not mandatory as in some other languages it is almost always acceptable to use the uncontracted form although in speech this may seem overly formal this is often done for emphasis i am ready the uncontracted form of an auxiliary or copula must be used in elliptical sentences where its complement is omitted whos ready i am not  im  some contractions lead to homophony which sometimes causes errors in writing confusion is particularly common between its for it ishas and the pronoun possessive its and sometimes similarly between youre and your for the confusion of have or ve with of as in would of for would have  see weak and strong forms in english contractions of the type described here should not be confused with abbreviations such as ltd for limited company contractionlike abbreviations such as intl for international are considered abbreviations as their contracted forms cannot be pronounced in speech abbreviations also include acronyms and initialisms contracted auxiliaries  editthe following contractions of auxiliary verbs including forms of be whether as a strict auxiliary or as a copula are usedm for am in im for i ams for is as in its for it is  the mans for the man is although the same form is used for the possessivere for are mostly in were youre and theyreve for auxiliary have mostly in ive youve weve and theyves for auxiliary has the examples given above for is could also be intended as it has and the man hasd for auxiliary had mostly in id youd etc and whod including in the expression had better  and similarly for wouldll for will sometimes interpreted as shallin very informal english s for does and d for did as in whats  what does he do there whod  who did you see there the contraction s representing is  has or does is pronounced in the same way as the regular plural ending  es and possessive ending s namely as ɪz or ə when following a sibilant sound as s when following any other voiceless consonant and as z otherwise negative contractions  editcontractions of negated auxiliary verbs in standard english are formed by reducing the negative grammatical particle not to nt a clitic or suffix which is fused to the root verb form which is modified in a few cases the nt may form a separate syllable as in isnt and wouldnt which are twosyllable words or may become part of the preceding syllable as in the monosyllables dont arent and werent the standard contractions for negation of auxiliaries are as follows from forms of be isnt arent wasnt werent from forms of have havent hasnt hadnt from forms of do dont doesnt didnt from modal verbs cant the full form is the single word cannot  couldnt maynt rare mightnt mustnt shant for shall not  shouldnt wont for will not  wouldnt darent neednt oughtnt usednt rare the above contractions can appear when the verb follows auxiliarytype syntax as defined in the section auxiliaries as verbs with special grammatical behavior § notes this includes all uses of be and for some speakers have when used to denote possession as in i havent a clue  for details of the usage of the modal contractions see the relevant sections of english modal verbs for the possibility of inverting a negative contraction with the clause subject see § contractions and inversion below the following four of the standard negative contractions involve changes to the form of the auxiliary in cant for cannot  the vowel may change – can has æ in the strong form and ə in the more common weak form whereas cant has ɑː in rp and æ in standard american pronunciation it was formerly written cant in dont there is again a vowel change from the uː of do to the oʊ  əʊ of dont in shant for shall not  the l sound is dropped and the vowel changes in rp from the æ or weaker ə of shall to the ɑː of shant  this contractions not common in american english it evolved from shallnt and was formerly written shant in wont for will not  again the l sound is dropped and the vowel is oʊ  əʊ rather than the ɪ of will there is no standard contraction for am not except in inversion this is known as the amnt gap some nonstandard contractions for this and certain other negations are described in the following sections contractions representing am not  editalthough there is no contraction for am not in standard english there are certain colloquial or dialectal forms that may fill this role these may be used in declarative sentences whose standard form contains i am not and in questions with standard form am i not in the declarative case the standard contraction im not is available but this does not apply in questions where speakers may feel the need for a negative contraction to form the analog of isnt it arent they etc see § contractions and inversion below the following are sometimes used in place of am not in the cases described above the contraction aint may stand for am not among its other uses for details see the next section and the separate article on aint the word amnae for am not exists in scots and has been borrowed into scottish english by many speakers 14the contraction amnt formed in the regular manner of the other negative contractions as described above is a standard contraction of am not in some dialects of mainly hibernoenglish irish english and scottish english 15 16 in hibernoenglish the question form  amnt i is used more frequently than the declarative i amnt 14 the standard im not is available as an alternative to i amnt in both scottish english and hibernoenglish an example appears in oliver st john gogarty s impious poem the ballad of japing jesus if anyone thinks that i amnt divine  he gets no free drinks when im making the wine these lines are quoted in james joyce s ulysses 17 which also contains other examples amnt i with you amnt i your girl spoken by cissy caffrey to leopold bloom in chapter 15 18the contraction arent which in standard english represents are not is a very common means of filling the amnt gap in questions arent i lucky to have you around some twentiethcentury writers described this usage as illiterate or awkward today however it is reported to be almost universal among speakers of standard english 19 arent as a contraction for am not developed from one pronunciation of ant which itself developed in part from amnt see the etymology of aint in the following section in nonrhotic dialects arent and this pronunciation of ant are homophones and the spelling arent i began to replace ant i in the early part of the 20th century 20 although examples of arent i for am i not appear in the first half of the 19th century as in st martins day from hollandtide by gerald griffin published in the ant in 1827 arent i listening and isnt it only the breeze thats blowing the sheets and halliards about there is therefore no completely satisfactory firstperson alternative to arent you and isnt it in standard english the grammatical am i not sounds stilted or affected while arent i is grammatically dubious and aint i is considered substandard 21 nonetheless arent i is the solution adopted in practice by most speakers other colloquial contractions  editaint described in more detail in the article aint is a colloquialism and contraction for am not is not was not are not were not has not and have not 22 in some dialects aint is also used as a contraction of do not does not did not cannot can not  could not will not would not and should not the usage of aint is a perennial subject of controversy in english 23aint has several antecedents in english corresponding to the various forms of to be not and to have not ant sometimes ant arose from am not via amnt and are not almost simultaneously ant first appears in print in the work of english restoration playwrights in 1695 ant was used as a contraction of am not and as early as 1696 ant was used to mean are not ant for is not may have developed independently from its use for am not and are not isnt was sometimes written as int or ent which could have changed into ant ant for is not may also have filled a gap as an extension of the alreadyused conjugations for to be not ant with a long a sound began to be written as aint which first appears in writing in 1749 by the time aint appeared ant was already being used for am not are not and is not ant and aint coexisted as written forms well into the nineteenth century hant or hant an early contraction for has not and have not developed from the elision of the s of has not and the v of have not hant also appeared in the work of english restoration playwrights much like ant hant was sometimes pronounced with a long a yielding haint with hdropping the h of hant or haint gradually disappeared in most dialects and became aint aint as a contraction for has nothave not appeared in print as early as 1819 as with ant haint and aint were found together late into the nineteenth century some other colloquial and dialect contractions are described belowbaint or baint apparently a contraction of be not is found in a number of works employing eye dialect including j sheridan le fanu s uncle silas 24 it is also found in a ballad written in newfoundland dialect 25dont is a standard english contraction of do not however for some speakers dont also functions colloquially as a contraction of does not emma she dont live here anymore this is considered incorrect in standard english haint in addition to being an antecedent of ain’t is a contraction of has not and have not in some dialects of english such as appalachian english it is reminiscent of hae have in lowland scots in dialects that retain the distinction between haint and aint haint is used for contractions of to have not and aint for contractions of to be not 26 in other dialects haint is used either in place of or interchangeably with aint haint is seen for example in chapter 33 of mark twain s the adventures of huckleberry finn i haint come back  i haint been gone haint is to be distinguished from haint a slang term for ghost ie a haunt famously used in the novel to kill a mockingbird  contractions not involving auxiliaries  editthe following contractions used in english do not involve either auxiliaries as defined in this article or their negationslets for let us when used to make firstperson plural imperativesin some nonstandard dialects s for as used for the relative pronoun thato in oclock originally a contraction of the words of thet for it archaic except in stock uses such as twas the night before christmasd for ed the simple past tense marker archaic except in abbreviated or shortened verbs em for them in fact from the old form hem – see english personal pronounsim er is etc for him her his etc – see

forms of syncope may also be considered contractions such as wanna for want to gonna for going to and others common in colloquial speech the suffix a can be a contraction for the auxiliary have such as woulda for would have contractions and inversion  editin cases of subject–auxiliary inversion particularly in the formation of questions the negative contractions can remain together as a unit and invert with the subject thus acting as if they were auxiliary verbs in their own right for example he is going → is he going regular affirmative question formationhe isnt going → isnt he going negative question formation isnt inverts with hethe alternative is not to use the contraction in which case only the verb inverts with the subject while the not remains in place after it he is not going → is he not going note that the form with isnt he is no longer a simple contraction of the fuller form which must be is he not and not  is not he  some more examples why havent you washed  why have you not washed cant you sing  can you not sing the full form cannot is redivided in case of inversionwhere wouldnt they look for us  where would they not look for us the contracted forms of the questions are more usual in informal english they are commonly found in tag questions for the possibility of using arent i or other dialectal alternatives in place of the uncontracted am i not see contractions representing am not above the same phenomenon sometimes occurs in the case of negative inversion not only doesnt he smoke   not only does he not smoke  notes  edit palmer 1965 p 19 see
