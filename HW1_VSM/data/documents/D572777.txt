shot filmmakingfrom wikipedia the free encyclopedianavigation search this article is about a technique used in filmmaking for other usages see shot in filmmaking and video production a shot is a series of frames that runs for an uninterrupted period of time 1 film shots are an essential aspect of a movie where angles transitions and cuts are used to further express emotion ideas and movement the term shot can refer to two different parts of the filmmaking process in production a shot is the moment that the camera starts rolling until the moment it stops in film editing a shot is the continuous footage or sequence between two edits or cuts 2contents  hide 1 etymology2 categories of shots21 by field size22 by camera placement23 by other criteria3 film editing4 duration5 see also6 references etymology  editthe term shot is derived from the early days of film production when cameras were handcranked and operated similarly to the handcranked machine guns of the time that is a cameraman would shoot film the way someone would shoot bullets from a machine gun 3categories of shots  edithow focal length affects perspective 18mm  ultra wideangle  34mm  wideangle  and 55mm  normal lens at identical field size achieved by different camerasubject distances notice that the shorter the focal length and the wider the angle of view the more perspective distortion and size differences change shots can be categorized in a number of ways 2by field size  editthe field size explains how much of the subject and its surrounding area is visible within the cameras field of view and is determined by two factors the distance of the subject from the camera camerasubject distance and the focal length of the lens note that the shorter a lenss focal length the wider its angle of view the angle in wideangle lens for instance which is how much you see so the same idea can also be expressed as that the lenss angle of view plus camerasubject distance is the cameras field of view caution in this context the focal length value differs with each film gauge and ccd size for optical reasons but the angle of view is the same for any of them so its easier comparing the angle of view with lenses for different formats than their focal lengths the same angle of view always gives the same field size at the same camerasubject distance no matter what format youre using but the same focal length does not for indepth information behind the laws of optics regarding the influence that focal length and different formats have on field sizes see 35 mm equivalent focal length crop factor image sensor format and digital photography sensor size and angle of view the same field size can be achieved at varied camerasubject distances by using a lens with a compensating focal length and at varied focal lengths by choosing a compensating camerasubject distance field size differs from framing in that within professional environments where prime lenses are dominant the latter applies only to camera placement including camera angle not focal length however maintaining an identical field size at varying camerasubject distances and focal lengths must be handled with caution as it applies different amounts of perspective distortion to the image wideangle lenses expand a perspective while long focus lenses compress a perspective the famous dolly zoom taken with a variable focal length lens is a vivid intuitive demonstration of this effect thus its more common in photography and cinematography to determine an images field size by only changing two out of the two factors the field size along with the specific amount of perspective distortion greatly affects the narrative power of a shot there are a number of standardized field sizes the names of which are commonly derived from varying camerasubject distances while not changing the lens the four basic kinds of field sizes marked with an asterisk in the gallery below are 2the long shot often used as an establishing shot the full shotthe medium shotthe closeup three less often used field sizes see gallery below arethe extreme long shot used for epic views and panoramasthe american shot also 34 shot a slight variation of the medium shot to also include owb handgun holsters in western movies a characterization from french film criticism for a type of shot in certain american films of the 1930s and 1940s also referred to as a cowboy shot in reference to the gun holster being just above the bottom frame linethe  italian shot  or extreme close up ecu or xcu where only a persons eyes are visible named after the genre of italowesterns particularly the dollars trilogy by sergio leone that established this particular field size there are other variants such as the medium close up between medium and close up and terms for moving in such as leanin and moving out such as leanout field size shots comparison   basic shotsextreme long shotlong shotfull shot figure shot complete view medium long

common in point of view and over the shoulder in the latter care must be applied to avoid a continuity error by violating the 180 degree rule the two shot where two people are in the picture by other criteria  editthe establishing shot is defined by giving an establishing broad overview over a scene whether performed by a wide shot with a fixed camera a zoom a series of different closeups achieved by camera motion or a sequence of independent closeangle shots edited right after each other 2the master shot is a scene done in one single take with no editingthe freeze frame shot is created in editing by displaying a single frame for an elongated duration of timethe insert shot is created in editing by replacing a picture with another while the audio stays the same common in interviews to illustrate topics mentionedthe trolley shot a shot in which the camera moves toward or away from its subject while filming traditionally dolly shots are filmed from a camera dolly but the same motion may also be performed with a steadicam gimbal etc a dolly shot is generally described in terms of dollying in or dollying out trucking in and out is also a common synonym film editing  edita film editor at work in 1946 main article film editing cutting between shots taken at different times or from different perspectives is known as film editing and is one of the central arts of filmmaking 5duration  editsee also long take the length of shots is an important consideration that can greatly affect a film the purpose of editing any given scene is to create a representation of the way the scene might be perceived by the story teller shots with a longer duration can make a scene seem more relaxed and slower paced whereas shots with a shorter duration can make a scene seem urgent and faster paced the average shot length asl of a film is one of its cinemetrical measures for example the mist has a length of 117 minutes and consists of 1292 shots so the asl is 54 seconds while russian ark is a single 96minute long take so an asl of 96 minutes or about 5760 seconds a factor of 1000 difference shots with extremely long durations are difficult to do because any error in the shot would force the filmmaker to restart from scratch and are thus only occasionally used films famous for their long cuts include francis ford coppola s the godfather in which the entire first scene is a long take featuring bonasera describing the assault on his daughter and alfred hitchcock s rope which only cuts at the end of each reel and does so surreptitiously so that it seems as if the whole film is one take orson welles s touch of evil opens with a long tracking crane shot as does robert altman s the player in addition to russian ark which was made in 2002 using digital recording technology other films known for their extremely long takes include stanley kubrick s 2001 a space odyssey and the works of andrei tarkovsky starting with solaris b√©la tarr is also known for using very long takes consistently in his films joss whedons feature film serenity introduces the main characters with a long take see also  editwikimedia commons has media related to camera shot types
