the pipes the pipes are calling   by patricia doherty hinnebusch when everyone is irish by the first week in march supermarkets restaurants and taverns and bars that serve food are wellstocked with corned beef and cabbage for st patricks day celebrations bagpipers and tin whistlers and flutists are practicing one song above all and the habitues of elegant lounges rustic taverns and neighborhood beer joints hear strains of that song loved around the world danny boy almost everyone whose mother said heshe could carry a tune will sing along those who cant or wont sing will propose an interpretation of the lyrics and an explanation of the circumstances that evoked them the musicologically literate will debate the origin of this air now so closely associated with erin again each march the pipes the pipes are calling  the origins of the most beloved ballad to clear the air in countless alefilled rooms i suggest we gently expose a few oftrepeated misconceptions about this beloved ballad and the circumstances surrounding its composition some readers may cringe at having their meaning dismythed er  that is dismissed others will read this explication but not remember it for it is a truism about us that we ear what we want to ear  and let the rest go out the other   i encourage anyone who hae me doubts about the following facts to engage his favorite search engine for an evening of further research while quaffing hisher favorite beverage try wwwstandingstonescom danny3html finding the music ill phrase it as succinctly as an irishwoman can danny boy was not written by an irishman in fact frederick edward weatherly never saw the forty shades of green in england in 1910 he had written these words for an unsuccessful song called danny boy in 1912 he heard the music known today as the londonderry air or derry air please please no tittering these are painful disclosures for some of you the lyrical lawyer poet entertainer and author of childrens books knew instantly that his words and this music belonged together the new improved danny boy was published in 1913 and became an immediate success a song of rebels and now for more demystification many believe the lyrics were intended to honor the courage of rebellious irishmen or comfort their progeny in 1926 weatherly said that danny boy was being sung all over the world  by sinn feiners and ulstermen by englishmen and australians and americans fred said it will be seen that there is nothing of the rebel in it and no note of bloodshed he acknowledged he had written some rebel songs but insisted danny boy was not one of them and nota bene the official ballad has only two verses a modern connection aha some of you exclaim but the british barrister did indeed have a son named danny a son who joined the raf and was killed during world war i i urge you to calmly recall the dates of that war frederick was a poet not a prophet and one more delicate detail weatherly wrote the song to be sung by a woman indeed a footnote to sheet music circulated in 1913 suggested the substitution of the words eily dear when the singer was a man which pipes are calling now then about the pipes one may question whether weatherly alluded to the highland pipes or the ullean irish pipes or one of the 28 other kinds of bagpipes and there is quite a commotion over whether the londonderry air is a distorted version of an earlier air claimed by the scots and the song for which mr weatherly  18481929 was more famous during his lifetime was roses of picardy rather than danny boy but it is danny boy that well be hearin for the wearin of the green so its time to pipe down and just enjoy the words and melody of one of the worlds bestloved songsÂ© 2005 patricia doherty hinnebusch
