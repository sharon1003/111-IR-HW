bovatec® rumensin® ingestion jan swan wood january 28 2013share tweet comments  0equids are very sensitive to bovatec and rumensin and it is critically important to avoid feeding them anything with those products in it ingesting t prev 1 of 2 images next nearly every ranch or farm operation has multiple types of feed around the place there will be sacks with feed in it for the horses some for the light calves some for a steer thats being fed out something different for the chickens and some range cubes for the cattle and sheep most of these products are harmless if fed to a different animal than intended but a few can be deadly if fed to the wrong species a type of supplement that is used in certain feeds is called an ionophore better known by the names bovatec® and rumensin® ionophores are used to improve feed efficiency in beef cattle and to aid in the prevention of some diseases its found in premixed feeds blocks and in bags for adding to rations bovatec® with the scientific name of lasalocid is most often used for cattle in pasture or forage situations and can also be fed to sheep rumensin® or monensin is used in feedlots to help prevent acidosis and to control feed intake on highgrain diets while increasing gains in beef cattle it also helps to prevent coccidiosis in cattle rumensin® monensin is used in chicken feed also rumensin however can be toxic to sheep the two products though beneficial for the animals they are meant for can be very dangerous for horses ionophores are a class of drugs that are particularly toxic to horses and it doesnt take very much to do the damage rumensin is ten times more toxic than bovatec and less than one half a gram can be fatal to a horse they can also be deadly to dogs kadoka sd veterinarian dr bill headlee dvm says we had a client have nine head of horses get into about a 25 lb bag that was in the back of the pickup they had scattered it around and eaten some of it three of the nine died and it took the others a long time to get over it recommended stories for you when horses ingest an ionophore they will demonstrate some or all of the following symptoms muscular weakness coliclike symptoms trouble breathing lack of appetite diarrhea stiffness lethargy a blue tinge to gums and membranes cyanosis pulmonary edema degeneration of the heart muscle and kidney damage dr headlee says the horses that we treated were sweating and at first appeared to be having tyingup syndrome with the stiff muscles and unwillingness to move they also went into convulsions when a horse survives ionophore poisoning they can have long term damage including heart damage which could result in sudden death during exertion weeks or months later one horse we treated had muscle weakness and unthriftiness for several years afterward we attributed that to kidney heart and muscle damage says dr headlee not much can be done for a horse that has ingested an ionophore as there isnt an antidote dr headlee says that one might give the horse mineral oil or activated charcoal to move it through the system faster in hopes of preventing some of the damage horses are known for being nosey and getting into feed they shouldnt as the nine did that dr headlee treated but it can problems can also occur through crosscontamination of feed feed mills are generally very careful to clean out the mixing area before making a different kind of feed but even with great care a small amount of rumensin or bovatec could still get mixed with a batch of horse feed if that happened and it was the deadlier rumensin it could be enough to kill horses that ate the next batch of feed another problem involves the feeding of cattle or sheep feed to horses thinking that if its good for one it will be good for the other if a person is going to feed that way it is critical that they not only read the label carefully but that they talk to the nutritionist that is involved with the feed if there is any question it would be good to also have a veterinarian knowledgeable in equines look the label over too the safest thing that a horse owner can do is to use feed specifically produced for horses in a mill that only produces horse feeds in leiu of that read labels carefully and check with a veterinarian to be certain if a farm or ranch is going to have products on hand with rumensin or bovatec in them it would be prudent to keep them separate from any other feed and locked up so that horses cant possibly get into it dont ever put horses in an area where other livestock has been fed anything with an ionophore in it as horses tend to keep looking for one more nibble of feed after cattle or sheep have quit eating the ionophores bovatec and rumensin are good supplements when used properly for the species they are intended for but if there are horses and other susceptible species around there is a responsibility to manage the products so they can do no harm share tweet
