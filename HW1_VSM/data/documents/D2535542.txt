politics  government military navy aschool my husband graduated boot camp dec 7th and now is heading into aschool does anyone know how leave time works like when he can come off base or stay over night how long things like that im trying to debate if i should move up there while he is in school or not its only for 10 weeks and then he will get his show more follow 7 answers answers relevance rating newest oldest best answer dont move up there if its only 10 weeks tough it out you will move shortly after finishing aschool my hubby is navy so he went straight from bootcamp to aschool after two weeks they are granted leave until for a few hours not overnight overnight leave comes a few weeks after that i would make the 3 hour drive every weekend so me and our little girl could see him whether it was for a few hours or overnight if you dont live close enough to drive youll be able to talk to him but really i would not move its so temporary its probably not worth the effort but to be honest i wanted to move as close as possible to my hubby too  some of the other comments say that he may not be able to leave overnight not the situation with my experience i took about 3 or 4 weeks and when he could stay out overnight we would stay together as a family at the navy lodgenavywife · 1 decade ago2 0 comment askers rating when i was in a school we didnt get leave until christmas standown when you get to your a school most of the time you have to go through phase where you cant leave the base and cant wear civilian clothes etc when i went it was 3 weeks ive heard from friends that it varies by school i definitely wouldnt move anywhere for less than 2 months there is a possibility though that when he gets to school he might have to wait for a class to start while youre doing that you basically do things like clean the grounds and go to gmts and things like that denise s · 1 decade ago0 1 comment he will only get leave for christmas if his a school authorizes it it all depends on the need for his rating out in the fleet he may or may not get leave at all they will tell him all about what he is authorized to do when he gets to a school if he was smart he would stay on base even if he is authorized holiday leave because if his school is only 10 weeks long he could use what little leave he has when he pcss to his first real command he will only have about 12 days on the books and if he uses it for christmas leave he will have to report straight to his next command from experience you would rather have the time to pcs and celebrate christmas together a little late than taken the christmas leave he wont be alone on base lots of people stay back because they dont have the leave days on the books yet you never want to go into the negative with leave because it will keep you from going on leave if an emergency comes up or something you are not authorized to move with him while he is in school sure you could go but what a total waste of money you probably do not have thosands of extra dollars going towards a hotel room is just a real waste of money it does suck but let him finish his school he will never be able to see you anyway between school duty pt extra study your husband is doing his job let him do it he will not be able to stay overnight with you or live with you anyway so your idea is really not practical once he gets his first set of orders you can get ready to move with him then and only then just be patient and dont blow money he doesnt have money is going to be very tight for the first year so be practical and listen to those of us you have been there already navy sailor  gai · 1 decade ago3 2 comment i have been through navy a school it is not nearly as bad as boot camp he will be expected to show up for his classes probably in uniform and the rest of the time is his minus studying i was not even required to stand watch on weekends however it was many years ago and things have changed most likely the changes were that he has even more freedom than when i was in other than distracting him from his studies i recommend you go with him if you can either leave him alone for a few hours to study or even read his material and help him study then i would say you would be more than welcome to be with him it is more like school and less like boot camployal · 1 decade ago2 2 commentdont bother for just ten weeks he will not be allowed to live off base and in fact may not ever get permission to stay overnight minimum 30 days before he can leave base period in or out of uniform he will be required to be back on base by curfew every night even weekends not to mention the navy will not pay for you to move there and all expenses incurred will be out of pocket mrsjvb · 1 decade ago1 1 comment if you move up there it will be on your own dime you will also have to find your own lodging and the bah rate will be based on where you are supposed to be so you can end up paying a lot more than you think out of pocket you may get to see him you may not it is going to depend on what he is doing what the restrictions are etc they can also change from day to day then afterwards when he is finished and has his orders the government will only pay for your things to be moved from where they are supposed to be so you will have to go back to arrange the move and again the trip back will be on your own dime nwip · 1 decade ago2 0 comment dont bother moving with him youre really going to have to get used to him being gone for much longer periods of time than that this is good practice source s navy
