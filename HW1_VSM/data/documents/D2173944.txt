melissa mc carthy singer adele and model ashley graham glamour labels amy schumer plus size without telling her she calls it not glamorous httpstco7uk z76knc m pictwittercomis t5e fncf f— jezebel jezebel april 5 2016i think theres nothing wrong with being plus size beautiful healthy women schumer wrote in the caption plus size is considered size 16 in america i go between a size 6 and an 8 the actress went on to explain that glamour had put me in their plus size only issue without asking or letting me know and it doesnt feel right to me young girls seeing my body type thinking that is plus size she wrote what are your thoughts mine are not cool glamour not glamourous glamour said in a statement first off we love amy and our readers do too  which is why we featured her on the cover of glamour last year the cover line on this special edition  which is aimed at women size 12 and up  simply says women who inspire us since we believe her passionate and vocal message of body positivity is inspiring as is the message of the many other women of all sizes featured the statement said the edition did not describe her as plussize we are sorry if we offended her in any way bottom line

confusion at seeing schumers name on the cover of the plussize edition in a story headlined sorry but amy schumer is definitely not plussize now glamour doesnt directly attribute the word plussize to amy schumer on the cover and its yet to be seen how the mag describes her inside but placing her name on an allplussize issue does associate her with the term and many people will pick up the copy of the magazine with the expectation of opening it up to spreads of only plussize women degrazia wrote its not the first time schumer has been termed as such in february 2015 jeffrey wells of hollywood elsewhere wrote that with trainwreck director judd apatow is once again introducing a chubbycheeked whipsmart not conventionally attractive neurotically bothered female comic to a mass audience  first
