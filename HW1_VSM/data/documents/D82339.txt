laughter is the shortest distancesusie austin laughter is the shortest distancebetween two people victor borge laughter is the shortest distance between two people as it connects us and helps keep things in perspective it can lighten any situation can reduce stress and tension and allows us to be human i used to have a tshirt that said sense of humor necessarywe talk at great lengths about goals dreams tasks and all the things we need and wish to accomplish but my suggestion for you today is schedule humor in your life do you always pass on the funny emails because you don’t have time to read them just about everyone has someone who is always sending some silly jokes to be honest i usually deleted them because i just don’t have time to read them how about spending ten minuets a day dedicated to humor if you hear a funny joke write it down if you’re anything like me you will forget it within a short period of time look for the humor in the day and make it a point to laugh often be careful you do not laugh at someone or at others expense as this can be hurtful i am sure we have experienced that at some point in our lives remember we are all imperfect and being able to laugh with others allows us to not take life so seriously at times another point to keep in mind don’t allow humor to mask issues or problems in your life it is possible to use humor to discuss and open up in ways you might not have been able to without using humor humor is one word with a lot of meaning for today remember to laugh well and often for no other reason other than it makes you feel goodvictor borge was an accomplished pianist who incorporated humor as his trademark he was known as the clown prince of denmark and the great dane he also said this “ occasionally a finger comes up to wipe a tear of laughter from the eye… and that’s my reward… the rest goes to the government”susie austin advertisements share this share like this like be the first to like this related a season of kindnesssusie austin in kindnesslesson on laughter susie austin in laughterpositive mental attitude pma in inspiration by coachsusie on november 24 2007 posted in humor laughter tags compsssion dreaming growth humor inspiration laughter love motivation passion personal success
