brooks kraft a woman should run for president against hillary clinton or many women by rebecca traister june 26 2014i spent a lot of 2008 feeling crushed it was exhilarating covering hillary clinton’s historic run for the presidency but there was so much about the race that was backward and retro more 1958 than 2008 it wasn’t just the media’s goggleeyed questions about whether the country was “ready” for a female president or the inane things that spilled out of people’s mouths on cable television—though let’s remember that christopher hitchens called clinton “soppy and bitchy” mike barnicle compared her to “everyone’s first wife standing outside a probate court” and keith olbermann suggested that the democratic party needed “somebody who can take her into a room and only he comes out” all of that was grim but it was symptomatic of a far bigger problem that in the first decade of the twentyfirst century the nation still had difficulty imagining a female president as anything other than an exception a somewhat threatening anomaly should she run as she almost certainly will people will be idiots about clinton this election too they’ll call her a bitch and express their distaste for her through fantasies of misogynistic violence but when i consider the distance we have traveled since 2008 i find myself strangely hopeful about what’s ahead the degree to which our cultural attitudes about women in politics have matured is astonishing win mc nameegetty images elizabeth warren most print and online political publications now employ writers who cover politics and media from an explicitly feminist perspective cable news features far more women as both anchors and pundits as well as more men who are as likely to engage in spirited gendered critiques as they are to unspool freakydeaky gendered nightmares and all over social media there dwell armies of unpaid but widely read commentators ready to launch hashtag campaigns and circulate changeorg petitions in response to the slightest of identitypolitics missteps but we haven’t come far enough instead we’re in a tricky potentially explosive stage bursting with ideas about how to normalize the concept of women in power but still constrained by a system that politically economically and culturally remains dominated by white men we are tweens caught between an awareness of the injustices of our past yet not grown up enough to seize control and right them so how do we catapult out of this cusp period having a woman in the white house would certainly help but in advance of that and perhaps just as crucially other women in the democratic party need to do what they’ve so far shown no stomach for they need to challenge hillary clinton for the nomination for the very first time there are four democratic women who could plausibly run for president four women whose names get mentioned on short lists and in wishfulthinking conversations among party faithful of course only one is ready for the job today nobody of any gender has more experience name recognition fundraising capabilities or realworld preparation for what awaits in partisanriven washington than hillary clinton but the other three aren’t laughable candidates massachusetts senator elizabeth warren is the troubadour of the populist left and the one challenger team clinton legitimately fears kirsten gillibrand who sits in clinton’s old senate seat has built a reputation as a savvy strategist by moving from center to left and makes no secret of her presidential ambitions there’s also amy klobuchar the twoterm minnesota senator who’s popular in her state and in her party and who has already made a couple of exploratory trips to iowa the imperfections of these potential contenders—inexperience lefty politics lack of name recognition—certainly hurt their chances it’s also worth pointing out that presidential campaigns cost time and money they’re not to be entered lightly but think about all of the men who have run for high office before they were “ready” in the way clinton is steve forbes gary bauer mike gravel and herman cain all stared in the mirror and decided they looked presidential far more analogous here are the underseasoned but serious politicians who run all the time lots of them—from jerry brown to john edwards to rick santorum—don’t make it the distance but they make an impact on their party and sometimes unlikely candidates can get pretty far—as far as a young bill clinton in 1992 or barack obama in 2008 interestingly the issue right now isn’t that the party establishment is disqualifying women other than clinton from running for president it’s that the women are disqualifying themselves seemingly on behalf of clinton mandel nganafpgetty images amy klobuchar warren gillibrand and klobuchar reportedly signed a letter to clinton—along with every other democratic woman in the senate—urging her to run and pledging their support if she did in june klobuchar attached her name to a fundraising invitation for the group minnesotans ready for hillary and in a recent interview coinciding with the release of her book off the sidelines which she described as “a call to action asking women to participate in politics” gillibrand said that she’ll consider running for president “someday i’m sure but not any time in the near future” instead she predicted that “hillary clinton will be our first woman president” according to some close to gillibrand she is plotting a long game for 2024 but if clinton weren’t to run in 2016 she almost certainly would so if she can do it why not do it partly out of fear of that storied clinton political machine sure but also as a sign of the esteem for clinton that democratic women seem determined to put on display on some level that’s terrific good for them clinton has not always enjoyed the support of the women in her party and given some of the challenges she faced in her last goround it’s refreshing to see her poised to enter a race backed by a bunch of smart tough broads except that this is a presidential election not a trust fall and the sisterly deference being shown to clinton by her colleagues—while intended as a sign of respect—is doing far more harm than good the last thing any woman in politics needs is the appearance of having won only because her wouldbe opponents gave her a pass this perhaps goes double for clinton whose years in the spotlight have demonstrated again and again that she is at her most appealing when she is fighting and scrappy and at her most loathed when she is selfassuredly coasting clinton and her party require arresting attentiondrawing competition she needs to be duking it out and not just with a bunch of white guys how many people are salivating at the thought of a martin o’malley candidacy 19 20 a predictable primary is a boring primary and a boring primary leads to a disinterested democratic party—a major hindrance going into a general election part of what hooked voters in the mesmerizing 2008 race was the thrum of newness the frisson of historymaking every time a woman and a black man stood on a debate stage together and while we could reproduce that thrill in a variety of ways—there is after all a shameful abundance of racial ethnic religious and gendered history to be made before presidential politics become remotely inclusive—one of the most realistic readytoroll scenarios of 2016 is the one in which multiple women show up to debate each other but there’s more at stake here than the health of the party in one presidential election viewing women as adversaries—ideologically and also within their own parties—is an urgent next step in helping the nation adjust to the idea that female politicians are just like you know regular politicians that means we have to swiftly abandon the processional model in which one diligent woman takes her hardearned turn while the next waits patiently in the wings associated press kirsten gillibrand ambitious men don’t behave that way they realize that in politics very few legal acts get you the attention that running for president does primaries can bolster fundraising capabilities and help politicians gain more influence within their party sometimes setting them up for vicepresidential and cabinet slots driven candidates also run for president in years when they don’t have much of a shot in order to become better known to voters and position themselves for the next round ronald reagan ran for and lost the republican nomination in both 1968 and 1976 before winning in 1980 al gore lost his 1988 bid for the democratic nomination before being elected vice president in 1992 and then winninglosing the general in 2000 besides if more women don’t run this cycle next time could be a long way off should clinton remain the only democratic woman on the ballot and win the nomination and the presidency that’s good for her and perhaps good for the country it’s not necessarily good however for the other female prospects in her party who would have a decade sucked from their presidential timelines there are surely other ways for these women to build their profiles and it’s true that clinton has a strong record of hiring and promoting women which would help lots of future leaders but it’s clearly not the same by getting over their impulse to defer to clinton and instead show her the real presidential respect of taking her on warren gillibrand and klobuchar would dramatically improve the tenor and content of political discourse on the left because here’s another benefit of women challenging each other in presidential and other races it alleviates the pressure of onlyness when a single avatar stands in for womankind womankind projects onto that avatar its own varied ideas and priorities and standards clinton suffered from this last time metaphysically unable to satisfy a million divergent hopes she couldn’t be progressive enough authentic enough strong enough stoic enough or welldressed enough for everyone that’s part of why it’s dangerous for one woman to mean so much to so many being the woman candidate also means donning a straitjacket when it comes to policy issues that make a direct impact on women just as obama has been limited in his ability to directly address racial injustices out of fear of being tagged the race guy a lone clinton would find herself hamstrung in debates over reproductive rights and social policy on her book tour she has already sounded too hesitant in talking about paid family leave a wildly important issue she should be all over having claimed credit for pushing the family and medical leave act during her husband’s administration but now hanging out there all alone in her ladyness clinton is behaving like someone who is not unreasonably worried about being feminized but what if there were other women out there to shoulder some of that weight and contextualize these crucial conversations whether or not warren gillibrand or klobuchar could topple clinton they could make sure that certain issues got talked about john edwards before melting into the oil slick of his own loathsomeness performed a real service nudging democrats in a direction they badly needed to go on poverty and the class divide in advance of the occupy movement doddfrank and warren’s rabblerousing no less and he did most of that work as a candidate who in neither his 2004 nor his 2008 bids ever had a strong shot of winning the nomination this time around the democratic party would become a stronger party if it got to listen to clinton argue paid sick days reproductive rights day care and equalpay protections with a few other women who know how serious and farreaching these policy questions are democrats would also be able to hear those arguments more clearly since they wouldn’t be filtered through the inevitable scrim of either oversolicitousness or condescension that comes when a bunch of guys take clinton on remember “you’re likeable enough hillary” remember edwards telling her he didn’t like her jacket yeah that was earsplitting we don’t need two years of that and if democrats had more women around there’d be less of it relatedly getting a bunch of women into the race would help us power through this irritating stage in which the media obsesses over likeability and pantsuits cankles and hair and heels and speculation over whether a candidate’s electoral support derives from some moony ovarian affiliation that’s all clutter and it lingers as the surest sign that female leadership remains exotic and weird i’m obviously aware that a primary with multiple women would make certain parts of the process worse before they got better this cycle we’d be presented with a whole new fetishized motif for presidential elections—the catfight but this too is a developmental hurdle we must clear if withstanding a season of hairpulling jokes and “meeeow”ing new york post headlines helps us get used to it and move forward then by all means let’s do it now when the possibility is in front of us instead of simply postponing it for next time ambitious promising young politicians including tulsi gabbard nina turner grace meng kamala harris kathleen kane and stacey abrams will be so much better off as a result let me be clear very little of the blame for the tentativeness of other female pols should be laid at the feet of clinton who at the moment is the only woman—and the only democrat—behaving like a future president that she lugs around such a huge symbolic burden is the structural reality in a nation that has historically and uniformly excluded women from executive power clinton is a trailblazer capable tough and strong she damn well should take advantage of her position of power entering the election but her individual fate shouldn’t have to carry so much overwrought meaning which is why i’m pleading with the talented and wellpositioned women of the democratic party run run right now run for yourselves run because the country the party and hillary need you to just run already read more election 2016 politics hillary clinton democratic primary elizabeth warren gender
