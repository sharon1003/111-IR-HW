links these are the best publicly available offers that we have found for each card please check out our advertiser policy for further details about the partners we work with thanks for your supportlast week i wrote a post entitled “best uses of chase ultimate rewards points” where — as the title suggests — i shared what i considered to be the best uses of chase ultimate rewards points in light of the united devaluation i followed that up with a post entitled “changing credit card strategy due to united devaluation” where — as the title suggests — i analyzed whether in practice the value of chase’s cards that accrues ultimate rewards points changes one of my main points in the post about the best uses of chase ultimate rewards points was that hyatt’s top hotels are still 22000 points per night so the points currency was still extremely valuable now that hyatt has deva l ued their chart has that changed to recap here are the major devaluations we’re seeing to the value of ultimate rewards points over the coming months united mileage plus announced a huge devaluation to their program for bookings made on or after february 1 2014 in particular for travel in premium cabins on partner airlines hyatt gold passport announced a devaluation for bookings made on or after january 7 2014 which especially impacts their top tier properties southwest rapid rewards which has a revenue based redemption program announced a devaluation to how many points it requires per dollar to book a “wanna get away” fare each point is now decreasing in value from 167 cents to 143 cents for bookings made on or after march 31 2014in march i valued ultimate rewards points at 18 cents each last week i valued ultimate rewards points at 16 cents each so what do i value them at now in light of the hyatt devaluation i probably now value chase ultimate rewards points at 15 cents each when i valued ultimate rewards points last week i made one major error i valued them the same i did their most valuable transfer partner and didn’t assign them a premium several of you called me out on that and you’re absolutely right chase rewards points should have a higher value because of their flexibility even if the value of the individual transfer partners is now lower there is a tangible benefit to being able to choose where your points are directed so the value of ultimate rewards must necessarily be higher than that of their best partner what do i value the individual points currencies of chase ultimate rewards’ transfer partners at after their individual devaluations off the top of my head i’d say i value hyatt gold passport points at 14 cents each there are still many great category six properties for 25000 points per night like the park hyatt maldivesi value united mileage plus miles at 14 cents each i’d be hard pressed to value them lower since redemption rates for travel on united didn’t go up by that muchi value korean air sky pass miles at 14 cents each while they can be a pain to book through and have some ridiculous rules 160000 miles for roundtrip first class to asia is tough to beat given how much award space they release and that their fuel surcharges are mildsouthwest rapid rewards points will be redeemable for 143 cents each towards the cost of a ticket so i think 15 cents per ultimate rewards point is a fair valuation assigning them a slight premium over the valuation of any individual points currency even with the lower valuation my advice for accruing points through credit card spend hasn’t actually changed to reiterate what i said in my post about if you should change your credit card strategy the barclaycard arrival world mastercard  starwood preferred guest® credit card from american express and starwood preferred guest® business credit card from american express remain the best cards for everyday spend if you’re spending money in a category that isn’t otherwise eligible for bonus points just as before the above cards remain your best options the barclaycard arrival essentially earns you the equivalent of 21 cashback towards travel you earn two miles per dollar each mile can be redeemed for one cent towards the cost of travel and you get a 5 refund when making redemptionsi value starpoints at 22 cents each so the spg american express cards remain a great value both cards have reasonable annual fees as well which are waived for the first year beyond that these are probably the two lowest risk points currencies out there i can’t imagine the barclaycard arrival will switch from their “one point gets you one cent” model anytime soon and similarly starwood has so many airline transfer partners that even if one were to devalue it wouldn’t drastically change the value of those points the chase sapphire preferred® card remains the best “all in one” card despite the devaluation there’s still not really any card that can compete with the chase sapphire preferred® card you earn 2x points on dining and travel and while there are other cards that offer bonus points on airfare and hotels for example this card has a much more liberal interpretation of travel as it includes parking train tickets etc the card has no foreign transaction fees so for spend in a category that otherwise doesn’t accrue bonus points the barclaycard arrival or starwood american express cards are still your better options but that has always been the case every traveler should have a card with no foreign transaction fees and the double points on dining and all travel expenses are pretty unique to the chase sapphire preferred the ink plus® business credit card ink bold® business charge card and ink cash cards offer the single most compelling category bonuses the ink cards have some of the most lucrative category bonuses out there5x points on spend at office supply stores and on cellular phone landline internet and cable tv services2x points on spend at gas stations and on hotels everyone has to crunch the numbers for themselves as to whether they do enough spend on the cards to justify the annual fee but whether the points earned are worth 16 or 18 cents doesn’t materially alter the value proposition of these cards in my opinion for big spenders the premier rewards gold card from american express can be very lucrative in terms of the ability to earn points the only american express card that can compete with the chase sapphire preferred is the premier rewards gold card which offers the following category bonuses3x points for flights booked directly with airlines2x points at us restaurants us gas stations and us supermarkets if the annual fee were 90 lower i’d say it would be great competition for the chase sapphire preferred for just about anyone for the average consumer however it’s probably not great beyond that so while these devaluations are discouraging and frustrating for the most part you’re still better off accruing a points currency than cash back unless you can tailor that to specific bonus categories as well i’m curious what do you value ultimate rewards points at after all these devaluations filed under chase credit cards
