what is a dental implant dental implants are cutting edge technology for tooth replacement with a dental implant a titanium screw is surgically placed into the jaw bone taking the place of the tooth roots after the bone has healed and bonded to the implant a second stage takes place where an abutment the upper half of the implant is mounted onto the implant itself and then a crown is seated on top of the abutment replacing the missing tooth what are the benefits of dental implants in mexico dental implants are a superior method for tooth replacement first by replacing a single tooth or multiple missing teeth with implants it is not necessary to gring down the adjacent teeth as is the case with a fixed bridge secondly when teeth are extracted you will begin to suffer bone loss at the extraction site but an implant will hold the bone and prevent the jaw bone from disolving away when a fixed bridge is used or when nothing is done to replace a missing tooth the resulting bone loss at the extraction site will eventually effect the adjacent teeth causing them to fail as well an implant stimulates the bone preventing bone loss evolve ct dental surgical  implant  prosthetic your

disadvantage of dental implants treatment is the time needed to finish treatment this is the best treatment but you will have to have patience and be willing to come to tijuana for two or three trips to get the treatment finished if time is an issue the alternative is fixed bridges or partial dentures how long does treatment take for dental implants because the bone needs to grow to and bond with the titanium implant called osseointegration implant treatment requires at least two stages if a patient is already suffering bone loss and is need of bone grafting before implantation treatment will take 3 stages in the case of bone grafting after the graft it can take 3 to 6 months before implantation once implantation is done it will take 3 months of healing time for lower jaw implants and 4 months for upper jaw implants when the implants are healed and are solidly in place we can do the final stage of placeing the abutment and crown time required for individual treatments for both bone grafting and implantation usually the dentist will just need you in the office for one visit a second visit the next day may be needed if you are having temporary teeth made the final stage can take two or three visits over 3 to 5 days depending on type of crowns and number of crowns are dental implants for everyone unfortunately not everyone is a candidate if you have too much bone loss grafting may not be feasible also there can be health issues that would hinder the healing process needed for implants such as uncontrolled diabetes also if you are a heavy smoker nicotine can cause your implants to fail during the healing process and therefore you will have to first get your smoking habit under control cutting way back to just a few cigarettes a day the doctor will advise you when you come in for evaluation what are some of the options for dental implant treatments bridges we can replace multiple teeth with implants and fixed bridges rather than each tooth with an individual implant and crown for example we can replace 3 or 4 adjacent teeth with two implants and a fixed bridge of 3 or 4 units that will save you the cost of extra implants another example would be replacing an entire arch with 8 implants and 12 crowns on fixed bridges dentures a popular treatment for those who have have dentures is to place 4 implants per arch and then make a new denture that snaps onto and is held in place by the implants this type of denture has the advantage that it does not require the roof of your mouth to be covered leaving the palet open and allowing all your taste buds to come in contact with your food also with the implants your dentures are held very solidly in place and you won’t have your dentures sliping when you talk or eat our dental implants in mexico specialist has top credentials along with a lot of experience our primary staff dentist has had specialized training in dental implant placement he is qualified and has a lot of experience in dental implant treatments and does most of the single implant procedures for larger jobs of multiple implant placements or oral surgeries we utilize implant specialists they have superior preparation and are within the top implant dentists in tijuana in many dental clinics the dentist who is placing the implants has not had more than a course on implants and has had little formal training this can manifest itself with implants not being properly placed they may be out of alignment crooked or at an improper depth that is why we won’t use a general dentist for multiple implant placements we only us a top specialist our implant specialists are so good we will guarantee the implant placements for life they many years of experience in dental implant placement and do hundreds of implants each year why we don’t do “teeth in a day” implants there are a lot of advertisements for “teeth in a day” also known as immediate load implants with this type of implants the implant is placed and the same day the abutment is put on and impressions made for the new crowns to the patient who has little patience and wants his new teeth now this sounds great however our doctors will not do this type of implant the reason is these immediate load implants will end up failing in a few years and the doctors cannot give them a lifetime guarantee the way implants work the bone needs time to bond to the titanium when pressure repeatedly put on the implant like it is when it is activated the bone cannot bond also with the immediate load implants the thread is very coarse and aggressive like the threads of a “lag bolt” compared to a fine thread when you chew on that type of implant because of because the thread is coarser it results tiny microfractures in the bone because of so many microfractures the bone cannot regenerate fast enough and bone loss results after 5 to 8 years they implants will get loose and fall out but with the type of implants we use delayed load implants the dentist can give a lifetime guarantee the only drawback is it requires 3 to 4 months of healing time before implant can be activated which will require a second trip to tijuana get a free quote call
