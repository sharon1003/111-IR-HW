developed for a prior generation of technology complementary benefits products or services that add additional value to the primary product or service that makes up a network examples howto books software addons labor congestion effects when increasing number of users lower the value of product or service most often happens when a key resource becomes increasingly scarce monopoly a market where there are many buyers but only one dominant seller the natural state of a market where network effects are present and this includes operating systems and office software is for there to be one major player they can charge customers more and may also enjoy substantial bargaining power over partners network effects when the value of a product of service increases as its number of users expands network effects are among the most powerful strategic resources that can be created by technologybased innovation many categorydominating organizations and technologies including microsoft apple nasdaq e bay facebook and visa owe their success to network effects network effects are also behind the establishment of most standards including bluray wifi and bluetooth onesided market a market that derives most of its value from a single class of users example instant messaging benefits derived by interaction among members of a single class of participant are called sameside exchange benefits twosided market network markets comprised of two distinct categories of participant both of which that are needed to deliver value for the network to work example video game console owners and developers of video games when an increase in the number of users on one side of the market console owners for example creates a rise in the other side software developers thats called a crossside exchange benefit platform products and services that allow for the development and integration of software products and other complementary goods examples windows i phone wii standards that allow users to create facebook apps staying power the longterm viability of a product or service switching costs the cost a consumer incurs when moving from one product to another it can involve the actual money spend buying a new product as well as any investments in time any data loss etc can strengthen the value of network effects as a strategic asset the higher the value of the users overall investment the more theyre likely to consider the staying power of any offering before choosing to adopt it similarly the more a user has invested in a product the less likely he or she is to leave total cost of ownership tco an economic measure of the full cost of owning a product includes direct costs such as purchase price plus indirect costs such as training support and maintenance be able to recognize products or services that are subject to network effects be able to recognize products and services that are not subject to network effects subject to network effects social networks video game consoles os online articles credit card companies microsoft apple nasdaq e bay facebook visa behind the establishment of most standards including bluray wifi and bluetooth not subject to network effects socks syrup trash bags what are the three main sources of value for network effects 1 exchange users can potentially communicate with more people 2 staying power longterm viability 3 complementary benefits products or services that add additional value to the network what factors contribute to the staying power and complimentary benefits of a product or service subject to network effects switching costs can strengthen the value of network effects as a strategic asset the higher the value of the users overall investment the more theyre likely to consider the staying power of any offering before choosing to adopt it similarly the more a user has invested in a product the less likely he or she is to leave many firms attempt to enhance their network effects by creating a platform for the development of thirdparty complementary products and services that enhance the primary offering what is the difference between onesided and twosided markets in onesided markets users gain benefits from interacting with a similar category of users think instant messaging where everyone can send and receive messages to one another sameside exchange benefits in twosided markets users gain benefits from interacting with a separate complementary class of users eg in the video game industry console owners are attracted to platforms with the most games while innovative developers are attracted to platforms that have the most users crossside exchange benefits how does competition in markets where network effects are present differ from competition in traditional markets early fierce competition caused by the positive feedback loop inherent in network effects often winnertakeall or winnertakemost exhibiting monopolistic tendencies where one firm dominates all rivals best product or service doesnt always win why is it so difficult for latemoving incompatible rivals to compete in markets where a dominant proprietary standard is present any product that is incompatible with the dominant network has to exceed the value of the technical features of the leading player plus since the newcomer likely starts without any users or thirdparty product complements the value of the incumbents exchange switching cost and complementary product benefit the incumbent must not be able to easily copy any of the newcomers valuable new innovations otherwise the dominant firm will quickly match any valuable improvements made by rivals what are some strategies for competing in markets where network effects are present both from the perspective of the incumbent and the new market entrant what are some examples of firms that have leveraged these strategies to compete effectively 1 move early firms that move early can often use that time to establish a lead in users switching costs and complementary products that can be difficult for rivals to match example in japan worldwide auction leader e bay showed up just five months after yahoo launched its japanese auction service but e bay was never able to mount a credible threat and ended up pulling out of the market 2 subsidize adoption might include a price reduction rebate or other giveaways example pay pal gave users a modest rebate as a signup incentive to encourage adoption of its new effort which successfully created momentous network effects that rivals were unable to match 3 leverage viral promotion since all products and services foster some sort of exchange its often possible to leverage a firms customers to promote the product or service example within facebook feeds help activities to spread virally by acting as a catalyst for friends to join groups and load applications that their buddies have already signed up for 4 expand by redefining the market appeal to more users example by going after a bigger redefined market including families and women nintendo was able to rack up sales that exceeded the xbox 360 even though it followed the system by twelve months 5 alliances and partnerships to promote a product or to increase a services user base example instead of each rival bank offering another incompatible network destined to trail citis lead competing banks agreed to share their atm operations through nyce and network effects eventually shifted to the rival bank alliance 6 leverage distribution channels to reach new customers example microsoft often bundles its new products into its operating systems office suite internet explorer browser and other offerings 7 seed the market with complements example adobe gives away the acrobat reader to build a market for the sale of software that creates acrobat files 8 encourage the development of complementary goods example facebook announced it would spur development for the site in part by administering the fb fund which initially pledged 10 million in startup funding to firms writing applications for its platform 9 leverage backward compatibility example was the centerpiece of apples strategy to revitalize the macintosh through its move to the intel microprocessor 10 rivals be compatible with the leading network example microsofts live maps and virtual earth 3d arrived late to the internet mapping game but it used the same keyhole and markup language used by google and so had an instant base of addon content 11 incumbents close off rival access and constantly innovate example apple has been far more aggressive than microsoft in introducing new versions of its software and windows are still unable to run mac programs 12 large wellknown followers preannouncements microsoft for example can cause potential customers to hold off on selecting a rival because users see that the firm has the resources to beat most players suggesting staying power statements from startups however often lack credibility to delay user purchases cloud computing replacing computing resourceseither an organizations or individuals hardware or softwarewith services provided over the internet fixed cost the sum of all payments made to the firms fixed factors of production lamp linux apache my sql perlpythonphp group of open source software that together run many websites including facebook and you tube marginal cost variable cost the cost of producing one more unit of a product the software business is attractive due to nearzero marginal costs and an opportunity to establish a standard—creating the competitive advantages of network effects and switching costs open source software oss software that is free and where anyone can look at and potentially modify the code scalability ability to either handle increasing workloads or to be expanded easily to handle workload increases in a software context systems that arent scalable often require significant rewrites or the purchase or development of entirely new systems server farm a massive network of computer servers running software to coordinate their collective use server farms provide the infrastructure backbone to saa s and cloud efforts as well as many largescale internet services service level agreement sla a negotiated agreement between the customer and the vendor the sla may specify levels of availability serviceability performance operation or other commitment requirements software as a service saa s a form of cloud computing where a firm subscribes to a thirdparty software and receives a service that is delivered online structured query language sql a language for creating and manipulating databases sql is by far the most common database standard in use today and is supported my many commercial and open source products recognize that the software industry is undergoing significant and broadly impactful change brought about by several increasingly adopted technologies including open source software cloud computing and softwareasaservice the new trends are creating challenges and opportunity across tech markets understanding the impact of these developments can help a manager make better technology choices and investment decisions how is open source software different from conventional offerings most can be downloaded for free over the internet source code is available for review and modification as opposed to that of conventional software firms which closely guard their intellectual properly and almost never provide the source code for their commercial software products linux flagship oss product now available on all scales of computing devices from cell phones to supercomputers open source version of unix invented by linus torvalds what are some examples of open source software linux lamp stack fire fox competes with internet explorer open office competes with microsoft officehow might firms leverage oss technology 1 low cost 2 reliability often has fewer bugs than its commercial counterparts due to the large number of persons who have looked at the code 3 security huge exposure to scrutiny by developers and other people helps to strengthen the security of oss 4 scalability can be easily migrated to more powerful computers as circumstances dictate and also can balance workload by distributing work over a number of machines 5 agility and time to market vendors who use oss as part of product offerings may be able to skip whole segments of the software development process allowing new products to reach the market faster why are forprofit companies paying people to develop open source software that they give away for free in order to keep standards unified with oss hardware firms spend less money than they would in the brutal headtohead competition where each one offered an operating system that was incompatible with rivals but offered little differentiation why do firms choose oss by lowering the cost of computing open source efforts make more computing options accessible to smaller firms more reliable secure computing also lowers costs for all users oss also diverts funds that firms would otherwise spend on fixed costs like operating systems and databases so that these funds can be spent on innovation or other more competitive initiatives many firms are trying to use oss markets to drive a wedge between competitors and their customers how do vendors of oss make money business models for firms in the open source industry are varied and can include selling services licensing oss for incorporation into commercial products and using oss to fuel hardware sales what are the disadvantages to oss complexity of some products and a higher total cost of ownership for some products concern about the ability of a products development community to provide support or product improvement legal and licensing concerns what is a typical business model for a saa s vendor most saa s firms earn money via a usagebased pricing model akin to a monthly subscription what are the benefits to vendors from deploying saa s limiting development to a single platform instead of having to create versions for different operating systems tighter feedback loop with clients helping fuel innovation and responsiveness ability to instantly deploy bug fixes and product enhancements to all users lower distribution costs accessibility to anyone with an internet connection greatly reduced risk of software piracy what are the benefits to users that accrue from using saa s lower costs by eliminating or reducing software hardware maintenance and staff expenses financial risk mitigation since startup costs are so low potentially faster deployment times compared with installed packaged software or systems developed inhouse costs that are a variable operating expense rather than a large fixed capital expense scalable systems that make it easier for firms to ramp up during periods of unexpectedly high system use higher quality and service levels through instantly available upgrades vendor scale economies and expertise gained across its entire client base remote access and availability—most saa s offerings are accessed through any web browser and often even by phone or other mobile device what are the risks associated with saa s dependence on a single vendor concern about the longterm viability of partner firms users may be forced to migrate to new versions—possibly incurring unforeseen training costs and shifts in operating procedures reliance on a network connection—which may be slower less stable and less secure data asset stored offsite—with the potential for security and legal concerns limited configuration customization and system integration options compared to packaged software or alternatives developed inhouse the user interface of webbased software is often less sophisticated and lacks the richness of most desktop alternatives ease of adoption may lead to pockets of unauthorized it being used throughout an organization what are the challenges and economics involved in shifting computer hardware to the cloud most legacy systems cant be easily migrated to the cloud meaning most efforts will be new efforts or those launched by younger firms cloud utility computing doesnt work in situations where complex legacy systems have to be ported or where there may be regulatory compliance issues some firms may still find tco and pricing economics favor buying over renting—scale sometimes suggests an organization is better off keeping efforts inhouse how can cloud computing decrease barriers to entry by lowering the cost to access powerful systems and software cloud computing makes it easier for startups to launch and smaller firms to leverage the backing of powerful technology what factors must be considered when making the make buy or rent decision add questions 1 competitive advantage 2 security 3 legal and compliance issues 4 the organizations skill expertise and available labor 5 cost 6 time 7 vendor issues what factors made microsoft so successful between 1990 and 2000 sold msdos and windows 3x as complementary products effectively doubling its os revenue per pc offered a bundle of applications at a discounted price and periodic upgrades in which customers could switch from competitors to microsoft for a significantly discounted price competitors were initially reluctant to write for windows and even slower to create their own bundles the launch of windows 2000 caused microsoft for the first time to penetrate the highend corporate server market the launch of internet explorer quickly dominated the browser market share what challenges was microsoft facing between 2000 and 2005 how to reposition microsoft for modern times security problems with internet explorer led to a rapid loss in market share in 2005 java threatened to reduce the significance of the traditional os as well as the supply of programmers for windowsbased applications as software moved to a service model microsofts challenge was to manage the complexity of the vast network interconnected computers and to find software that could deliver the new applications and services form that complex underutilized grid found guilty of multiple antitrust violations one of which forced the company to offer an unbundled version for the first time as well as reveal information about windows source code decreased employee morale along with complaints that the company had become unmanageable and too centralized led to organizational changes expensive technical support across all of its product lines emergence of linux and other open source software threatened to put downward pressure on prices and captured some of the market share efforts to become to backbone of the digital home included the xbox and media center pc competed for market share in web services digital home services the cell phone market the smallbusiness market and the internet growth in pc shipments fell drastically product quality and security issues continued open source gained momentum and emerging markets proved more difficult to penetrate how did bundling help microsofts profitability they were the first to offer a bundle of applications at a discounted price competitors slow reaction to create their own bundles contributed to microsofts success how did microsofts relationship with oems and isvs affect profitability most of windows sales went to oems which would preinstall the program on each computers hard drive consequently microsofts only variable production cost after the initial development was to ship a single master copy of the software to each oem for reproduction microsoft spent tens of millions of dollars per year for engineers to support isvs that wrote applications of oses exploited its oem relationships to secure a dominant position in the worldwide desktop os and productivity suite markets analytics a term describing the

and metadata a dbms is a licensed software program for creating processing and administering data a database application is a collection of forms reports queries and application programs that process a database what are three tactical advantages to using a database 1 preserve data integrity assurance that data is consistent correct and accessible 2 eliminate data redundancy unnecessary repetition of data that slows data processing 3 limit data view query report so that users only see what they need to see as cleanly and clearly as possible what is a primary key what is a foreign key how are keys used to connect tables in a database primary key column or group of columns that identifies a unique row in a table foreign key nonkey column or field in one table that links to a primary ket in another table relational databases store data that represent relationships using foreign keys how is the combination of increasingly standardized data access to thirdparty datasets cheap fast computing and easytouse software collectively enabling a new age of decision making by enabling datadriven and factbased decision making using business intelligence and analytics what are the various internal and external sources for enterprise data internal sources for organizations that sell directly to their customers transaction processing systems tps represent a source of potentially useful data grocers and retailers can link you to cash transactions if they can convince you to use a loyalty card which in turn requires you to give up information about yourself in exchange for some kind of financial incentive such as points or discounts enterprise software crm scm and erp is a source for customer supply chain and enterprise data survey data can be used to supplement a firms operational data external sources if your firm has partners that sell products for you then youll likely rely heavily on data collected by others data obtained from outside sources when combined with a firms internal data assets can give the firm a competitive edge who is collecting data about you data aggregators are part of a multibilliondollar industry that provides genuinely helpful data to a wide variety of organizations data that can be purchased from aggregators may not in and of itself yield sustainable competitive advantage since others may have access to this data too however when combined with a firms proprietary data or integrated with a firms proprietary procedures or other assets thirdparty data can be a key tool for enhancing organizational performance data aggregators can also be quite controversial among other things they represent a big target for identity thieves are a method for spreading potentially incorrect data and raise privacy concerns what are the privacy implications of ubiquitous data collection recent studies have shown that in many cases it is possible to pinpoint users through allegedly anonymous data and to guess social security numbers from public data new methods for tracking and gathering user information are raising privacy issues which possibly will be addressed through legislation that restricts data use what is the strategic value of having a database 1 connecting activities across the value chainwhat are the problems with transactional operational data most transactional databases arent set up to be simultaneously accessed for reporting and analysis in order to run analytics the data must first be ported to a data warehouse or data mart raw data usually unsuitable for sophisticated reporting or data mining dirtyinconsistent data values may be missing data can be too fine or too coarse has too much detail or not enough detail too much data what tools are available to turn data into information data warehouse a set of databases designed to support decision making in an organization data mart a database or databases focused on addressing the concerns of a specific problem eg increasing customer retention improving product quality or business unit eg marketing engineering how has walmart leveraged information technology to become the worlds largest retailer give some examples of how walmart has used business analytics to create competitive advantage walmart grew in large part by leveraging information systems to an extent never before seen in the retail industry technology tightly coordinates the walmart value chain while these systems also deliver a mineable data asset thats unmatched in u s retail walmart uses data mining in numerous ways from demand forecasting to predicting the number of cashiers needed at a store at a particular time to help suppliers become more efficient and as a result lower prices walmart shares data with them while walmart shares data with relevant suppliers the firm otherwise fiercely guards this valuable asset how has harrahs used it to move from an alsoran chain of casinos to become the largest gaming company based on revenue what are some of the technology innovations that harrahs is using to help it gather more data and help push service quality and marketing program success harrahs entertainment provides an example of exceptional data asset leverage
