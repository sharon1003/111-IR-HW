external links occurrence  edittitanium dioxide occurs in nature as the wellknown minerals rutile anatase and brookite and additionally as two high pressure forms a monoclinicbaddeleyite like form and an orthorhombic αpb o 2 like form both found recently at the ries crater in bavaria one of these is known as akaogiite and should be considered as an extremely rare mineral 7 8 9 it is mainly sourced from ilmenite ore this is the most widespread form of titanium dioxidebearing ore around the world rutile is the next most abundant and contains around 98 titanium dioxide in the ore the metastable anatase and brookite phases convert irreversibly to the equilibrium rutile phase upon heating above temperatures in the range 600–800 °c 1112–1472 °f 10titanium dioxide has eight modifications – in addition to rutile anatase and brookite three metastable phases can be produced synthetically  monoclinic tetragonal and orthorombic and five highpressure forms αpb o 2 like baddeleyitelike cotunnite

°cti o 2 oii cotunnite  pb cl 2 like 18orthorhombic p  40 gpa t  700 °cthe cotunnite type phase was claimed by l dubrovinsky and coauthors to be the hardest known oxide with the vickers hardness of 38 gpa and the bulk modulus of 431 gpa ie close to diamonds value of 446 gpa at atmospheric pressure 18 however later studies came to different conclusions with much lower values for both the hardness 7–20 gpa which makes it softer than common oxides like corundum al 2 o 3 and rutile ti o 2 19 and bulk modulus 300 gpa 20 21the oxides are commercially important ores of titanium the metal can also be mined from other minerals such as ilmenite or leucoxene ores or one of the purest forms rutile beach sand star sapphires and rubies get their asterism from rutile impurities present in them 22titanium dioxide b is found as a mineral in magmatic rocks and hydrothermal veins as well as weathering rims on perovskite ti o 2 also forms lamellae in other minerals 23spectral lines from titanium oxide are prominent in class m stars which are cool enough to allow molecules of this chemical to form structure of anatase together with rutile and brookite one of the three major polymorphs of ti o 2 production  editevolution of the global production of titanium dioxide according to process the production method depends on the feedstock the most common mineral source is ilmenite ilmenite is treated with sulfuric acid to extract iron ii sulfate the resulting synthetic rutile is further processed according to the specifications of the end user ie pigment grade or otherwise 24 in another method for the production of synthetic rutile from ilmenite the becher process first oxidizes the ilmenite as a means to separate the iron component rutile is the second most abundant mineral sand rutile found in primary rock cannot be extracted hence the deposits containing rutile sand can be mined crude titanium dioxide in the form of rutile or synthetic rutile is purified by conversion to titanium tetrachloride in the chloride process in this process the crude ore containing at least 70 ti o 2 is reduced with carbon oxidized with chlorine to give titanium tetrachloride ie carbothermal chlorination this titanium tetrachloride is distilled and reoxidized in an oxygen flame or plasma at 1500–2000 k to give pure titanium dioxide while also regenerating chlorine 25 aluminium chloride is often added to the process as a rutile promotor the product is mostly anatase in its absence the preferred raw material for the chloride process is natural rutile because of its high titanium dioxide content 26specialized methods  editfor specialty applications ti o 2 films are prepared by various specialized chemistries 27 solgel routes involve the hydrolysis of titanium alkoxides such as titanium ethoxide ti oet 4 2 h 2 o → ti o 2  4 et ohthis technology is suited for the preparation of films a related approach that also relies on molecular precursors involves chemical vapor deposition in this application the alkoxide is volatalized and then decomposed on contact with a hot surface ti oet 4 → ti o 2  2 et2oapplications  editthe most important application areas are paints and varnishes as well as paper and plastics which account for about 80 of the worlds titanium dioxide consumption other pigment applications such as printing inks fibers rubber cosmetic products and food account for another 8 the rest is used in other applications for instance the production of technical pure titanium glass and glass ceramics electrical ceramics catalysts electric conductors and chemical intermediates 28 it is also in most redcoloured candy pigment  edittitanium dioxide is the most widely used white pigment because of its brightness and very high refractive index in which it is surpassed only by a few other materials approximately 46 million tons of pigmentary ti o 2 are used annually worldwide and this number is expected to increase as utilization continues to rise 29 when deposited as a thin film its refractive index and colour make it an excellent reflective optical coating for dielectric mirrors and some gemstones like mystic fire topaz  ti o 2 is also an effective opacifier in powder form where it is employed as a pigment to provide whiteness and opacity to products such as paints coatings plastics papers inks foods medicines ie pills and tablets as well as most toothpastes in paint it is often referred to offhandedly as the perfect white the whitest white or other similar terms opacity is improved by optimal sizing of the titanium dioxide particles some grades of titanium based pigments as used in sparkly paints plastics finishes and pearlescent cosmetics are manmade pigments whose particles have two or more layers of various oxides – often titanium dioxide iron oxide or alumina – in order to have glittering iridescent and or pearlescent effects similar to crushed mica or guanine based products in addition to these effects a limited colour change is possible in certain formulations depending on how and at which angle the finished product is illuminated and the thickness of the oxide layer in the pigment particle one or more colours appear by reflection while the other tones appear due to interference of the transparent titanium dioxide layers 30 in some products the layer of titanium dioxide is grown in conjunction with iron oxide by calcination of titanium salts sulfates chlorates around 800 °c 31 or other industrial deposition methods such as chemical vapour deposition on substrates such as mica platelets or even silicon dioxide crystal platelets of no more than 50 µm in diameter 32 the iridescent effect in these titanium oxide particles which are only partly natural is unlike the opaque effect obtained with usual ground titanium oxide pigment obtained by mining in which case only a certain diameter of the particle is considered and the effect is due only to scattering in ceramic glazes titanium dioxide acts as an opacifier and seeds crystal formation titanium dioxide has been shown statistically to increase skimmed milks whiteness increasing skimmed milks sensory acceptance score 33titanium dioxide is used to mark the white lines of some tennis courts 34the exterior of the saturn v rocket was painted with titanium dioxide this later allowed astronomers to determine that j002e3 was the sivb stage from apollo 12 and not an asteroid sunscreen and uv blocking pigments  editin cosmetic and skin care products titanium dioxide is used as a pigment sunscreen and a thickener as a sunscreen it is notable in that combined with zinc oxide  it is considered to an effective sunscreen that is less harmful to coral reefs than sunscreens that include chemicals such as oxybenzone and octinoxate titanium dioxide is found in the majority of physical sunscreens because of its high refractive index its strong uv light absorbing capabilities and its resistance to discolouration under ultraviolet light this advantage enhances its stability and ability to protect the skin from ultraviolet light nanoscaled particle size of 30–40 nm 35 titanium dioxide particles are primarily used in sun screen lotion because they scatter visible light less than titanium dioxide pigments while still providing uv protection 29 sunscreens designed for infants or people with sensitive skin are often based on titanium dioxide andor zinc oxide as these mineral uv blockers are believed to cause less skin irritation than other uv absorbing chemicals it is used as a tattoo pigment and in styptic pencils titanium dioxide is produced in varying particle sizes oil and water dispersible and in certain grades for the cosmetic industry ti o 2 is used extensively in plastics and other applications as a white pigment or an opacifier and for its uv resistant properties where the powder disperses light – unlike organic uv absorbers – and reduces uv damage due mostly to the particles high refractive index 36 certain polymers used in the concrete 37 or those used to impregnate concrete as a reinforcement are sometimes charged with titanium white pigment for uv shielding in the construction industry but it only delays the oxidative photodegradation of the polymer in question which is said to chalk as it flakes off due to lowered impact strength and may crumble after years of exposure in direct sunlight if uv stabilizers have not been included research  editphotocatalyst  editti o 2 fibers and spirals titanium dioxide particularly in the anatase form exhibits photocatalytic activity under ultraviolet uv irradiation this photoactivity is reportedly most pronounced at the 001 planes of anatase 38 39 although the 101 planes are thermodynamically more stable and thus more prominent in most synthesised and natural anatase 40 as evident by the often observed tetragonal dipyramidal growth habit interfaces between rutile and anatase are further considered to improve photocatalytic activity by facilitating charge carrier separation and as a result biphasic titanium dioxide is often considered to possess enhanced functionality as a photocatalyst 41 it has been reported that titanium dioxide when doped with nitrogen ions or doped with metal oxide like tungsten trioxide exhibits excitation also under visible light 42 the strong oxidative potential of the positive holes oxidizes water to create hydroxyl radicals it can also oxidize oxygen or organic materials directly hence in addition to its use as a pigment titanium dioxide can be added to paints cements windows tiles or other products for its sterilizing deodorizing and antifouling properties and is used as a hydrolysis catalyst it is also used in dyesensitized solar cells which are a type of chemical solar cell also known as a graetzel cell the photocatalytic properties of titanium dioxide were discovered by akira fujishima in 1967 43 and published in 1972 44 the process on the surface of the titanium dioxide was called the hondafujishima effect  ja本多藤嶋効果  43 titanium dioxide in thin film and nanoparticle form has potential for use in energy production as a photocatalyst it can carry out hydrolysis ie break water into hydrogen and oxygen with the hydrogen collected it could be used as a fuel the efficiency of this process can be greatly improved by doping the oxide with carbon 45 further efficiency and durability has been obtained by introducing disorder to the lattice structure of the surface layer of titanium dioxide nanocrystals permitting infrared absorption 46in 1995 fujishima and his group discovered the superhydrophilicity phenomenon for titanium dioxide coated glass exposed to sun light 43 this resulted in the development of selfcleaning glass and antifogging coatings ti o 2 incorporated into outdoor building materials such as paving stones in noxer blocks 47 or paints can substantially reduce concentrations of airborne pollutants such as volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides 48a photocatalytic cement that uses titanium dioxide as a primary component produced by italcementi group was included in time s top 50 inventions of 2008 49attempts have been made to photocatalytically mineralize pollutants to convert into co 2 and h 2 o in waste water 50 ti o 2 offers great potential as an industrial technology for detoxification or remediation of wastewater due to several factors 51the process uses natural oxygen and sunlight and thus occurs under ambient conditions it is wavelength selective and is accelerated by uv light the photocatalyst is inexpensive readily available nontoxic chemically and mechanically stable and has a high turnover the formation of photocyclized intermediate products unlike direct photolysis techniques is avoided oxidation of the substrates to co 2 is complete ti o 2 can be supported as thin films on suitable reactor substrates which can be readily separated from treated water 52the photocatalytic destruction of organic matter is also exploited in photocatalytic antimicrobial coatings 53 which are typically thin films applied to furniture in hospitals and other surfaces susceptible to be contaminated with bacteria fungi and viruses hydroxyl radical formation  editalthough ti o₂ pigment does not absorb visible light it does strongly absorb ultraviolet uv radiation  hv  leading to the formation of hydroxyl radicals 54 this occurs when photoinduced valence bond holes h  vb are trapped at the surface of ti o₂ leading to the formation of trapped holes h  tr that cannot oxidize water 55ti o₂  hv → e⁻  h  vbh  vb →h  tr o₂  e⁻ → o₂•⁻o₂•⁻ o₂•⁻ 2h⁺→ h₂o₂  o₂o₂•⁻h  vb → o₂o₂•⁻h  tr → o₂oh⁻ h  vb →ho•e⁻ h  tr → recombination note wavelength λ  387 nm 55this reaction has been found to mineralize and decompose undesirable compounds in the environment specifically the air and in wastewater 55synthetic single crystals of ti o 2 ca 2–3 mm in size cut from a larger plate nanotubes  edittitanium oxide

57sem top and tem bottom images of chiral ti o 2 nanofibers 57health and safety  edittitanium dioxide is incompatible with strong reducing agents and strong acids 58 violent or incandescent reactions occur with molten metals that are very electropositive eg aluminium calcium magnesium potassium sodium zinc and lithium 59titanium dioxide accounts for 70 of the total production volume of pigments worldwide 60 it is widely used to provide whiteness and opacity to products such as paints plastics papers inks foods and toothpastes used in food applications it whitens skim milk and adds flavors to soups beer and nuts 61 it is also used in cosmetic and skin care products and it is present in almost every sunblock where it helps protect the skin from ultraviolet light 62many sunscreens use nanoparticle titanium dioxide along with nanoparticle zinc oxide which despite reports of potential health risks 63 is not actually absorbed through the skin 64 other effects of titanium dioxide nanoparticles on human health are not well understood 65 nevertheless allergy to topical application has been confirmed 66titanium dioxide dust when inhaled has been classified by the international agency for research on cancer iarc as an iarc group 2b carcinogen meaning it is possibly carcinogenic to humans 67 the findings of the iarc are based on the discovery that high concentrations of pigmentgrade powdered and ultrafine titanium dioxide dust caused respiratory tract cancer in rats exposed by inhalation and intratracheal instillation 68 the series of biological events or steps that produce the rat lung cancers eg particle deposition impaired lung clearance cell injury fibrosis mutations and ultimately cancer have also been seen in people working in dusty environments therefore the observations of cancer in animals were considered by iarc as relevant to people doing jobs with exposures to titanium dioxide dust for example titanium dioxide production workers may be exposed to high dust concentrations during packing milling site cleaning and maintenance if there are insufficient dust control measures in place however the human studies conducted so far do not suggest an association between occupational exposure to titanium dioxide and an increased risk for cancer the safety of the use of nanoparticle sized titanium dioxide which can penetrate the body and reach internal organs has been criticized 69 studies have also found that titanium dioxide nanoparticles cause inflammatory response and genetic damage in mice 70 71 the mechanism by which ti o 2 may cause cancer is unclear molecular research suggests that cell cytotoxicity due to ti o 2 results from the interaction between ti o 2 nanoparticles and the lysosomal compartment independently of the known apoptotic signalling pathways 72the body of research regarding the carcinogenicity of different particle sizes of titanium dioxide has led the us national institute for occupational safety and health to recommend two separate exposure limits niosh recommends that fine ti o 2 particles be set at an exposure limit of 24 mgm 3 while ultrafine ti o 2 be set at an exposure limit of 03 mgm 3 as timeweighted average concentrations up to 10 hours a day for a 40hour work week 73 these recommendations reflect the findings in the research literature that show smaller titanium dioxide particles are more likely to pose carcinogenic risk than the larger titanium dioxide particles there is some evidence the rare disease yellow nail syndrome may be caused by titanium either implanted for medical reasons or through eating various foods containing titanium dioxide 74dunkin donuts in the united states is dropping titanium dioxide from its powdered sugar doughnuts after public pressure 75 76 77  undue weight – discuss however andrew maynard director of risk science center at the university of michigan downplayed the supposed danger from use of titanium dioxide in food he says that the titanium dioxide used by dunkin’ brands and many other food producers is not a new material and it is not a nanomaterial either nanoparticles are typically smaller than 100 nanometres in diameter yet most of the particles in food grade titanium dioxide are much larger 78environmental waste introduction  edittitanium dioxide ti o₂ is mostly introduced into the environment as nanoparticles via wastewater treatment plants 79 mascara pigments including titanium dioxide enter the wastewater when the product is washed off into sinks after cosmetic use once in the plants pigments separate into sewage sludge which can then be released into the soil when injected into the soil or distributed on its surface 99 of these nanoparticles wind up on land rather than in aquatic environments due to their retention in sewage sludge 79 once in the environment the titanium dioxide nanoparticles have incredibly low to negligible dissolution and have been shown to be very stable once particle aggregates are formed in soil and water surroundings 79 in the process of dissolution watersoluble ions typically dissociate from the nanoparticle into solution when thermodynamically unstable ti o 2 dissolution increases when there are higher levels of dissolved organic matter and clay in the soil however aggregation is promoted by p h at the isoelectric point of ti o 2 p h  58 which renders it neutral and solution ion concentrations above 45 m m 80 81see also  edittitanium dioxide nanoparticle dyesensitized solar cell list of inorganic pigments noxer a building material incorporating ti o 2
