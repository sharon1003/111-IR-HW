the rights of others a low moral sense or conscience is often apparent as well as a history of crime legal problems or impulsive and aggressive behavior 1 2antisocial personality disorder is defined in the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm dissocial personality disorder dpd a similar or equivalent concept is defined in the international statistical classification of diseases and related health problems icd which includes antisocial personality disorder in the diagnosis both manuals provide similar criteria for diagnosing the disorder 3 both have also stated that their diagnoses have been referred to or include what is referred to as psychopathy or sociopathy but distinctions have been made between the conceptualizations of antisocial personality disorder and psychopathy with many researchers arguing that psychopathy is a disorder that overlaps with but is distinguishable from aspd 4 5 6 7 8contents  hide 1 signs and symptoms11 conduct disorder2 causes and

and feelings of others 1 individuals with this personality disorder will typically have no compunction in exploiting others in harmful ways for their own gain or pleasure and frequently manipulate and deceive other people achieving this through wit and a facade of superficial charm or through intimidation and violence 9 they may display arrogance think lowly and negatively of others and lack remorse for their harmful actions and have a callous attitude to those they have harmed 1 2 irresponsibility is a core characteristic of this disorder they can have significant difficulties in maintaining stable employment as well as fulfilling their social and financial obligations and people with this disorder often lead exploitative unlawful or parasitic lifestyles 1 2 10 11those with antisocial personality disorder are often impulsive and reckless failing to consider or disregarding the consequences of their actions they may repeatedly disregard and jeopardize their own safety and the safety of others and place themselves and others in danger 1 2 12 they are often aggressive and hostile and display a disregulated temper and can lash out violently with provocation or frustration 1 11 individuals are prone to substance abuse and addiction and the abuse of various psychoactive substances is common in this population these behaviors lead such individuals into frequent conflict with the law and many people with aspd have extensive histories of antisocial behavior and criminal infractions stemming back before adulthood 1 2 10 11serious problems with interpersonal relationships are often seen in those with the disorder attachments and emotional bonds are weak and interpersonal relationships often revolve around the manipulation exploitation and abuse of others 1 while they generally have no problems in establishing relationships they may have difficulties in sustaining and maintaining them 10 relationships with family members and relatives are often strained due to their behavior and the frequent problems that these individuals may get into conduct disorder  editmain article conduct disorder while antisocial personality disorder is a mental disorder diagnosed in adulthood it has its precedent in childhood 13 the dsm5 s criteria for aspd require that the individual have conduct problems evident by the age of 15 9 persistent antisocial behavior as well as a lack of regard for others in childhood and adolescence is known as conduct disorder and is the precursor of aspd 14 about 2540 of youths with conduct disorder will be diagnosed with aspd in adulthood 15conduct disorder cd is a disorder diagnosed in childhood that parallels the characteristics found in aspd and is characterized by a repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior in which the basic rights of others or major ageappropriate norms are violated children with the disorder often display impulsive and aggressive behavior may be callous and deceitful and may repeatedly engage in petty crime such as stealing or vandalism or get into fights with other children and adults 16 this behavior is typically persistent and may be difficult to deter with threat or punishment attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd is common in this population and children with the disorder may also engage in substance abuse 17 18 cd is differentiated from oppositional defiant disorder odd in that children with odd do not commit aggressive or antisocial acts against other people animals and property though many children diagnosed with odd are subsequently rediagnosed with cd 19two developmental courses for cd have been identified based on the age at which the symptoms become present the first is known as the childhoodonset type and occurs when conduct disorder symptoms are present before the age of 10 years this course is often linked to a more persistent life course and more pervasive behaviors and children in this group express greater levels of adhd symptoms neuropsychological deficits more academic problems increased family dysfunction and higher likelihood of aggression and violence 20 the second is known as the adolescentonset type and occurs when conduct disorder develops after the age of 10 years compared to the childhoodonset type less impairment in various cognitive and emotional functions are present and the adolescentonset variety may remit by adulthood 21 in addition to this differentiation the dsm5 provides a specifier for a callous and unemotional interpersonal style which reflects characteristics seen in psychopathy and are believed to be a childhood precursor to this disorder compared to the adolescentonset subtype the childhood onset subtype especially if callous and unemotional traits are present tends to have a worse treatment outcome 22causes and pathophysiology  editpersonality disorders are seen to be caused by a combination and interaction of genetic and environmental influences 23 genetically it is the intrinsic temperamental tendencies as determined by their genetically influenced physiology and environmentally it is the social and cultural experiences of a person in childhood and adolescence encompassing their family dynamics peer influences and social values 1 people with an antisocial or alcoholic parent are considered to be at higher risk firesetting and cruelty to animals during childhood are as well linked to the development of antisocial personality the condition is more common in males than in females and among people who are in prison 23 9genetic  editresearch into genetic associations in antisocial personality disorder is suggestive that aspd has some or even a strong genetic basis prevalence of aspd is higher in people related to someone afflicted by the disorder twin studies which are designed to discern between genetic and environmental effects have reported significant genetic influences on antisocial behavior and conduct disorder 24in the specific genes that may be involved one gene that has seen particular interest in its correlation with antisocial behavior is the gene that encodes for monoamine oxidase a maoa an enzyme that breaks down monomamine neurotransmitters such as serotonin and norephinephrine various studies examining the genes relationship to behavior have suggested that variants of the gene that results in less maoa being produced such as the 2r and 3r alleles of the promoter region have associations with aggressive behavior in men 25 26 the association is also influenced by negative experience in early life with children possessing a lowactivity variant maoal who experience such maltreatment being more likely to develop antisocial behavior than those with the highactivity variants maoah 27 28 even when environmental interactions eg emotional abuse are controlled for a small association between maoal and aggressive and antisocial behavior remains 29the gene that encodes for the serotonin transporter scl6a4 a gene that is heavily researched for its associations with other mental disorders is another gene of interest in antisocial behavior and personality traits genetic associations studies have suggested that the short s allele is associated with impulsive antisocial behavior and aspd in the inmate population 30 however research into psychopathy find that the long l allele is associated with the factor 1 traits of psychopathy which describes its core affective eg lack of empathy fearlessness and interpersonal eg grandiosity manipulativeness personality disturbances 31 this is suggestive of two different forms one associated more with impulsive behavior and emotional dysregulation and the other with predatory aggression and affective disturbance of the disorder 32various other gene candidates for aspd have been identified by a genomewide association study published in 2016 several of these gene candidates are shared with attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder with which aspd is comorbid 33physiological  edithormones and neurotransmitters  edittraumatic events can lead to a disruption of the standard development of the central nervous system which can generate a release of hormones that can change normal patterns of development 34 aggressiveness and impulsivity are among the possible symptoms of aspd testosterone is a hormone that plays an important role in aggressiveness in the brain 35 for instance criminals who have committed violent crimes tend to have higher levels of testosterone than the average person 35 the effect of testosterone is counteracted by cortisol which facilitates the cognitive control of impulsive tendencies 35one of the neurotransmitters that have been discussed in individuals with aspd is serotonin also known as 5ht 34 a metaanalysis of 20 studies found significantly lower 5hiaa levels indicating lower serotonin levels especially in those who are younger than 30 years of age 36while it has been shown that lower levels of serotonin may be associated with aspd there has also been evidence that decreased serotonin function is highly correlated with impulsiveness and aggression across a number of different experimental paradigms impulsivity is not only linked with irregularities in 5ht metabolism but may be the most essential psychopathological aspect linked with such dysfunction 37 correspondingly the dsm classifies impulsivity or failure to plan ahead and irritability and aggressiveness as two of seven subcriteria in category a of the diagnostic criteria of aspd 38 9some studies have found a relationship between monoamine oxidase a and antisocial behavior including conduct disorder and symptoms of adult aspd in maltreated children 39neurological  editantisocial behavior may be related to head trauma 40 antisocial behavior is associated with decreased grey matter in the right lentiform nucleus left insula and frontopolar cortex increased volumes have been observed in the right fusiform gyrus inferior parietal cortex right cingulate gyrus and post central cortex 41people that exhibit antisocial behavior demonstrate decreased activity in the prefrontal cortex the association is more apparent in functional neuroimaging as opposed to structural neuroimaging 42 the prefrontal cortex is involved in many executive functions including behavior inhibitions planning ahead determining consequences of action and differentiating between right and wrong cavum septi pellucidi csp is a marker for limbic neural maldevelopment and its presence has been loosely associated with certain mental disorders such as schizophrenia and posttraumatic stress disorder 43 44 45 one study found that those with csp had significantly higher levels of antisocial personality psychopathy arrests and convictions compared with controls 45environmental  editfamily environment  editsome studies suggest that the social and home environment has contributed to the development of antisocial behavior 34 the parents of these children have been shown to display antisocial behavior which could be adopted by their children 34cultural influences  editthe sociocultural perspective of clinical psychology views disorders as influenced by cultural aspects since cultural norms differ significantly mental disorders such as aspd are viewed differently 46 robert d hare has suggested that the rise in aspd that has been reported in the united states may be linked to changes in cultural mores the latter serving to validate the behavioral tendencies of many individuals with aspd 47 136 while the rise reported may be in part merely a byproduct of the widening use and abuse of diagnostic techniques 48 given eric berne s division between individuals with active and latent aspd – the latter keeping themselves in check by attachment to an external source of control like the law traditional standards or religion 49 – it has been plausibly suggested that the erosion of collective standards may indeed serve to release the individual with latent aspd from their previously prosocial behavior 47 136–7there is also a continuous debate as to the extent to which the legal system should be involved in the identification and admittance of patients with preliminary symptoms of aspd 50diagnosis  editdsm ivtr  editthe apa s diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders fourth edition text

falls under the dramaticerratic cluster of personality disorders  cluster b  icd10  editthe who s international statistical classification of diseases and related health problems tenth edition icd10 has a diagnosis called dissocial personality disorder  f602  52 53it is characterized by at least 3 of the following callous unconcern for the feelings of othersgross and persistent attitude of irresponsibility and disregard for social norms rules and obligationsincapacity to maintain enduring relationships though having no difficulty in establishing themvery low tolerance to frustration and a low threshold for discharge of aggression including violenceincapacity to experience guilt or to profit from experience particularly punishmentmarked readiness to blame others or to offer plausible rationalizations for the behavior that has brought the person into conflict with society the icd states that this diagnosis includes amoral antisocial asocial psychopathic and sociopathic personality although the disorder is not synonymous with conduct disorder presence of conduct disorder during childhood or adolescence may further support the diagnosis of dissocial personality disorder there may also be persistent irritability as an associated feature 53 54it is a requirement of the icd10 that a diagnosis of any specific personality disorder also satisfies a set of general personality disorder criteria 53psychopathy  editmain article psychopathy psychopathy is commonly defined as a personality disorder characterized partly by antisocial behavior a diminished capacity for empathy and remorse and poor behavioral controls 8 55 56 57 psychopathic traits are assessed using various measurement tools including canadian researcher robert d hare s psychopathy checklist revised  pclr  58 psychopathy is not the official title of any diagnosis in the dsm or icd nor is it an official title used by other major psychiatric organizations the dsm and icd have however stated that they have antisocial diagnoses that have been referred to or include what is referred to as psychopathy or sociopathy 8 52 57 59 60american psychiatrist hervey cleckley s work 61 on psychopathy formed the basis of the diagnostic criteria for aspd and the dsm has stated that aspd has also been referred to as psychopathy 4 8 however critics have argued that aspd is not synonymous with psychopathy as the diagnostic criteria are not exactly the same since criteria relating to personality traits are emphasized relatively less in the former these differences exist in part because it was believed that such traits were difficult to measure reliably and it was easier to agree on the behaviors that typify a disorder than on the reasons why they occur 4 5 6 7 8although the diagnosis of aspd covers two to three times as many prisoners than the diagnosis of psychopathy robert hare believes that the pclr is better able to predict future criminality violence and recidivism than a diagnosis of aspd 4 5 he suggests that there are differences between pclrdiagnosed psychopaths and nonpsychopaths on processing and use of linguistic and emotional information while such differences are potentially smaller between those diagnosed with aspd and without 5 6 additionally hare argued that confusion regarding how to diagnose aspd confusion regarding the difference between aspd and psychopathy as well as the differing future prognoses regarding recidivism and treatability may have serious consequences in settings such as court cases where psychopathy is often seen as aggravating the crime 5 6nonetheless psychopathy has been proposed as a specifier under an alternative model for aspd in the dsm5 under alternative dsm5 model for personality disorders aspd with psychopathic features is described as characterized by a lack of anxiety or fear and by a bold interpersonal style that may mask maladaptive behaviors eg fraudulence low levels of withdrawal and high levels of attentionseeking combined with low anxiety are associated with social potency and stress immunity in psychopathy 16 765 under the specifier affective and interpersonal characteristics are comparatively emphasized over behavioral components 62other  edittheodore millon suggested 5 subtypes of aspd 63 64 however these constructs are not recognized in the dsm and icd this article uses citations that link to broken or

hyperactivity disorder bipolar disorder borderline personality disorder histrionic personality disorder narcissistic personality disorder sadistic personality disorder when combined with alcoholism people may show frontal function deficits on neuropsychological tests greater than those associated with each condition 66the rates of antisocial personality disorder tends to be around 4050 in male alcohol and opiate addicts 67treatment  editaspd is considered to be among the most difficult personality disorders to treat 68 69  verification needed rendering an effective treatment for aspd is further complicated due to the inability to look at comparative studies between psychopathy and aspd due to differing diagnostic criteria differences in defining and measuring outcomes and a focus on treating incarcerated patients rather than those in the community 70 because of their very low or absent capacity for remorse individuals with aspd often lack sufficient motivation and fail to see the costs associated with antisocial acts 68 they may only simulate remorse rather than truly commit to change they can be seductively charming and dishonest and may manipulate staff and fellow patients during treatment 71  verification needed studies have shown that outpatient therapy is not likely to be successful but the extent to which persons with aspd are entirely unresponsive to treatment may have been exaggerated 72most treatment done is for those in the criminal justice system are given the treatment regimes as part of their imprisonment 73 those with aspd may stay in treatment only as required by an external source such as parole conditions  verification needed residential programs that provide a carefully controlled environment of structure and supervision along with peer confrontation have been recommended 68 there has been some research on the treatment of aspd that indicated positive results for therapeutic interventions 74 psychotherapy also known as talk therapy is found to help treat patients with aspd 75 schema therapy is also being investigated as a treatment for aspd 76 a review by charles m borduin features the strong influence of multisystemic therapy mst that could potentially improve this imperative issue however this treatment requires complete cooperation and participation of all family members 77 some studies have found that the presence of aspd does not significantly interfere with treatment for other disorders such as substance abuse 78 although others have reported contradictory findings 79therapists working with individuals with aspd may have considerable negative feelings toward patients with extensive histories of aggressive exploitative and abusive behaviors 68 rather than attempt to develop a sense of conscience in these individuals which is extremely difficult considering the nature of the disorder therapeutic techniques are focused on rational and utilitarian arguments against repeating past mistakes these approaches would focus on the tangible material value of prosocial behavior and abstaining from antisocial behavior however the impulsive and aggressive nature of those with this disorder may limit the effectiveness of even this form of therapy 80the use of medications in treating antisocial personality disorder is still poorly explored and no medications have been approved by the fda to specifically treat aspd 81 a 2010 cochrane review of studies that explored the use of pharmaceuticals in aspd patients of which 8 studies met the selection criteria for review concluded that the current body of evidence was inconclusive for recommendations concerning the use of pharmaceuticals in treating the various issues of aspd 82 nonetheless psychiatric medications such as antipsychotics antidepressants and mood stabilizers can be used to control symptoms such as aggression and impulsivity as well as treat disorders that may cooccur with aspd for which medications are indicated 81prognosis  editaccording to professor emily simonoff of the institute of psychiatry psychology and neuroscience childhood hyperactivity and conduct disorder showed equally strong prediction of antisocial personality disorder aspd and criminality in early and midadult life lower iq and reading problems were most prominent in their relationships with childhood and adolescent antisocial behaviour 83epidemiology  editaspd is seen in 3 to 30 of psychiatric outpatients 65 the prevalence of the disorder is even higher in selected populations like prisons where there is a preponderance of violent offenders 84 a 2002 literature review of studies on mental disorders in prisoners stated that 47 of male prisoners and 21 of female prisoners had aspd 85 similarly the prevalence of aspd is higher among patients in alcohol or other drug aod abuse treatment programs than in the general population 84 suggesting a link between aspd and aod abuse and dependence 86history  editthe first version of the dsm in 1952 listed sociopathic personality disturbance individuals to be placed in this category were said to be ill primarily in terms of society and of conformity with the prevailing milieu and not only in terms of personal discomfort and relations with other individuals  verification needed there were four subtypes referred to as reactions antisocial dyssocial sexual and addiction the antisocial reaction was said to include people who were always in trouble and not learning from it maintaining no loyalties frequently callous and lacking responsibility with an ability to rationalize their behavior the category was described as more specific and limited than the existing concepts of constitutional psychopathic state or psychopathic personality which had had a very broad meaning the narrower definition was in line with criteria advanced by hervey m cleckley from 1941 while the term sociopathic had been advanced by george partridge in 1928 when studying the early environmental influence on psychopaths partridge discovered the correlation between antisocial psychopathic disorder and parental rejection experienced in early childhood 87the dsmii in 1968 rearranged the categories and antisocial personality was now listed as one of ten personality disorders but still described similarly to be applied to individuals who are basically unsocialized in repeated conflicts with society incapable of significant loyalty selfish irresponsible unable to feel guilt or learn from prior experiences and who tend to blame others and rationalize 88 the manual preface contains special instructions including  antisocial personality should always be specified as mild moderate or severe the dsmii warned that a history of legal or social offenses was not by itself enough to justify the diagnosis and that a group delinquent reaction of childhood or adolescence or social maladjustment without manifest psychiatric disorder should be ruled out first the dyssocial personality type was relegated in the dsmii to dyssocial behavior for individuals who are predatory and follow more or less criminal pursuits such as racketeers dishonest gamblers prostitutes and dope peddlers dsmi classified this condition as sociopathic personality disorder dyssocial type  it would later resurface as the name of a diagnosis in the icd manual produced by the who later spelled dissocial personality disorder and considered approximately equivalent to the aspd diagnosis 89the dsmiii in 1980 included the full term antisocial personality disorder and as with other disorders there was now a full checklist of symptoms focused on observable behaviors to enhance consistency in diagnosis between different psychiatrists interrater reliability the aspd symptom list was based on the research diagnostic criteria developed from the socalled feighner criteria from 1972 and in turn largely credited to influential research by sociologist lee robins published in 1966 as deviant children grown up 90 however robins has previously clarified that while the new criteria of prior childhood conduct problems came from her work she and coresearcher psychiatrist patricia oneal got the diagnostic criteria they used from lees husband the psychiatrist eli robins one of the authors of the feighner criteria who had been using them as part of diagnostic interviews 91the dsmiv maintained the trend for behavioral antisocial symptoms while noting this pattern has also been referred to as psychopathy sociopathy or dyssocial personality disorder and reincluding in the associated features text summary some of the underlying personality traits from the older diagnoses the dsm5 has the same diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder the pocket guide to the dsm5 diagnostic exam suggests that a person with aspd may present with psychopathic features if he or she exhibits a lack of anxiety or fear and a bold efficacious interpersonal style 62popular culture  editantisocial personality disorder is depicted in 23 of all academy award winning movies that depict a mental disorder 92one of the most famed cases of antisocial personality disorder in popular culture would be that of british cultural icon sherlock holmes as he is often portrayed to lack empathy be manipulative egocentric and impulsive 93another famous example of what appears to be antisocial personality disorder in film is michael douglas s portrayal of gordon gekko in wall street 1987 film in which gekko sees other people as a means to his ends and attacks when threatened gekko is known for the famous quote in the film greed  is good which is a simple quote that is indicative of his aspd 94patrick bateman in american psycho film is a serial killer who shows clear signs of antisocial personality disorder in various scenes within the film bateman is shown lacking severe impulse control through his killings and sexual activity with prostitutes 95see also
