to help children plagued with seizures the relief however comes in a most unlikely form marijuana share full storydesperate for relief parents are taking unusual steps to help children plagued with seizures the relief however comes in a most unlikely form marijuana as many as 30 percent of people with epilepsy  or about one million americans  still have seizures while on food and drug administration fdaapproved treatments its left many who suffer from uncontrollable seizures  or their parents as many of them are children  turning to medical marijuana and its derivatives in an attempt to take back control of a disease with no cure a seizure is an abnormal electrical storm in the brain that causes sudden alteration in consciousness sensation and behavior that can manifest from an eye flicker to fullbody convulsions people with medicationresistant also called intractable epilepsy suffer from consequences of recurrent seizures which could damage the brain and adversely impact their quality of life this is commonly observed in children with certain types of devastating pediatric epilepsy such as lennoxgastaut doose and dravet syndromes stories about desperate parents seeking anything to relieve their childrens seizures abound but how much scientific evidence is there for cannabis effectiveness d samba reddy ph d r ph professor in the department of neuroscience and experimental therapeutics at the texas am health science center college of medicine studies novel therapies for epilepsy he recently published an article with coauthor victoria golub in the journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics about the current state of research into medical marijuana for treating epilepsy there was a lot of media attention about how medical marijuana is good for epilepsy said reddy who is a fellow of both the american association of pharmaceutical scientists aaps and the american association for the advancement of science aaas we became interested in finding out whether there was scientific evidence in the literature to support the claims of these people who have seen great benefits there are at least 85 active components of the plant colloquially known as marijuana but two major ones of have been the focus of study delta 9tetrahydrocannabinol thc and cannabidiol cbd thc is the psychoactive component of the plant while cbd doesnt cause any sort of a high and isnt thought to be addictive preliminary studies  largely in animal models  have shown cbd might have some antiseizure potential derivatives of marijuana high in cbd but with negligible amount of thc might offer some benefit for intractable epilepsy cbdenriched products like epidiolex and realm oil exist but their efficacy hasnt been proven and they exist in a sort of legal grey area homemade compounds exist but since they dont go through rigorous best practice manufacturing procedures and havent been approved by the fda it can be difficult for consumers to know exactly what theyre getting although thc is known to share the actions of anandamide from the indian sanskrit word anand for bliss or happiness a naturally occurring compound in the brain the exact mode of antiseizure action of cbd is unclear it is critical to know how cbd controls seizures so pharmaceutical companies can design novel synthetic compounds for epilepsy that could surpass the hurdles of mixed cbd extracts said reddy who directs an epilepsy research lab at texas am these compounds might provide the benefits without some of the risks  or the legal issues  associated with the marijuana plant a standard manufacturing process and clinical trials might help answer some of these questions but conducting one isnt easy and there are currently only 19 clinical trials going on to test the use of cannabinoids for epilepsy for one thing cannabis is still listed as a schedule i substance by the federal government meaning gaining permission to use it in research on human participants is extremely difficult still change is occurring at the state level recreational marijuana use is legal for adults in four states alaska colorado oregon and washington and in 23 states and washington dc medical marijuana is allowed texas in a law passed during the last legislative session in 2015 legalized lowthc cannabis oils for people with intractable epilepsy while still prohibiting medical marijuana more broadly a new study at the university of colorado anschutz medical campus is enrolling dravet epilepsy patients who have tried charlottes web a specific strain of medical marijuana that is low in thc and high in cbd the researchers will compare the genetics of those who have seen seizure activity decreased dramatically at least 50 percent in response to the drug versus those who did not although this research could yield useful information about how cbd and genetic factors interact in a dravet population it is not the gold standard of scientific drug trials the randomized placebocontrolled doubleblinded clinical trial in which patients were randomly assigned to either cbd or a placebo as for experts like reddy who is a texas boardcertified pharmacist most are taking a cautious waitandsee approach the american epilepsy society aes has released a statement on the use of medical marijuana in the treatment of epilepsy stating that due to the lack of data no conclusion can be drawn at present the epilepsy foundation doesnt specifically discourage cannabis use but urges anyone exploring treatment for epilepsy to work with their treating physician to make the best decisions for their own care and to follow applicable laws despite all of the controversy about medical marijuana as a potential therapy for epilepsy reddy said most people agree that what we need is greater rigorous scientific study into cannabinoids to prove or disprove their safety and efficacy story source materials provided by texas am university note content may be edited for style and
