ways to prevent avalanches and lessen their power and destruction they are employed in areas where avalanches pose a significant threat to people such as ski resorts and mountain towns roads and railways explosives are used extensively to prevent avalanches especially at ski resorts where other methods are often impractical explosive charges are used to trigger small avalanches before enough snow can build up to cause a large avalanche snow fences and light walls can be used to direct the placement of snow snow builds up around the fence especially the side that faces the prevailing winds downwind of the fence snow buildup is lessened this is caused by the loss of snow at the fence that would have been deposited and the pickup of the snow that is already there by the wind which was depleted of snow at the fence when there is a sufficient density of trees they can greatly reduce the strength of avalanches they hold snow in place and when there is an avalanche the impact of the snow against the trees slows it down trees can either be planted or they can be conserved such as in the building of a ski resort to reduce the strength of avalanches artificial barriers can be very effective in reducing avalanche damage there are several types one kind of barrier  snow net uses a net strung between poles that are anchored by guy wires in addition to their foundations these barriers are similar to those used for rockslides another type of barrier is a rigid fence like structure  snow fence and may be constructed of steel wood or prestressed concrete they usually have gaps between the beams and are built perpendicular to the slope with reinforcing beams on the downhill side rigid barriers are often considered unsightly especially when many rows must be built they are also expensive and vulnerable to damage from falling rocks in the warmer months finally there are barriers that stop or deflect avalanches with their weight and strength these barriers are made of concrete rocks or earth they are usually placed right above the structure road or railway that they are trying to protect although they can also be used to channel avalanches into other barriers occasionally earth mounds are placed in the avalanches path to slow it down safety in avalanche terrain  editterrain management  terrain management involves reducing the exposure of an individual to the risks of travelling in avalanche terrain by carefully selecting what areas of slopes to travel on features to be cognizant of include not undercutting slopes removing the physical support of the snow pack not travelling over convex rolls areas where the snow pack is under tension staying away from weaknesses like exposed rock and avoiding areas of slopes that expose one to terrain traps gulleys that can be filled in cliffs over which one can be swept or heavy timber into which one can be carried group management  group management is the practice of reducing the risk of having a member of a group or from the avalanche hazard before the next one leaves protective cover route selection should also consider what dangers lie above and below the route and the consequences of an unexpected avalanche ie unlikely to occur but deadly if it does stop or camp only in safe locations wear warm gear to delay hypothermia if buried plan escape routes in determining the size of the group balance the hazard of not having enough people to effectively carry out a rescue with the risk of having too many members of the group to safely manage the risks it is generally recommended not to travel alone because there will be noone to witness your burial and start the rescue additionally avalanche risk increases with use that is the more a slope is disturbed by skiers the more likely it is that an avalanche will occur 1 most important of all practise good communication within a group including clearly communicating the decisions about safe locations escape routes and slope choices and having a clear understanding of every members skills in snow travel avalanche rescue and route finding risk factor awareness  risk factor awareness in avalanche safety requires gathering and accounting for a wide range of information such as the meteorological history of the area the current weather and snow conditions and equally important the social and physical indicators of the group leadership  leadership in avalanche terrain requires well defined decision making protocols that use the observed risk factors these decision making frameworks are taught in a variety of courses provided by national avalanche resource centres in europe and north america fundamental to leadership in avalanche terrain is honestly assessing and estimating the information that was ignored or overlooked recent research has shown that there are strong psychological and group dynamic determinants that lead to avalanche involvement to quickly find and rescue a person buried in an avalanche a probe beacon and shovel are essential the buried person must also be wearing an avalanche beacon even small avalanches are a serious danger to life even with properly trained and equipped companions who avoid the avalanche between 55 and 65 percent of victims buried in the open are killed and only 80 percent of the victims remaining on the surface survive mc clung p177 research carried out in switzerland 2 1 based on 422 buried skiers indicates how the chances of survival drop very rapidly from 92 percent within 15 minutes to only 30 percent after 35 minutes victims die of suffocationnear zero after two hours victims die of injuries or hypothermia historically the chances of survival were estimated at 85 within 15 minutes 50 within 30 minutes 20 within one hour consequently it is vital that everyone surviving an avalanche is used in an immediate search and rescue operation rather than waiting for help to arrive additional help can be called once it can be determined if anyone is seriously injured or still remains unaccountable after the immediate search ie after at least 30 minutes of searching even in a well equipped country such as france it typically takes 45 minutes for a helicopter rescue team to arrive by which time most of the victims are likely to have died in some cases avalanche victims are not located until spring thaw melts the snow or even years later when objects emerge from a glacier search and rescue equipment  edita blackhawk helicopter as the crew prepares to evacuate tourists stranded by an avalanche in galt√ºr austria on february 25 1999 chances of a buried victim being found alive and rescued are increased when everyone in a group is carrying and using standard avalanche equipment and have trained in how to use it a beacon shovel and probe is considered the minimum equipment to carry for companion rescue organized rescue involves ski patrols and mountain rescue teams who are often equipped with other technologies to search for buried victims rescue equipment can make a difference and in 2010 the french national association for the study of snow and avalanches  anena recommended that all offpiste skiers should carry beacons probes shovels and recco reflectors avalanche cords  editmain article avalanche cord the use of avalanche cords goes back just over 100 years to a bavarian mountaineer named eugen oertel in the united states the concept was recommended as early as 1908 in the colorado newspaper  the ouray herald november 13  when the editor repeated the suggestion that miners in the san juan mountains adopt snowslide ribbons to safeguard their travels to and from the mines 3 the principle is simple an approximately 15 metre long red cord similar to parachute cord is attached to the person in questions belt while skiing snowboarding or walking the cord is dragged along behind the person the assumption is that if the person gets buried in an avalanche the light cord stays on top of the snow due to the colour the cord would be easily visible for companions commercial avalanche cords have metal markings every one to three metres indicating the direction and length to the victim avalanche cords were popular before beacons became available and while cords were thought to be effective markers there was never any proof of their effectiveness in the 1970s melchior schild of the swiss federal institute for snow and avalanche research slf reviewed 30 years of swiss avalanche accidents and rescues from 194445 to 197374 of the 2042 avalanche victims he found only seven cases where avalanche cords were used not including the 2 mentioned above in five cases part of the cord was visible on the surface but so too were part of the victims in the sixth case the victim was completely buried but part of the cord was visible sadly this victim died of trauma in the seventh case the completely buried avalanche cord was located by an avalanche rescue dog however the cord had become detached from the victim her body was found much later in knox williams and betsy armstrongs 1986 book the avalanche book they cite an early 1970s study where avalanche cords were tested on sandbag dummies the dummies were placed onto steep slopes where explosives were used to trigger avalanches trials showed a portion of the cord remained on the surface only 40 of the time the other 60 of the time the cord was completely buried along with the dummy typically the cord had spooled around the dummy 1975 at a symposium of avalanche rescue experts hosted by the international foundation vanni eigenmann schild concluded ‚Äúon the basis of these results the avalanche cord can no longer be considered reliable‚Äù 3in the united states there have been two accidents with five buried victims all wearing avalanche cords in one accident an avalanche cord remained on the surface in the second accident five ski mountaineers with cords deployed triggered an avalanche one skier was partly buried but his four friends and cords were completely buried moderate snow and the loss of the survivor‚Äôs eyeglasses only worsened the situation the search was called off a few days later the four were eventually found many months later after their bodies with attached cords melted out of the snow on one victim the cord was wrapped tightly around the body  citation neededavalanche cords are now regarded obsolete as beacons are available and much more effective 4beacons  editmain article avalanche transceiver avalanche transceivers ‚Äî known as beacons beepers peeps pieps arvas  appareil de recherche de victimes en avalanche in french lvs  lawinenversch√ºttetensuchger√§t swiss german or various other trade names are important for every member of the party they emit a beep via 457 k hz radio signal in normal use but may be switched to receive mode to locate a buried victim up to 80 meters away analog receivers provide audible beeps that rescuers interpret to estimate distance to a victim to use the receiver effectively requires regular practice some older models of beepers operated on a different frequency 2275 k hz  and a group leader should ensure these are no longer in use since about 2000 nearly all avalanche rescue transceivers use digital displays to give visual indications of direction and distance to victims most users find these beacons easier to use but to be effective still requires considerable practice by the user beacons are the primary rescue tool for companion rescue and are considered active devices because the user must learn to use and care for their device avalanche transceivers are not to be confused with several smartphone applications calling themselves smartphone avalanche search apps using twoway communication technologies 5 every member of the party must be equipped with an avalanche transceiver probes  editavalanche security search and rescue equipment left to right avalanche airbag system collapsed probe shovel avalanche transceiver portable collapsible probes can be extended to probe into the snow to locate the exact location of a victim at several yards  metres in depth when multiple victims are buried probes should be used to decide the order of rescue with the shallowest being dug out first since they have the greatest chance of survival probing can be a very timeconsuming process if a thorough search is undertaken for a victim without a beacon in the u s 86 of the 140 victims found since 1950 by probing were already dead 2 survivalrescue more than 2 m deep is rare about 4 probes should be used immediately after a visual search for surface clues in coordination with the beacon search shovels  editeven when the snowpack consists of loose powder avalanche debris is hard and dense the energy of the avalanche causes the snow to melt and the debris refreezes immediately after it stops shovels are essential for digging through the snow to the victim as the snow is often too dense to dig with hands or skis a large strong scoop and sturdy handle are important plastic shovels often break whereas metal ones are less prone to failure 6as excavation of the avalanche victim is extremely timeconsuming and many buried victims suffocate before they can be reached shovelling technique is an essential element of rescue 6shovels are also useful for digging snow pits as part of evaluating the snowpack for hidden hazards such as weak layers supporting large loads recco rescue system  editthe recco system is used by organised rescue services around the world the recco system is a twopart system where the rescue team uses a small handheld detector the detector receives a directional signal that is reflected back from a small passive transponder called a reflector that is included into outerwear boots helmets and body protection recco reflectors are not a substitute for avalanche beacons the recco signal does not interfere with beacons in fact the current recco detector also has an avalanche beacon receiver 457 k hz so one rescuer can search for a recco signal and a beacon signal at the same time avalung  editrecently a device called an avalung has been introduced for use in avalanche terrain the device consists of a mouth piece a flap valve an exhaust pipe and an air collector several models of avalung either mount on ones chest or integrate in a proprietary backpack during an avalanche burial victims not killed by trauma usually suffer from asphyxiation as the snow around them melts from the heat of the victims breath and then refreezes disallowing oxygen flow to the victim and allowing toxic levels of co 2 to accumulate the avalung ameliorates this situation by drawing breath over a large surface area in front and pushing the warm exhaled carbon dioxide behind this buys additional time for rescuers to dig the victim out 7avalanche airbags  editavalanche airbag system with visible airbags avalanche airbags help a person avoid burial by making the user an even larger object relative to the moving snow which forces the person toward the surface avalanche airbags work on the principle of inverse segregation  granular convection  8 avalanches like mixed nuts and breakfast cereal are considered granular materials and behave fluidlike but are not liquids where smaller particles settle to the bottom of the flow and larger particles rise to the top provided the airbag is properly deployed the chances of a complete burial are significantly reduced with freeriding becoming more popular in recent years avalanche airbags have become relatively commonly used equipment with one german producer reporting over 20000 sales in the 201213 winter season 9 one complication is that the small explosives or compressed air canisters that deploy the airbag might need to be emptied or expended in order to fly on a commercial airplane though the international air transport association has approved carrying charged devices the u s transportation security administration requires that they be discharged for this reason some users who travel by air buy a new canister or refill an empty one after arrival 10in 2014 one company introduced an airbag system that uses a batterypowered fan to inflate its 200litre 71 cu ft bag in around 35 seconds avoiding the use of compressed gas is claimed to avoid problems with travel restrictions the manufacturer claims a number of other advantages for the system such as the ability to easily and repeatedly test it the ability of a continuously operating fan to keep the airbag inflated even if it receives a puncture or small tear and the fact that the bag can be easily deflated and repacked making the system available for a second deployment if needed 11other devices  editmore backcountry adventurers are also carrying satellite electronic notification devices send to quickly alert rescuers to a problem these devices include the spot messenger emergency positionindicating radio beacon epirb or personal locating beacons plbs containing the global positioning system gps this device can quickly notify search and rescue of an emergency and the general location within 100 yards but only if the person with the epirb has survived the avalanche and can activate the device survivors should also try to use a mobile phone to notify emergency personnel unlike the other devices mentioned above the mobile phone or satellite phone provides twoway communications with rescuers onsite rescuers usually companions are in the best position to save a buried victim however organized rescue teams can sometimes respond very quickly to assist in the search for a buried victim the sooner organized rescue can be notified the sooner they can respond and this difference can mean the difference in living or dying for a critically injured patient the international commission for alpine rescue recommends ‚Äúearly notification is essential eg by mobile phone satellite phone or radio wherever possible‚Äù 12other rescue devices are proposed developed and used such as avalanche balls vests and airbags based on statistics indicating that decreasing the depth of burial increases the chances of survival although inefficient some rescue equipment can be improvised by unprepared parties ski poles can become short probes skis or snowboards can be used as shovels a first aid kit and equipment is useful for assisting survivors who may have cuts broken bones or other injuries in addition to hypothermia selfrescue  editvictims caught in an avalanche are advised to try to escape to the side of the avalanche if not possible theyre instructed to grab onto a tree brush or rock each second one hangs on lets snow pass by that cannot end up burying the victim if knocked off ones feet victims should jettison any equipment if possible and fight for their life rolling like a log may help one escape to the side conventional wisdom says to make swimming motions to stay on the surface anecdotal stories tell successes however analysis of avalanche motion and physics dispute swimming as a successful tactic 13 avalanches stop quickly and if under the snow it is critical to get a hand in front of the face to create an airspace before the snow stops if near the surface one may try to thrust an arm leg or object above the surface if possible victims should try to break free once the snow stops if unable to move one should not struggle except to enlarge the air space you cant dig yourself out if you could dig yourself out few people would die in avalanches avalanche debris instantly entombs you in place as if you were frozen in concrete and most of the time you cant even move your fingers sometimes if its a small avalanche with soft debris and they have a hand near the surface people have been able to dig themselves out but the vast majority of the time there are only two ways to get out of the snowto be dug out or to melt out 14companion rescue  editperiodic winter avalanches on this 800 m high slope transport woody debris to the flat in the foreground survival time is short if a victim is buried the search for victims must start immediately many people have died because the surviving companions or witnesses failed to do even the simplest search witnesses to an avalanche that engulfs people are frequently limited to those in the party involved in the avalanche those not caught should try to note the locations where the avalanched person or persons were last seen in fact anyone planning to enter an avalanche area should discuss this step as part of their preparation once the avalanche has stopped and the danger of secondary slides has passed witnesses should mark these points with objects for reference then survivors should take a headcount to determine who may be lost if the area is safe to enter the searchers should visually scan along a downslope trajectory from the marked points last seen victims who are partially or shallowly buried can often be located quickly by visually scanning the avalanche debris and pulling out clothing or equipment that may be attached to someone buried because survival rates plummet as time passes do not send a searcher for help until you feel you can do no more however do use your mobile phone or radio to call for help as soon as you suspect a burial generally the telephone connection will be better from the top of a slope than from the bottom go to and mark the last seen area switch transceivers to receive mode and check them select likely burial areas and search them listening for beeps or voices expanding to other areas of the avalanche always looking and listening for other clues movement equipment body parts probe randomly in probable burial areas mark any points where signal was received or equipment found continue scanning and probing near marked clues and other likely burial areas after 30 to 60 minutes consider sending a searcher to get more help because at this point the remaining victims have probably not survived line probes are arranged in most likely burial areas and marked as searched continue searching and probing the area until it is no longer feasible or reasonable to continue avoid contaminating the scent of the avalanche area with urine food spit blood etc in case search dogs arrive buried victims are most likely to be foundbelow the marked point last seen along the line of flow of the avalanche around trees and rocks or other obstacles near the bottom runout of the debris along edges of the avalanche track in low spots where the snow may collect gullies crevasses creeks ditches along roads etc although less likely check other areas if initial searches are not fruitful once buried victims are found and their heads and chests are freed perform first aid airway breathing circulationpulse arterial bleeding spinal injuries fractures shock hypothermia internal injuries etc  according to local law and custom organized rescue  editprofessional and volunteer rescue teams respond when a victim needs more help than their companions can provide traditionally organized rescue responded after companion rescue efforts failed however today thanks to mobile telephones helicopters and snowmachines the distinction between organized and companion rescue sometimes blur together as organized rescue can respond quickly to assist companions in some cases in recent years organized rescue has even replaced companion rescue and saved lives when organized rescue teams reached the debris before the victims companions 15there are four primary goals of any rescue operation and in organized rescue the goals can be initiated simultaneously immediate search get rescuers to the site find and uncover buried victims medical care for victims and companions

pressures in sound waves are far too low the very strong shockwaves produced by explosions can trigger avalanches however if they are close enough to the surface 16myth spitting while covered in snow can determine the direction upwards  spitting while covered in snow is not helpful because when the snow has settled it becomes very solid and most of the time moving is not possible references  edit
