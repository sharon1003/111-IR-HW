kilobits per second or faster broadband typically downloads at a much faster speed than that however as a result broadband internet service is categorized into two different connection groups tier 1 t1 broadband connections range from 1544 mbits to 2048 mbits and tier 3 t3 broadband connections range from 44736 mbits to 1592 gbits with these rates of data transmission broadband represents an evolution from the original high speed internet service integrated services digital network isdn and is by far a significant improvement upon the original internet service dialup the latest

other mobile wireless technologies edge transmits data at approximately 2368 kbits which is below the standard for a broadband connection however its theoretical maximum speed is 4736 kbits so it still considered a wireless broadband technology evdo evolutiondata optimized is significantly faster than edge it transmits data via radio signals and for this reason is classified as a wireless
