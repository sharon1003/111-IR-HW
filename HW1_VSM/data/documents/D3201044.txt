blog beauty how i naturally grew longer eyelashes and thicker eyebrows with before  after picturesposted on july 8 2017the other day i found an old picture where i looked somewhat…different i had almost no eyebrows literally half of the eyebrows i have now i remember i thought by plucking my eyebrows that much i would give myself a more open and fresh glance it was also trendy to have thin eyebrows back then and thank goodness that trend has passed a long time ago my eyebrows did not immediately follow the new ”brooke shields trend” though and then my lashes i believed that lash extensions would not damage my own lashes i found it difficult to cope with the fact that removing the lash extensions meant half of my lashes disapeared too fast forward many years later and i actually don’t care that much anymore about how long my lashes are or how thick my eyebrows are however i adopted an all natural habit ever since and i believe this is the reason my eyelashes and eyebrows grew back thicker and longer and stay that way how i naturally grew longer eyelashes and thicker eyebrows oils after my eyebrows didn’t grew back that easily and beautifully and my lashes were half gone i knew i had to reach out for oils back then i had no clue which one would work best for me i’m now using three types of oils that i a lternate1 jojoba oil i have two favorite oils and jojobo oil is one of them it was also the first oil i used to grow my lashes back before i switched to another oil jojoba oil is a moisturizing oil with amazing regenerative properties jojobo oil is also probably the most populair oil for eyelash enhancers because not only does it moisturize the lashes it also protects the hair follicles which allows the eyelashes to grow longer and thicker before they can fall out how to use wash your eye area so it’s clean of any makeup andor products apply a bit of pure jojoba oil on a cotton swab and dap into the roots of your lashes do the same with your eyebrows i use now organic jojoba oil2 castor oil castor oil has worked amazing to grow back my lashes and eyebrows and it’s my number one favorite the reason i started with jojoba oil is that i was not aware that castor oil would give better results castor oil is a popular oil that is often used to promote the growth of not only lashes and eyebrows but scalp hair too this thick oil contains beneficial antiinflammatory antifungal and antibacterial properties it’s a rich oil with not only a moisturizing effect but castor oil also contains minerals and is high in unique fatty acids that nourishes and strengthen the eyelashes and eyebrows castor oil also increases circulation – which is critical for promoting any hair growth there are two types of castor oils that are great for longer eyelashes and thicker eyebrows the most common type is regular cold pressed castor oil that has a pale color and a mild aroma the other type of castor oil that is very popular for eyebrow and eyelash growth is the much darker jamaican black castor oil jbco i use this one the most but alternate between the two i think it comes down to personal preferences which one you use it’s important though to buy castor oil that is 100 pure and that is hexanefree how to use wash your eye area so it’s clean of any makeup andor other products with a cotton swab or clean mascara brush lightly apply the castor oil from the roots of the eyelashes to the ends of the lashes you only need a drop or two per eye lashes repeat this process at least a few times a week i use this hexane free castor oil i use this jamaican black castor oil3 lavender oil andor coconut oil lavender oil is the oil i use when i want to maintain the results that i got after using the previous described methods lavander oil however is known to significantly increase hair growth too i like to use my diy serum which is an easy to apply eyelash and brow serum it’s a simple recipe that contains lavender oil and coconut oil a study found that in 86 patients who use lavender to treat hair loss over 44 saw significant hair growth as determined by photographic assessment the degree of improvement was significant coconut oil is a perfect carrier oil to mix lavender oil with because it’s nutrient rich plus it’s antibacterial when i’m lazy i only use coconut oil how to use mix 12 teaspoon coconut oil with 24 drops lavender essential oil and use a cotton swab to apply it along your eyelash roots down to the ends of your eyelashes and on the eyebrows i use a different brand all the time but i really like this lavender oil and this coconut oil massage as you might have noticed the most important part about any hair growth methode is to help increase the blood flow and circulation oils are a great way to do so but massages also help a lot massaging the eyelid area and the area near the lashes will do just that increase blood flow and circulation equals a better haireyebrowlash growth this doesn’t need a lot of explanation and as you might have read here i also do this for my hair when i need it to grow quickly it’s also so relaxinghow to do so with your clean fingers gently massage the eyelid area along the lashes before  after o ther differences are weight health and an instagram filter just like with any other natural beauty method you can’t expect miracles overnight it takes time and patience and in my case it took 23 months to see a noticible difference it became a habit now that is part of my nighttime routine i sometimes forget about it and also i have stopped several times for a few months but each time i noticed that especially my lashes are less thick and long if you are struggling with finding a natural and effective way to grow thicker eyebrows and longer lashes i hope this article

the oils and with the oils they only grew faster because i overplucked my eyebrows years ago and they haven’t grown back since now i have tried castor oil multiple times but haven’t seen that mich of a difference or none but maybe i should give it another chance greetings from germany suzan reply bianca january 9 2018 at 107 pm hi sozanthey started growing faster and thicker i don’t think the hair started growing where there never was hair hope this helps best bianca reply clarissa january 22 2018 at 329 pm oh i love the effect of castor oil and coconut oil it’s absolutely effective just it’s not suitable for me to take them with me on business trips and vacations cherish lash makes the same effect and it’s quite natural too but very easy to transport and use on the way somewhere since i
