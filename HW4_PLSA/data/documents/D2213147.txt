offer an affordable and popular housing option for many particularly those with modest incomes however purchasers often end up using financing that costs them considerably more than they would spend on a mortgage for the same property many purchasers may not be aware that you can finance the purchase of a manufactured or mobile home using a conventional mortgage but you can do so provided that you either own or purchase the property the home will be sited on and permanently install the home at its site manufactured homes are a major housing type in the u s accounting for one in seven homes outside of metropolitan areas according to the u s census bureau theyre particularly popular in southern and western states where they account for as much as 17 percent of the total housing stock in south carolina mortgage or chattel loan a mobile home financed through a mortgage will generally have a lower interest rate and monthly payments sometimes by a large margin than one purchased using a chattel loan which is the more common type of financing for manufactured homes of course there are certain requirements to meet a new report from the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb explores some of the ins and outs of purchasing and financing manufactured homes manufactured homes or mobile homes as they are traditionally known are usually considered personal property by default thats because theyre mobile and not attached to the land as is the case with real property ie real estate because theyre classified as personal property theyre only eligible for chattel loans a type of loan secured by property that is portable such as an auto boat rv or mobile home  because theyre you know  mobile the question of real property however a mobile home can legally become real property if it is rendered immobile  that is permanently attached to a foundation or base some threequarters of all states have legal procedures in place to allow a manufactured home to be reclassified as real property along with the land it is on that makes them eligible for mortgage financing  and potentially lower rates and loan costs according to the cfpb the cost of a traditional mortgage can be anyway from onehalf a percent to five percentage points lower than that of a chattel loan used to purchase a manufactured home on a monthly basis the payments could be as much as 40 percent less  although this may be depend on the borrowers credit and financial profile according to cfpb figures nearly half of all manufactured home residents own both the home and the land it is placed on yet nearly twothirds of them used chattel loans to finance their purchase about onequarter of all manufactured homes sold over the past decade have been classified as real property according to the cfpb although that figure has dropped to about 13 percent in recent years highrate highcost loans much more common on manufactured homes overall purchasers of manufactured homes incur much higher rates and other loan expenses than do buyers of singlefamily homes more than twothirds of mobile home buyers have what are considered higherprice loans compared to only 3 percent of buyers of conventional sitebuilt homes higherpriced is considered to be a loan with a rate 15 percentage points or more higher than the average offered wellqualified buyers when points and fees are taken into account a small but significant share of manufactured home buyers pay far more one in six manufactured home buyers have what are considered highcost loans in which their apr annual percentage rate is at least 65 percentage points higher than that given to wellqualified borrowers according to the cfpb by comparison almost no singlefamily home buyers pay rates that high some examples from the cfpb show how the costs can vary assuming a borrower who buys a fairly typical multisection manufactured home for 80000 and puts 20 percent down a 20year fixedrate mortgage at 336 percent would produce payments of 367 per month going to a chattel loan at 487 percent  just above the definition of a highrate loan  yields payments of 418 per month and if the borrower ends up with a highcost loan at 987 percent apr  again just above the threshold for that type  the payments would rise to 612 a month these figures dont include the cost of buying or renting the land the home will be placed on nor does they include the cost of installation and such addons as steps patios or air conditioning which can add 25 percent to the price of the unit itself credit profile location may be factors of course there may be other factors at play borrowers who obtain highcost chattel loans may do so because their credit and financial profile make them risky borrowers so lenders charge them more to offset that risk the cfpb reports that two lenders account for a disproportionate share of highcost chattel loans for manufactured homes suggesting that they may be targeting borrowers with higher risk profiles also it should be noted that you usually cant obtain a mortgage on a unit that will be sited in a manufactured home community even if it is permanently installed because such lots are rented the homes sited on them generally are not classified as real property historically about a 2530 percent of new manufactured homes are sited in such communities a figure that appears to be growing chattel homes are not without their advantages closing is faster and less complicated and the fees may be less than on a mortgage as well although the incidence of highcost loans shows that isnt always the case on the downside chattel loans generally have shorter terms than mortgages  20 years is often the maximum which raises monthly payments borrowers also have fewer legal protections than they do with mortgages as chattel loans are not covered by the real estate settlement procedures act respa a manufactured home isnt everyones cup of tea although the quality of construction and finish has come a long way from the trailers of decades ago with a squarefoot cost about half that of the median singlefamily home they offer an affordable alternative for those whod prefer to own their home rather than rent if you can swing it a mortgage may offer a more affordable financing option as wellmanufactured homes kirk haverkamp published on october 3 2014
