cheesecheese from the sea fromage du mer 10 8dolphins are mammels they nurse their young i wanna put them in pens milk them then take that milk and make cheese cheese of the sea it may taste a bit like feta i would also try the asian market to sell the dolphin colostrum chummy— tony jaguar  may 22 2006whale milk ice cream whale20milk20ice20cream i knew this was floating around somewhere jeremis idea  xenzag may 24 2006i want a dolphincheese dolphinburger with a chocolate dolphinmilkshake— nihilo  may 22 2006we did the whale milk thing already for ice cream and rats we might as well have a insert wildly unsuitable mammal here milk general category but its all just the same basic idea— dr curry  may 22 2006we were discussing this just the other week on w85 fuel  the consensus was that due to their fish and krill diets the resulting fluids might be a bit fishy much better to use dugongs and manatees of the taxonomical order sirenia due to their vegetarian diet their milk should be less reminiscent of haddock i for one would welcome a massive brie du mer instead of the more common brie de meaux muck you get lying about the place these days— zentom  may 22 2006brie du mer that one got by me we could also use the milk for calimarioooohhs— tony jaguar  may 22 2006good one tony jaguar i can now accredit you with the invention of milkcheese— texticle  may 22 2006yep— tony jaguar  may 23 2006sp camels— methinksnot  may 23 2006a mammel  whats a mammel  a dolphincamel hybrid perhaps  a dolphin with humps   the humps could be filled with milk and after an acrobatic session this would turn to cheese— xenzag  may 23 2006i dont get it whats camel toe cheese got to do with the sea— ian tindale  may 23 2006both can make you nauseous— zentom  may 23 2006and contain sand— harderthanjesus  may 23 2006and then why arent we making ice cream with this camelmammelmilk esp with the acrobat dolphins turning tricks— xandram  may 23 2006ive been milking dolphins since the day i was born— sleeka  may 23 2006i think i missed the bit where tony jaguar suggested we all take pot shots at him cut the new guy a little slack this isnt an intrinsically stupid idea hes not throw his teddy out of the pram at the slightest provocation so we go for him based on a single spelling error in the idea please— davidscothern  may 23 2006teddy out of the pram i had to look that up and i still dont know what it means— sleeka  may 23 2006im going to avoid commenting on your rather odd capitalisation and instead give you a bun it may have been done here before but not in the real world and id eat it— wagster  may 23 2006thanks for the title change all it needs now is some appropriate capitalisation what dr curry said— texticle  may 23 2006 tony jaguar are you related to rods tiger — neilp  may 24 2006true years ago you guys were very hard on me with my first idea and it wasnt nearly as bad as this one hahaha im sorry tony jaguar i like the title of your idea it makes me think of a tuna brand in the states called chicken of the sea maybe thats where you got the idea from— pericles  may 24 2006i think everyones being too hard on tj there are certainly some applications where a fishy cheese would be a good thing think caesar salad anchovies and parmesan with lettuce hey maybe we could use fish gut fertilizer in theahhh never mind— rm brz  may 24 2006id like to see you fing the teat of an animal mammel as streamlined as a dolphin also they would have to be milked underwater how would you keep the milk separate from the saltwater dolphin nipple cathader— jellydoughnut  may 26 2006dolphin nipple catheter i feel an album title coming on— wagster  may 26 2006i bet a succesful marketing strategy consists in persuading the public that dolphin milk increases iq since dolphins are the most inteligent mammals on the planet like that time everyone was convinced they wont get cancer thanks to eating sharkcartilage pillsyou could call it milky q uhmmm im starting to like it changes neutral to  tony jaguar please do yourshelf a flavour and spellcheck your text before pressing the ok buton next time just paste it into word or samething than paste it back into the annotation window end press the buton ok — sweet  may 27 2006theres some law of the universe that says any anno about spelling or grammar will contain at least one error itself isnt there anyway im curious about xandrams dolphin prostitutes maybe theyre not so intelligent after all if they have to resort to turning tricks to make a living— bunsen honeydew  may 27 2006did buton pass the spellcheck— po  may 27 2006since dolphins are the most inteligent mammals on the planet i suppose that can be supported by the fact that noone has ever seen a dolphin that made a spelling mistake— ling  may 27 2006have we done human cheese yet— epicproblem  may 28 2006uh yeah human male cheese to be peculiar— reensure  may 28 2006cheese from different land mammals now sea mammals i guess the next obvious choice is a tossup between airborne mammals and subterranean mammals im preemptively putting bat cheese and mole cheese into the public domain hopefully to circumvent more of these dumb echoes— texticle  may 28 2006imagine flying squirrels with such wide flight membranes that they can live underwater with all that oxygen transport surface then make cheese from their milki only support dolphin crafted dolphin cheese from dolphin cheese makerstranslation if the dolphin knowingly makes the cheese from voluntary milk id support the idealet them roam as they will— beanangel  feb 18 2008mmmmmm bat cheese i cant wait— wc w  feb 19 2008while this actually does appeal to me i must say that i think its an aberration to consume the milk from any other than ones own species which for us should be homo sapiens perhaps the  sapiens has something to do with  sapping the life of helpless baby creatures to further our own selfish ends we should mass market human milk that might be delicious it could come in halfpint containers and cost 5999 us on the carton could be a picture of breasts— gabrielsnew  feb 19 2008
