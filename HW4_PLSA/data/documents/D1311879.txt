sulfites are a big issue if you are experiencing cfsfms symptoms you should be aware of how they work and how they can affect you how sulfites can hurt you sulfites can hurt you if your protective sulfite oxidase enzyme a chemical that converts one chemical to another chemical is low sulfite oxidase converts sulfites to sulfates which are not harmful if your sulfite oxidase enzyme is down the sulfites will swim around your blood and inhibit important enzymes such as tyrosinase polyphenoloxidase and ascorbate oxidase this can result in the impairment of the synthesis of dopamine and the conversion of dopamine to noradrenaline which can lead to neurological fatigue sulfites can inhibit 90 of lung atp energy production can impair liver cell atp energy production and can deplete glutathione chemical that helps the liver filter the blood and helps protect cell enzymes from damage anything that reduces your production of atp energy can cause fatigue since low levels of energy are synonymous with fatigue things that can inhibit your protective sulfite oxidase enzyme things that can impair the protective sulfite oxidase are as follows heavy metal molecules such as lead and mercury sulfadrugs eg a class of drugs within the sulfa group that can impair pterin synthesis such as asthmatic inhalants and many antibiotics molybdenum deficiency protoixporphyria enzyme that makes blood inhibited inherited genetic damage encoding of the soenzyme severe b12vitamin deficiency and arrays of so2so3group containing drugs including dmps an rx chelation drug how to live safely in summary if one wants to be safe they should avoid things that inhibit the protective sulfite oxidase enzyme eg sulfa drugs heavy metals and if this protective enzyme does go down then avoid the sulfites themselves signs of a sulfite problem below are several clues that one is sensitive to sulfites which probably means the sulfite oxidase enzyme is down 1 one becomes tired after ingesting one of the foods listed above that contains sulfites one can look at the food label to see if the product contains sulfites 2 one coughs after ingesting sulfites due to the impairment of the lung atp energy 3 one has asthma 4 one develops low blood glucose sugar after ingesting sulfites since sulfites disrupt the regulation of blood sugar 5 one gets a headache after ingesting sulfites brain fog 6 one experiences itching and reddening of the skin after ingesting sulfites contained in foods drinks or drugs foods that sometimes contain sulfites sulfites are a kind of food preservative the following is a list of foods that sometimes contain sulfite preservatives dried fruit bottled lemon juice bottled lime juice red wine molasses sourcrout juice grape juice all colors and yellow die 5 found in doritos foods that sometimes contain sulfites in lesser amounts are mashed potatoes made from dry powder pickles in a jar shrimp cookies crackers beet sugar and pie dough if a food contains more than 10ppm parts per million of sulfite the fda requires that the product label list the amount of sulfite in some cases molybdenum b12vitamin p5pvitamin b1vitamin and tetrahydrofolate supplementation has helped to boost the protective sulfite oxidase a bit also if mercury or lead molecules have induced protoporphoria enzyme that makes blood inhibited detoxifying those heavy metals can help as well in some cases the protoporphoria is inherited and this is considered incurable at this time in any case if the protective sulfite oxidase is down one can make a great difference by avoiding sulfite containing foods thiosulfate  2 glutathione sulfite  glutathione disulfide  sulfide thus the two substrates of this enzyme are thiosulfate and glutathione whereas its 3 products are sulfite glutathione disulfide and sulfide this enzyme belongs to the family of transferases specifically the sulfurtransferases which transfer sulfurcontaining groups the systematic name of this enzyme class is thiosulfatethiol sulfurtransferase other names in common use include glutathionedependent thiosulfate reductase sulfane reductase and sulfane sulfurtransferase this enzyme participates

molybdenum is known to function as a cofactor for four enzymes sulfite oxidase catalyzes the transformation of sulfite to sulfate a reaction that is necessary for the metabolism of sulfurcontaining amino acids methionine and cysteine xanthine oxidase catalyzes the breakdown of nucleotides precursors to dna and rna to form uric acid which contributes to the plasma antioxidant capacity of the blood aldehyde oxidase and xanthine oxidase catalyze hydroxylation reactions that involve a number of different molecules with similar chemical structures xanthine oxidase and aldehyde oxidase also play a role in the metabolism of drugs and toxins mitochondrial amidoxime reducing component m arc was described only recently 4 and its precise function is under investigation initial studies showed that m arc forms a threecomponent enzyme system with cytochrome b5 and nadh cytochrome b5 reductase that catalyzes the detoxification of mutagenic nhydroxylated bases molybdenum functions only in the form of the moco in humans any disturbance of moco metabolism can disrupt the function of all molybdoenzymes current understanding of the essentiality of molybdenum in humans is based largely on the study of individuals with very rare inborn metabolic disorders caused by a deficiency in moco moco is synthesized de novo by a multistep metabolic pathway involving four genes mocs1 mocs2 mocs3 and

be used as a way to assess sulfite processing sulfites are converted to sulfates by suox which uses b12 and molybdenum in the reaction if sulfate levels are high it may indicate that sulfite levels were too high and you want to be sure that you have enough b12 and molybdenum support in place such that the levels of molybdenum and b12 are not depleted in the process of converting sulfites to sulfates also high sulfites by default high sulfates is an indication that you may have too much activity via the transulfuration pathway and so you do not yet have the methylation cycle in balance there are three enzymes in the body that need molybdenum sulfite oxidase suox xanthine oxidase and aldehyde oxidase xanthine oxidase helps to convert intermediates to uric acid milk that has been homogenized increases the level of xanthine oxidase in the milk this may be a more subtle aspect of dairy free diets to limit excess xanthine oxidase in the system too much xanthine oxidase like increased sulfite oxidase activity runs the risk of depleting molybdenum finally aldehyde oxidase is involved in addressing yeast candida in the body the net effect of homogenized milk  candida  high levels of sulfites is to increase the activity through these three molybdenum containing enzymes and potentially deplete levels of important intermediates high levels of overall sulfur in the body can trigger the cortisol stress reaction there are entire ppts i have given on the topic of stress also high levels of sulfur groups in general can exacerbate other situations in the body with excess glutamate and throw off the epinephrinenorepineprhine ratio one of the consequences of sulfite toxicity is the depletion of b1 vitamin in the body b1 is also known as thiamine casein is one of the ways to protect vitamin b1 from destruction by sulfites supplementation with benfotiamine can also be considered in order to help support healthy vitamin b1 levels especially when sulfite toxicity is a concern tungsten in the system may impair important sulfite oxidase enzyme function those with higher levels of tungsten in the system may have a greater issue with sulfites and may want to support with forms of b1 in addition sulfite oxidase also needs sufficient molybdenum and b12 in the system for optimal function so those with higher tungsten levels may also want to consider molybdenum and b12 support to summarize in my opinion the issue with high sulfates is three fold one it indicates high levels of sulfites and excess transulfuration activity two it suggests that molybdenum and b12 may be depleted from the system and three that the cortisol reaction and imbalances in norepepi may be a factor due to high total levels of sulfur containing groups thiamine has a halflife of 18 days and is quickly exhausted particularly when metabolic demands exceed intake thiamine is involved in a variety of glucose metabolismrelated and neurological functions after modification in the body to a

regeneration of methionine from homocysteine the overall reaction transforms 5methyltetrahydrofolate into tetrahydrofolate thf while transferring a methyl group to hcy to form met methionine synthase is the only mammalian enzyme that metabolizes n5me thf to regenerate the active cofactor thf in cobalamindependent forms of the enzyme the reaction proceeds by two steps in a pingpong reaction the enzyme is initially primed into a reactive state by the transfer of a methyl group from n5me thf to co i in enzymeboundcobalamin forming methylcobalamin that now contains meco iii and activating the enzyme then a hcy that has coordinated to an enzymebound zinc to form a reactive thiolate reacts with the mecob the activated methyl group is transferred from mecob to the hcy thiolate which regenerates co i in cob and met is released from the enzyme the cobindependent mechanism follows the same general pathway but with a direct reaction between the zinc thiolate and n5me thf the mechanism of the enzyme depends on the constant regeneration of co i in cob but this is not always guaranteed instead every 12000 catalytic turnovers the co i may be oxidized into co ii which would permanently shut down catalytic activity a separate protein methionine synthase reductase catalyzes the regeneration of co ii and the restoration of enzymatic activity because this process inevitably shuts down all methionine synthase activity defects or deficiencies in methionine synthase reductase have been implicated in some of the disease associations for methionine synthase deficiency cysteine and cystine as the functional group of the amino acid cysteine the thiol group plays a very important role in biology when the thiol groups of two cysteine residues as in monomers or constituent units are brought near each other in the course ofproteinfolding an oxidation reaction can generate a cystine unit with a disulfide bond ss disulfide bonds can contribute to a proteins tertiary structure if the cysteines are part of the same peptide chain or contribute to thequaternary structureof multiunit proteins by forming fairly strong covalent bonds between different peptide chains a physical manifestation of cysteinecystine equilibrium is provided by hair straightening technologies sulfhydryl groups in the active site of an enzyme can form noncovalent bonds with the enzymes substrate as well contributing to covalent catalytic activity in catalytic triads active site cysteine residues are the functional unit in cysteine protease catalytic triads cysteine residues
