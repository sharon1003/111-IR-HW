beck ulrich — the cosmopolitan vision posted on 28 november 2008 by dr frank ejby poulsen work cited beck ulrich the cosmopolitan vision cambridge polity press 2006 summary of the introduction the introduction opens with the opposition cosmopolitanismpatriotism today this old debate is over because the human condition has become cosmopolitan 2cosmopolitanism is no more a controversial rational idea the “cosmopolitan outlook” “global sense a sense of boundarylessness an everyday historically alert reflexive awareness of ambivalences in a milieu of blurring differentiations and cultural contradictions it reveals not just the ‘anguish’ but also the possibility of shaping one’s life and social relations under conditions of cultural mixture it is simultaneously a sceptical disillusioned selfcritical outlook” 3examples cosmopolitan identities “one constructs a model of one’s own identity by dipping freely into the lego set of globally available identities and building a progressively inclusive selfimage the result is a patchwork quasicosmopolitan but simultaneously provincial identity whose central characteristic is its rejection of traditional relations of responsibility” 5 good example of the “bothand” that replaced the “eitheror” of methodological nationalism cosmopolitan empathy “globalization of emotions” 56 five interconnected constitutive principles of the cosmopolitan outlook the principle of the experience of crisis in world society “civilisational community of fate”the principle of recognition of cosmopolitan differences and the resulting cosmopolitan conflict character the principle of cosmopolitan empathy and of perspectivetaking the principle of the impossibility of living in a world society and the impulsion to rebuild old walls the mélange principle local and cosmopolitan cultures and traditions interpenetrate intermingle difference between globalization and cosmopolitanisation globalization is onedimensional as economic globalization cosmopolitanisationis multidimensional it has irreversibly changed the historical nature of social worlds three examples of cosmopolitans based on munich three writers from munich write in distinct traditions of “rooted cosmopolitanism” that have both “roots” and “wings” thomas mann national cosmopolitanism rejects in reflections of a nonpolitical man the alternative nationalism versus internationalism and formulates the position of a national cosmopolitanism although he is aware of the “inbuilt ambivalences” 11lion feuchtwanger germanjewish cosmopolitanism against the arbitrary administrative boundary one is born that determines who are friends and enemies oskar maria graf catholic cosmopolitanism from tolstoy’s christianity and patriotism he quotes “if men would only finally grasp that they are not children of some fatherland but of god the father” 13 he puts “the world must become provincial only then will it become human”“what then does the cosmopolitan outlook signify it does not herald the first rays of universal brotherly love among peoples or the dawn of the world republic or a freefloating global outlook or compulsory xenophilia nor is cosmopolitanism a kind of supplement that is supposed to replace nationalism and provincialism for the very good reason that the ideas of human rights and democracy need a national base rather the cosmopolitan outlook means that in a world of global crisis and dangers produced by civilisational and international us and them lose their validity and a new cosmopolitan realism becomes essential to survival” 1314critique beck is building on his conception of “second modernity” and the “reflexive condition” it entails as expounded in his famous risk society and developed in the sequel world risk society and what is globalization in a nutshell the present condition is reflexive and as such everything is constructed including “reality” as such there are no fixed identities since they are socially constructed the first modernity characterised by realism and a primary scientization with rationalism and the enlightenment is replaced by a “reflexive scientization” based on constructivism as such science is equally altering the reality is attempts to describe and understand methodological cosmopolitanism is perceived as a better tool for describing this second modernity where globalisation — the movement produced by a world economy and increasing individualisation — have replaced the industrial society with a world risk society in consecutive articles and in this book beck elaborates on what he understands as cosmopolitanism and develops the concept of “cosmopolitan realism” he takes distance from “philosophical cosmopolitanism” but in the end the project of a cosmopolitan sociology may just be the wishful thinking for normatively imposing a cosmopolitan project through “science” for that cosmopolitanism is opposed to nationalism which is the basis for analysing the first modernity through the prism of the nationstate cosmopolitanism is also differentiated from globalization which is a process of uniformization of the world around western capitalistic values cosmopolitanism also have “enemies” in all forms of sectarian particularism or uniformism or violent universalism all in all cosmopolitanism appears as “the good thing” that everyone should embrace i am not particularly unsympathetic to cosmopolitanism but i think that a number of contradictions should be resolved first and most importantly this methodological cosmopolitanism claims to be opposed to nationalism because different from methodological nationalism however it is based on the same hidden mechanisms of thought basically it is just replacing the nationsociety on the “local” level we now know with a global level everything we know in the nationstate is transferred to a global and transnational level is cosmopolitanism synonymous with global then why not call it globalism well because globalism is too close to globalization which is a bad thing cosmopolitanism refers to something more positive at least in our contemporary western culture this is the reason why the study of globalization could not lead to the introduction of a globalism philosophy whereas cosmopolitanism as a philosophy seems to lead to the introduction of the study of “cosmopolitanization”my personal research project is actually to understand where our perception of cosmopolitanism as opposed to nationalism comes from and why is cosmopolitanism associated with travel my contention is that these two conceptions are not necessarily obvious to cosmopolitanism first the opposition between nationalism and cosmopolitanism appeared when nationalism became a socially embedded discourse in the second half of the nineteenth century and cosmopolitanism was thus constructed as the significant “other” to nationalism as negative and opposed to the good values of nationalism this cosmopolitanism can hence be called a “nationalcosmopolitanism” since it is constructed inside the national paradigm second the idea that cosmopolitanism is related to travel and the “citizen of the world” as a globetrotter is situated in eighteenth century europe when the “grand tour” was a must for all educated citizen or aristocrat it was popularised by eg oliver goldsmith’s the citizen of the world in britain or fougeret de monbron’s le cosmopolite ou le citoyen du monde in france which famous opening sentence served as an inspiration to byron in childe harold as the epigraph runs the universe is a kind of book of which one has only read the first page when one has only seen one’s native land i’ve leafed through a number of them and have found them all equally bad this examination has not proved fruitless i hated my country all the impertinences of the diverse peoples among which i have lived has reconciled me to it further readings”toward a new critical theory with a cosmopolitan intent”
