in armor defense items purchasable items armor view source share pieces of armor are items that reduce the amount of damage a player takes by increasing the players defense all armor is either crafted at a workbench at an anvil purchased from npcs or dropped from monsters an accessory can also give 4 defense each with the reforge warding adding up to 20 extra defense armor items will not grant any defense when placed in the social slots although aesthetic effects created by the armor will still occur this does not include light given off from the mining helmet as of pc 11 chest plates of female player characters will differ in appearance from male characters by removal of the abdomen part however the helmet and leggings will look the same calculations the damage reduction is equal to half of the total defense of the armor worn rounded up to the nearest whole number however the damage taken can never be reduced to less than one point on a critical hit the damage is doubled after defense is taken into account ex wood armor full set  3 defense  2  2 always rounding up  2 less damage taken alphabetical list of all armor sets adamantite armor ancient cobalt armor ancient shadow armor bee
