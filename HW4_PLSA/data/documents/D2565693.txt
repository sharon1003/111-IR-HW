productive says dr pollack once hes cooled down tell him that youd really like to address the problem so you can work on it together if he still pulls away say i understand it may take some time but when is good for you to talk about it this allows him to choose the time and the place on his own terms meaning hell feel more in control and be more likely to share his feelings7 of 10getty images its a game of giveandtakemaybe its an emotional defense mechanism but when our relationship starts to feel too onesided it makes me less likely to open up to her — dave 40 syracuse nyget him to open up try saying you seem more distant whats up this shows that you realize that he has been present in the past and gives him an opportunity to state that he feels he has been taken for granted instead of giving him the laundry list of all the things you do to take care of the household and the family try addressing his feelings by saying can you tell me when you feel like i stopped giving my half doing this keeps him from being defensive and gets him to talk about it so he feels like youre part of a team again says dr pollack8 of 10getty images dont try to change himi shut down when i feel

get a man to change is to not ask him to change but to say i love the fact that you do this and this — things you know he sees as his core values — and then mention something that he doesnt do but that youd like him to do without directly asking that he do it says dr pollack if hes shutting off one of your interactions can be i love what you usually do insert something that reflects who he is here so why did you stop he may say well you always want me to stop doing this and be someone else and you dont like me as a person you can respond i love who you are as a person and thats the most important thing to me by telling him what you adore and appreciate youll encourage him to take a risk and try something new without shutting down9 of 10getty images try to see where hes coming from reallyi shut down when i feel frustrated that no matter what i say she will not see my point of view and when i feel that if i keep on talking it will only make things worse i back away to cut my losses and to keep the conversation from going even more wrong than it already has — dan 42 newburyport maget him to open up if youre having an argument and your husband pulls away wait a few minutes and say whats up why have you stopped talking if he cant explain it do something together that he enjoys and amidst the activity say maybe your point and mine are a little different so lets talk about it hell be much more open to another point of view when he is in action mode — rather than sitting around and chatting10 of 10getty images give him what he wants — and needsi begin to pull away when im not getting my needs met even after ive expressed to her what i want if she tells me what she wants and needs ill do all that i can to give it to her so i want her to do the same thing for me — kyle 34 jersey city njget him to open up he may think hes expressed what he wants but she may not know it because he may not have been speaking her language says dr pollack this man is more vulnerable than he wants to feel so you have to reach out across the divide if he starts to pull away ask him whether theres something he wanted but isnt getting and let him know that he can tell you what he desires hell realize that it is still just as good if he gets what he wants after vocalizing it — rather than you trying to read his mind — and eventually youll understand more easily and be able to give him more of what he needs without him having to say it next what hes really thinking after 1 5 and 10 years of marriage
