africa anthony likes making small talk with korean cabbies – the best language instructors you don’t have to pay for – and avoiding having to be the one who calls for pizza even if you’re learning korean it’ll probably be a few weeks before you get past the chapters on hangeul saying “ hello my name is john i am a foreigner ” and asking for a discount at the traditional market useful lessons all you might think but i’m living here now how do i ask the old lady in the restaurant where the bathroom is or tell her i’m allergic to shrimp one way to learn this stuff is to find a korean coworker or friend and just ask them but honestly their explanations can be spotty marred by weak english skills or general shyness what you really need is a survival cheat sheet with those words and phrases that are so fundamental that no one ever bothers to mention them well here’s hoping that this can be that…notes on pronunciation bear in mind that the korean language has almost nothing in common with english – and that includes sounds what korean guides might describe to you as an “a” sound is going to be slightly different in korean when speaking korean try to imitate the accents and sounds of the koreans around you – just quit the accent when you come back to english please korean language follows a different rhythmic structure than english where english tends to be strongly inflected and stressed korean is the opposite try to give every syllable of a korean word the same amount of stress as every other it’s not annyeonghaseyo nor annyeonghaseyo but annyonghasseyo one common exception is the last syllable of the vowel which is often elongated and given a rising inflection kamsahamnidaa aaif a korean syllable has a final consonant that consonant is barely pronounced almost to the point of being a glottal stop this difference is responsible for a lot of the pronunciation problems koreans have with english and english speakers with korean pleasantries1 hellogoodbye – 안녕하세요 – annyeonghaseyo an obvious one but a necessary inclusion this is almost certainly the most common phrase anyone in korea will use there are dozens of variations to account for slightly different situations and levels of respect and it can all get really complicated the simple solution is just to say it really fast and slur all the syllables together everyone will understand you and you’ll sound like a real local in that way you can also use this for both hello and goodbye typical situation absolutely any meeting greeting arriving departing entering a store sighting someone you barely know across the street or addressing an entire school of 1200 students 12 hours after stepping off a plane bonus variation for situations requiring a high degree of respect such as meeting your boss speak more clearly annyeonghashyeosumnika2 nice to meet you – 반갑습니다 – bangapsumnida the most pleasant of pleasantries apply liberally whenever you find yourself suddenly introduced to a curious

be to shout “nice to meet you” whenever they see you typical situation after three days at this school you think you’ve met everyone from the principal to the janitor until someone you don’t recognize approaches you with arm outstretched bow shake hands “반갑습니다”3 thank you – 감사합니다 – kamsahamnida this is probably the bare minimum for making any attempt at korean use it exactly as you would its

to wait5 i’m sorry – 최성합니다미안합니다 – chwayseonghamnidamianhamnida there are two ways to say sorry in korean the first is a “sorry i bumped into you” kind of sorry while the second is more of a “i’m
