maternal adaptations to pregnancy hematologic changes author kenneth a bauer md section editor charles j lockwood md mhcm deputy editors kristen eckler md facog jennifer s tirnauer mdintroductionnormal pregnancy is characterized by profound changes in almost every organ system to accommodate the growing fetoplacental unit during pregnancy the womans body expands its plasma volume provides oxygen vitamins and minerals for the developing fetus and prepares for the hemostatic challenges encountered during delivery the clinician must distinguish the anticipated physiologic changes from pregnancyrelated complications that require specific interventions this topic discusses physiologic changes in blood volume blood cells and hemostasis during pregnancy cardiovascular and vascular changes associated with pregnancy and hematologic complications of pregnancy are discussed in separate topic reviews● see maternal adaptations to pregnancy cardiovascular and hemodynamic changes  ● see treatment of iron deficiency anemia in adults section on pregnancy  ● see approach to the adult with unexplained neutropenia  to continue reading this article you must log in with your
