how much weight is needed for my pinewood derby car the maximum weight limit for a pinewood derby car is 50 ounces your car should weigh 50oz to be competitive the car block weighs between 15oz and 35oz depending on your car design so plan on adding roughly between 1 and 3 ounces which allows 5oz for wheels and axles the more weight your car has the more inertia it has and this extra inertia will make your car faster through the flatter part of the track to the finish line how to add weight to a pinewood derby car select the type of weight based on your car design and your budget cut out your car put your car axles and wheels on a scaleput weights on the scale until it reaches 49oz insert or attach your weights paint your car and make minor adjustments to weights to get to 50oz your weights should be toward the rear of the car to get the optimal center of gravity about 1 in front of the rear axles see our guide for how to make a fast pinewood derby car for more speed tips what are the best weights for a pinewood derby car pinewood derby weights come in a variety of sizes such as 38 round cylinder weights and 14 cube weights that can be hidden inside the car stickon wieghts that can be placed anywhere on your car or screwon weights screwed to the bottom of your car weights also come in a variety of materials such as zinc lead and tungsten these materials have different densities and costs lead is dense and inexpensive but it is toxic so we do not sell lead weights zinc is inexpensive and nontoxic but it is not very dense so it takes up lots of space on your car our new composite flex weights are a steel alloy that can be cut with a scissors flex weights are nontoxic easy to handle and inexpensive but like zinc they take up a lot of space tungsten is nontoxic and 17 times denser than lead so tungsten is the best weight for pinewood derby cars but it is the most expensive for more information about tungsten read our guide about the advantages of tungsten weights  plan on adding 1 to 35 oz of weight to your car depending on your car design and the weight of your pine wood block a chunky car design has more wood so it needs less weight a thin small car design has less wood so it needs more weight the best way to get the exact weight for your car is to make your completed car 48 to 49oz then add small incremental weights to get the exact weight you need the best type of weights to add small amounts are stickon zinc or flex weights tungsten putty or tungsten bbs my preference is drilling small holes in the bottom of the car and using tungsten putty because it is dense so you can easily add or subtract small amounts then if you need to remove small amounts of weight on checkin it is very simple to pull some putty out consider purchasing
