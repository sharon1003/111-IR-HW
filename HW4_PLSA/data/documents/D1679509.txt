his death jesus christ brought his disciples to caesarea philippi where he revealed to his disciples for the first time that he was indeed the jewish messiah the city of caesarea philippi also known as ancient paneas was situated way in the north about 30 miles past the sea of galilee on a terrace at the foot of mount hermon on its southern slope about 1150 feet above sea level the area had an unusually beautiful setting it was very lush and full of life and it has always been one of the main sources of the jordan river josephus saying that it was the chief source the ancient canaanites built a sanctuary to baal at paneas the greeks and romans both built sanctuaries there because of the cave of pan inside the cave was a seemingly bottomless pit with an unlimited quantity of water which made the pagans marvel paneas was a peculiarly remarkable place in its natural appearance with a sweeping view of the upper jordan river valley josephus considered it the main source of nthe jordan river and the ancient greeks claimed the water that fed the jordan actually flowed from the nearby cave later josephus reported that an earthquake altered the area so the water source changed to underground springs in front of the cave the area produced a lush oasis of life and overlooked the very fertile northern portion of the jordan river valley it was located near the city of dan 4 miles to the east near a trade road coming from the western phoenician ports of tyre and sidon to damascus which was about 40 miles to the northeast the place of jesus great revelation caesarea philippi was mentioned only twice in the bible both referring to the same event where jesus chose to reveal to his disciples that he was the messiah he also announced his coming death in jerusalem and the end of his earthly ministry and beginning of theirs it is a mystery why jesus shose this place to reveal who he was to his disciples so far north of the sea of galilee yet there are some interesting clues caesarea philippi was the location the cave of pan the place of the pagan gate of hades it was in this area that the first king of israel jeroboam led the northern kingdom of israel into idolatry this was also the same place where the greeks and romans received revelations from the god pan who was mentioned in classical writings as a seer or fortune teller and a giver of revelations at caesarea philippi jesus turned to his disciples and asked them who the multitudes thought he was they responded that some thought he was john the baptist some elijah and others jeremiah or one of the prophets then jesus asked them who they thought he was and peter answered you are the christ the son of the living god matthew 161516 jesus blessed peter and revealed to them upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hades shall not prevail against it matthew 1618painting of the sanctuary of pan in the first century ad reconstruction painting of the sanctuary of pan at

amazing because of many reasons the waters flowed out of the cave and fed the jordan river there was a bottomless pit inside that contained so much water that it could not be measured the place was so striking that it impressed alexander the great and the greeks built a sanctuary there natural features not only impressed the greeks but they believed them to be a dwelling place of the gods and nothing produced more awe and terror than a place identified as a cave where the god pan dwelt he was responsible for the scary noises in the forest and many mysteries were associated with him that brought great fear the romans were heavily influenced by the greeks and they followed many of their religious traditions today the cave can be seen by any tourist in israel the cave in modern times

most beautiful temple of the whitest stone in zenodoruss country near the place called panium panias caesarea philippi this is a very fine cave in a mountain under which there is a great cavity in the earth and the cavern is abrupt and prodigiously deep and full of a still water over it hangs a vast mountain and under the caverns arise the springs of the river jordan herod adorned this place which

additional country he built there also a temple of white marble hard by the fountains of jordan the place is called panium panias caesarea philippi where is a top of a mountain that is raised to an immense height and at its side beneath or at its bottom a dark cave opens itself within which there is a horrible precipice that decends abruptly to a vast depth it contains a mighty quantity of water which is immovable and when anybody lets down anything to measure the depth of the earth beneath the water no length of cord is sufficient to reach it now the fountains of jordan rise at the roots of this cavity outwardly and as some think this is the utmost origin of jordan  josephus wars of the jews 1213coin of the sanctuary of pan in the first century ad judaea caesarea panias bronze coin from

lay at the siege of jerusalem did vespasian go on board a merchantship and sailed from alexandria to rhodes whence he sailed away in ships with three rows of oars and as he touched at several cities that lay in his road he was joyfully received by them all and so passed over from ionia into greece whence he set sail from corcyra to the promontory of iapyx whence he took his journey by land but as for titus he marched from that caesarea which lay by the seaside and came to that which is named caesarea philippi and stayed there a considerable time and exhibited all sorts of shows there and here a great number of the captives were destroyed some being thrown to wild beasts and others in multitudes forced to kill one another as if they were their enemies josephus wars 721again josephus reports while titus was at caesarea philippi he solemnized the birthday of his brother domitian after a splendid manner and inflicted a great deal of the punishment intended for the jews in honor of him for the number of those that were now slain in fighting with the beasts and were burnt and fought with one another exceeded two thousand five hundred yet did all this seem to the romans when they were

ancient greek name of caesarea philippi its modern name is banias pan in greek mythology paneas was named after the god pan in greek mythology the son of hermes who played the pipes his appearance was like a man with a goats legs a tail and sometimes horns he was also known to make scary noises in the forests mount hermon mount hermon is 9100 feet above sea level and is the highest mountain in israel and it is also the highest mountain in syria most of the year mount hermon can be seen with snow on its peak below the snow line there were forests with bears leopards and wolves with pine

transfiguration happened either on mount hermon or on nearby mount tabor which was seven miles to the south of caesarea philippi there are many reasons to believe that it took place at mount hermon for example the connection to hermes the father of pan the history of the canaanites with mount hermon stories in jewish apocryphal literature such as the book of i enoch 1216 and the testament of levi 27 which are very similar to matthews account very interesting to read nonetheless according to the book of enoch the peak of mount hermon was the spot where the fallen angels first touched the
