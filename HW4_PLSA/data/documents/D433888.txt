type of pollen  1back to ragweed with a capability to grow in all sorts of conditions ragweed inflicts its allergy agenda in all 50 states just one plant is capable of producing about one billion grains of pollen in single season research shows just 5 to 20 pollen grains per cubic meter can trigger ragweed allergy symptoms to put that into perspective ragweed pollen grain concentrations

reaction or make existing symptoms worse which is referred to as crossreactivity in the case of pollen and foods the result of crossreactivity is called oral allergy syndrome  5that may seem surprising especially since these things usually fall under the health food category your immune system thinks differently let’s take a closer look at at herbal tea in particular do you ever swap

season people with a ragweed allergy are more likely to become itchy get a runny nose or even experience hives while drinking this type of herbal tea  6and get this if you don’t have allergy symptoms
