first no more discs in the windscreen and now for the first time in 40 years you wont have to hunt down an insurance certificate to buy your car tax either insurance check has been in place for 40 years car tax discs axed last week after almost 100 years insurance now automatically checked against central database government says it will slash red tape for drivers by ray massey for the daily mail published 0439 edt 9 december 2013  updated 2213 edt 9 december 2013183view comments taxing times drivers will no longer have to hunt down their car insurance certificate to buy car tax motorists will no longer need to show their car insurance certificate when taxing their vehicle under new plans to cut red tape for drivers the insurance check when you buy a tax disc has been in place for over 40 years and has led to countless drivers scrabbling for the key insurance document every time their cartax falls due but the change to be announced today by roads minister robert goodwill is part of a package of measures that the government says will save taxpayers up to £8 million every year the government’s driver and vehicle licensing agency dvla said ‘motorists will no longer have to search for their insurance certificates when they tax their cars‘they will still have to have valid insurance but they won’t be asked to show it’police and the authorities can now make automatic online checks on whether a car is covered by crossreferencing the vehicle’s number plate with the dvla and insurance industry databases this means they already know if a driver has insurance or not so there’s no longer a need to make people dig around for bits of paper to prove they have insurance the changes apply whichever way you buy your tax discs  whether at a post office or online via the dvla it comes after chancellor announced in last week’s autumn statement that the traditional paper tax disc  and the need to display one on your windscreen  is being scrapped after nearly a century and for the first time drivers will be able to pay by direct debit more death of the tax disc you wont need one on your windscreen but you still pay six of the most economical family cars money can buy true mpg figures revealed planned fuel duty hike for next year scrapped while rail fare rises will be lower than expected the changes which come into force from next monday also mean that motorists will only need to tell dvla once when they declare their vehicle ‘off the road’ currently motorists who make a statutory off road notification sorn have to renew their sorn every year last year around 4 million ‘sorns’ were made with over 1 million of those repeat renewals the dvla said ‘we’re also getting rid of the need to tell dvla that your vehicle is off the road every year currently if you declare sorn that only lasts 12 months and then you have to tell us again the changes mean that when you tell us it’s sorn once that’s it until you tax it sell it or scrap it’roads minister robert goodwill said ‘we want to make it as easy as possible for motorists to access government services getting rid of needless bits of paper making changes to free up motorists’ time while saving money for the taxpayer is all part of our commitment to get rid of unnecessary red tape’the changes to insurance checks have been made possible because dvla regularly checks existing databases for insurance under continuous insurance enforcement rules begun in 2011 dvla’s records are compared regularly with the motor insurance database mid to identify registered keepers of vehicles that have no insurance ashton west chief executive at the motor insurers’ bureau mib said ‘motor insurance remains a legal requirement and these changes recognise the value and importance of the insurance records held centrally on the motor insurance database these changes will bring benefits to millions of motorists’by law motorists must ensure that they have appropriate motor insurance in place the continuous insurance enforcement cie scheme to tackle uninsured motorists was launched in june 2011 under the scheme it is an offence to be the keeper of an uninsured vehicle information is cross checked between the motor insurance database mid and dvla keeper records lucy burnford founder of motorietycouk the online moneysaving and car management platform for motorists said its high time the government hauled the motoring industry into the digital age making the tax disc system electronic should result in a massive decrease in the number of motorists who get stung with fines of up to £80 – more if they get clamped or impounded – through sheer absentmindedness most people dont mean to break the law the move towards an electronic tax system acknowledges the longstanding issue of car admin and paperwork that has blighted car owners for years its a win for motorists who already facing extortionate prices at the pumps need easier ways to manage the other financial pressures of car ownership too the more ways we can help motorists with the automation of car ownership and maintenance the better the government has been saying for a while that it wants a digital by default solution for motorists  better late than never under the continuous insurance enforcement system keepers of vehicles which appear to be uninsured are first sent reminder letters those who take no action receive a fixed penalty notice of £100 followed by enforcement action – wheelclamping impounding and ultimately prosecution by the courts the maximum fine in court is £1000 driving without insurance can land a driver with a fixed penalty of £200 plus six penalty points or prosecution with a maximum fine of £5000 discretionary disqualification and mandatory endorsement of between six and eight penalty points since 2005 the police have had the power to seize uninsured vehicles and in 2011 alone they seized 140000 vehicles the removal of the insurance check applies to motorists in great britain the removal of the need to sorn each year applies to all motorists in the uk drivers and owners can check their vehicle is on the motor insurance database at wwwask midcom advertisement share
