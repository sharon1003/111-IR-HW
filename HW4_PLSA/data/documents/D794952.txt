product rule let f  x and g  x be two functions if the functions f  x and g  x are both differentiable then the product f  fg   x is also differentiable at all x such that proof of product rule the derivative of the function of one variable f  x with respect to x is the function f  x  which is defined as follows since the two functions f  x and g  x are both differentiable general product rule if f 1  x  f 2  x  f 3  x  f n  x are differentiable then f 1  x  f 2  x  f n  x is also differentiable such that example consider the function y  x 2  e 5 x  then the derivative of y with respect to x is obtained below let f  x  x 2 and g  x  e 5 x apply the product rule  fg ′  x  f ′  x g  x  f  x g ′  x  see more calculus topics lesson on product rule product rule  calculus  chegg tutors your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available click here to visit our frequently asked questions about html5 video000  721product rule  calculus  chegg tutors videos related to calculus100tutorial integration by substitution100tutorial volumes of rotation disk method100tutorial volumes of rotation cylinder method show more need more help understanding product rule weve got you covered with our online study tools qa related to product rule experts answer in as little as 30 minutes q 8 85 use partial fractions to evaluate the in tegrals 2r2  3 a 212  dr 3c26x4a see answer q 7 84 use trigonometric substitution to evalu ate the integrals 2v9 42 3 dx o 16232a see answer q in problems 142 find the indefinite integrals and evaluate the definite integrals in some of the problems a particular change of variable is suggested a see answer q use a graphing utility to find the limit 5  x lirnm need help read it talk to a tutor a see answer q the length of the curve 335 72 a b 335 c 335 d find the area enclosed by the given curves 16 y x2 yx2  6 a 32 b 4 c 16 d8 use the substitution formula to evaluate the integral 0 4t 17 35 dt 671 d162 a see answer q find the limit lim 06 need help read it talk to a tutor a see answer q find the horizontal asymptote of the graph of the function if an answer does not exist enter dne 2x2 7xi8 1  4x  12x2  x  need help read it talk to a tutor a see answer q in problems 142 find the indefinite integrals and evaluate the definite integrals in some of the problems a particular change of variable is suggested a see answer q 3r2 a 5m2 157℃ c t2 d 152 10 「3x2  x7dx a 552 b 552 c 276 d  276 find the area of the shaded region 38 c 16 3 a b 12 2 y x3 c41 b c a 13 yx4 4 68 10x a see answer q find lim h x if possible  x 6x2  7x9 a h x4x2 lim h x b h x4x2 x2 lim h x c h xm lim h x need help read i watch it talk to a tutor a see answer see more related qatop calculus solution manuals get stepbystep solutions find stepbystep solutions for your textbook submit see more related calculus textbook solutions
