pop3 vs imap email setup if you use an email app such as outlook or apple mail you’ve probably seen these acronyms before if youve previously used other email services like gmail or mobile me your email client may have simply set up your accounts automatically and you may not have had to think about which set up was right for you your jub jub hosted email account can be set up either way though so it might make sense to decide whether pop3 or imap is best for how you use email once you understand the difference between pop and imap it can actually revolutionize the way you use email—and it can help turn your inbox into an effective productivity tool more and more mobile devices and updated versions of email clients are defaulting to an imap set up when doing an automatic set up so its good to understand what imap is before you get locked into that set up as it may not be the best set up for your email behavior especially on our servers let’s break it down    when someone sends you an email it’s stored on your websites server you can access this new email one of two ways1 pop – using your email app outlook apple mail etc  you can download your email to your computer and then

system for your computer in case you need to retrieve lost or deleted emails is pop the best productivity choice for you if you always access your email from one computer and you have limited online storage capacity or use a dialup connection pop is probably best for you it will save you the hassle of worrying about online storage limits or poor connection speeds just be sure you back up your

prefer this way you could check your email using our webmail application squirrel mail from another location you could also download emails using a mobile device imap – using your email app outlook etc  you can manage your email directly on the mail server rather than downloading it to your computer advantages since the emails are stored on the mail server you can access and manage your email

outlook thunderbird apple mail etc we generally encourage our clients to set up their email clients and mobile devices using pop3 as our servers while very reliable are not infinitely large pop3 makes it easy for users to manage the size of their inboxes on the server thus allowing the user to continue to receive email uninterrupted because email clients can be set to automatically delete email off the server after a set number of days this usually is the best scenario because then the user doesnt have to remember to move email manually from the inbox down to local servers pop3 set up is especially useful to those clients who dont want to incur the extra cost of extra cloud storage or for a hosted exchange set up also cloud based with a pop3 setup users can set their email client to leave email up on our servers and thus still check their email from multiple mobile devices smart phones tablets without having to use the imap set up and easily download and archive their email to one or many local harddrives this makes it very easy for users to archive gigabytes of email for professional reasons which would cost much more under a cloud storage or hosted exchange framework imap
