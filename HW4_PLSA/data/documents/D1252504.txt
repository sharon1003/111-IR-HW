reader approved how to greet people in indonesia okay here you are in indonesia which is right under the equator in southeast asia it is the home of wondrous spices exotic jungles and a smiling people as warm as their tropical climate while many indonesians can communicate in english you can always impress them by greeting them using bahasa indonesia their native tongue steps1 for greetings you can always say a simple ‘hi’ or ‘hello’ in nonformal situations you might say ‘apa kabar’ how are you more formally you might want to use ‘selamat pagi’ in place of good morning ‘selamat siang’ for good afternoon ‘selamat sore’ for good evening and ‘selamat malam’ for good night selamat malam is not used if you want to go to sleep2 note that the e in selamat is not pronounced to pronounce it correctly simply say slamat also its perfectly ok to omit the selamat completely and simply say pagi similar to english where good morning is abbreviated into morning3 if you greet a person using ‘apa kabar ’ how are you  the answer will most likely be ‘baikbaik saja’ or ‘kabar baik’ which means ‘i’m fine thank you’4 bahasa indonesia is usually read and pronounced phonetically say it the way you see it rarely will anyone laugh if you accidentally slip just continue on speaking in your usual accent and youll eventually get it right5 in most polite situations use the honorifics ‘mas’ or ‘pak’ or ‘bu’ or mba spelled embak before a person’s name ‘mas’ meaning one younger than you pak sir or mister can be used to address any male except boys which would be mas ibu is also used everyday such as hai ibu abbreviation is used normally indonesians constantly shorten things bu is an abbreviation of ibu ex mas bayu young male pak mulyawan male formal  bu kartini married female mba elita ms elita while for married females the honorific ibu does not often change you might also hear ‘bapak’ father when a young person speaks to a male who’s clearly older or has higher position ex a person middleaged person named djoko might be addressed as bapak djoko the k and the ng are the only 2 somewhat tricky sounds of bahasa indonesia the former has a dual function sometimes it sounds exactly like the k in english while at other times like in pak it marks a glottal stop a glottal stop is the opposite of the ahhhhsound as you intentionally choke off the air in your throat to end the syllable it sounds like the uh in uhoh the second is the ng combination which produces a velar nasal sound similar to the way you would pronounce sing all that said it is a minor matter that the locals will tolerate until you eventually refine it as you learn more of the language6 the indonesian way for naming does not always use the surname or family name if a person is named ‘arif perdana’ it does not mean his family name is perdana feel free to call him with just ‘pak arif’ some indonesian even named with one single first name without middle name or family name7 don’t be offended if an indonesian you barely know addresses you by your first name indonesian people use first name basis in daily life with whomever they meet the exceptions are married women nobles and royalty8 married women will likely be using their husband’s name but in the way they like use the name she told you when you were introduced to her don’t forget to add ‘buibu’ before you speak her name9 speak in english if you get suddenly stuck and don’t know what to do or to say experience shows that indonesians are very intuitive communicators who can make out what youre trying to say regardless10 smile when you speak indonesians are as a whole open and friendly people smiles will do magic to oil social interactions with them a slight nodbow is also a common practice the bowing should not be equated with subservience but with extreme politeness westerners should not let it bother them youre helping people by reading wiki howwiki hows mission is to help people learn and we really hope this article
