drinkdriving guidelines ever since the introduction of the breathalyser in 1967 official sources have been extremely unwilling to publish any figures on the amount of alcohol you need to consume to take you over the 80 mg legal limit for driving the reason for this is that they feel it will encourage drivers to drink up to the limit but in reality nobody can do that because of the extremely unpredictable rate at which alcohol is absorbed by the body either you play safe and stay well below it or you try to drink up to the limit and run a serious risk of exceeding it of course everyone knows that the law lays down a limit not a prohibition and that a certain amount of alcohol can be consumed without taking drivers outside the law this is expressed in the popular wisdom that the limit equals two pints this can be misleading but contains some truth broadly speaking if a man of average weight consumes two pints of ordinary strength beer of 4 abv or less it is extremely unlikely to take him above the 80 mg legal limit and in reality will probably lead to a maximum bac of no higher than 60 mg the following is an attempt to express this in rather more detail it is drawn from various sources including individuals experiences of being breath tested but the primary source is a booklet entitled the facts about drinking and driving published by the transport and road research laboratory in 1986 which presumably can be regarded as reasonably authoritative however these guidelines are not a statement of fact and must not be taken as a guarantee of keeping below the legal limit in any particular circumstances alcohol is normally measured in units of 10ml of alcohol this is the amount of alcohol contained a a halfpint of beer of 35 abv a single 25ml pub measure of spirits or a small 125ml glass of light table wine the rate of absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream is unpredictable and depends on a number of factors such as the level of hydration the type of alcoholic drink consumed and whether food is eaten at the same time as a broad rule of thumb the alcohol in a drink is fully absorbed about an hour after the drink is finished the rate at which alcohol is metabolised and removed from the bloodstream is rather more predictable and averages out at one unit per hour starting one hour after the first drink is finished however the capacity of the body to metabolise alcohol is finite and is limited to about 1620 units per day if you consistently drink around or above this level you will probably never be below the limit  and you also need to consider seriously whether you have a drink problem to ensure you run no risk of being over the limit immediately before driving men should consume no more than 4 units women no more than 3when drinking the night before driving men should consume no more than 10 units women no more than 7 this assumes that no alcohol is consumed after 1130 pm and that driving does not take place before 8 am the following morningthis applies to people of average weight around 1213 st for men 910 st for women if you are particularly small these figures should be reduced accordingly but if you are particularly big it is no guarantee that they can be increased the figures are lower for women not only because they are usually lighter than men but also because their metabolism is different if you drink more than this it will not guarantee that you will exceed 80 mg as the rate of absorption of alcohol is so unpredictable but even with one unit more you will be running a tangible risk the above figures are the maximum you can consume without any significant risk of exceeding the legal limit and also without resulting in any significant increase in accident risk it is also important to remember that a half pint of beer or a glass of wine can contain considerably more than one unit given that most pubs serve draught beer 5 to 10 under measure it is fairly safe to assume a half of any beer up to around 4 represents one unit but any higher than that and you have to make adjustments a pint of 5 beer is almost three units and even one and a half pints may not quite be safe in 1967 very little beer was available above 4 abv now it is widespread and in some pubs it can be be difficult to find beer below that strength in particular the 33cl bottles of designer lagers that are so popular are usually between 5 and 55 abv meaning that each contains almost two units and any more than two could take a driver above 80 mg the risks with wine are even greater only the very lightest german wines have an abv as low as 8 and many pubs and restaurants serve wine in 175ml or even 250ml glasses rather than 125ml a 175ml glass of wine of 12 abv which is fairly typical represents two units two such glasses could put a smallish woman over the limit whereas two pints of bitter would not do so for an averagesized man an increasing number of pubs are now also serving spirits in 35ml measures containing 14 units rather than 25ml which is exactly one unit if you feel this is all a bit complicated then dont drink anything its very simple and an alcoholic drink will never ever make you a better driver but bear in mind that to be consistent that also means you should drink little or nothing the night before driving its no good making a point of not touching a drop immediately before driving and then having a skinful in the evening and getting in your car the next morning however you want to play it you must look at your overall pattern of alcohol consumption in relation to
