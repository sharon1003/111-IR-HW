monitoring should be undertaken when anticoagulants are prescribed concurrently adjustments in the dose of oral anticoagulants may be necessary to maintain the desired level of anticoagulation allopurinol the concurrent administration of allopurinol and amoxicillin increases the incidence of rashes in patients receiving both drugs as compared to patients receiving amoxicillin alone it is not known whether this potentiation of amoxicillin rashes is due to allopurinol or the hyperuricemia present in these patients oral contraceptives amoxil may affect the gut flora leading to lower estrogen reabsorption and reduced efficacy of combined oral estrogen progesterone contraceptives other antibacterials chloramphenicol macrolides sulfonamides and tetracyclines may interfere with the bactericidal effects of penicillin this has been demonstrated in vitro however the clinical significance of this interaction is not well documented effects on laboratory tests high urine concentrations of ampicillin may result in falsepositive reactions when testing for the presence of glucose in urine using clinitest® benedict s solution or fehlings solution since this effect may also occur with amoxicillin it is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions such as clinistix® be used following administration of ampicillin or amoxicillin to

fatal hypersensitivity anaphylactic reactions have been reported in patients on penicillin therapy including amoxicillin although anaphylaxis is more frequent following parenteral therapy it has occurred in patients on oral penicillins these reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity andor a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens there have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe reactions when treated with cephalosporins before initiating therapy with amoxil careful inquiry should be made regarding previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins cephalosporins or other allergens clostridium difficile associated diarrhea clostridium difficile associated diarrhea cdad has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents including amoxil and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis  treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of c difficile c difficile produces toxins a and b which contribute to the development of cdad hypertoxinproducing strains of c difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy cdad must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use careful medical history is necessary since cdad has been reported to occur over 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents if cdad is suspected or confirmed ongoing antibiotic use not directed against c difficile may need to be discontinued appropriate fluid and electrolyte management protein supplementation antibiotic treatment of c difficile and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated development of drugresistant bacteria prescribing amoxil in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drugresistant bacteria use in patients with mononucleosis a high percentage of patients with mononucleosis who receive amoxicillin develop an erythematous skin rash thus amoxicillin should not be administered to patients with mononucleosis phenylketonurics amoxil chewable tablets contain aspartame which contains phenylalanine each 200 mg chewable tablet contains 182 mg phenylalanine each 400 mg chewable tablet contains 364 mg phenylalanine the oral suspensions of amoxil do not contain phenylalanine and can be used by phenylketonurics nonclinical toxicology carcinogenesis mutagenesis impairment of fertility longterm studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential studies to detect mutagenic potential of amoxicillin alone have not been conducted however the following information is available from tests on a 41 mixture of amoxicillin and potassium clavulanate augmentin augmentin was nonmutagenic in the ames bacterial mutation assay and the yeast gene conversion assay augmentin was weakly positive in the mouse lymphoma assay but the trend toward increased mutation frequencies in this assay occurred at doses that were also associated with decreased cell survival augmentin was negative in the mouse micronucleus test and in the dominant lethal assay in mice potassium clavulanate alone was tested in the ames bacterial mutation assay and in the mouse micronucleus test and was negative in each of these assays in a multigeneration reproduction study in rats no impairment of fertility or other adverse reproductive effects were seen at doses up to 500 mgkg approximately 2 times the 3 g human dose based on body surface area  use in specific populations pregnancy teratogenic effects pregnancy category b reproduction studies have been performed in mice and rats at doses up to 2000 mgkg 3 and 6 times the 3 g human dose based on body surface area there was no evidence of harm to the fetus due to amoxicillin there are however no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response amoxicillin should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed labor and delivery oral ampicillin is poorly absorbed during labor it is not known whether use of amoxicillin in humans during labor or delivery has immediate or delayed adverse effects on the fetus prolongs the duration of labor or increases the likelihood of the necessity for an obstetrical intervention nursing mothers penicillins have been shown to be excreted in human milk amoxicillin use by nursing mothers may lead to sensitization of infants caution should be exercised when amoxicillin is administered to a nursing woman pediatric use because of incompletely developed renal function in neonates and young infants the elimination of amoxicillin may be delayed dosing of amoxil should be modified in pediatric patients 12 weeks or younger  ≤ 3 months see dosage and administrationgeriatric use an analysis of clinical studies of amoxil was conducted to determine whether subjects aged 65 and over respond differently from younger subjects these analyses have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients but a greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out this drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function care should be taken in dose selection and it may be useful to monitor renal function dosing in renal impairment amoxicillin is primarily eliminated by the kidney and dosage adjustment is usually required in patients with severe renal impairment gfr  30 m lmin see dosing in renal impairment for specific recommendations in

discontinue medication treat symptomatically and institute supportive measures as required a prospective study of 51 pediatric patients at a poisoncontrol center suggested that overdosages of less than 250 mgkg of amoxicillin are not associated with significant clinical symptoms interstitial nephritis resulting in oliguric renal failure has been reported in a small number of patients after overdosage with amoxicillin 1 crystalluria in some cases leading to renal failure has also been reported after amoxicillin overdosage in adult and pediatric patients in case of overdosage adequate fluid intake and diuresis should be maintained to reduce the risk of amoxicillin crystalluria renal impairment appears to be reversible with cessation of drug administration high blood levels may occur more readily in patients with impaired renal function because of decreased renal clearance of amoxicillin amoxicillin may be removed from circulation by hemodialysis contraindicationsamoxil is

absorption of amoxicillin from the tablets and suspension of amoxil has been partially investigated 400mg and 875mg formulations have been studied only when administered at the start of a light meal orally administered doses of 250mg and 500mg amoxicillin capsules result in average peak blood levels 1 to 2 hours after administration in the range of 35 mcgm l to 50 mcgm l and 55 mcgm l to 75 mcgm

concentrations occurred approximately 1 hour after the dose distribution amoxicillin diffuses readily into most body tissues and fluids with the exception of brain and spinal fluid except when meninges are inflamed in blood serum amoxicillin is approximately 20 proteinbound following a 1gram dose and utilizing a special skin window technique to determine levels of the antibiotic it was noted that therapeutic levels were found in the interstitial fluid metabolism and excretion the halflife of amoxicillin is 613 minutes approximately 60 of an orally administered dose of amoxicillin is excreted in the urine within 6 to 8 hours detectable serum levels are observed up to 8 hours after an orally administered dose of amoxicillin since most of the amoxicillin is excreted unchanged in the urine its excretion can be delayed by concurrent administration of probenecid see drug interactions  microbiology mechanism of action amoxicillin is similar to penicillin in its bactericidal action against susceptible bacteria during the stage of active multiplication it acts through the inhibition of cell wall biosynthesis that leads to the death of the bacteria mechanism of resistance resistance to amoxicillin is mediated primarily through enzymes called betalactamases that cleave the betalactam ring of amoxicillin rendering it inactive amoxicillin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the bacteria listed below both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the indications and usage section grampositive bacteria enterococcus faecalis staphylococcus spp streptococcus pneumoniae streptococcus spp alpha and betahemolyticgramnegative bacteria escherichia coli haemophilus influenzae helicobacter pylori proteus mirabilis susceptibility test methods when available the clinical microbiology laboratory should provide cumulative in vitro susceptibility test results for antimicrobial drugs used in local hospitals and practice areas to the physician as periodic reports that describe the susceptibility profile of nosocomial and communityacquired pathogens these reports should aid the physician in selecting the most effective antimicrobial dilution techniques quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimum inhibitory concentrations mics these mics provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds the mics should be determined using a standardized test method  broth or agar 24  the mic values should be interpreted according to the criteria in table 4 diffusion techniques quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters can also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds 34 the zone size should be determined using a standardized test method 3 susceptibility to amoxicillin of enterococcus spp enterobacteriaceae and h influenzae may be inferred by testing ampicillin 4 susceptibility to amoxicillin of staphylococcus spp and betahemolytic streptococcus spp may be inferred by testing penicillin 4 the majority of isolates of enterococcus spp that are resistant to ampicillin or amoxicillin produce a temtype betalactamase a betalactamase test can provide a rapid means of determining resistance to ampicillin and amoxicillin 4 susceptibility to amoxicillin of streptococcus pneumoniae nonmeningitis isolates may be inferred by testing penicillin or oxacillin 4 the interpretive criteria for s pneumoniae to amoxicillin are provided in table 4 4 table 4 susceptibility interpretive criteria for amoxicillin minimum inhibitory

oxacillin zone sizes of ≤ 19 mm 4 a report of “susceptible” indicates the antimicrobial is likely to inhibit growth of the pathogen if the antimicrobial compound reaches a concentration at the infection site necessary to inhibit growth of the pathogen a report of “intermediate” indicates that the result should be considered equivocal and if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative clinically feasible drugs the test should be repeated this category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated this category also provides a buffer zone that prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation a report of “resistant” indicates the antimicrobial is not likely to inhibit growth of the pathogen if the antimicrobial compound reaches the concentration usually achievable at the infection site other therapy should be selected susceptibility testing for helicobacter
