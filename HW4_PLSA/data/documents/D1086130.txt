problems with ancestry dna’s genetic ethnicity prediction blaine bettinger 19 june 2012 201 comments i’ve received a number of emails and comments see eg here complaining about ancestrycom’s new test ancestry dna  specifically several testtakers believe that the genetic ethnicity prediction provided by ancestrycom does not reflect the numbers that they expected based on their own research for example“i just got my dna test results back from ancestrycom and i am concerned i was born in england and i have gone back many generations and have found that all my ancestors as far back as the 1600′s in most cases are english according to the results i have no british isles dna it states that i have 60 central europe 30 scandinavian and 7 southern europe i also have 3 unknown how can this be”“just received my results 21 southern european and 79 central european which doesn’t follow years of work on my family history”do these comments reflect errors in ancestry dna’s genetic ethnicity prediction or are there other factors at play caveats although i am not privy to the ‘behindthescenes’ at ancestrycom i don’t believe that there are serious issues with ancestry dna’s genetic ethnicity prediction ancestrycom’s dna arm has a solid scientific team and a large and valuable reference database indeed ancestrycom is well aware of the limitations and challenges that their genetic ethnicity prediction brings we use cuttingedge science as a base for our predictions but that comes with its own inherent challenges it’s an emerging field with exciting new discoveries and developments constantly changing the landscape right now your genetic ethnicity may not look quite right with some ethnicities under or overrepresented as scientists gain a deeper understanding of the data our prediction models will evolve to provide you with more accurate and relevant information about your family history it’s important to understand that biogeographical estimates which are still relatively new are notoriously difficult and complicated ten different researchers analyzing the same genome can come up with ten different estimates based on a number of different factors including their algorithm the reference populations used for comparison and many others here are just a few factors that can influence a biogeographical estimate and any one or more of these may be the reason that your genetic ethnicity prediction does not match estimates you make based on your paper trail different reference populations and algorithms as i suggested above different companies use different reference populations and algorithms to create a biogeographical estimate which can result in varying estimates for example in my previous review of ancestry dna’s genetic ethnicity prediction i compared my genetic ethnicity results from three companies ancestrycom 23and me and ftdna and found that their results varied considerably i’m not surprised by this but i do expect that over time – as the industry arrives at more standard reference populations and algorithms which the cheap wholegenome sequencing revolution will enable – that estimates from different companies will align much more closely be patient and enjoy being a pioneer you have two family treesremember that “ everyone has two family trees – a genealogical tree and a genetic tree ” your genealogical tree is the tree containing all of your ancestors however only a tiny subset of these individuals actually randomly contributed dna to the genome that you walk around with today these ancestors are the only individuals in your genetic tree it has been estimated for example that at 10 generations only about 1012 of ancestors in your genealogical tree are actually in your genetic treeaccordingly even if a decent percentage of your ancestors at 10 generations originated in the british isles there is possibility that your dna – and thus your genetic ethnicity prediction – could include very little or absolutely no british isles ancestry simply because of the rules of genetics ancestrycom tries to explain this as well i’m biased but i think my “everyone has two trees” explanation is a little clearer i’ve had great luck explaining this to newbies so if you look at your family tree it may indicate a pedigreebased ethnicity of 30 english 20 scandinavian and 50 italian based on birth locations of your greatgreatgreat grandparents while this is one valid way to look at ethnicity and in fact has been the only way until recently dna analysis can reveal the actual percentage of your dna that is reflected by these ethnic groups so your geneticbased ethnicity might reveal you are 40 british isles 15 scandinavian and 45 southern european both measures are accurate and informative—but they are measuring different things misleading labels another issue with any biogeographical estimate is the labels used to describe a population for example what does “scandinavian” or “central european” really mean does “scandinavian” mean that greatgrandpa must have been a swede or does it mean something else ancestrycom defines the “scandinavian” with the modern day locations of norway sweden denmark but explains in their faq that it can mean much much more ethnic groups moved around because people move over time and when they do they take their dna with them a group may contribute dna to other groups at different times so ethnic groups can be defined by time and place—not just location for example if you have german or british ancestors in your family tree it’s a possibility that your genetic ethnicity may be partly scandinavian the viking invasions and conquests about a thousand years ago are likely responsible for occurrences of scandinavian ethnicity throughout other regions and there are similar examples for other ethnicities with your results we provide historical information describing migrations to and from the regions to give you a broader picture of the origins of your dna similarly the “central european” label is defined to include the enormous swath of land in europe including the modern day locations of austria belgium france germany netherlands switzerland slovenia czech republic luxembourg and liechtenstein i certainly don’t think of france as being “central europe” which shows that a testtaker shouldn’t rely on the labels alone dig a little deeper nonpaternal events npesi won’t dwell on nonpaternal events because i believe they have become too much of a scapegoat nonpaternal events or npes can be broadly defined as secret or unknown breaks in your genealogical tree adoption infidelity etc at some point every single genealogical tree has an npe although current estimates vary widely consider the possibility of a break in your tree but focus on the other factors presented here as the more likely explanation for your unexpected results reviewing my genetic ethnicity prediction i have a fairly welldocumented genealogical tree my documented ancestors were mostly from the british isles england and ireland and france with far fewer ancestors from germany and central america years ago based on my paper trail i might have predicted 65 british isles 20 irish 15 french and 5 german in light of the above let’s review my ancestry dna genetic ethnicity prediction scandinavian – 78central european – 12uncertain – 10at first glance and without any of the knowledge above these numbers seem way out of whack i don’t have a single document ancestor from scandinavia or the area i think of as “central europe”however when i learn that “central europe” includes france and germany a contribution of 12 “central european” doesn’t seem farfetched further considering that ancestry in the british isles can include “scandinavian” ancestors as a result of relatively recent viking conquests on a genetic timescale perhaps the 78 scandinavian isn’t so farfetched either while i am still surprised that i don’t report any british isles dna that could simply be because of difficulties in deciphering between scandinavian and british isles or perhaps because of the random inheritance of dna from those ancestors rather than others lastly where’s my confirmed native american and african dna well these percentages are rather small  or 5 each and i’m sure they’re contained within the “uncertain” category in any event i’m not discouraged by my results and i fully expect my results to change over time conclusions lastly as ancestrycom has warned don’t forget that your results are subject to change with revisions of their algorithms and new discoveries and if ancestrycom is dedicated to the best and latest results your results almost certainly will and should change your turn what are your percentages do they match your expected percentages if you were unhappy with your ancestry dna genetic ethnicity prediction does any of the above change your view share this email print facebook
