allergic rhinitis such as hay fever in adults and adolescents over 12 years of age relieving the symptoms of an allergic skin rash called urticaria or nettle rash in adults and adolescents over 12 years of age how does it work rupafin tablets contain the active ingredient rupatadine which is a type of medicine called a nonsedating antihistamine rupatadine works by preventing the actions of histamine histamine is a substance produced by the body as part of its defence mechanisms it is stored in cells called mast cells in almost all tissues of the body when the body reacts to a foreign substance known as an allergen eg flower pollen the mast cells stimulated by the allergen release their stores of histamine the released histamine then binds to its receptors h 1 receptors causing a chain reaction that results in allergic symptoms it causes an increase in blood flow to the area of the allergy and the release of other chemicals that add to the allergic response all this results in the symptoms of an allergic reaction in hay fever histamine causes inflammation of the nose eyes and airways and results in itchy watery eyes a runny nose sneezing and nasal congestion rupatadine works by blocking histamine h 1 receptors it doesnt prevent the actual release of histamine from mast cells but prevents it binding to its receptors this in turn prevents the release of other allergy chemicals and reduces the blood supply to the area providing relief from the typical symptoms of hay fever rupatadine can also be used to relieve the symptoms of an allergic skin rash called urticaria this is an itchy rash with hives also known as nettle rash blocking the actions of histamine relieves the itching and reduces the rash associated with this condition rupatadine is called a nonsedating antihistamine as it does not enter the brain and is therefore unlikely to cause drowsiness however some people may experience some slight drowsiness how do i take it adults and adolescents over 12 years of age should take one tablet once a day when needed to relieve symptoms of the allergy you can continue to take one tablet daily to relieve your symptoms for as long as you are exposed to the allergen for example throughout the pollen season follow the instructions given by your doctor rupafin tablets should be swallowed with a drink of water they can be taken either with or without food you should not take rupafin with grapefruit juice because grapefruit juice can affect the metabolism of rupatadine and could increase the amount of the medicine in your blood thus increasing the risk
