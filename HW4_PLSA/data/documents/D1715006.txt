229 answers and 31m answer views according to me the beauty of the book lies not in the character of only vito corleone but the presence of the marginal character called kay adams michaels wife shes not a prominent character thus not making it a fullblown ethical debate this image will help in the analysis of vitos goodness on one side we have the towering character of vito corleone who speaks of capitalism hardwork how all is he doing is out of necessity due to the government being crooks themselves using survival argument of filling ones stomach he also makes some marvelous offers difficult to refuse the reader is enamored by his charm gambling is after all not such a huge moral issue and then slowly puzo unveils what these offers were involving bloodshed killing deciding who was worth living fannucci nevertheless vitos survival arguments makes us willing to accept this new dimension of him he represents what we want to be powerful person who in his deathbed could say  life is beautiful  and thats where kay comes in  she is a manifestation of our conscience a small voice within us nagging  but really is vito right do i want to become like him and these small voices within us in the end decide for us how we perceive vito a good person or a bad person vito has numerous good qualities helping needy ones he loves like his godson jonny he loves his sons other than fredo tom who he has adopted so dismissing vito as an outright bad person would be inappropriate he is not a bad person but he has a compelling aura which makes the reader want to emulate him he maybe good person but what he did was not and kays sound constantly reminds us hes not that good either in summary vito like every human being has shades of grey he is neither good nor bad absolutely and what makes the novel beautiful is manifestation of his both sides5k views · view upvoters your response is private is this answer still relevant and up to datepromoted by fiverrcom need creative writing

overrated how would someone describe vito corleones personality is he a good man or a cold blooded mafia boss ask new question andrew stein books are good answered jan 22 2013 · author has 16k answers and 36m answer views im pretty ambivalent about this im rereading the book and have been thinking hard on the subject i want to look at both sides of the argument im mostly going by depictions of the character from the book but i may use the movie as well good person first his primary motivation for living a life of crime seems to be more about power or lack thereof than money greed avarice etc he lives in the smallest house in the mall his tuxedo he wore during the wedding wasnt flattering he appears to have been faithful to his wife he doesnt appear to have a very ostentatious lifestyle the two defining moments that lead him down a life of crime were about power first a mafia don murdered his family forcing him to flee his country it was only by the help of friends was he able to escape second fanucci forced his employer to fire him from his job as a grocer so that the employer could hire his nephew in both cases he was at the mercy of a power greater than himself he got into crime in order to help support his family once he was without means his life of crime helped him acquire the means vis a vis money and friends that made him a power unto himself no longer would he be at the mercy of any outside force be it government or criminal second despite michael telling kay that his father collects favors much in the same way arctic explorers leave caches of food laying around he does appear appreciate his relationships on a personal level he appears to be touched andor flattered several times when the senator gave a valuable wedding gift to his daughter when tom hagen asks to work for him like one of his sons and when johnny fontaine flies back to visit him granted fontaine is his godson but he even seems flattered that fontaine would come to him for help and advice i think this is evidence that he appreciates his relationships on a personal level as opposed on a strategic or business level if that werent the case the gift from the senator would be more likely to be seen as someone paying tribute as opposed to a powerful person taking time to send gifts to the don s daughter third as a continuation of the second point he appears to do at least some favors out of the goodness of his heart for lack of a better term he took diseased orphan tom hagen in without hesitation he cleaned up his neighborhood in long island after he discovered the scammers he helped his wifes friend stay in her apartment after shed been kicked out vito did not appear to do these things only to expect something in return later he even appeared to be surprised when he discovered how much hagen saw him as a fatherly figure also vito seems to see doing at least some favors as a sign of friendship and respect when the baker came to see him early in the book it was said that vito looked forward with pleasure to helping him out since they were boyhood chums when he asked for several thousand dollars it appeared to be meant for bringing the congressman not as a payment to vito himself finally though we see amerigo dread the day his favor would be called in when it is called in it was simply to do as good of a job as he possibly could do in fixing up sonny for the funeral in fact both times we see favors called in it was not expected that they would do anything illegal or anything they wouldnt like for amerigo it was working on sonny for johnny it was performing at the familys casino to draw in customers i think the best you can say about vito is he is a person who does bad things for good reasons he protects and raises his family he helps out his friends and community he doesnt appear to be psychopathic and enjoy hurting people he doesnt live an ostentatious lifestyle he simply no longer wanted to submitted to powers other than himself when doing so would have killed him and his family bad person this is pretty easy he is the head of a crime syndicate he personally committed at least one murder that we know about he ordered the murders of others he gained control of the olive oil business through extremely dirty means he uses a psychopath luca brasi to further his own ends he has no compunction about breaking most laws in order to further enrich himself he controls unions for the sole purpose of extortion against those he needs to deal with and power despite knowing that he is living a lifestyle that is dangerous he allows two of his sons to work for him with michael he didnt have a choice and despite what i said earlier there is at least some evidence that he gives out favors strategically for the purpose of getting something he wantsneeds later so is vito a good person i dont think it is a simple answer i think one can honestly say yes and no it does take a bit more mental gymnastics and rationalizations to argue in favor of yes but i think there is still enough evidence that he isnt outandout evil this question is probably a reflection of your answer to the question do the ends justify the means81k views · view upvoters

planning that anyone can usesign up at airtablecom lawrence kuok godfather fan answered apr 26 2012the book talks a little bit about this the idea is that vito is sicilian and sicilians are principled makes no difference what a man does for a living vito did everything for survival and so that he could run a society in a way he thought was fairest no one elected him no one appointed him he was self appointed so in this respect not a great person in the film godfather part i the scene where vito dies this scene was actually completely impromptu marlon brando pretends to be a monster when playing with anthony this was great because vito in many ways was a monster he did favors for people then would ask for favors vito does whats convenient for him and his family johnny fontane being in the film was completely undeserved johnny fontane was a womanizer showed up drunk and just wasnt a great employee waltz not hiring johnny is completely understandable but vito forces his arm because johnny is his god son so the short answer is  i dont know  its like asking if president bush  obama are good people i think they think of it as they have a larger responsibility which sometimes draws a blurry line of what good and bad is yes bush  obama were elected but they have to make some tough calls because they are leaders and are doing something that we cannot do because they have a larger responsibility than any of us can imagine i really believe that both presidents when they do something most of the time they can what they are doing will help people and help more people than it hurts i really they think that republican or democrat as much as we may dislike politicians i think for the most part most politicians have some hope of helping people they sometimes make unpopular compromises so they can gain political capital in another way but i think most politicians really try to do something good vito was a politician the idea is that vito clearly makes a distinction of who he can or cannot kill what he can do and what he should not do he is very responsible with his power5k views · view upvoters your response is private is this answer still relevant and up to date arkadia getheren moon on pilgrimage to my species homeworld answered oct 4 2012 · author has 698 answers and 2m answer views i want to give an illustration of quora users answer which i completely endorse by the way in the mid70s a sicilian second cousin of mine my grandmother was sicilian and one of the reasons i love the godfather is that it reminds me of certain aspects of my childhood moved to north boston for a job after she got her ms she moved into a certain apartment building and drove to work every day after a few days she noticed that whenever she got home the same parking space would be open in front of her building not twenty feet from the front door she shrugged it off  until one day she left for work pulled away from the curb and for some reason happened to look into her rearview  where she saw a couple of guys crossing the street to put construction sawhorses around her parking space she never checked up on it would you  but she reasoned out that a couple of guys knew approximately when she usually came home or kept a lookout for her car and removed the sawhorses just before she arrived what happened was that word had gotten around probably through her building super or her landlord that a young single sicilian woman had just moved into the area and the dons were taking care of her making sure she didnt have to walk a long way to get into her building  the streets being what they were nobody ever said anything to her about it nobody ever asked her a favour in return when she told me this she told me very matteroffactly and i accepted it very matteroffactly if you are of a certain age and you were close to the italian or especially sicilian community this is something understood theres nothing startling about it this was the way the world worked32k views · view upvoters dennis mulgannon i am a fan of very bad movies having horrible actors answered dec 28 2017 · author has 22k answers and 3m answer views by my standards vito corleone is not a good person he drove all of his independent competitors in the olive oil industry they either partnered with genco or disappeared businesses had to pay for protection from his family and while in the book we read that everyone who did business with vito prospered it is very likely that anyone wanting out of the agreement would disappear in the film we see only the fatherly side of him keep in mind that he trained michael both michael and his father used other people as insulators they used their caporegimes to order their men to carry out any level of violence against others as necessary for them to get their way the godfathers would order a killing and lower men on the hierarchy carried the order out if those men were caught they served the time in prison if a man failed to carry out the order he was killed if the book we learn that in order to arrange for michael to come back to america vito arranges for another to confess to the killing of sollozzo and mc cluskey by promising to care for his family after he is put to death in the electric chair vito instilled in his son that once a traitor always a traitor as long as a traitor lives he is dangerous oh and when it came to carlo beating his daughter connie that was none of his business the only rason that vito had not beaten his wife carmela was because as she said “i never gave him reason to beat me”so was vito a good person or a bad person well he was good to his wife and his sons and daughter and grandchildren272 views · view upvoters · answer requested by matthew culbertson derick ofodirinwa founder answered feb 7 2018 · author has 162 answers and 1434k answer views i would say yes though michael isn’t the part ii plays on this dynamic vito was born under the rule of an extortionist bully his brother was killed in the first scene of movie one his mother in scene too his father before that he was shuttled to america ended up in a poor italian neighborhood that’s ironically run by an extortionist bully he’s scraping together to make ends meet for his family when he’s thrown out of his job simply cause don fanucci wants someone else to have the role vito realizes that his family doesn’t have a fighting chance in america or anywhere if he doesn’t become the bully himself only because he could empathize with the victims of this system having been one he structures things differently his organization would make money from business legal or illegal and not randomly terrorizing and extorting everyone around him he would become a source or support and strength for ‘his people’ what tells me that he’s a good person is that he doesn’t oppress anyone the godfather becomes a benevolent dictator anytime he’s seen ‘doing bad’ it’s against ‘others’ people outside of his immediate circle of protection that it’s self is only small because of his limited worldview being an illiterate unintelligent peasant from corleone the ‘bad side’ of him comes from his limited scope of service he was a provider and hero for his own community and his own family when his community or family were pitted against outsiders he became an extortionist bully to ‘the enemy’ often times people that have done no wrong other than not complying with the request of someone he protects to me he’s a good man though those he felt like saving were limited in scope and that’s understandable corleone surrounding himself with family may also be a side effect of losing his own in rapid succession the effect sonny’s death took on him tells me that through his whole life it really was about his family michael on the other hand has a more limited understanding of family but bigger scope of thinking because of the opportunities in life having a predecessor and superior intelligence michael believes in the mafia as an institution whereas for his father it was a semiaccidental actualization of his life story circumstance and culture to michael ‘the family’ is an ends to a means whereas for vito it’s a means to an end that tells me that vito was a good principled person12k views · view upvoters lilo galente answered dec 27 2017 · author has 255 answers and 2407k answer views no he’s not with his friends and family he’s a nice person perhaps even soft at times but treating our loved ones well is not really the measure of a good person as is pointed out in the sermon on the mount  among other places vito is not the most violent person in the world nor is murder or threat of violence his immediate answer to all problems but that just means that for a mafia boss he’s known as a decent person but vito still oversees an organization that exploits workers at shipyards and garment districts that threatens debtors with beatings or worse that forces honest businessmen to pay tribute to corleone led “associations”  that routinely threatens or kills less powerful criminals who dare to compete that traffics in stolen property and that loans money at extortionate rates he’s friendly with a womankiller and childkiller in luca brasi per book when starting out in the olive oil business vito murdered people whose sole sin was competing against him so no he’s not good by any stretch of the imagination he’s not a complete devil like luca or a hothead like sonny but he’s evil all the same he’s indifferent to the wellbeing of his fellow man his interest is in extracting wealth from his fellow man and if he has to murder to do so it’s not a big deal to him19k views · view upvoters · answer requested by matthew culbertson raghu venkataraman i read anything everything

hes no worse than them and less hypocritical but you cant imagine him claiming to be a good person good and bad are absolute categories easier to apply to acts than people however murder is murder so
