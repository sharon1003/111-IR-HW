10 a81icd  9cm 046  edit on wikidataprions are infectious agents composed entirely of a protein material that can fold in multiple structurally abstract ways at least one of which is transmissible to other prion proteins leading to disease in a manner that is epidemiologically comparable to the spread of viral infection prions composed of the prion protein pr p are believed to be the cause of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies tses among other diseases 1prions were initially identified as the causative agent in animal tses derived from scrapie in sheep and later bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse—known popularly as mad cow disease human prion diseases include creutzfeldt–jakob disease cjd and its variant v cjd gerstmann–sträussler–scheinker syndrome fatal familial insomnia and kuru 2 all known prion diseases in mammals affect the structure of the brain or other neural tissue no effective medical treatment is known the illnesses are progressive and always fatal 3a 2015 study concluded that multiple system atrophy msa a rare human neurodegenerative disease is caused by a misfolded version of a protein called alphasynuclein and is therefore also classifiable as a prion disease 4 several yeast proteins have also been identified as having prionogenic properties 5 6a protein as a standalone infectious agent stands in contrast to all other known infectious agents such as viruses bacteria fungi and parasites all of which contain nucleic acids  dna rna or both for this reason a minority of researchers still consider the priontse hypothesis unproven 7prions may propagate by transmitting their misfolded protein state when a prion enters a healthy organism it induces existing properly folded proteins to convert into the misfolded prion form in this way the prion acts as a template to guide the misfolding of more proteins into prion form in yeast this refolding is assisted by chaperone proteins such as hsp104 these refolded prions can then go on to convert more proteins themselves leading to a chain reaction resulting in large amounts of the prion form 6 all known prions induce the formation of an amyloid fold in which the protein polymerises into an aggregate consisting of tightly packed beta sheets amyloid aggregates are fibrils growing at their ends and replicate when breakage causes two growing ends to become four growing ends the incubation period of prion diseases is determined by the exponential growth rate associated with prion replication which is a balance between the linear growth and the breakage of aggregates 8 the propagation of the prion depends on the presence of normally folded protein in which the prion can induce misfolding animals that do not express the normal form of the prion protein can neither develop nor transmit the disease prion aggregates are extremely stable and accumulate in infected tissue causing tissue damage and cell death 9 this structural stability means that prions are resistant to denaturation by chemical and physical agents making disposal and containment of these particles difficult prion structure varies slightly between species but nonetheless prion replication is subject to epimutation and natural selection just like other forms of replication 10contents  hide 1 prion protein11 discovery12 structure121 pr p c122 pr p res123 pr p sc13 function131 pr p and

radiation biologist tikvah alper and biophysicist john stanley griffith developed the hypothesis that some transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are caused by an infectious agent consisting solely of proteins 11 12 earlier investigations by e j field into scrapie and kuru had identified the transfer of pathologically inert polysaccharides that only become infectious in the host 13 14 alper and griffith wanted to account for the discovery that the mysterious infectious agent causing the diseases scrapie and creutzfeldt–jakob disease resisted ionizing radiation 15 a single ionizing hit normally destroys an entire infectious particle and the dose needed to hit half the particles depends on the size of the particles empirical results of ionizing doses applied to the unknown infectious substance evidenced an infectious particle size too small to be a viral mechanism francis crick recognized the potential significance of the griffith proteinonly hypothesis for scrapie propagation in the second edition of his  central dogma of molecular biology  1970 while asserting that the flow of sequence information from protein to protein or from protein to rna and dna was precluded he noted that griffiths hypothesis was a potential contradiction although it was not so promoted by griffith 16 the revised hypothesis was later formulated in part to accommodate reverse transcription which both howard temin and david baltimore discovered in 1970  citation neededin 1982 stanley b prusiner of the university of california san francisco announced that his team had purified the hypothetical infectious prion and that the infectious agent consisted mainly of a specific protein – though they did not manage to isolate the protein until two years after prusiners announcement 17 18 while the infectious agent was named a prion the specific protein that the prion was composed of is also known as the pr ion p rotein pr p though this protein may occur both in infectious and noninfectious forms prusiner won the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 1997 for his research into prions 19structure  editsee also prnp § structure the protein that prions are made of pr p is found throughout the body even in healthy people and animals however pr p found in infectious material has a different structure and is resistant to proteases the enzymes in the body that can normally break down proteins the normal form of the protein is called pr p c while the infectious form is called pr p sc — the c refers to cellular pr p while the sc refers to  scrapie  the prototypic prion disease occurring in sheep 20 while pr p c is structurally welldefined pr p sc is certainly polydisperse and defined at a relatively poor level pr p can be induced to fold into other moreorless welldefined isoforms in vitro and their relationship to the form s that are pathogenic in vivo is not yet clear pr p c  editpr p c is a normal protein found on the membranes of cells it has 209 amino acids in humans one disulfide bond a molecular mass of 35–36 k da and a mainly alphahelical structure several topological forms exist one cell surface form anchored via glycolipid and two transmembrane forms 21 the normal protein is not sedimentable meaning that it cannot be separated by centrifuging techniques 22 its function is a complex issue that continues to be investigated pr p c binds copper ii ions with high affinity 23 the significance of this finding is not clear but it is presumed to relate to pr p structure or function pr p c is readily digested by proteinase k and can be liberated from the cell surface in vitro by the enzyme phosphoinositide phospholipase c piplc which cleaves the glycophosphatidylinositol gpi glycolipid anchor 24 pr p has been reported to play important roles in cellcell adhesion and intracellular signaling in vivo and may therefore be involved in cellcell communication in the brain 25pr p res  editproteaseresistant pr p sc like protein pr p res is an isoform of pr p c from which is structurally altered and converted into a misfolded proteinase kresistant form in vitro to model conversion of pr p c to pr p sc in vitro saborio et al rapidly converted pr p c into a pr p res by a procedure involving cyclic amplification of protein misfolding 26 the term pr p res  has been made to distinguish between pr p sc which is isolated from infectious tissue and associated with the transmissible spongiform encephalopathy agent 27 for example unlike pr p sc pr p res may not necessarily be infectious pr p sc  editthe infectious isoform of pr p known as pr p sc is able to convert normal pr p c proteins into the infectious isoform by changing their conformation or shape this in turn alters the way the proteins interconnect pr p sc always causes prion disease although the exact 3d structure of pr p sc is not known it has a higher proportion of βsheet structure in place of the normal αhelix structure 28 aggregations of these abnormal isoforms form highly structured amyloid fibers which accumulate to form plaques it is unclear as to whether these aggregates are the cause of cell damage or are simply a sideeffect of the underlying disease process 29 the end of each fiber acts as a template onto which free protein molecules may attach allowing the fiber to grow under most circumstances only pr p molecules with an identical amino acid sequence to the infectious pr p sc are incorporated into the growing fiber 22 however rare crossspecies transmission is also possible function  editthe physiological function of the prion protein remains a controversial matter while data from in vitro experiments suggest many dissimilar roles studies on pr p knockout mice have provided only limited information because these animals exhibit only minor abnormalities in research done in mice it was found that the cleavage of pr p proteins in peripheral nerves causes the activation of myelin repair in schwann cells and that the lack of pr p proteins caused demyelination in those cells 30pr p and longterm memory  edita review of evidence in 2005 suggested that pr p may have a normal function in maintenance of longterm memory 31 as well a 2004 study found that mice lacking genes for normal cellular pr p protein show altered hippocampal longterm potentiation 32 33pr p and stem cell renewal  edita 2006 article from the whitehead institute for biomedical research indicates that pr p expression on stem cells is necessary for an organisms selfrenewal of bone marrow the study showed that all longterm hematopoietic stem cells express pr p on their cell membrane and that hematopoietic tissues with pr pnull stem cells exhibit increased sensitivity to cell depletion 34prion replication mechanism  editheterodimer model of prion propagation fibril model of prion propagation the first hypothesis that tried to explain how prions replicate in a proteinonly manner was the heterodimer model 35 this model assumed that a single pr p sc molecule binds to a single pr p c molecule and catalyzes its conversion into pr p sc the two pr p sc molecules then come apart and can go on to convert more pr p c however a model of prion replication must explain both how prions propagate and why their spontaneous appearance is so rare manfred eigen showed that the heterodimer model requires pr p sc to be an extraordinarily effective catalyst increasing the rate of the conversion reaction by a factor of around 10 15 36 this problem does not arise if pr p sc exists only in aggregated forms such as amyloid where cooperativity may act as a barrier to spontaneous conversion what is more despite considerable effort infectious monomeric pr p sc has never been isolated an alternative model assumes that pr p sc exists only as fibrils and that fibril ends bind pr p c and convert it into pr p sc if this were all then the quantity of prions would increase linearly forming ever longer fibrils but exponential growth of both pr p sc and of the quantity of infectious particles is observed during prion disease 37 38 39 this can be explained by taking into account fibril breakage 40 a mathematical solution for the exponential growth rate resulting from the combination of fibril growth and fibril breakage has been found 8 the exponential growth rate depends largely on the square root of the pr p c concentration 8 the incubation period is determined by the exponential growth rate and in vivo data on prion diseases in transgenic mice match this prediction 8 the same square root dependence is also seen in vitro in experiments with a variety of different amyloid proteins 41the mechanism of prion replication has implications for designing drugs since the incubation period of prion diseases is so long an effective drug does not need to eliminate all prions but simply needs to slow down the rate of exponential growth models predict that the most effective way to achieve this using a drug with the lowest possible dose is to find a drug that binds to fibril ends and blocks them from growing any further 42prion diseases and their transmission properties  editmain article transmissible spongiform encephalopathy diseases caused by

prppr p sc but by a misfolded αsynuclein 47until 2015 all known mammalian prion diseases were considered to be caused by the prion protein pr p in 2015 multiple system atrophy was found to be likely caused by a new prion the misfolded form of a protein called alphasynuclein 4 the endogenous properly folded form of the prion protein is denoted pr p c for c ommon or c ellular  whereas the diseaselinked misfolded form is denoted pr p sc for sc rapie  after one of the diseases first linked to prions and neurodegeneration 22 48 the precise structure of the prion is not known though they can be formed by combining pr p c polyadenylic acid and lipids in a protein misfolding cyclic amplification pmca reaction 49 proteins showing priontype behavior are also found in some fungi which has been useful in helping to understand mammalian prions fungal prions do not appear to cause disease in their hosts 50prions cause neurodegenerative disease by aggregating extracellularly within the central nervous system to form plaques known as amyloid which disrupt the normal tissue structure this disruption is characterized by holes in the tissue with resultant spongy architecture due to the vacuole formation in the neurons 51 other histological changes include astrogliosis and the absence of an inflammatory reaction 52 while the incubation period for prion diseases is relatively long 5 to 20 years once symptoms appear the disease progresses rapidly leading to brain damage and death 53 neurodegenerative symptoms can include convulsions dementia ataxia balance and coordination dysfunction and behavioural or personality changes all known prion diseases collectively called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies tses are untreatable and fatal 54 however a vaccine developed in mice may provide insight into providing a vaccine to resist prion infections in humans 55 additionally in 2006 scientists announced that they had genetically engineered cattle lacking a necessary gene for prion production – thus theoretically making them immune to bse 56 building on research indicating that mice lacking normally occurring prion protein are resistant to infection by scrapie prion protein 57 in 2013 a study revealed that 1 in 2000 people in the united kingdom might harbour the infectious prion protein that causes v cjd 58many different mammalian species can be affected by prion diseases as the prion protein pr p is very similar in all mammals 59 due to small differences in pr p between different species it is unusual for a prion disease to transmit from one species to another the human prion disease variant creutzfeldt–jakob disease however is believed to be caused by a prion that typically infects cattle causing bovine spongiform encephalopathy and is transmitted through infected meat 60transmission  editit has been recognized that prion diseases can arise in three different ways acquired familial or sporadic 61 it is often assumed that the diseased form directly interacts with the normal form to make it rearrange its structure one idea the protein x hypothesis is that an asyet unidentified cellular protein protein x enables the conversion of pr p c to pr p sc by bringing a molecule of each of the two together into a complex 62current research suggests that the primary method of infection in animals is through ingestion it is thought that prions may be deposited in the environment through the remains of dead animals and via urine saliva and other body fluids they may then linger in the soil by binding to clay and other minerals 63a university of california research team led by nobel prize winner stanley prusiner has provided evidence for the theory that infection can occur from prions in manure 64 and since manure is present in many areas surrounding water reservoirs as well as used on many crop fields it raises the possibility of widespread transmission it was reported in january 2011 that researchers had discovered prions spreading through airborne transmission on aerosol particles in an animal testing experiment focusing on scrapie infection in laboratory mice 65 preliminary evidence supporting the notion that prions can be transmitted through use of urinederived human menopausal gonadotropin administered for the treatment of infertility was published in 2011 66prions in plants  editin 2015 researchers at the university of texas health science center at houston found that plants can be a vector for prions when researchers fed hamsters grass that grew on ground where a deer that died with chronic wasting disease cwd was buried the hamsters became ill with cwd suggesting that prions can bind to plants which then take them up into the leaf and stem structure where they can be eaten by herbivores thus completing the cycle it is thus possible that there is a progressively accumulating number of prions in the environment 67 68sterilization  editinfectious particles possessing nucleic acid are dependent upon it to direct their continued replication prions however are infectious by their effect on normal versions of the protein sterilizing prions therefore requires the denaturation of the protein to a state in which the molecule is no longer able to induce the abnormal folding of normal proteins in general prions are quite resistant to proteases heat ionizing radiation and formaldehyde treatments 69 although their infectivity can be reduced by such treatments effective prion decontamination relies upon protein hydrolysis or reduction or destruction of protein tertiary structure examples include sodium hypochlorite sodium hydroxide and strongly acidic detergents such as lp h 70 134 °c 274 °f for 18 minutes in a pressurized steam autoclave has been found to be somewhat effective in deactivating the agent of disease 71 72 ozone sterilization is currently being studied as a potential method for prion denaturation and deactivation 73 renaturation of a completely denatured prion to infectious status has not yet been achieved however partially denatured prions can be renatured to an infective status under certain artificial conditions 74the world health organization recommends any of the following three procedures for the sterilization of all heatresistant surgical instruments to ensure that they are not contaminated with prions immerse in 1n sodium hydroxide and place in a gravitydisplacement autoclave at 121 °c for 30 minutes clean rinse in water and then perform routine sterilization processes immerse in 1n sodium hypochlorite 20000 parts per million available chlorine for 1 hour transfer instruments to water heat in a gravitydisplacement autoclave at 121 °c for 1 hour clean and then perform routine sterilization processes immerse in 1n sodium hydroxide or sodium hypochlorite 20000 parts per million available chlorine for 1 hour remove and rinse in water then transfer to an open pan and heat in a gravitydisplacement 121 °c or in a porousload 134 °c autoclave for 1 hour clean and then perform routine sterilization processes 75prionlike domains  editwhile pr p is considered the only mammalian prion prionlike domains have been found in a variety of other mammalian proteins some of these proteins have been implicated in the ontogeny of agerelated neurodegenerative disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als known as motor neurone disease outside the us frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitinpositive inclusions ftldu alzheimers disease and huntingtons disease 76 as well as some forms of systemic amyloidosis including aa secondary amyloidosis that develops in humans and animals with inflammatory and infectious diseases such as tuberculosis crohns disease rheumatoid arthritis and hiv aids aa amyloidosis like prion disease may be transmissible 77 this has given rise to the prion paradigm where otherwise harmless proteins can be converted to a pathogenic form by a small number of misfolded nucleating proteins 78the definition of a prionlike domain arises from the study of fungal prions in yeast prionogenic proteins have a portable prion domain that is both necessary and sufficient for selftemplating and protein aggregation this has been shown by attaching the prion domain to a reporter protein which then aggregates like a known prion similarly removing the prion domain from a fungal prion protein inhibits prionogenesis this modular view of prion behaviour has led to the hypothesis that similar prion domains are present in animal proteins in addition to pr p 76 these fungal prion domains have several characteristic sequence features they are typically enriched in asparagine glutamine tyrosine and glycine residues with an asparagine bias being particularly conducive to the aggregative property of prions historically prionogenesis has been seen as independent of sequence and only dependent on relative residue content however this has been shown to be false with the spacing of prolines and charged residues having been shown to be critical in amyloid formation 5bioinformatic screens have predicted that over 250 human proteins contain prionlike domains pr ld these domains are hypothesized to have the same transmissible amyloidogenic properties of pr p and known fungal proteins as in yeast proteins involved in gene expression and rna binding seem to be particularly enriched in pr lds compared to other classes of protein in particular 29 of the known 210 proteins with an rna recognition motif also have a putative prion domain meanwhile several of these rnabinding proteins have been independently identified as pathogenic in cases of als ftldu alzheimers disease and huntingtons disease 79role in neurodegenerative disease  editthe pathogenicity of prions and proteins with prionlike domains arises from their selftemplating ability and the resulting exponential growth of amyloid fibrils the presence of amyloid fibrils in patients with degenerative diseases has been well documented these amyloid fibrils are seen as the result of pathogenic proteins that selfpropagate and form highly stable nonfunctional aggregates 79 while this does not necessarily imply a causal relationship between amyloid and degenerative diseases the toxicity of certain amyloid forms and the overproduction of amyloid in familial cases of degenerative disorders supports the idea that amyloid formation is generally toxic specifically aggregation of tdp43 an rnabinding protein has been found in alsmnd patients and mutations in the genes coding for these proteins have been identified in familial cases of alsmnd these mutations promote the misfolding of the proteins into a prionlike conformation the misfolded form of tdp43 forms cytoplasmic inclusions in afflicted neurons and is found depleted in the nucleus in addition to alsmnd and ftldu tdp43 pathology is a feature of many cases of alzheimers disease parkinsons disease and huntingtons disease the misfolding of tdp43 is largely directed by its prionlike domain this domain is inherently prone to misfolding while pathological mutations in tdp43 have been found to increase this propensity to misfold explaining the presence of these mutations in familial cases of alsmnd as in yeast the prionlike domain of tdp43 has been shown to be both necessary and sufficient for protein misfolding and aggregation 76similarly pathogenic mutations have been identified in the prionlike domains of heterogeneous nuclear riboproteins hn rnpa2b1 and hn rnpa1 in familial cases of muscle brain bone and motor neuron degeneration the wildtype form of all of these proteins show a tendency to selfassemble into amyloid fibrils while the pathogenic mutations exacerbate this behaviour and lead to excess accumulation 80fungi  editmain article fungal prion fungal proteins exhibiting templated conformational change were discovered in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae by reed wickner in the early 1990s for their mechanistic similarity to mammalian prions they were termed yeast prions subsequent to this a prion has also been found in the fungus podospora anserina these prions behave similarly to pr p but in general are nontoxic to their hosts susan lindquist s group at the whitehead institute has argued some of the fungal prions are not associated with any disease state but may have a useful role however researchers at the nih have also provided arguments suggesting that fungal prions could be considered a diseased state 81 there is mounting evidence that fungal proteins have evolved specific functions that are beneficial to the microorganism that enhance their ability to adapt to their diverse environments 82as of 2012 there are eight known prion proteins in fungi seven in saccharomyces cerevisiae  sup35 rnq1 ure2 swi1 mot3 cyc8 and mod5 and one in podospora anserina hets  contradictory the article that reported the discovery of a prion form the mca1 protein was retracted due to the fact that the data could not be reproduced 83 notably most of the fungal prions are based on glutamineasparaginerich sequences with the exception of hets and mod5 research into fungal prions has given strong support to the proteinonly concept since purified protein extracted from cells with a prion state has been demonstrated to convert the normal form of the protein into a misfolded form in vitro and in the process preserve the information corresponding to different strains of the prion state it has also shed some light on prion domains which are regions in a protein that promote the conversion into a prion fungal prions have helped to suggest mechanisms of conversion that may apply to all prions though fungal prions appear distinct from infectious mammalian prions in the lack of cofactor required for propagation the characteristic prion domains may vary between species—eg characteristic fungal prion domains are not found in mammalian prions fungal prions protein natural host normal function prion

identify compounds that can treat prioncaused diseases such as one compound found to bind a cavity in the pr p c and stabilize the conformation reducing the amount of harmful pr p sc 85antiprion antibodies capable of crossing the bloodbrainbarrier and targeting cytosolic prion protein an otherwise major obstacle in prion therapeutics have been described 86in the last decade some progress dealing with ultrahighpressure inactivation of prion infectivity in processed meat has been reported 87in 2011 it was discovered that prions could be degraded by lichens 88astemizole has been found to have antiprion activity 89another type of chemical that may be effective against prion infection is the luminescent conjugated polythiophenes fluorescent compounds that are often used to stain tissue samples in a 2015 study led by adriano aguzzi professor of neurobiology at the university of zurich found that when they injected mice with a prion disease and then with polythiophenes the mice survived eighty percent longer than the control mice that were only injected with the prion disease 90there continues to be a very practical problem with diagnosis of prion diseases including bse and cjd they have an incubation period of months to decades during which there are no symptoms even though the pathway of converting the normal brain pr p protein into the toxic diseaserelated pr p sc form has started at present there is virtually no way to detect pr p sc reliably except by examining the brain using neuropathological and immunohistochemical methods after death accumulation of the abnormally folded pr p sc form of the pr p protein is a characteristic of the disease but it is present at very low levels in easily accessible body fluids like blood or urine researchers have tried to develop methods to measure pr p sc but there are still no fully accepted methods for use in materials such as blood  citation neededin 2010 a team from new york described detection of pr p sc even when initially present at only one part in a hundred billion 10 −11 in brain tissue the method combines amplification with a novel technology called surround optical fiber immunoassay sofia and some specific antibodies against pr p sc after amplifying and then concentrating any pr p sc the samples are labelled with a fluorescent dye using an antibody for specificity and then finally loaded into a microcapillary tube this tube is placed in a specially constructed apparatus so that it is totally surrounded by optical fibres to capture all light emitted once the dye is excited using a laser 91 92the rtqu ic assay a microplate reader based prion detection method which uses as reagents normally folded prions fluorescently labelled so that they light up when they are misfolded samples suspected of containing misfolded prions are added and misfolded reagents can be detected by standard fluorescence detection methods 93 94 95causal hypotheses  editwhether prions cause disease or are merely a symptom caused by a different agent is still debated by a minority of researchers the following sections describe several hypotheses some pertain to the composition of the infectious agent proteinonly protein with other components virus or other while others pertain to its mechanism of reproduction proteinonly hypothesis  editprior to the discovery of prions it was thought that all pathogens used nucleic acids to direct their replication the proteinonly hypothesis states that a protein structure can replicate without the use of nucleic acids this was initially controversial as it contradicts the central dogma of molecular biology which describes nucleic acid as the central form of replicative information evidence in favor of a proteinonly hypothesis includes 29infectivity titre in tses roughly correlates with prion amyloid pr p sc titre however prion amyloid is absent in approximately 10 of cjd cases 96no virus particles bacteria or fungi have been conclusively associated with prion diseases although viruslike particles and spiroplasmalike inclusions can be detected in some tse cases but not in controls uninfected individuals 97 98no nucleic acid has been conclusively associated with infectivity agent is resistant to ultraviolet radiation and nucleases although in 2016 studies have suggested that the agent can be destroyed by nucleases under certain situations and that part of the resistance to nucleases and radiation may be that byproducts from degenerating neurons may help protect a nucleic acid 99no immune or inflammatory response to infection pr p sc experimentally transmitted between one species and another results in pr p sc with the aminoacid sequence of the recipient species suggesting that nucleic acidmediated replication of the donor agent does not occur 100familial prion disease occurs in families with a mutation in the pr p gene and mice with pr p mutations develop prion disease despite controlled conditions where transmission is prevented these mice can then transmit the disease to healthy wild type mice suggesting that mice with pr p mutations spontaneously generate infectivity animals lacking pr p c do not contract prion disease genetic factors  edita gene for the normal protein has been identified the prnp gene 101 in all inherited cases of prion disease there is a mutation in the prnp gene many different prnp mutations have been identified and these proteins are more likely to fold into abnormal prion 102 although this discovery puts a hole in the general prion hypothesis that prions can aggregate only proteins of identical amino acid makeup these mutations can occur throughout the gene some mutations involve expansion of the octapeptide repeat region at the nterminal of pr p other mutations that have been identified as a cause of inherited prion disease occur at positions 102 117  198 gss 178 200 210  232 cjd and 178  fatal familial insomnia ffi the cause of prion disease can be sporadic genetic or infectious or a combination of these factors 103 for example to have scrapie both an infectious agent and a susceptible genotype must be present 102multicomponent hypothesis  editdespite much effort significant titers of prion infectivity have never been produced by refolding pure pr p molecules raising doubt about the validity of the protein only hypothesis in addition the protein only hypothesis fails to provide a molecular explanation for the ability of prion strains to target specific areas of the brain in distinct patterns these shortcomings along with additional experimental data have given rise to the multicomponent or cofactor variation hypothesis 104in 2007 biochemist surachai supattapone and his colleagues at dartmouth college produced purified infectious prions de novo from defined components pr p c copurified lipids and a synthetic polyanionic molecule 49 these researchers also showed that the polyanionic molecule required for prion formation was selectively incorporated into highaffinity complexes with pr p molecules leading them to hypothesize that infectious prions may be composed of multiple host components including pr p lipid and polyanionic molecules rather than pr p sc alone 105in 2010 jiyan ma and colleagues at the ohio state university produced infectious prions from a recipe of bacterially expressed recombinant pr p popg phospholipid and rna further supporting the multicomponent hypothesis 106 this finding is in contrast to studies that found minimally infectious prions produced from recombinant pr p alone 107 108in 2012 supattapone and colleagues purified the membrane lipid phosphatidylethanolamine as a solitary endogenous cofactor capable of facilitating the formation of hightiter recombinant prions derived from multiple prion strains 109 they also reported that the cofactor is essential for maintaining the infectious conformation of pr p sc and that cofactor molecules dictate the strain properties of infectious prions 110heavy metal poisoning hypothesis  editreports suggest that imbalance of brain metal homeostasis may be a cause of pr p sc associated neurotoxicity though the underlying mechanisms are difficult to explain based on existing information proposed hypotheses include a functional role for pr p c in metal metabolism and loss of this function due to aggregation to the diseaseassociated pr p sc form as the cause of brain metal imbalance other views suggest gain of toxic function by pr p sc due to sequestration of pr p c associated metals within the aggregates resulting in the generation of redoxactive pr p sc complexes the physiological implications of some pr p c metal interactions are known while others are still unclear the pathological implications of pr p c metal interaction include metalinduced oxidative damage and in some instances conversion of pr p c to a pr p sc like form 111viral hypothesis  editthe proteinonly hypothesis has been criticised by those maintaining that the simplest explanation of the evidence to date is viral 112 for more than a decade yale university neuropathologist laura manuelidis has been proposing that prion diseases are caused instead by an unidentified slow virus in january 2007 she and her colleagues published an article reporting to have found a virus in 10 or less of their scrapieinfected cells in culture 113 114evidence in favor of a viral hypothesis includes 29strain variation differences in prion infectivity incubation symptomology and progression among species resembles that seen between viruses especially rna viruses the long incubation and rapid onset of symptoms resembles lentiviruses such as hiv induced aidsvirallike particles that do not appear to be composed of pr p have been found in some of the cells of scrapie or cjdinfected cell lines 114many viruses including hiv which needs cd4 and cxcr4 need a receptor to attach to and enter into host cells the host prion pr p c may be a receptor protein for an as yet undiscovered tse virus explaining why animals lacking host prion do not become infected with experimental prion disease 115 116a prion like protein called mavs has been shown to misfold as part of the innate immune response against pathogenic viruses 117 118 similarly the cellular prion pr p c has been shown to have anti hiv properties 119 and it is hypothesized that the misfolding of the prion in tses may be an antiviral response against an unknown virus 116in 2016 studies have demonstrated susceptibility to nucleases under certain situations 99 of infectivity was destroyed but there was no reduction of prion protein suggesting the presence of a nucleic acid 120studies propagating tse infectivity in cellfree reactions 121 and in purified component chemical reactions 49 is thought to strongly suggest against tse viral nature however some viruses such as poliovirus have the ability to replicate in cellfree reactions 115 122 123virino hypothesis  editthe  virino hypothesis postulates that the tse agent is a foreign self replicating nucleic acid or nucleic acid fragment bound to pr p 124 125spiroplasma hypothesis  editspiroplasma is a cell wall –deficient bacterium related to mycoplasma which some think may be the cause of the tses the lack of a cell wall means it is not susceptible to conventional antibiotics such as penicillin which target cell wall synthesis frank o bastian of louisiana state university first discovered spiroplasma like inclusions in the brain of a cjd patient during an autopsy in 1979 98 and has hypothesized that this bacterium could possibly be the cause of the tses 96 126 127however as of 2015 with the exception of spiroplasma mirum strain smca causing spongiform microcystic encephalitis in suckling rats other researchers have been unable to duplicate these findings 128 129 130 casting doubt on the spiroplasma hypothesis in defense of the spiroplasma hypothesis bastian pointed out that spiroplasma is hard to culture and that strain variation makes it hard to detect certain strains using pcr and other techniques thus giving a false negative acinetobacter autoimmunity hypothesis  editacinetobacter is a bacterium which some think is the cause of the tses 131 132etymology and pronunciation  editthe word prion coined in 1982 by stanley b prusiner is a portmanteau derived from pr otein and infect ion hence prion and is short for proteinaceous infectious particle 4 in reference to its ability to selfpropagate and transmit its conformation to other proteins 133 its main pronunciation is  ˈ p r iː ɒ n   listen 134 135 136 137 although  ˈ p r aɪ ɒ n  as the homographic name of the bird is pronounced 136 137 is also heard 138 in his 1982 paper introducing the term prusiner specified that it be pronounced pree on 18see also  editmedicine portal molecular and cellular biology portal viruses portal amyloidosis creutzfeldt–jakob disease prion pseudoknot protein folding protein misfolding cyclic
