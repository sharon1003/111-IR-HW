bluetooth or usb its a great way to work mobile with a laptop and not have to worry about finding a wifi hotspot to work from hotspot or notspot personal hotspot is unfortunately rather restricted it isnt enabled by default and as well as making sure your network carrier supports personal hotspot you also have to be on a data plan that offers it as well apple maintains a list of worldwide carriers that offer the i phone and the servicesfeatures they support such as visual voicemail that includes personal hotspot if youre unsure that your carrier supports personal hotspot this should be your first port of call personal hotspot may cost an additional fee or be subject to restrictive data caps be sure to check with your carrier about any additional charges and restrictions that may be imposed supported devices personal hotspot is available on the following devicesi phone 4 and later over wifi bluetooth and usbi phone 3g and i phone 3gs over bluetooth and usbi pad 3rd gen wifi

after the 3rd generation that includes cellular functionality enabling personal hotspot provided both your carrier and data plan support personal hotspot launch settings and tap the option for personal hotspot enabling personal hotspot is as simple as sliding the switch if you dont have wifi and bluetooth enabled before switching it on youll be prompted if you want to enable those wireless services or just use it over usb wifi the most common way that personal hotspot is used is via wifi using this option the i os device creates a wireless network that is encrypted with a password other devices such as laptops and tablets can then connect to the wireless network and connect to the internet using the i os devices data connection the wifi password can be changed to something more memorable should you need to provided it is at least 8 characters with personal hotspot enabled your i os device will disconnect from any wifi network it is connected to and create one of its own named after the device if youd like to rename your i os device you can do so by tapping settings  general  about within i os and os x personal hotspot networks are displayed slightly differently so instead of the typical radarstyle icon youre shown a chainlink one instead denoting that the network is a personal hotspot once youre connected using another i os device or mac you can access the internet bluetooth personal hotspot over bluetooth works in a similar way to wifi though needs a little more configuration to get going to be honest youll likely never need to use it over bluetooth and its a throwback to the days when personal hotspot and i phones werent capable of creating their own wireless network with personal hotspot and bluetooth enabled on your i os device you need to pair it to your mac pairing bluetooth devices has become much easier over the years and isnt the nearconstant battle it used to be to pair your i phone with your mac open system preferences and select bluetooth alternatively click on the bluetooth menu bar icon and select open bluetooth preferences from the dropdown menu your i os device should appear within the list of discovered devices automatically click pair to begin the process at which point os x will display a 6digit number to check against your i phone to confirm the pair request is coming from the correct device once paired your i os device is ready to use via bluetooth to connect use the bluetooth menu icon select the i os device then click connect to network once connected your mac will use your i os devices data connection over bluetooth it has a number of disadvantages when compared to wifi bluetooth only supports one device connected at any time so if you want to share your i os devices data connection with multiple devices you cant over bluetooth perhaps more importantly bluetooth 40 the latest iteration of the standard currently in use has a maximum transfer speed of just 24 mbitsec with lte and 4g networks offering speeds beyond 40mbitsec you will find that bluetooth actually becomes a bottleneck usbperhaps the easiest of the three options to use usb may seem the weakest of the three options what with it needing to be physically tethered but im going to let you in on a secret usb is the best by far personal hotspot over wifi or bluetooth will burn through your i os devices battery like a blowtorch through a birthday cake with the insane battery life that the current mac book range are capable of thanks to the haswell updates it makes much more sense to shift the burden of power to your mac whilst keeping your i os device topped up with charge using personal hotspot over usb requires no pairing or passwords simply enable it on your i os device and connect the usb cable to your mac thats really all there is to it to see how it works launch system preferences and select network all of the network connections that your mac is capable of are listed here and your i os device
