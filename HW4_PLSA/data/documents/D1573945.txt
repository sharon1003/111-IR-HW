1with an almost unpronounceable surname and a thick austrian accent who would have ever believed that a brash quick talking bodybuilder from a small european village would become one of hollywoods biggest stars marry into the prestigious kennedy family amass a fortune via shrewd investments and one day be the governor of california the amazing story of megastar arnold schwarzenegger is a true rags to riches tale of a penniless immigrant making it in the land of opportunity the united states of america arnold alois schwarzenegger was born july 30 1947 in the town of thal styria austria to aurelia schwarzenegger born jadrny and gustav schwarzenegger the local police chief from a young age he took a keen interest in physical fitness and bodybuilding going on to compete in several minor contests in europe however it was when he emigrated to the united states in 1968 at the tender age of 21 that his star began to rise up until the early 1970s bodybuilding had been viewed as a rather oddball sport or even a misunderstood freak show by the general public however two entrepreneurial canadian brothers ben weider and joe weider set about broadening the appeal of pumping iron and getting the sport respect and what better poster boy could they have to lead the charge then the incredible austrian oak arnold schwarzenegger over roughly the next decade beginning in 1970 schwarzenegger dominated the sport of competitive bodybuilding winning five mr universe titles and seven mr olympia titles and with it he made himself a major sports icon he generated a new international audience for bodybuilding gym memberships worldwide swelled by the tens of thousands and the weider sports business empire flourished beyond belief and reached out to all corners of the globe however schwarzeneggers horizons were bigger than just the landscape of bodybuilding and he debuted on screen as arnold strong in the low budget hercules in new york 1970 then director bob rafelson cast arnold in stay hungry 1976 alongside jeff bridges and sally field for which arnold won a golden globe award for best acting debut in a motion picture the mesmerizing pumping iron 1977 covering the 1975 mr olympia contest in south africa has since gone on to become one of the key sports documentaries of the 20th century plus arnold landed other acting roles in the comedy the villain 1979 opposite kirk douglas and he portrayed mickey hargitay in the well received tv movie the jayne mansfield story 1980 what arnold really needed was a super hero  warrior style role in a lavish production that utilized his chiseled physique and gave him room to show off his growing acting talents and quirky humor conan the barbarian 1982 was just that role inspired by the robert e howard short stories of the hyborean age and directed by gung ho director john milius and with a largely unknown cast save max von sydow and james earl jones conan was a smash hit worldwide and an inferior although still enjoyable sequel titled conan the destroyer 1984 quickly followed if conan was the kick start to arnolds movie career then his next role was to put the pedal to the floor and accelerate his star status into overdrive director james cameron had until that time only previously directed one earlier feature film titled piranha part two the spawning 1981 which stank of rotten fish from start to finish however cameron had penned a fast paced science fiction themed film script that called for an actor to play an unstoppable ruthless predator  the terminator 1984 made on a relatively modest budget the high voltage action  science fiction thriller the terminator 1984 was incredibly successful worldwide and began one of the most profitable film franchises in history the dead pan phrase ill be back quickly became part of popular culture across the globe schwarzenegger was in vogue with action movie fans and the next few years were to see arnold reap box office gold in roles portraying tough nononsense individuals who used their fists guns and witty oneliners to get the job done the testosterone laden commando 1985 raw deal 1986 predator 1987 the running man 1987 and red heat 1988 were all box office hits and arnold could seemingly could no wrong when it came to picking winning scripts the tongueincheek comedy twins 1988 with costar danny de vito was a smash and won arnold new fans who saw a more comedic side to the muscle bound actor once described by australian author  tv host clive james as a condom stuffed with walnuts the spectacular total recall 1990 and feel good kindergarten cop 1990 were both solid box office performers for arnold plus he was about to return to familiar territory with director james cameron in terminator 2 1991 the second time around for the futuristic robot the production budget had grown from the initial films 65 million to an alleged 100 million for the sequel and it clearly showed as the stunning sequel bristled with amazing special effects bonecrunching chases  stunt sequences plus state of the art computergenerated imagery terminator 2 1991 was arguably the zenith of arnolds film career to date and he was voted international star of the decade by the national association of theatre owners remarkably his next film last action hero 1993 brought arnold back to earth with a hard thud as the selfsatirizing but confusing plot line of a young boy entering into a mythical hollywood action film confused movie fans even more and they stayed away in droves making the film an initial financial disaster arnold turned back to good friend director james cameron and the chemistry was definitely still there as the james bond style spy thriller true lies 1994 costarring jamie lee curtis and tom arnold was the surprise hit of 1994 following the broad audience appeal of true lies 1994 schwarzenegger decided to lean towards more familythemed entertainment with junior 1994 and jingle all the way 1996 but he still found time to satisfy his hardcore fan base with eraser 1996 as the chilling mr freeze in batman  robin 1997 and battling dark forces in the supernatural action of end of days 1999 the science fiction  conspiracy tale the 6th day 2000 played to only mediocre fan interest and collateral damage 2002 had its theatrical release held over for nearly a year after the tragic events of sept 11th 2001 but it still only received a lukewarm reception it was time again to resurrect arnolds most successful franchise and in 2003 schwarzenegger pulled on the biker leathers for the third time for

personal quotes 551i was always interested in proportion and perfection when i was 15 i took off my clothes and looked in the mirror when i stared at myself naked i realized that to be perfectly proportioned i would need 20inch arms to match the rest of me interview in starlog magazine in 1991 explaining his reluctance to do sequels to most of his successful films from the 80s theres so little time to do all the things i want to do that i cant see any reason to get bogged down in sequels everything i have ever done in my life has always stayed ive just added to it    but i will not change because when you are successful and you change you are an idiot i know that if you leave dishes in the sink they get sticky and hard to wash the next day i would rather be governor of california than own austria i love the hong kong style of action movies but that only looks good for small guys the reason why the whole style was developed over there was because those guys were very puny guys  theyre not powerfullooking guys theyre also not powerful guys theres no weightlifting champion coming out of hong kong  maybe in the bantam division or the lightweight division or something like that but normally you dont have really strong men coming out of there    they had to learn a technique that small people can do that are as effective as the big guys strength so thats where the martial arts came from in the beginning i was selfish it was all about how do i build arnold how can i win the most mr universe and mr olympic contests how can i get into the movies and get into business i was thinking about myself    as ive grown up got older maybe wiser i think your life is judged not by how much you have taken but by how much you give back during his campaign for california governor about his history of misbehavior where i did make mistakes or maybe go overboard sometimes    i regret that this is a different arnold on his fight scenes with the female tx in terminator 3 rise of the machines 2003 how many times do you get away with this  to take a woman grab her upside down and bury her face in a toilet bowl the thing is you can do it because in the end i didnt do it to a woman  shes a machine we could get away with it without being crucified by who knows what group on his decision to run for governor of california it was the most difficult decision in my life  except the one in 1978 when i decided to get a bikini wax after being pelted with an egg at a political rally this guy owes me bacon now    you cant have egg without bacon responding to criticism during a televised debate i just realized i have the perfect part for you in terminator 4 victory speech after having won election as governor of california i will not fail i will not disappoint you i will not let you down the worst i can be is the same as everybody else i hate that theres a lot of people who want me to get out of acting and want me to run for governor i think its mostly movie critics you have to remember something everybody pities the weak jealousy you have to earn i took more abuse in predator 1987 than i did in conan the barbarian 1982 i fell down that waterfall 40 feet and swam in this icecold water for days and for weeks was covered in mud it was freezing in the mexican jungle they had these heat lamps on all the time but they were no good if you stayed in front of the lamps the mud dried then you had to take it off and put new mud on again it was a nowin situation the location was tough never on flat ground always on a hill we stood all day long on a hill one leg down one leg up it was terrible referring to democrats at a political rally in ontario california in 2004 if they dont have the guts to come up here in front of you and say i dont want to represent you i want to represent those special interests the unions the trial lawyers    if they dont have the guts i call them girlie men at the 2004 republican national convention speaking of acting one of my movies was called true lies 1994 its what the democrats should have called their convention president  george bush knows you cant reason with people that are blinded by hate but let me tell you something their hate is no match for our decency their hate is no match for the leadership and the resolve of george bush talking about his conan the barbarian 1982 director john milius used to call himself the dog trainer guess who were the dogs from an interview about his reaction to reading the original the terminator 1984 screenplay i have read a lot of action adventure scripts and this definitely was one of the best i knew that i wanted to play the part of the terminator as soon as i started reading about being taken seriously i dont care the important thing to me is that im doing work that people enjoy out there that the movie makes good money that the studio makes the money back and that im having a great time at what im doing i dont even consider myself serious so how do i expect people to take me serious i think this whole hollywood thing has to be taken much looser    its just entertainment there were various steppingstones in my career one of them was conan the barbarian 1982 because it was the first time i did a film with that kind of budget and i had the title role the next big steppingstone was the terminator 1984 with the terminator i think people became aware of the fact that i didnt really have to take my shirt off or run around and expose my muscles in order to sell tickets after i did the terminator and we had seen it be more successful than the conan films people then sent me a variety of different kinds of scripts  all in the actionadventure genre but they were not muscle movies or viking movies or pirate movies or anything like that talking about playing the terminator i had to act like a cyborg which meant i couldnt show any kind of human fear or reaction to the fire explosions or gunfire that was going off around me that can be difficult when youre walking through a door with its frame on fire trying to reload a gun and at the same time thinking in the back of your mind that people have accidents doing these kinds of stunts and that it might be my turn about more sequels to the terminator 1984 i dont necessarily want to leave the magic of the terminator movies behind and who says we have to according to what we know about the future there were hundreds of terminators built the story of the terminator could go on forever from an interview expressing concern over making conan the destroyer 1984 less brutal than its predecessor conan the barbarian 1982 i think its a mistake i know sylvester stallone made an extra 20 million because he got a pg rating for rocky iii 1982 but its a matter of how much you want to stay within the characters reality can you slaughter people and never see blood is it possible you must have battles thats part of life war and the world of conan talking about director richard fleischer the first day fleischer came to see me work out he told me arnold could you put on some more muscles i couldnt believe it it turned out that fleischer thought  john milius  decision to keep conan clothed throughout the first film was a mistake fleischer believes that people want to see my body much more often than they did the first time around so they will i spend most of my time in conan the destroyer 1984 fighting off people while im dressed in a loincloth about the dog accident while making conan the barbarian 1982 one of them hit me too soon it caught me off guard and i went right over the ledge i fell ten feet and landed on my back i was covered with scratches and bruises it was probably a pretty good beginning for this movie though it set the tone for the whole time we were there this was going to be fun    but dangerous talking about director john milius there never would have been a conan movie without him on warren beatty there are some people who are close to him that say he is just starving for attention and thats the way he gets attention other people said look hes not working and he just feels like he should maybe get involved in politics instead i just think that maybe he is jealous that i did jump in i find it silly because i respect his work well i think because a lot of people dont know why im a republican i came first of all from a socialistic country which is austria and when i came over here in 1968 with the presidential elections coming up in november i came over in october i heard a lot of the press conferences from both of the candidates  hubert h humphrey and  richard nixon  and humphrey was talking about more government is the solution protectionism and everything he said about government involvement sounded to me more like austrian socialism then when i heard nixon talk about it he said open up the borders the consumers should be represented there ultimately and strengthen the military and get the government off our backs i said to myself what is this guys party affiliation i didnt know anything at that point so i asked my friend what is nixon hes a republican and i said i am a republican thats how i became a republican on refusing to grant clemency to condemned killer stanley tookie williams after studying the evidence searching the history listening to the arguments and wrestling with the profound consequences i could find no justification for granting clemency the facts do not justify overturning the jurys verdict or the decisions of the courts in this case after undergoing heart surgery in 1997 we made actually history because it was the first time ever that doctors could prove that a lifelong republican has a heart as a kid  as a kid i saw socialist  the socialist country that austria became after the soviets left now dont misunderstand me i love austria and i love the austrian people but i always knew that america was the place for me in school when the teacher would talk about america i would daydream about coming here i would daydream about living here i would sit there and watch for hours american movies transfixed by my heroes like john wayne everything about america seemed so big to me so open so possible i have no sexual standards in my head that say this is good or this is bad homosexual  that only means to me that he enjoys sex with a man and i enjoy sex with a woman its all legitimate to me i didnt think about money i thought about the fame about just being the greatest i was dreaming about being some dictator of a country or some savior like jesus im 62 ive heard rumors that im really much shorter in real lifelike 56 or something like that  which is ridiculous i can assureyou this is not the case people look up to me and not just because i do a lot of work in the community i mean most people really look up to me california will not wait for our federal government to take strong action on global warming we wont wait for the federal government we will move forward because we know its the right thing to do we will lead on this issue and we will get other western states involved i think theres not great leadership from the federal government when it comes to protecting the environment money doesnt make you happy i now have 50 million but i was just as happy when i had 48 million in a 1987 interview i have to give the audiences what they enjoy seeing while i try to bring in a little something new with different movies different time periods and all those things but whats important is to entertain the people  everything else means nothing on his late friend and role model body builder reg park reg was a dear friend an extraordinary mentor and a personal hero other than my parents there may be no single person who had more to do with me becoming the person i am today than reg he was like a second father to me it was reg who impressed upon me how hard i would have to work if i wanted to achieve my dreams ill always remember him making me do calfraises with 1000 pounds at 5 oclock in the morning on terminator salvation 2009 i think its cool to continue on with the franchise in case i want to jump over again and get into the acting after im through here as governor of california there are such high standards and now there are always new standards being set for action you see that with iron man 2008 and with the dark knight 2008 and that other film this summer um wanted 2008 that was an excellent movie there was this train coming down from a bridge falling and theyre fighting inside the train car jesus that is unbelievable that you can do that to have the imagination to write it and the talent to shoot it and make it real on the screen its a whole new dimension with batman and terminator those big movies theres a certain expectation and if you dont live up to it if the movie is not a 10 then the business will be soft if terminator salvation 2009 is pushing it forward it will be breaking records all the time if director mc g has the t4 and the kind of shots that has the audience thinking now how did he do that  then it is terminator and you can blow everyone away and every record at the box office on terminator salvation 2009 i hope they do well and i hope it is a huge hit i do hope it creates a spectacle on the screen that is what james cameron created on watching will ferrell movies in those you howl for two hours and you feel like you get a sixpack of ab muscles from all the laughs on terminator salvation 2009 i wasnt sure who the terminator was i dont know if there is one or if hes the star or the hero these are the things that determine the success and how strong the movie will be i know california is supposed to be a place where dreams come true but my life has gone way beyond the dream my dream was to come to america become the greatest bodybuilder of all time and do what reg park had done by going into hercules movies and if that worked out i was going to build a gym business and then live happily ever after then all of a sudden i shot right by my dream i stopped doing the strong man stuff did the terminator movies and became the highestpaid actor in hollywood i got 30 million for terminator 3 rise of the machines 2003 you know on the death of michael jackson michael was a pop phenomenon who never stopped pushing the envelope of creativity though there were serious questions about his personal life michael was undoubtedly a great entertainer and his popularity spanned generations and the globe on the death of patrick swayze patrick swayze was a talented and passionate artist who struck a memorable chord with audiences throughout the world he played a wide range of characters both on stage and in movies and his celebrated performances made the hard work of acting look effortless  which i know from experience is not easy as a fan and as an actor i admired patrick and i know that he will be dearly missed on behalf of all californians maria and i send our deepest condolences to patricks family friends and fans i am here to spend i love to spend hollywoods money june 1993 on sylvester stallone in the expendables 2010 it is a great inspiration for people to see someone at his age still at the top of his game  acting writing directing doing his own stunts and fight scenes  i mean what an amazing talent and for him to still be so athletic and be able to rip off his shirt and have a sixpack is just unbelievable on the death of tony curtis tony curtis was a hollywood icon a great performer and artist and devoted family man i saw his extraordinary talent and ability to inspire generations of americans firsthand on the set of christmas in connecticut 1992 and will always remember our times together on a return to movies when his term as governor of california ends i have no idea so it depends if someone comes with a great script or a great ideayou know would i still have the patience to sit on the set and to do a movie for three months or six months all of those things i dont know but i did have a meeting with james cameron we talked about some very important things the meaning of life is not simply to exist to survive but to move ahead to go up to achieve to conquer on the power of visualizing your goals when i was very young i visualized myself being and having what it was that i wanted the mind is really so incredible before i won my first mr universe i walked around the tournament like i owned it the title was already mine i had won it so many times in my mind that there was no doubt i would win it then when i moved on to the movies the same thing i visualized myself being a successful actor and earning big money i could feel and taste success i just knew it would happen on the passing of elaine kaufman elaine was an early supporter of my acting career and would often call to let me know when an influential writer or producer came in so i could stop and schmooze on terminator salvation 2009 the last one was awful it tried hard not that they didnt try the acting and everything  it missed the boat on visiting venice california this place is insane you never have to smoke a joint you just go on a bicycle ride in the morning inhale and you live off everyone else on predator 2 1990 a predator in a city is a bad idea on his career as a bodybuilder i had a very clear vision of where i wanted to go you realize you have to pay no attention to the naysayers when you learn those lessons in sports you can apply those lessons for the rest of your life on his governors salary i didnt take a penny of my salary during my terms after all it was petty cash compared to what you make in the movies you cant have a life full of successes in bodybuilding i tried benchpressing 500lb many times and failed thats how you get there you have to be daring theyre writing right now terminator genisys 2015 there have been some writers on it for the last yearandahalf and they could not pull it off we have told them over and over that they are going in the wrong direction now theyve finally got rid of those writers and theyve got new really quality writers now theyre going in the right direction i think this year the script will be finished and we will be able to go into preproduction on the death of his mentor joe weider he advised me on my training on my business ventures and once bizarrely claimed i was a german shakespearean actor to get me my first acting role in  hercules in new york 1970 even though i barely spoke english he was there for me constantly throughout my life and i will miss him dearly his father a lot of sons would have been crippled by his demands but instead the discipline rubbed off on me i turned it into drive to this day im more comfortable when theres someone to schmooze with until i fall asleep when you grow up in a harsh environment you never forget how to withstand physical punishment even long after the hard times end if you wanted a girl you had to make an effort to have a conversation not just drool like a horny dog i associate glasses with intellectuals i came to america won mr universe and now im in the movies most bodybuilders dont have very interesting insights or routines in america unlike europe there werent a million obstacles to starting a business after coming to california i posed in the heights above malibu bodybuilders like this spot because the ridges in the distance seem little and your muscles look bigger than the mountains the applause of a crowd made me stronger if you get muscles you can go to the beach and pick up girls americans love foreign names i wanted to be rich very quickly monstrous futuristic what i envisioned america as all about something that seems impossible at the start can be achieved on sweat its a great way to lose body fat nights without sleep dont mean you cant perform at a high level the next day and days without food dont mean youll starve i aimed to be a leader someday if you let ego show through youre put in your place on journalists they see everything from the outside staying on top of the hill is harder than climbing it its great to have someone to go home to when you have a relationship in a foreign language you have to be extra careful not to miscommunicate i couldnt believe how difficult learning a new language could be pronunciations were especially dangerous mr universe mr world and mr olympia winning all three would be like unifying the heavyweight title in boxing it would make me the undisputed world champion mr world was by far the biggest bodybuilding event id ever seen in bodybuilding i was king of the mountain but in everyday la i was just another immigrant struggling to learn english and make a life i was glad to be away living my own life i always saw myself as a citizen of the world the more popular bodybuilding grew in prisons the more guys would get the message to behave winning narrowly didnt make me feel good i wanted my dominance to be clear after his father had a stroke it was painful and upsetting to see a man who had been so smart and so strong lose his coordination and his ability to think he died not long after his nephew patrick he became my pride and joy real estate was the place to invest the math of real estate really spoke to me i like to always wander in like a puppy bodybuilders look in the mirror as they train you need to be your own trainer if millions of people came to see my movies someday it was important that they know where the muscles came from i wanted to promote bodybuilding both so that more people would take part and to benefit my career if i wanted to promote bodybuilding to a new audience id have to find my own way on bodybuilding it needed fresh blood i find joy in the gym because every rep and every set gets me one step closer to my goal i liked getting swept up into a cloud of celebs on jack nicholson warren beatty and roman polanski they all had such enormous passion for their profession having women in the gym made us train harder i had no idea that reading from a script means youre supposed to act out the role personal motto presentation presentation presentation when somebody sets the bar so low you cant go wrong endorsing bodybuilding publicly it was a boost for bodybuilding in america suddenly the sport had a face and a personality in an entertainment interview you could just make up stuffin bodybuilding you try to suppress emotions and march forwards with determination in acting its the opposite to live your life as an actor you cant be afraid of someone stirring up your emotions europe was always far less puritanical than the united states sometimes its hard to explain to your toddler what you do at the office ive been retired from bodybuilding since 1980 but ill always stay involved during his openheart surgery maria shriver put a brave face on a scary situation i get goosebumps when nelson mandela talks about inclusion tolerance and forgiveness on maria shriver if i hadnt been her style and she hadnt been mine we never would have ended up together maria meshed with everything that i was what i stood for and what i was doing i got addicted to her maria was such a forceful personality that she would just run over guys she wanted to be unique and different i was a selfmade man in politics when disputes arise and camps form you have to grasp whats happening and move very quickly i could go on for hours about what draws me to maria shriver but still never fully explain the magic love stories are built around peoples idiosyncrasies on conan the barbarian there was no stunt double because it would have been difficult to find someone with a body like mine dino de laurentiis had a reputation for getting things done he was very powerful in that way and people in hollywood knew it and didnt mess with him on conan the barbarian 1982 id never done a love scene on camera and found it really strange my character and his stolen harley were a perfect combo of cyborg and machine in terminator 2 1991 our first major decision as a couple he and maria shriver was to find a house and call it our place when people come to me with a movie concept or a script i always ask what is the poster what is the image what are we trying to sell here danny de vito is a master of comedy loves stogies and cooks pasta on the setno wonder he made such a great twin ivan reitman took a chance on me as a comic hero sylvester stallone bruce willis and i had great fun opening planet hollywood restaurants around the world total anonymity is almost impossible in hollywood the outside world looked at our relationship he and maria shriver in a simpleminded way as a juicy success story according to this way of thinking maria becomes part of my trophy collection on maria shriver she brought a great foundation of knowledge and was a great partner to work with because we both grew when you start out its all about one to one contact id always advanced by starting with a clear vision and working as hard as possible to achieve it for maria shriver to go out and be in front of the camera was a real declaration of independence on maria shriver she was the ideal woman for me writing something is different from saying it i was conan and millions of dollars were being spent to make me shine for the first time i felt like the star on oprah winfrey she was talented and aggressive and you could tell she believed in herself an aspect of being a kennedy cousin maria shriver was that you were never completely free since there were so many cousins the number of command performances were high every one of the killings in conan the barbarian was well shot and extraordinary on conan the barbarian 1982 a star wars episode iv  a new hope 1977 set on earth john milius always pushed the envelope conan the barbarian has stunts that have since been outlawed from movies the bloodshed in conan seems tame by todays standards at the time the film introduced a whole new dimension of violence on screen actors had five quarts of blood strapped to their chests the same amount in the human body whenever it was spilled milius shot it against a light background to get the full carnage i was really annoyed by the way that powerful studio executives kowtowed to the members of the ratings board i saw myself as a businessman first on ronald reagan he was wonderful at painting ideas in ways that everyone could understand my definition of living is to have excitement always thats the difference between living and existing if you want to fight prejudice you have to have tolerance centers everywhere i was amazed to see how negative most of the people in hollywood remained toward reagan during his presidency he represented the values that had brought me to america the us was the greatest country with the best opportunities and now that it was my home i wanted to keep it that way and make it even better after the turmoil and gloom of the 1970s americans voted for reagan because he reminded them of their strength the outrageous and conservative sides to his personality i wanted to feel comfortable in both worlds there has to be investment in the public good id have made more money if jimmy carter still occupied the white house you do a movie or a book you promote the hell out of it you travel the world as if its your marketplace and in the meantime you work out and take care of business and explore even more when i learned about the terminator 1984 i loved the idea that he was a machine that never had to sleep for me the question was always how to fit in all the stuff i want to do i seldom saw my life as hectic the thought rarely crossed my mind im not a religious person i never like to cut things from my life i only add id felt like an american from the time i was 10 years old his first thought when he met james cameron a skinny intense guy i never went to a competition to compete i went to win i wasnt sure i was free from prejudice id made prejudiced comments when you promote a movie you want to win over everybody if you give political speeches you are bound to turn off somebody i considered the us my permanent home i kept quiet about politics whenever i visited austria i never wanted to be perceived as some wise guy coming back and telling people what to do i always believed in shooting for the top and to become an american is like becoming a member of the winning team his first thought about the terminator 1984 strange name poses are the snapshots and the routine is the movie bodybuilding is a lot like politics you go from town to town hoping word will spread on bodybuilding competitions you cant just pose on stage like a robot and then walk off people will never get to know your personality at the top of the ladder there was always room for one more the more people who stay on the bottom the more crowded it becomes if i can see it and believe it then i can achieve it on james cameron he seemed more real than the people i met from hollywood on the terminator 1984 no thinking no blinking no thought just action on restaurants in hollywood the actor never pays once ive locked in on a vision for myself i always resist changing the plan im a big believer in hard work grinding it out and not stopping until its done on james cameron the women he married although a long list were women you didnt want to mess with i never left the house without 1000 in cash and a nolimit credit card the conventional wisdom in hollywood is that playing a villain is career suicide i think more like a businessman than like a typical actor compared to conan the barbarian 1982 conan the destroyer 1984 was a trip to club med on james cameron a control freak he has eyes in the back of his head he knows the name of everyone on the set and no screwup gets past him if you screw up hell make a scene publicly and embarrass you i always think the world of people who make a project their own and are on it 24 hours a day the golden raspberry awards a kind of oscar in reverse for bad movies you should marry when youre set financially and the toughest struggles of your career are behind you most marriages break up over financial issues i wasnt marrying her  maria shriver because she came from wealth what was marias was hers  maria shriver s portrait in his art collection among these beautiful images marias was the gem on jacqueline kennedy she had an amazing ability to ask questions that would make you wonder how did she know that she always made people feel welcome gitte  brigitte nielsen had a personality filled with laughter and fun mixed with a great hunger for attention when you make a movie you can never really predict what will turn out to be the most repeated line on the terminator the american public accepted me as both a hero and a villain in the mind of the public the star is responsible for a movies success on marriage just let me stumble into it i dont want to be forewarned you can overthink anything there are always negatives the more you know the less you tend to do something on marriage i might not have done it if id known everything id have to go through im always comparing life to a climb not just because theres a struggle but also because i find at least as much joy in the climbing as in reaching the top i pictured marriage as a whole mountain range of fantastic challenges on grace jones an interesting nonactor talented and entertaining she could not do anything lowkey have at least ten good laughs a day the makeup trailer is the place on the set where everyone talks if anybodys worried about anything thats where you see it its the mother of all beauty salons the makeup trailer is all about a soothing atmosphere because youre getting ready for a scene actresses have more problems than the average housewife on his wedding day i loved watching maria shriver coming up the aisle she looked so regal but at the same time she radiated warmth and happiness i was riding the great wave of action movies they became as important to the 1980s as westerns were in the 1950s action movies are always more of an ordeal than a pleasure to make on john mc tiernan if a director of his caliber had done the sequel to predator 1987 the movie could have become a major franchise on a par with the terminator 1984 or die hard 1988 its always easy to be smart in hindsight stallone and i were the leading forces in the genre we created work for up and coming action stars like chuck norris jeanclaude van damme dolph lundgren and bruce willis clint eastwood began to show more muscle as a result the body was key the era had arrived where muscular men were viewed as attractive looking physically heroic had become the aesthetic early in my movie career the hardest thing was giving up control in bodybuilding everything had been up to me in movies you depend on others right from the start on the opening scene you have one idea and then sit down and cook up the rest whenever i finished filming a movie my job was only half done every film had to be nurtured in the marketplace some of the greatest artists never sold much because they didnt know how no matter what i did in life i was aware that you had to sell it listening made me a more effective promoter you have to cultivate your audience and expand it with each new film nurturing a movie means paying attention to the distributors you do the things they feel are important because they go all out in pushing the theatres when i had a good director my movies went through the roof because i was directed well if i had a director who was confused with no compelling vision for the movie it would fizzle i didnt make the terminator the success that it was it was james cameron s vision that made the movie great everything in life has a funny side id always been the perfect target for jokes there was so much material to work from meeting comedians helped me to understand comedy i really liked being around people who are funny on total recall 1990 working with sharon stone will always be a challenge she was a sweetie off the set but needed tons of attention onset there are just some actors who need more attention people just have their hangups and insecurities and acting definitely brings that out in acting you take criticism so much more personally you get upset but every job has its downside on paul verhoeven and total recall 1990 so many things he said were brilliant he had a masterful vision he had enthusiasm and did a great job i was proud my interest and passion helped to bring about the movie but the experience also proves how important marketing is  how important it is to tell the people what this is about really blow up their skirt and make them say i have to go see this movie a special achievement oscar is how the motion picture academy honors an accomplishment for which there is no set category i grew up in a culture where you respect the elders when i see a great performer i always start to dream maybe its the leo in me the perpetual performer who always wants to be the center of attention starting with something disarming and funny is a good way to stand out you become more likable and people receive your information much better whenever i watched a comedy i always thought i could have done that but if i was going to branch into comedies i would need someone to be my cheerleader on total recall 1990 for me it connected with the sense i had sometimes that my life was too good to be true it wouldnt matter if you watched total recall 1990 20 years from now you could still enjoy it theres just something very appealing about futuristic movies if they have great action and believable characters a change in studio management can sink a movie once you pick a director you have to have total faith in him and go with his judgment on the running man 1987 it was totally screwed up by hiring a firsttime director and not giving him time to prepare his first impression of paul verhoeven on total recall 1990 a skinny intenselooking dutch guy every director wants to pee on the script and make his mark on danny de vito hes the opposite of a crazy hollywood personality and the milton berle of comic acting compared to an action hero it was easier being a comic star his singing ability im no frank sinatra the only time i sing in real life is at the end of a party when i want the guests to leave on george bush he had tremendous strength of character and will this was our next president the real american hero he had a casual approach to campaigning not everything had to be perfect i belonged to the nra because i believed in the constitutional right to bear arms i am a patriotic american i saw ronald reagan and george bush take an economy that looked like peewee herman and make it look like superman eisenhower and kennedy championed fitness as a way for america to stand strong against the soviets fitness is important for all americans not just athletes a lot of schools have great athletic programs but not great fitness programs id never seen a director finetune a movie as methodically as ivan reitman i was on a crusade around the world to promote health and fitness to young people governments dont want to be told theyre doing something wrong id always felt we lacked real men in movies when his first child was born fuck this is my first baby you can be so overwhelmed by something that billions of people in history have done and from that moment on your life as a couple has changed but as long as you love the baby youll figure it out just like with everything you love doing caring for babies is hardwired into the brain i was addicted to public service humour was what made me stand out from other action leads it opened up the action movie and made it appealing to more people on the terminator 1984 commando 1985 predator 1987 and total recall 1990 they all focused on the universal theme of good vs evil if the press sees you coming out of the oval office with the president youll win respect fitness is fun i felt very strongly that i had to carry to all 50 states the message that fitness was a national priority i love being on the road and meeting people thats what i do best the great american workout was from 7 to 9 oclock in the morning when in austria i often put on traditional clothes and do as the austrians do hiking in the alps id sometimes wear loud obnoxious hawaiian shorts just to get a rise out of the lederhosen traditionalists on james cameron he is a big believer in surprising the audience his knowledge of science and the world of the future went way beyond the ordinary on terminator 2 1991 it was typical james cameron genius to have character development in a machine my friendship with the president george bush sr quickly became a very big part of my life it was warm from the time we first met during the reagan years on the gulfstream iii jet the perfect vehicle for visiting the states after being the fitness czar running for governor of california felt like deja vu my talent is fitness and this is something i can give back you cant have people just like your movie you need them to be passionate word of mouth is what makes movies big because while you can put in millions to promote the movie on the first weekend you cant afford to do that every week its embarrassing to fail at the box office when you feel embarrassed you assume the whole world is focused on your failure on george bush if you had talent and did him a favour or he liked you he would push you forward whether it made sense or not he was a different breed a sweetheart of a guy the fact he put such trust in me had a powerful effect i felt there would never ever be a time no matter what happened when i would violate that trust or let the man down a persons muscles dont care where the resistance comes from america wouldnt be the land of the free if it wasnt the home of the brave when you see the work they do and the risks they take you realize what we owe our military1991 was golden for me on planet hollywood a glitzy new moneymaking machine it was not just an event it was the beginning of an empire i came to america because its the greatest place in the world and im going to do everything i can to keep it the greatest place ive always felt appreciative of the armed forces because ive benefited from the american dream and their courage and determination is what safeguards it during conan the destroyer 1984 im finally getting paid a million dollars for a movie but now sylvester stallone s making 3 million i feel like im standing still if i heard an idea or saw a script that was exceptionally good and triggered something in me i wanted to make that movie i loved the idea of new challenges along with new dangers of failure clint eastwood was one of the few hollywood personalities who had his head screwed on straight richard nixon was very good at paying attention to you we need more leaders like him nobody in hollywood wins all the time at some point youre bound to get a beating america can be powerful only if you have a strong military i figured that the idea of eventually ending up in politics was not that far fetched when someone like richard nixon suggested it i love factories and whenever im passionate about a product i want to see it being made cubans are geniuses they have the best climate they have the best soil and they have the tradition generations of people who are passionate about rolling cigars and who are always looking for ways to make the cigars ever more perfect when you look at a cigar and it has those thick veins in it its either a cheaper cigar or someone wasnt paying attention as with everything its important to have a greatlooking label cuban cigars truly are as good as people say you can sniff out the fakes ones within seconds i always like to be called up for a speech without any prior notice noone expects you to blow people up in a comedy when you feel good about someone and you know specifically why its not difficult at all to speak from the heart im like a little kid who loves to show off and share things that i have experienced i thought i was the poster boy for the american dream i came to the us virtually broke worked hard kept focused on my goal and made it this really was the land of opportunity if a kid like me could do it anybody could i had a fire inside of me to succeed anything is possible but you have to do your end of the work making money was never my only goal but money opened the door to interesting investments in the mid1990s the internet was just an odd new idea the most important thing was not how much you make but how much you invest how much you keep i never wanted to join the long list of famous entertainers and athletes who wiped out financially my goal was to get rich and stay rich i never like business relationships that are purely work his personal motto take one dollar and turn it into two i wanted big investments that were interesting creative and different conservative bets didnt interest me i was proud to pay taxes on the money i earned i could tolerate big risks in exchange for big returns but im always open to new ideas singapore airlines had the best reputation in the airline business the boeing 747 was the ballsiest airliner stan winston s special effects studio was torture on the terminator it took 30 minutes for the cement to dry when designing the prosthetics to cover my face the first time i went through it i got very anxious and thought of pleasant memories to endure it my heart surgery reminded me of all that the more you promote yourself as the ultimate action hero the more people form a larger than life perception of you after heart surgery i felt as vigorous as hercules planet hollywood opened in moscow sydney helsinki london san antonio texas drawing 100000 spectators and paris planet hollywood was like the beatles sometimes when you look at a deal you see less danger and youre too willing to take the plunge the more risky things are the more upside there is id hear guys bragging about their new gulfstream iv or ivsp and id get to say thats great guys let me talk about my 747 it was a great conversation stopper god is the one who made the science possible on heart surgery big risk big reward on maria shriver she had a tendency to blow things up into high drama even things that werent life and death whereas i would play everything down im a person who does not like to talk about things over and over i make quick decisions i dont ask opinions and i dont think over the same things i want to move on shes an outward processor while i keep things bottled up theres a moment going into surgery that i really hate the moment when the anesthesia takes hold when you know youre going out losing consciousness and dont know if youll ever wake up from it after heart surgery i got a second or third lease on lifeon planet hollywood id love to do it again only to have it managed better whoopi goldberg bruce willis sly stallone and all the other bigname participants would tell you that planet hollywood was fun with the huge parties openings premieres we met people all over the world and had the time of our lives she  maria shriver is a very good writer with an unbelievable vocabulary and grace with words holidays become more meaningful when you have a family talking to kids in your second language is never easy to do after i came to america i learned to think a bit more about my family rather than just myself with my mother i built a good relationship where she and i really communicated i loved doing things for my mother she deserved to be treated like a queen she was buried next to my father because they were so connected youre just one person and the country is much bigger and its what will live forever bigtime celebrities dont like flying commercial promotion and merchandising were realms i truly understood on california americas golden state america is my true home i wasnt interested in symbols i was interested in action big cats have always fascinated me independent producers are the saviours in hollywood because theyll take risks that the big studios wont i love shooting at night because i have a lot of energy at night and i get lots of inspiration on heart surgery it gave me energy beyond belief i feel like a totally new person and i no longer had to convince people that i still had a pulse on being governor he can bring a vision to the state you get blamed for everything and you get credit for everything its high risk high reward i felt tremendous loyalty and pride about california i wanted america to stay the bastion of free enterprise and protect it from following europe in the direction of bureaucracy and stagnation you make a big mistake to lock in programs that require you to keep spending at boomtime levels the more i read up on california the more it was like bad news piled on top of bad news we cant continue this way we need change i was fiscally conservative probusiness against raising taxes prochoice progay prolesbian proenvironment proreasonable gun control proreasonable social safety net we needed to avoid trying to win over the press and instead play to the people i was all about leadership and major projects and reforms that could attract massive public support i pride myself on being able to juggle many tasks i got a college education while bodybuilding married maria shriver in the middle of filming predator and made kindergarten cop and terminator 2 while launching planet hollywood most juvenile crime is committed between 3 and 6 oclock in the afternoon i would not go into a competition with a disadvantage if you dont get killed you win i thought i would never die winning the title of mr universe it is my lifetime realized i am very happy to be mr universe i say it again it sounds so good i am very happy to be mr universe my thanks to everyone in england who have helped me they have been very kind to me thank you all los angeles stood out because it was the only big city that had afterschool programs in every one of its 90 elementary schools state officials and lawmakers just didnt see afterschool programs as important afterschool programs not only help the kids but also reduce the strain on the teachers young kids relate better to young people especially after a whole day of teachers and school they want counsellors in jeans and with spiky hair who can serve as parent figures but who dont look like them  not that many retired teachers want to go back to work the reason i wanted to be healthy was that i never wanted to ask anyone for money it was so against my grain raising cash from the set of a movie was a huge advantage i had a track record of organizing summits across fifty states i loved seeing wounded veterans and entertaining them and thanking them for their great work id assumed that a recall would be just like a normal election i never argued with people who underestimated me if the accent and the muscles and the movies made people think i was stupid it worked to my advantage our elected leaders will either act decisively or we will act in their place governorship i would give up my movie career for that californians love their cars spend no more than the state is taking in its hard for any governor to make the changes that were needed i loved it when people say that something cant be done thats when i really get motivated i like to prove them wrong and i liked the idea of working on something bigger than me california it is the place in the world where everyone wants to go it was wrapped in problems but it was also heaven there is a disconnect between the people of california and the politicians of california we the people are doing our job work hard pay taxes raise our families the politicians are not doing their job they fiddle they fumble and they fail these words resonated more strongly than any movie script id read baghdad the wild driving the poverty no money and a leadership vacuum  like california right now i was not the least bit intimidated by the thought of a campaign it was like every other major decision id faced i thought about winning i knew it would happen i was locked in automatic pilot as every spouse knows you have to pick the right moment to bring up a loaded subject when i came here california was a beacon why he wanted to become governor of california im tired of this acting stuff i need a new challenge in politics everybody knows everything youre totally exposed when i met maria shriver she was full of life excitement and hunger for the world she wanted to be a rebel not have a job on capitol hill whatever she maria shriver wanted to do i would help her get there one side of maria shriver was ballsy and brave and wanted to be a strong partner making a career decision had always been an incredible high making a career decision as a husband and a father was a whole different deal declaring a candidacy was so loaded california is more important than everyones career is firefighting a macho enough profession for an action hero the real life heroism at ground zero laid that question to rest elected officials usually hate ballot initiatives because they reduce their power and make the state harder to govern republicans and unions usually dont mix i wanted to know what it really took to run for office given that i wasnt a typical candidate i remember marvelling at how ordinary citizens could limit the states power i took pride in my financial independence leave no stone unturned i always paid close attention to focus groups and surveys and in politics opinion research plays an even bigger role being governor of california this was the best job i ever had there is no contradiction in being both a republican and an environmentalist for me talking convincingly about the future was easy all i had to do was point to what wed achieved since i came into office california politics was this big centrifuge that forced voters policies and parties away from the center i challenged californians to stop yielding to the far left and the far right and return to the center centrist does not mean weak or watered down or warmed over it means well balanced and well grounded the american people are instinctively centrist so should be our government americas political parties should return to the center where the people are the left and the right dont have a monopoly on conscience we are not waiting for politics for our problems to get worse or for the federal government because the future does not wait not only can we lead california into the future we can show the nation and the world how to get there politics you get so immersed in the job there are side effects on the people you love even if you succeed in protecting your wife and kids from the public spotlight they feel theyre sharing and losing you trying to reform health care had almost destroyed bill clinton s presidency id always thought it was a disgrace that the greatest country in the world didnt provide a health care system for all of its people as many european countries do our health care reform became americas and california led the way all the great ideas come from local governments i am of the reagan view that we should not go off the cliff with flags flying the california republican party should be a right of center party that occupies the broad middle of california even when acting in a movie i would not shoot a stunt if i hadnt rehearsed it a minimum of ten times president bush jr was always available to talk if i raised only one issue at a time i would get a fair hearing if you need to do something thats not in the manual throw the manual out never bullshit the statistics in the wake of a disaster are always tragic when the federal government meddles in markets the states pay the price when youre spending more money than youre taking in you cut spending simple adlibbing can backfire when youre running for governor im not really the crying type its painful to have just endorsed things that you now have no money for i felt like a schmuck backing out on commitments i wanted to make but could no longer afford the consequences of cuts are not just dollars but people were all getting screwed i was forced to make unpopular decisions that nobody least of all me was happy about on his children the drama of the presidential election interested them more than my job i believe in sprinting through to the finish line all great movements in history start out on a grassroots level not in places like washington or paris or moscow or beijing im proud to say i found a way to cram 36 hours of work into a single day budget negotiations are no different than grueling five hour weight lifting sessions in the gym the joy of working out is that with each painful rep you get a step closer to achieving your goal i was deeply frustrated with party leaders and the press for not making plain the budget history when i stepped up to the podium i was overwhelmed to realize i was standing where john f kennedy nelson mandela and mikhail gorbachev had all addressed the un before me unlike regular politicians i had nothing to lose six years of ups and downs forged me as a governor i had more forward momentum than ever before i felt more like a hungry eagle rather than a lame duck the key to real permanent reform is being in sync with the hearts and minds of the people we had rattled so many cages on the left and the right with our reforms of all the things ive done with my life nothing is seared in my memory more than looking into the eyes of someone who has just lost everything he loved in the world being governor was more complex and challenging than i had imagined thats the problem of presenting yourself as the governator you can do miracles but not the kind that require wearing a cape and being able to fly as governor youre neither a solitary champion nor a star compared to making a movie when you accomplish something in government the satisfaction is so much larger and long lasting in a movie you are entertaining people for a few hours in a dark theatre in government you are affecting entire lives generations even change takes big balls ive always idolized mikhail gorbachev because of the courage it took to dismantle the political system that he grew up under for gorbachev to have the guts to embrace change rather than further oppress his people or pick fights with the west has always amazed me fitness promotes health and enhances the quality of life lying to maria shriver about his infidelity instead of doing the right thing id just put the truth in a mental compartment and locked it up where i didnt deal with it every day on his illegitimate son politically i didnt feel it was anybodys business because i hadnt campaigned on family values if i was going to talk about bad behavior i wanted to do it on my own timetable although maria shriver and i remain separated i still try to treat everyone as if we are together maria has a right to be bitterly disappointed and never look at me the same way again what had made my career fun for more than 30 years was sharing it with maria shriver wed done everything together and now there was no one to come home to a green global economy is desirable necessary and within reach you start reading scripts and visualizing the scene and how to direct it how to choreograph the stunt and then you get into it and then you look forward to doing it normally an action star keeps to himself on the set theres a difference between being 35 and almost 65 university of southern california it prides itself on being neither conservative nor liberal but open minded it operates by promoting discussion to draw the best ideas from the brightest minds across the political spectrum the great leaders always talk about things that are much bigger than themselves they say working for a cause that will outlive us is what brings meaning and joy the more im able to accomplish in the world the more i agree i always wanted to be an inspiration for people but i never set out to be a role model in everything its never been my goal to set an example in everything i do i dont believe that violence onscreen creates violence on the street or in the home otherwise there would have been no murders before movies were invented and the bible is full of them i prefer being way out there shocking people rebelliousness is part of what drove me from austria being outrageous is a way to succeed no one could put me in a mold being different was right up my alley life is richer when we embrace the multitudes we all contain impossible was a word i loved to ignore when i was governor the only way to make the possible possible is to try the impossible if you fail so what thats what everybody expects but if you succeed you make the world a much better place never follow the crowd go where its empty its easier to stand out when you aim straight for the top no matter what you do in life selling is part of it you can do the finest work and if people dont know you have nothing the most important thing is to make people aware on muhammad ali i always admired him because he was a champion had a great personality and he was generous and always thoughtful toward others if all athletes could be like him the world would be better off dont overthink if you think all the time the mind cannot relax part of us needs to go through life instinctively turning off your mind is an art knowledge is extremely important for making decisions the more knowledge you have the more youre free to rely on your instincts the more you know the more you hesitate when you are not confident of your decisionmaking process it will slow you down overthinking is why people cant sleep at night it cripples you many movie deals are made under pressure and if you freeze you lose to test yourself and grow you have to operate without a safety net forget plan b if there is no plan b then plan a has to work you can use outrageous humour to settle a score what are the odds for an austrian farm boy to come to america and become the greatest bodybuilding champion of all time to get in the movie business marry a kennedy and then get elected governor of the biggest state in the united states if government is not taking in enough revenue because of an economic slowdown then everyone should chip in and sacrifice writing out my goals became second nature and so did the conviction that there are no shortcuts it took hundreds and even thousands of repetitions for me to learn to hit a great threequarter back pose deliver a punchline dance the tango in true lies 1994 paint a beautiful birthday card and say ill be back just the right way i have come to feel great affection for the peoples of the world because they have always been so welcoming to me whether as a bodybuilder a movie star a private citizen or as governor of the great state of california dont blame your parents theyve done their best for you and if theyve left you with problems those problems are now yours to solve i could channel my upbringing in a positive way rather than complain i could use it to have a vision set goals find joy i dont have to lick my wounds sometimes you have to appreciate the very people and circumstances that traumatized you today i hail the strictness of my upbringing and the fact i didnt have anything i wanted in austria because those were the very factors that made me hungry it put fuel on the fire in my belly it drove and motivated me there are a thousand keys to success on his infidelity it was one of those stupid things that i promised myself never to do a lot of people no matter how successful or unsuccessful in life make stupid choices involving sex secrecy is just part of me i keep things to myself no matter what im not a person who was brought up to talk bodybuilders who are blind to themselves or deaf to others usually fall behind on mr universe i wanted to win it so decisively that people would forget id ever lost take care of your body and your mind focusing on the body was no problem for me i realized that the mind is a muscle and we should train it too if world leaders have time to work out so do you gorbachev dismantling the ussr im amazed by the courage it took to not go for immediate gratification but to look for the best direction for the country in the long run to me gorbachev is a hero at the same level as nelson mandela who overcame the anger and despair of 27 years in prison when given the power to shake the world both of them chose to build rather than destroy on pope john paul ii balancing his duties with an exercise regime if that guy can do it ive got to get up even earlierbe hungry for success hungry to make your mark hungry to be seen and to be heard and to have an effect and as you move up and become successful make sure also to be hungry for helping others dont rest on your laurels too many former athletes spend their lives talking about how great they were 20 years ago so many accomplished people just coast they wish they could still be somebody and not just talk about the past there is much more to life than being the greatest at one thing we learn so much when were successful so why not use what youve learned use your connections and do more with them if you have a talent or skill that makes you happy use it to improve your neighborhood and if you feel a desire to do more then go all out youll have plenty of time to rest when youre in the grave live a risky and spicy life and like eleanor roosevelt said every day do something that scares you we should all stay hungrymemoirs are about looking back but ive lived my life by the opposite principle at home i have a hundred photo albums starting with my childhood in austria and i never look at them id rather do another project or make another movie and learn from looking forward on his autobiography total recall digging up and piecing together memories proved to be as difficult as i imagined and yet what made the work unexpectedly enjoyable was the help i got from others i found myself swapping stories with old friends from the worlds of bodybuilding business sports hollywood and politics  a large cast of characters im grateful to all of them for helping me recreate the past and for making it immediate and friendly finally i thank my family they were generous in helping me make sure this memoir delivers on its name and thanks especially to maria shriver for her patience with the project and for remaining as always the person i could go to whenever i got stuck if i accomplished and solidified my position in the bodybuilding world from then on i would be on a roll nobody would stop me there is no such thing as an austrian shakespearean actor it doesnt exist youre not supposed to laugh on the film set when youre not on camera stay in character act your part giving it everything you have in order to draw the best out of the actor who is being filmed it was very difficult for me in the beginning  i was told by agents and casting people that my body was too weird that i had a funny accent and that my name was too long you name it and they told me i had to change it basically everywhere i turned i was told that i had no chance a few months ago i got rearended by this guy he took off and i chased him i will admit i drove at a slightly excessive speed i cut him off and two guys jumped out of the car looking tough but when they saw me they just said oh shit the terminator they were nice and gave me their information on terminator genisys 2015 it will be challenging because it will be a new director and it will be a really actionpacked movie and sometimes it does get more difficult when youre 66 years old and doing this kind of action versus when youre in your 30s or 40s on his eighties rivalry with sylvester stallone we had a competition and heres a perfect example of how competition is healthy because he was trying to outdo me but i was also trying to outdo him so who benefited the fans i was training harder he was training harder it was a competition of who has more muscles who has more cuts who has the lower body fat who uses the biggest guns who kills the most people who has the most creative killings and this went on and on and on so the movies became better and better because of it and eventually we grew up right he said we were doing planet hollywood together and we were laughing about it on the plane when we flew around weve become very good friends and im a big supporter of sly because i really always thought i admired him even though there was competition hes a great director hes a great writer a great actor a great producer and also a fantastic artist his paintings are great and hes a great family man he has it all i have a love interest in every one of my films a gun i would never exchange my life with anybody elses if my life was a movie no one would believe it no matter the nationality no matter the religion no matter the ethnic background america brings out the best in people i went from being the terminator to being the governator i know a lot of athletes and models are written off as just bodies i never felt used for my body i just use my muscles as a conversation piece like someone walking a cheetah down 42nd street i was striving to be the most muscular man and it got me into the movies it got me everything that i have failure is not an option everyone has to succeed i am a big believer in education because when i grew up in austria  when i grew up in austria i had a great education i had great teachers even with my divorce and with everything i dont need money i dont suffer of anything that ive lost i think that people are interested seeing me on the screen you know nothing is more important than education because nowhere are our stakes higher our future depends on the quality of education of our children today i have a private plane but i fly commercial when i go to environmental conferences my friend james cameron and i made three films together  true lies 1994 the terminator 1984 and terminator 2 1991 of course that was during his early lowbudget arthouse period there is no place no country more compassionate more generous more accepting and more welcoming than the united states of america strength does not come from winning your struggles develop your strengths when you go through hardships and decide not to surrender that is strength people need to be insured so when you have an accident out there or when something catastrophic happens to you that youre covered and theres not someone else has to pay for you that is as simple as that the biggest problem that we have is that california is being run now by special interests all of the politicians are not anymore making the moves for the people but for special interests and we have to stop that to restore the trust of the people we must reform the way the government operates the worst thing i can be is the same as everybody else i hate that im addicted to exercising and i have to do something every day political courage is not political suicide i made my fair share of mistakes in our society the women who break down barriers are those who ignore limits politically there were failures and also on the personal level there were tremendous failures start wide expand further and never look back everything i have my career my success my family i owe to america when the people become involved in their government government becomes more accountable and our society is stronger more compassionate and better prepared for the challenges of the future i think that gay marriage should be between a man and a woman help others and give something back i guarantee you will discover that while public service improves the lives and the world around you its greatest reward is the enrichment and new meaning it will bring your own life one of my movies was called true lies 1994 its what the democrats should have called their convention he was being asked on what kind of terminator he will be playing in terminator genisys 2015 its a character that has been programmed to protect them to protect sarah connor but im basically the same terminator i will destroy anything thats in front of me in order to save her the last three or four reps is what makes the muscle grow this area of pain divides the champion from someone else who is not a champion thats what most people lack having the guts to go on and just say theyll go through the pain no matter what happens freedom is a right ultimately defended by the sacrifice of americas servicemen and women as you know im an immigrant i came over here as an immigrant and what gave me the opportunities what made me to be here today is the open arms of americans i have been received i have been adopted by america well you know im the forever optimist i have plenty of money unlike other hollywood celebrities or athletes that have not invested well as president reagan worked very well with democrats to do big things it is true that he worked to reduce the size of government and cut federal taxes and he eliminated many regulations but he also raised taxes when necessary the mind is the limit as long as the mind can envision the fact that you can do something you can do it as long as you really believe 100 percent on what is like getting back into the terminator character for terminator genisys 2015 its like youve been doing it your whole life because im very passionate about the character i think its a great interesting character i think its a great story the whole concept that cameron had way back in the early 80s of creating a world where machines take over and things becoming a reality that no one could even think of in those days its really been great because the whole team is really into going all out it is fun to be in a movie like that the studio is very enthusiastic about the terminator movie  the producers the director theyre very talented and great visionaries you can tell the stages  everything is really big and exciting its been a great experience well i think that california has had a history of always spending more money than it takes in gray davis can run a dirty campaign better than anyone but he cant run a state what we face may look insurmountable but i learned something from all those years of training and competing i learned something from all those sets and reps when i didnt think i could lift another ounce of weight what i learned is that we are always stronger than we know i welcome and seek your ideas but do not bring me small ideas bring me big ideas to match our future im not perfect i believe with all my heart that america remains the great idea that inspires the world it is a privilege to be born here it is an honor to become a citizen here it is a gift to raise your family here to vote here and to live here if you work hard and play by the rules this country is truly open to you you can achieve anything my relationship to power and authority is that im all for it people need somebody to watch over them ninetyfive percent of the people in the world need to be told what to do and how to behave you can scream at me call me for a shoot at midnight keep me waiting for hours  as long as what ends up on the screen is perfect i was born in europe and ive traveled all over the world i can tell you that there is no place no country that is more compassionate more generous more accepting and more welcoming than the united states of america i am the most helpful and open up doors for everyone and i like to share he was being asked how long it takes to put on the prosthetics for terminator genisys 2015 i think it was two and a half hours but its not every day it depends which stage were in the story so this is getting now towards the end it gets more and more severe women are the engine driving the growth in californias economy women make californias economy unique milk is for babies when you grow up you have to drink beer i came to hollywood and within a decade i was one of the biggest action stars of all time governments first duty and highest obligation is public safety i feel good because i believe i have made progress in rebuilding the peoples trust in their government i do the same exercises i did 50 years ago and they still work i eat the same food i ate 50 years ago and it still works bodybuilding is much like any other sport to be successful you must dedicate yourself 100 to your training diet and mental approach my own dreams fortunately came true in this great state i became mr universe i became a successful businessman and even though some people say i still speak with a slight accent i have reached the top of the acting profession maria is the best reason to come home for 20 years simon  schuster asked me why dont you write your autobiography if it bleeds we can kill it the resistance that you fight physically in the gym and the resistance that you fight in life can only build a strong character training gives us an outlet for suppressed energies created by stress and thus tones the spirit just as exercise conditions the body the future is green energy sustainability renewable energy on if he feels protective of the terminator franchise oh no we had very open discussions after i got the first script i had a lot of questions some of the things didnt make sense they were tweaked they didnt make sense to other people either so it was finetuned it was a process there was a period of i think a few months there were very talented people who went off and  and the great thing is that everyone was in sync it wasnt like i was going off in one direction and david ellison was thinking differently and then alan was thinking differently there was none of that i think this is a very unique project because i think everyone is very protective  not just because of the arts sake but i think also because of the business sake the studio sees this as if we do well here we can go with another few we can entertain people we can make money weve done a good job bringing back the franchise so everyone is in sync with that thats why everyone is working around the clock here to make this a great movie i can promise you that when i go to sacramento i will pump up sacramento learned helplessness is the givingup reaction the quitting response that follows from the belief that whatever you do doesnt matter its time to stop thinking of the republican party as an exclusive club where your ideological card is checked at the door and start thinking about how we can attract more solutionbased leaders like nathan fletcher and anthony adams people should make up their own mind about what they think of me i saw a woman wearing a sweatshirt with guess on it i said thyroid problem my body is like breakfast lunch and dinner i dont think about it i just have it and now of course this is another thing i didnt count on that now as the governor of the state of california i am selling california worldwide you see that selling the success i have achieved in bodybuilding motion pictures and business would not have been possible without the generosity of the american people and the freedom here to pursue your dreams we are a forwardlooking people and we must have a forwardlooking government as long as i live i will never forget that day 21 years ago when i raised my hand and took the oath of citizenship do you know how proud i was i was so proud that i walked around with an american flag around my shoulders all day long ill be back always sounded a little girly to me i didnt leave bodybuilding until i felt that i had gone as far as i could go it will be the same with my film career when i feel the time is right i will then consider public service i feel that the highest honor comes from serving people and your country if its hard to remember itll be difficult to forget whats fascinating is people in washington would rather spend time in hollywood and people in hollywood would rather spend time in washington ill be back i think americans are very patriotic i have inhaled exhaled everything i knew i was a winner back in the late sixties i knew i was destined for great things people will say that kind of thinking is totally immodest i agree modesty is not a word that applies to me in any way  i hope it never will for me life is continuously being hungry the meaning of life is not simply to exist to survive but to move ahead to go up to achieve to conquer its simple if it jiggles its fat teddy roosevelt is still a hero among environmentalists for his conservationist policies i told warren if he mentions prop 13 one more time he has to do 500 pushups i speak directly to the people and i know that the people of california want to have better leadership they want to have great leadership they want to have somebody that will represent them and it
