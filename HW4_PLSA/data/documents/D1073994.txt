the solar system are very different from those in the inner part eruptions on earth venus mercury and mars are of rocky material and are driven by internal heat ios eruptions are probably sulfur or sulfur compounds driven by tidal interactions with jupiter tritons eruptions are of very volatile compounds such as methane or nitrogen driven by seasonal heating from the sun and there are apparently volcanoes on pluto that erupt ice consisting of water and nitrogen ammonia or methane possibly driven by heat from radioactive decay in the dwarfplanets core terrestrial volcanic eruptions may take one or more of five chief forms or phases known as hawaiianstrombolian vulcanian peleean and plinian in the hawaiian phase there is a relatively quiet effusion of basaltic lava unaccompanied by explosions or the ejection of fragments the eruptions of mauna loa on the island of hawaii are typical the strombolian phase derives its name from the volcano stromboli in the lipari or aeolian islands n of sicily it applies to continuous but mild discharges in whichviscous lava is emitted in recurring explosions the ejection of incandescent material producesluminous clouds a more explosive volcanic eruption is the vulcanian where the magma lava beforeemission accumulates in the upper level of the vent but is blocked by a hardened plug of lava thatforms between consecutive explosions
