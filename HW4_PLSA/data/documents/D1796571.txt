characteristics of dysarthria in communication all types of dysarthria affect the articulation of consonants causing the slurring of speech in very severe cases vowels may also be distorted intelligibility varies greatly depending on the extent of neurological damage hypernasality is frequently present as are problems with respiration phonation and resonance spastic dysarthria you will recall that it is due to damage to the pyramidal tract this direct monosynaptic tract is predominantly facilitatory that means its cell bodies send impulses that result in movement along its axons the principle result of damage is difficulty with fine motor movements this is due to exaggerated stretch reflexes resulting in increased muscle tone and incoordination all of the cranial nerves except vii and xii are stimulated bilaterally by the cortico bulbar tracts bilateral lesions on those tracts result in a much more severe dysarthria than unilateral lesions however unilateral lesions on a corticobulbar tract will affect cranial nerves vii facial movement and xii tongue protrusiont since the other cranial nerves recieve signals from both corticobulbar tracts the muscles they innervate are barely affected thus one would not expect problems with the lips cheecks throat velum or larynx with bilateral corticobulbar lesions all of the above and more would be affected phonation vocal quality is harsh sometimes the voice of a patient with spastic dysarthria is described as strained or strangled duffy 1995 pitch is low with pitch breaks occurring in some cases resonance hypernasality typically occurs but is usually not severe enough to cause nasal emission prosody bursts of loudness are sometimes noted in the speech of patients with spastic dysarthria articulation according to duffy 1995 range of movement tongue strength speech rate and voice onset time for stops are reduced there is an increase in phoneme to phoneme transitions in syllable and word duration and in voicing of voiceless stops hyperkinetic dysarthria as described above hyperkinetic dysarthria is usually thought to be due to lesions of the basal ganglia its predominant symptoms are associated with involuntary movement there may be unilateral or bilateral damage phonation as with spastic dysarthria vocal quality may be described as harsh strained or strangled voice stoppages may occur in dysarthria associated with dystonia resonance hypernasality is common speech when voluntary speech movements are made there is often a superimposition of involuntary movements speech can range from total lack of intelligability to a mild problem there are many syndromes several of which are described above associated with this problem hypokinetic dysarthria associated mainly with parkinsons disease it is due to a lesion in the substantia nigra however it can also result from antipsychotic medications frequent blows to the head and other etiologies described above according to ferrand and bloom 1997 in order for normal muscle movement to occur dopaminergic and cholinergic ach pathways must be in balance phonation hoarseness is common in parkinsons patients also low volume frequently reduces intelligibility resonance hypernasality may occur prosody monopitch and monoloudness may occur pallilalia or the compulsive repetition of syllables is sometimes present the sound production pattern of patients with parkinsons disease is sometimes described as articulatory undershoot articulation bradykinesia reduced speed of muscles associated with parkinsons disease causes difficulty in the initiation of voluntary speech this can result in delay in starting to talk as well as very slow speech according to duffy 1995 there may be freezing of movement during speech rigidity can also occur additionally parkinsons patients have reduced loudness imprecise consonant production reduced pitch variability and festinating speech the latter can result in extremely fast speech together with short rushes of speech ferrand and bloom 1997 ataxic dysarthria this disorder is due to damage to the cerebellar control circuit according to duffy 1995 it can affect respiration phonation resonance and articulation but its characteristics are most pronounced in articulation and prosody phonation vocal quality may be harsh as loudness may vary excessively and increased effort is evident ataxic speech is sometimes described as explosive speech resonance hypernasality is not common but may occur prosody patients with ataxic dysarthria tend to place equal and excessive stress on all syllables spoken the term scanning speech has been used in the past to describe this prosodic pattern the name was originally used by charcot in reference to the speech of a patient who spoke very slowly and paused after each syllable the label is no longer applied to ataxic dysarthria in order to avoid confusion as it has been used to describe a variety of different speech problems articulation all dysarthric speech could be described as slurred however due to the incoordination caused by cerebellar lesions ataxic speech sounds especially slurred patients sound almost inebriated gait is affected in the same way according to duffy 1995 it is a breakdown in motor organization and control the result is slowness and inaccuracy in range force timing and direction of articulatory movements flaccid dysarthria this results from damage to the lower motor neurons cranial nerves involved in speech phonation if cn x is damaged voice will be affected as this nerve innervates the intrinsic musculature of the larynx occasionally only one vocal fold is paralyzed if the fold is paralyzed in an adducted position the voice will sound harsh and have low volume if the fold is paralyzed in the abducted position this will cause breathiness along with a reduction in loudness bilateral vocal fold paralysis is more common than unilateral paralysis when the folds are in an abducted position the voice is breathy and inspiratory stridor may be noted of course paralysis of both vocal folds in a completely adducted position would constitute a medical emergency the airway would be closed off resonance hypernasality will occur if the muscles involved in velar elevation have been affected frequently velar movement is reduced sufficiently to cause nasal emission prosody monopitch and monoloudness may both result from vocal fold paralysis associated characteristics muscles affected by flaccid paralysis may begin to atrophy or lose mass over time also lack of innervation may cause fasciculations or twitching of muscle fibers these movements are especially visible in the tongue its surface may dimple as if worms were moving beneath its skin unilateral paralysis of the oral structures may be noted the affected side of the mouth may sag causing drooling while it will be drawn to the unparylized side the jaw will deviate toward the weakened side while the tongue moves toward its stronger side mixed dysarthria characteristics will vary depending on whether the upper or lower motor neurons remain most intact for example if upper motor neurons are most damaged initially the voice will sound harsh however if lower motor neurons are most affected the voice will sound breathy prognosis according to netsell 1984 as cited in halperen 1986 a number of factors influence the prognosis of dysarthric patients among them are neurological status and history dysarthrias caused by bilateral subcortical lesions brain stem lesions or degenerative diseases like als have the poorest prognosis age in general the younger the patient the better the prognosis children are especially likely to have a good outcome because of neural plasticity treatment effects patients who receive treatment especially coordinated speech medical physical and behavioral treatment have a better outcome than those who do not personality and intelligence patients who were purposeful and optimistic before injury have a better prognosis than those who were not those who kept their minds active have a better prognosis than do those who did not support systems obviously patients who receive support form family members andor friends have a more favorable prognosis than those who dont dysarthria is treated differently depending on its severity patients with a mild or moderate form of the disorder can be taught to use strategies that make their speech more intelligible before compensation is attempted every effort should be made to improve physiological support for articulation resonance and respiration patients with mild to moderate dysarthria will be able to continue to use speech as their primary mode of communication patients whose dysarthria is more severe however may have to learn to use alternative forms of communication remediation of severe dysarthria dworkin 1991 p188 recommends the following sequence of treatments for spastic dysarthria that with some cautions may be used with other types such as hyperkinetic  hypokinetic and flaccid for hyperkinetic and ataxic dysarthrias dworkin feels that in most cases muscular tone reduction and muscular strengthening exercises may not be necessary for flaccid dysarthria muscular tone reduction would not be required  lingual labial and mandibular musculature tone reduction relaxation techniques lingual labial and mandibular musculature strengthening exercises lingual labial and mandibular force physiology training isometric phonetic stimulation in various contexts remediation of severe dysarthriacerebral palsy adaptation of the bobath method in remediation of dysarthria crickmay adapted the bobath method of physical therapy for the remediation of dysarthria in children and adults with cerebral palsy since cerebral palsy results from upper neural lesion problem it can present with any of the dysarthrias mentioned above except flaccid which is caused by lesions on the cell bodies or axons of cranial nerves the methods crickmay advocates make sense to me it is as timely now as when it was first published the bobath method has three main stages in the first stage the patients abnormal and pathological reflexes are inhibited in the second stage more developmentally mature movements are facilited in the third stage movements are put under the voluntary control of the patient it is a important that the speech therapist have guidance and assistance from a physical therapist before heshe initiates remediation in order to normalize muscle tone the patient is placed in a reflex inhibiting posture rip which heshe has become accustomed to while in physical therapy two postures that tend to have normalizing effects are the prone extended spine and flexed elbowslying on your stomach while leaning on your elbows and the supine hips and knees extended shoulders flexed held by therapist and head backchin held in inhibiting abnormal speech reflexes the therapist should go from gross to fine head control the ability to lift and turn the head is a prerequisite for speech crickmay suggests that the individulal be in a supine position with legs and arms at hisher sides and hips and legs flexed this is a good time to work on desensitize the facearticulators remember we are talking about desensitizing the speech mechanism because when you manipulate the tongue and lips the child may react with spasms crickmay suggests that you help the patient build up tolerance by holding himher in the rip while gently and carefully touching and moving the hypersensitive face since the mouth is the most sensitive heshe should start with facial areas furthest from the mouth and work in towards the mouth the patient will resist and try to break out of the rip heshe should be held gently but firmly so that heshe can build up a tolerance and permit the speech pathologist to manipulate the speech mechanism the time taken for this to happen is quite variablefrom a few days to several weeks the patient learns to lie quietly in an rip keeping the face free of abnormal movement when facial grimacing occurs it can be usually controlled by the fingertips those with spasticity often have an open mouth lips drawn back grin crickmay suggests flexing the head forward to inhibit the extensor spasm and close the patients mouth to control drooling crickmay recommends teaching the patient to keep the teeth closed and the tongue tip up against the alvealor ridge as heshe swallows the clinician then inhibits any extraneous movements of cheecks and lips to teach a normal mouth position crickmay suggests the following help the patient close hisher teeth in a normal jaw position place one hand under the patients chin and hold that position for himher use the other hand to stroke the patients lips and cheecks forward in order to relax the face chin pressure must be released gradually in order to permit the patient to assume control and to experience a closed mouth help the patient gradually increase the time the mouth remains closed to reinforce the closed mouth position negative practice may be used the clinician asks the patient to go back the original open mouth position and then to deliberately assume the new closed mouth one repeated practise will enable the patient to feel the difference between positions using a mirror during practise will provide visual reinforcement in order to inhibit the infantile sucking reflex crickmay recommends the following put the patient in an rip gently stimulate the lips by touching them with a straw or finger use the other hand to prevent them from moving into a sucking position the clinician will have to control the patients lips by keeping them in a relaxed position despite the stimulation finally the therapist should help the child assume control this can be done by the clinician removing hisher hand occasionallygradually increasing the length of time until the patient can inhibit the reflex without assistance to facilitate the chewing reflex a normal reflex which with sucking and swallowing is a prerequisite for speech the clinician can give hard licorice or chocolate absent dietary or swallowing restrictioins it should be pressed against the hard palate in order to stimulate chewing rubbing the gums and teeth front back and sides in a rotary motion with a finger will also help to facilitate independent tongue movement crickmay suggests holding the patients jaws apart while having himher raise the tongue to the alvealor ridge next encourage himher to produce t d l and n sounds make sure the jaw dosent become fixed it should be immobilized but given some freedom of movement finally permit the patient to take control differentiation of lip movements may be necessary for many patients the techniques described above can be used with patients who have difficulty differentiating lip tongue and jaw movements that is they cannot make the r sound without moving both lips and tongue or are unable to make t l or n sounds without also moving the jaw remediation of mild to moderate dysarthria compensatory strategies according to rosenbeck and la pointe 1978 and mc caffrey et al 2001 the goal of therapy for dysarthria is to help patients achieve compensated intelligibility in other words patients must learn techniques that help them to make good use of their remaining physiological capacity to produce understandable speech because dysarthria can impair respiration phonation resonance and prosody therapy will often include compensatory strategies which address these aspects of speech production as well as articulation the most effective way for most dysarthrics to make themselves more intelligible is to reduce the rate of their speech and produce syllables one by one speaking this way will disrupt intonation patterns and may make the person sound robotlike however it is the best way to maximize the clarity of dysarthric speech many patients have difficulty learning to speak slowly a pacing board may be helpful for such patients pacing boards are divided into sections and the patient must tap one section every time he pronounces a syllable as the fingers cannot move nearly as rapidly as the articulators this should slow the rate of speech enough to improve intelligibility after reduced rate has been established using the board the client can begin to count syllables on his fingers eventually he should be able to maintain the proper rate without counting syllables at all a device called a graduated stickmay be used instead of a pacing board graduated sticks have bumps on them at regular intervals and the client must touch one bump every time he says a syllable metronomes can also be used to slow speech rate patients are taught to pronounce one syllable per tick on the metronome the use of a pacing board graduated stick or metronome to slow rate may be referred to as intrasystemic reorganization intrasystemic reorganization for speech remediation is described by la pointe and rosenbeck as introducing a non speech function into the impaired act that is not normally used in the impaired act in order to facilitate speech this new function is called an organizer according to duffy 1995 using tongue protrusion to facilitate the production of interdental sounds is an example of using a lower level function for a higher level purpose dysarthric patients should also try to emphasize all syllables as they speak this will reduce vowel distortion patients should also use greater excursion of the mandible tongue and lips to improve production of both consonants and vowels the exaggeration of jaw and tongue movements is the most crucial aspect of this strategy it may be too difficult for some patients to increase the amplitude of their tongue movements consonant exaggeration is another compensatory strategy that improves the intelligibility of dysarthric speech teach the patient to overarticulate in order to emphasize the sounds that she is slighting medial and final consonants are typically most slighted in running speech if a patient has difficulty with a particular type of phoneme the clinician may have to teach him to use compensatory placement to produce those sounds for example it the patient has trouble with tongue tip sounds like t d n s and z heshe could learn to make them with the blade rather than the tip of the tongue if the patient can no longer put his lips together to make bilabials he could learn to use his teeth to contact the lips monitoring techniques are often used to work with patients who have problems with either reduced or excessive loudness for example the visipitch could be used to help parkinsons patients who speak too softly or patients with spastic dysarthria who have bursts of very loud speech reducing phrase length is another way to increase the loudness of a dysarthrics speech when a patient with hypokinetic dysarthria stops to take a breath and rest for an instant between every few words their vocal volume usually increases slowing the rate of speech which will be the main focus of therapy for dysarthria may automatically reduce phrase length and improve the patients loudness the yawnsigh technique for easy onset of voice the use of a breathy voice and froeschels chewing method of focusing energy in the oral cavity may all be used to reduce the strainedstrangled vocal quality that occurs in spastic dysarthria patients with this kind of voice problem are often using hard glottal attack in this case any technique used to ameliorate this problem will help the patient some dysarthrics especially those with the hypokinetic form of the disorder may have an excessively breathy voice pushing exercises may help a patient who has this problem by facilitating glottal closure many dysarthrics speak at an abnormally low pitch if they continue to do so for a sufficient length of time they may develop a functional voice disorder like nodules for this reason it may be necessary to address the patients voice problem although there is usually a tradeoff between improving pitchintonation and improving intelligibility prosthetic devices if a parkinsons patient with hypokinetic dysarthria cannot learn to speak more loudly through the use of monitoring techniques or the use of short phrases he or she might be provided with an electrolarynx or computer hardwaresoftware as a way of increasing vocal volume usually therapy does not effectively reduce the hypernasality that accompanies most types of dysarthria patients can be given blowing exercises or exercises that contrast nasal sounds with oral sounds eg n vs a perceptual training such as having the client listen to a tape recording of his voice is also used froeshels chewing method may help to some extent by concentrating energy in the oral cavity but if the velum is paralyzed none of these techniques will do anything to alleviate the problem if hypernasality is severe the patient should be referred to an ent to explore the possibility of pharyngeal flap surgery or the use of an obturator and speech bulb prosthesis although these were developed as treatments for cleft palate they could also be used with a dysarthric patient isometric exercises oral motor exercises may be used in therapy with dysarthric patients programs must also include speech exercises as the movements involved in speech are different from other types of oralmotor movements feedback in addition to the use of the visipitch to monitor loudness levels other kinds of feedback are employed in therapy with dysarthric patients tactile and kinesthetic feedback can be used to teach compensatory articulation strategies electromyographic emg feedback can be used to reduce the hypertonicity of muscles delayed auditory feedback daf has been used successfully with parkinsons patients rosenbeck et al 1973 developed an eight step continuum for treating apraxia of speech this can be modified for use with dysarthric patients the principle modification would be to give dysarthrics several models of the desired production with apraxics one model is given with several opportunities to match it  step 1integral stimulationthe therapist asks the patient to look and listen and imitate watch me and do the same step 2same as 1 except the patient is asked to delay the response then the therapists silently mimes the response while the patient is producing the target stimulus step 3integral stimulation followed by imitation without cuesmiming or otherwise step 4integral stimulation with several successive productions without simultaneous cues or intervening stimuli step 5printed stimuli are presented by the therapist without auditory or visual cues followed by patients production while looking at the written stimuli step 6written stimuli with delayed production after removal of the written stimuli step 7the therapist elicits a response by asking a question step 8 role playing is used to elicit responses
