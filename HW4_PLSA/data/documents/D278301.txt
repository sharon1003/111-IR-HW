usually the result of toxins infection or shock felines may present with a sudden onset of vomiting weakness and dehydration the cat may produce excessive urine or no urine at all depending on how the kidney was damaged bloodwork often shows very elevated kidney enzymes and poorly concentrated urine acute renal failure is more common in younger cats than the chronic form chronic kidney failure is more insidious though the exact causes are uncertain chronic kidney failure is the result of an accumulation of injuries to the nephrons which are the functional units of the kidney these injuries may be due to a history of acute kidney failure genetic disease infection or the result of a long term poorly understood inflammatory process while the kidney can compensate for a good amount of injury kidney failure becomes evident once twothirds of the nephrons have been damaged the symptoms of kidney failure in cats in its early stages felines with chronic kidney disease look and act normal and is only discovered as an incidental finding during routine or preanesthetic bloodwork as the disease progresses cat parents may notice the more classic clinical signs such as increased drinking and urination vomiting weight loss and bad breath bloodwork and urinalysis confirms the diagnosis the kidneys also help regulate blood pressure so it is common for cats with kidney failure to also suffer
