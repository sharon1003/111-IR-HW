social occasions of sorts there was also competition among the various outfits as they rode side by side carrying out their work at night it was campfires that served for socializing and entertainment one of the most unique aspects of these gatherings were the diversity of people there rich poor college graduates uneducated all got together in a common effort the texas cowboy represented many social classes everyone involved knew that to get along they merely needed to follow the code of live and let live probably one of the most false tale was how rowdy and violent the cowboys could be at the end of a trail drive to be sure there was a lot of celebration and drinking at the end of the drive but the violence was hard to find dodge city kansas one of the biggest cattle towns reported a miniscule amount of violence and shootings involving cattle drive cowboys the real trouble in these towns came from the outsiders who traveled there to take advantage of the cowboys a large cattle town would surely attract the gamblers swindlers and outlaws ja ranch cowboy bunkhouse exhibit at saints roost museum overseas capital helped fund texas ranching many foreign investors were well aware of the potential profits to be made in early cattle ranching many british and scottish groups were formed just for the purpose of buying into western ranches generally during the ranching boom of the 1880’s american speculative groups sold their ranch holdings to foreign investors with one of them becoming manager for the new corporation in some instances foreigners with some livestock experience assumed the role sometimes that arrangement worked and sometimes it didn’t the biggest problem with foreign capital was trying to explain ranch conditions to boards sitting across an ocean two of the largest foreign owned ranches in texas were the xit and the matador ranches not to let foreign capital dominate things old eastern capital also found it’s way west one good example of this was theodore roosevelt’s investments in dakota territory ranch land old fort worth texas stockyards characteristics of the early texas ranchers the most distinguishing characteristic of the old texas rancher was his individuality one of these best descriptions of the texas rancher can be found in the book the cattle kings by author lewis atherton atherton makes the case that ranchers and cowboys both expressed allegiance to individualism since the early days government influence at the time was basically nonexistent the open range was available to all takers the ranchers were rugged individualists who opposed government paternalism and generally cooperated among each other quite well these ranchers would return strays to their rightful owners without asking for a fee ranchers would offer hospitality to all travelers coming by and would help neighboring outfits in cases of illness or accidents the old texas ranches would form associations to coordinate cattle drives and decide how many cowboys would be required you might think that the texas rancher who got his cattle to dodge city first would benefit from higher prices but that really wasn’t the case instead they would meet with their neighbors and coordinate dates for the roundup additional trips into history articles you may enjoy are linked below…cattle drives and cowboys  what it was really like things
