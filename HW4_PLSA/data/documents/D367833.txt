sciencesigneous rocks labproblem how can you tell the difference between plutonic and volcanic rocks hypothesis materials earth science  igneous rocks  swift gh microscope or hand lens procedure general questions  answer the following questions a what type of igneous rocks take the longest to cool why b volcanic rocks cool more quickly than plutonic rocks name some environments where volcanic rocks are likely to form hint can volcanoes form underwaterc if plutonic rocks are formed deep inside the crust of the earth will we ever see them on the surface of the earth explain your answer d examine each of the igneous rock samples complete the chart below it is more important to visualize the environment where each rock formed than to memorize the names of each rock rock

provided by your instructor be sure to examine each specimen and use the classification charts to help you1 pumicepumice is a type of pyroclastic material it has a vesicular texture it is full of holes these formed because the magma cooled when it was full of gas bubbles the gas escaped leaving the holes behind pumice is composed of volcanic glass rich in silica si o2 a why is pumice very light b how did pumice form was it cooled quickly or slowly how can you tell c does pumice float on water why2 scoriathis volcanic rock may look similar to pumice in fact it formed the same way as pumice it is a volcanic rock that solidified when it was full of gas bubbles the main difference between the two rocks is composition scoria contains much more iron fe and magnesium mg and much less silica si o2 than pumice a describe scoria b what is the difference between pumice and scoria3 obsidianobsidian is volcanic glass it is magma that became solid so quickly that there was no time for minerals to form obsidian is easy to break and shape for this reason native peoples often used obsidian to make arrowheads knives and other cutting tools be careful your obsidian specimens might be sharpa what common material does obsidian resemble b can you see any crystals in obsidian c this obsidian was used by the clear lake indians of california what do you think they used it for hint is obsidian sharpd clear lake was a  area at one time4 basaltbasalt is the most abundant igneous rock in the earth’s crust most of the ocean floor is underlain by basalt it is a volcanic igneous rock and is typically dark in color because it contains large amounts of iron fe and magnesium mg compared to other igneous rocks basalt is also very common on islands like hawaii a describe this specimen of basalt b can you see any minerals in the sample c why is basalt always a dark color hint has something to do with minerals5 andesiteandesite is a volcanic igneous rock it is named after the andes mountains of south america which contain many active volcanoes most volcanoes on land are composed of andesite in the form of either lava or pyroclastic material a is andesite lighter in color than basalt b basalt contains a lot of dark elements like iron and magnesium notice that andesite is not as dark as basalt does andesite thus have more or less dark minerals c are any minerals visible in this andesite6 rhyolite tufftuff is a name for a pyroclastic rock where the magma fragments are small a rock with big magma fragments is called a breccia tuffs sometimes contain mineral crystals that were blown out of the volcano along with the magma tuff is very common in the western united states especially in washington and oregon where there are many volcanoes a describe this rock b why is rhyolite light in color7 granite south carolinathis granite is a plutonic igneous rock it formed from a magma that cooled slowly underground granites are rich in silica si o2 which makes them light in color a are the minerals that make up this granite visible to the naked eye b what is the general percentage of light minerals compared to dark minerals hint greater or less than 50c what is the difference between basalt and granite d what can you attribute this to8 granite texasthis is another granite from a different part of the united states it looks different from the specimen in question 7 because it formed from a slightly different magma both rocks are called granite because they have the same general texture and composition it is important to remember that most rock names are not very specific a what is the general percentage of light minerals compared to dark minerals in your sample b can you see distinct minerals in this specimen c does it look the same as 7 why are they both called granite9 dioritediorite is another phaneritic igneous rock like granite it formed by slow cooling inside the crust of the earth if the magma which cooled to make a diorite was instead erupted on the earth’s surface it would make andesite this means that diorite and andesite have the same composition but have very different textures a what is the percentage of dark minerals in this specimen what percentage are lighter minerals b describe the dark minerals c what is the difference between diorite and the two granites in questions 7 and 810 granodiorite sierra nevadagranodiorite is not on your identification chart it is an igneous rock which is between granite and diorite in composition granodiorites can form directly by melting inside the earth or by the mixing of other kinds of magma the formation of magma inside the earth can be very complex a estimate the percentages of dark and light minerals in this specimen b describe the size of the minerals why do you think the minerals are smaller than the granites or diorite11 gabbrogabbro is another phaneritic igneous rock its dark color indicates that it contains lots of iron fe and magnesium mg gabbro forms from the same kind of magma that creates basalt and scoria however to make gabbro the magma cooled slowly inside the earth a estimate the percentages of dark and light minerals in this specimen b describe the size of the minerals c what is the difference between gabbro and granodiorite diorite and the granites
