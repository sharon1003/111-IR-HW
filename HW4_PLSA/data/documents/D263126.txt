a collection of wisdom niccolo machiavelli  the prince niccolo machiavelli 14691527 is among the most notable and influential political philosophers of all time his theories not only concern government but also analyze topics like human nature and behavior niccolos works are still studied today and are noted for being valuable yet also controversial life  works niccolo machiavelli received a typical italian middle class education and then got a job working for a banker by age 29 in 1498 he was named head of the second chancellery of the florentine republic and became a notable person in italian politics and government however his career as a statesman and diplomat came to an abrupt end in 1512 when the medici family who ruled right before niccolo was initially appointed work with the government regained power and dismissed niccolo shortly later he was accused of conspiring against the medici government and was jailed and tortured although niccolo was found innocent of the charges several weeks later the medici government continued to view him with suspicion he was unable to secure any work with them so he left florence and went to a small town called sant andrea reflecting on his career with the government and his dealings with various leaders niccolo turned to political advisory writing by 1513 he came out with a brief book called the prince which is now considered one of the most notable literary works ever and a classic of political philosophy his other works include the life of castruccio castracani discourses on the first ten books of titus livius the art of war and history of florence and of the affairs of italy from the earliest times to the death of lorenzo the magnificenta the prince niccolo wrote the prince at a time when italian politics was marred with blackmail violence and conflict in the prince niccolo gives advice on how to be an effective and successful ruler and how to stay in power the book was written as a practical guide to ruling that uses simple and straightforward descriptions in order to provide easily understandable advice the prince was groundbreaking because niccolo described the world as he saw it this was much unlike earlier political writers who treated politics as an extension of morals and whose theories had little practical use niccolos theories are based on the premise that a ruler must base policies on peoples true nature although the prince is intended advice for a monarch its regarded not just as a political work but also one on leadership sociology human nature psychology and philosophy overview and themes of the princehuman nature in the prince niccolo analyzes human nature in order to formulate his advice for rulers he points out a number of traits that he believes are common in people for instance most peopleare interested primarily in themselves and basically carry the mindset of whats in it for me are mainly concerned with their property and honor when neither their property nor their honor is touched the majority of men live content are motivated by their financial greed but are also usually content with the overall existing state of affairs although those who have achieved some power are usually much more ambitiousoften remain content and uncomplaining unless something horrible happens to themmight be trustworthy in good times or due to various motives but are generally very dishonest in times of distressadmire and praise qualities such as integrity mercy honesty humaneness religiousness and generosity in other people but rarely ever foster those characteristics in themselvesare often herdminded cling to the general opinion and judge from appearances in general men judge more from appearances than from realness all men have eyes but few have perception everyone sees what you seem to be few know what you really are and those few do not dare take a stand against the general opinion can become very loyal to someone through receiving acts of goodwill but even ones strong sense of loyalty is not absolute and can be won or lostcan have their feelings towards others changed ie with certain catalysts they can turn against someone they favored or they can have their favor won towards someone they used to view negativelyare inconstantcan have their friendship bought but friends that are bought with money are not reliable friendships that are obtained by payments and not by greatness or nobility of mind may indeed be earned but they are not secured and in time of need cannot be relied upon subscribe to my mailing list to read great quotes

success is a matter of virtu as in skill strength cunning and good decision making as well as fortuna in other words chance probability and external factors outside of ones control he believes that both factors play a near equal role in determining whether a venture succeeds or fails he niccolo then asserts that through foresight one can hope to deal with fortuna and thus maximize ones success niccolo then emphasizes the importance of adapting behavior to suit the times and making timely and appropriate adjustments to circumstances i believe that fortuna is the settler of one half of our actions but that she still leaves us by virtu to direct the other half or perhaps a little less i compare fortuna to a raging river which when in flood overflows the plains sweeps away trees and buildings and moves the soil from place to place everything flies before it and everything yields to its violence without being able in any way to withstand it but despite its nature it can be said that when the weather becomes calmer people can make provisions with defenses and barriers in such a way that if the waters rise again they may pass away by canal and their force will not be as out of control or as dangerous and in the same way it happens with fortuna who shows her power only where overboldness has not prepared to resist her and in that direction she directs her forces where she knows that barriers and defenses have not been raised to constrain her a prince can be seen happy today and ruined tomorrow even without having shown any change of his mood or character  the prince who relies exclusively on fortuna is lost when it changes i also believe that he who suits his action to fit the times will prosper but he whose actions do not accord with the times will not be successful we see people different people attain glory and riches through different means one with caution another with haste one by force another by skill one by patience another by its opposite  two men working differently can bring about the same effect and of two working similarly one can attain his goal while the other does not if one governs himself with caution and patience and then times and affairs move in such a way that his administration is successful his wealth is made but if times and affairs change he is ruined if he does not change his course of action but a man is not often found to be prudent enough to know how to adapt himself to the change  having always prospered by acting one way he cannot be persuaded that it is a good idea to leave it thus a cautious man when it is time to turn adventurous does not know how to do it hence he is ruined but had he changed his conduct with the times his fortune would not have changed lion and fox to develop ones virtu niccolo recommends studying and learning from the strengths of people and animals whe it comes to animals he states that one should balance the strength and ferocity of a lion with the cunning slyness and perceptiveness of a fox the lion cannot defend himself against traps and the fox cannot defend himself against wolves therefore it is necessary to be a fox to discover the traps and a lion to terrify the wolves those who rely simply on the lion do not understand what they are about should a leader be loved or feared niccolo is well known for his controversial assertion that it is better to be feared than loved if you cannot be both the two rarely come together for one person  if you must choose between the two you will find it safer to be feared than to be loved  love is preserved by an obligatory link in which men being low in character may break whenever it is advantageous for them to do so but fear is preserved by the dread of punishment which never fails despite his belief in using fear niccolo also states that a leader should definitely avoid being hated a prince ought to inspire fear in such a way that if he does not win love he avoids hatred because he can endure very well being feared whilst he is not hated to back up and further explain his theory on avoiding hatred niccolo describes the importance of having peoples goodwill and support which in a monarchs case can defend against both domestic revolutions like widespread political activism as well as foreign attacks niccolo points out several ways to avoid peoples hatreddont confiscate or even mess with peoples private property above all things he must keep his hands off the property of others because people forget the death of their father before they forget the loss of their inheritance respect peoples traditionsdont appear greedydont appear bland or lacking in characterdirect peoples energies into private pursuitspromote material prosperitywhen giving give gradually so the benefits will taste better  niccolo also notes that while generosity is usually considered praiseworthy a monarch still needs to be financially responsible and generally stingy he feels that this will cause him to be considered generous through lower taxes levied on the people especially in times of war draw attention to anything that is praiseworthy ie anything that makes you appear trustworthy humane and religious and hide what seems evil everyone admits how praiseworthy it is in a prince to keep faith and to live with integrity and not with craft nevertheless our experience has been that those princes who have done great things have held good faith of little account and have known how to circumvent the intellect of men by craft and in the end have overcome those who have relied on their word  it is necessary to know well how to disguise this foxlike deceptive characteristic and to be a great pretender and concealer  anyone who seeks to deceive will always find someone who will allow himself to be deceived subscribe to my mailing list to read great quotes mini biographies and more youll receive about two emails per month i respect your time and i wont send you anything that isnt really worth reading employing the right people getting advice and dealing with opinions niccolo feels that that rulers should hire quality ministers and servants who will be dependent on and look out for and the well being and interest of the state and the ruler he also recommends that rulers should study servants and ministers and make them feel encouraged to beneift the state when you see the servant thinking more of his own interests than of yours such a man will never make a good and trustworthy servant  to keep his servant honest the prince ought to study him honoring him enriching him doing him kindnesses sharing with him the honors and cares and at the same time let him see that he cannot stand alone niccolo also points out that employing quality people will make the prince look wise to his subjects niccolo also recommends that taking advice from a small and trusted group of advisors and only on matters the prince inquires about also the prince who should use his own brain and make the final decisions of importance when everyone is allowed to tell you the truth the respect for you lessens  a prince should choose the wise men in his state and give only them the freedom of speaking the truth to him and only on those things that he inquires of  he should question them upon everything listen to their opinions and then form his own conclusions  he should let them understand that the more freely they speak the more they will be preferred  he should be a constant inquirer and patient listener other themes of the prince niccolos belief in the effectiveness of having a sound military and sound lawsan outline of how to have a strong military and engage in wara call for italian unity and nationalisma dedication to lorenzo de medici the ruler of florencemachiavelliansince the publication of the prince the term machiavellian has been used both in and out of politics to denote a cunning deceptive and deceitful kind of resourcefulness that being said niccolos other political works are very far from promoting a machiavellian philosophy most notably discourses on the first ten books of titus livius is aimed at republics states controlled by politically active citizenry and preaches themes of patriotism and civic excellence as well as the use of open political participation and debate subscribe to my mailing list to read great quotes mini
