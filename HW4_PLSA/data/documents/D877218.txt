project management tools is here and its visual if this article feels a little familiar we published the first edition of it way back in 2009 while svg has added a whole new dimension to web design questions such as “what is the difference between jpeg and png” are still as relevant as ever we thought it was time to take a fresh look at the state of play in webimage formats today’s short guide will give you the quick rundown of the various file types and where they work best enjoy jpg vs png vs gif vs svg – what is the difference category palette use for jpg lossy millions of colors still images photography gif lossless maximum 256 colors simple animations graphics with flat colors graphics without gradients png8 lossless maximum 256 colors similar to gif better transparency but no animation great for icons png24 lossless unlimited colors similar to png8 handles still images and transparency svg vectorlossless unlimited colors graphicslogos for web retinahighdpi screens gif the graphic interchange format256 color palette ads by hooly unless you just stepped out of a faintly smoking de lorean straight from 1985 you’re very likely already familiar with the web’s goofiest image format – the gif graphics interchange format the gif format is a type of bitmap but unlike jpeg or png gif files are limited to a maximum palette of 256 colors essentially each gif image contains a preset ‘box of crayons’ and there is no way to truly mix those colors to make new colors while 256 might sound like a lot of crayons to work with complex photographs typically have many thousands of tones this color range is lost during the gif conversion process and this is the key reason not to use gif for color photos while gif is generally a poor choice for images with wide color variation that 256 color limit can help keep file sizes small which is ideal for even the slowest of internet speeds for many years gif provided the web’s only transparency option – though png and svg now offer this too category lossless choose gif for simple animations small icons graphics with low pixeltopixel variation ie lots of flat color like logos and flagsjpegdepending on your preference you may refer to this format as either ‘jpeg’ or ‘jpg’ – both are accepted variations of the same acronym – joint photographic experts group unlike gif jpeg is a 16bit format which means that it can blend red blue and green light to display millions of color this makes jpg very ‘photofriendly’ this is partly why it is a standard format when it comes to most digital cameras on the market the jpeg format also allows you the flexibility to choose the how much you compress your image – from 0 heavy compression to 100 no compression generally a 6075 compression setting will shrink your file considerably while keeping your image looking decent on most screens while jpeg is well suited to compressing and rendering photography it is a lossy compression type which means it’s less useful for ongoing editing of an image exporting a jpeg results in a loss of quality and these losses get worse with each successive export – like a photocopy of a photocopy this is why professional photographers generally shoot in lossless raw format also note that unlike the gif and png jpeg can not preserve transparency category lossy use jpeg for still images photography images with complex colors and dynamic pnga newer file format than gif and jpeg the png portable network graphics is like a marriage between both the gif and jpeg format thanks to its two variants png8png8 is similar to gif in many ways and uses the same 256 color palette maximum it has better transparency options and usually exports slightly smaller file sizes however png8 has no animation function png24png24 allows you to render images with millions of colors – much like jpeg – but also offers the ability to preserve transparency because png24 is a lossless format file type you are likely to get larger files but if image quality is more important than file size png24 is your best option even so services like tiny pngcom can often make a big difference to your file size compared to their cousin jpeg png24 files are not as universally compatible with every app and platform which makes the format marginally less ideal for web sharing however it is capable of being edited without diminished qualities category lossless use png for web graphics that require transparency color heavy and complex photographs and graphics images that require reediting and reexporting svgunlike the three formats mentioned above svg scalable vector graphics is not a pure bitmap format instead it is a vector format – a close cousin to adobe illustrator’s ai format and eps – that is steadily becoming an attractive option for web and ui designers sometimes it’s helpful to think of svg as ‘html for illustrations’ and you need to think about it quite differently to other image formats we’ve listed svg is bestsuited to displaying logos icons maps flags charts and other graphics created in vector graphics applications like illustrator sketch and inkscape written in an xmlbased markup your svg can be edited in any text editor and modified by java script or css as vectors can be scaled to any size while retaining crisp image quality they are ideal for responsive design though svg is a vector format at its core it is possible even common to embed bitmap graphics inside your svg file – just as you might embed jpegs in your html you can do this by either linking to an image source via its url as you might link to jpg in a webpage or by encapsulating the pixel image as a data uri this gives svg unchallenged flexibility and power though svg can help keep your images looking beautiful on the web it isn’t necessarily a format that the everyday person can utilize to save and upload images via their website or social media platforms online services like word press flickr medium tumblr and facebook will either forcibly convert your svg to a format they like or – more likely – outright block your svg upload there are a handful of svg hosting options including svgurcom imghus and even github as alex demonstrated here as happy as i am to see smaller hosting services tackle svg github is currently the only svgfriendly service i’d be 99 confident will be around in 5 years if you are using svg to design for the web you will find that you can almost always reduce file size when compared to something like the jpeg or png but note that the more complex your svg the larger the file will become category vectorlossless use svg for logos and icon with strong geometric vectorfriendly design graphics that may need to be displayed in multiple sizes and screens graphics that respond to their device graphics that need to be edied updated and redeployed compare and contrast now that we have covered the differences between popular file formats it is time to see them side by side below you will see how gif jpeg png and svg formats handle images with both simple and complex colors along with photographic images flat color graphics the first type of image we’re going to look at are flat color graphics this covers most logos and branding icons simple maps charts and diagrams the original image is a 234 kb png image with a 1280 x 1280 dimension below you will be able to see the difference in compression size as well as image quality note the images were saved using photoshop’s “save for web and devices” option at the highest quality settings gif 176 kbjpeg 100 no compression 533 kbjpeg 75 33 kbpng8 118 kbpng24 196 kbsvg 6 kb as a pure vector graphicin the case of this particular image there isn’t much loss in quality when you compare the six formats – though you’ll notice slight artifacts near edges inside the compressed jpeg this isn’t always true with flat color graphics but in most cases you should be fine with going with the least byteheavy image for this image assuming we have the original vector file svg is the obvious choice at 6kb if we don’t have the vector the png8 option is a decent fallback with our original image dropping from 234 kb to 118 kb complex color images the original image is a 328 kb jpeg image with a 1280 x 960 dimension below you will be able to see the difference in compression size as well as image quality note the images were saved using photoshop’s “save for web and devices” option at the highest quality settings as we don’t have access to a vector version of this file any svg version of this image would just be a jpeg embedded inside an svg this makes it a little redundant so i won’t offer an svg example here gif 426kb jpeg 100 no compression 776 kbjpeg 75 215 kbpng8 327 kbpng24 17 mbimages that have complex colors tend to look better when using a jpeg png24 or svg format colors are for the most part preserved and don’t have ugly banding and noise that you are likely to get with gif and png8 formats color photography the original image is a 215 kb jpeg image with a 1280 x 701 dimension below you will be able to see the difference in compression size as well as image quality note the images were saved using photoshop’s “save for web and devices” option at the highest quality settings again there’s little to be gained with an svg offering here gif 453 kbjpeg 100 no compression 410 kbjpeg 75  410 kbpng8 395 kbpng24 103 mbas with complex images your photographs are best to be saved under a jpeg png24 or svg format in the photo above the color remains preserved in all formats aside from banding and noise that stand out in the shadows of the hair skin and background as well as at the top of photo as seen in the gif and png8 outputs have a question about photoshop why not ask it on our forums
