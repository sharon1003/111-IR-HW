toxicological implications of toxic encephalopathy the review will focus on the most significant occupational causes of toxic encephalopathy chronic toxic encephalopathy cerebellar syndrome parkinsonism and vascular encephalopathy are commonly encountered clinical syndromes of toxic encephalopathy few neurotoxins cause patients to present with pathognomonic neurological syndromes the symptoms and signs of toxic encephalopathy may be mimicked by many psychiatric metabolic inflammatory neoplastic and degenerative diseases of the nervous system thus the importance of good historytaking that considers exposure and a comprehensive neurological examination cannot be overemphasized in the diagnosis of toxic encephalopathy neuropsychological testing and neuroimaging typically play ancillary roles the recognition of toxic encephalopathy is important because the correct diagnosis of occupational disease can prevent others eg workers at the same worksite from further harm by reducing their exposure to the toxin and also often provides some indication of prognosis physicians must therefore be aware of the typical signs and symptoms of toxic encephalopathy and close collaborations between neurologists and occupational physicians are needed to determine whether neurological disorders are related to occupational neurotoxin exposure keywords occupational diseases nervous system diseases toxic encephalopathy go to introduction chemicals capable of damaging the central nervous system cns are ubiquitous in the environment particularly in occupational settings industrial processes are major sources of some of the most wellknown neurotoxins according to the united states environmental protection agency more than 65000 commercial chemicals are currently used in the us and 20003000 new chemicals are added to this list each year  1  we do not know how many neurotoxic chemicals are used in industry at present but an unadventurous estimate might suggest more than 1000  2  people may be exposed to these neurotoxins due to their occupations or occasionally at home or through other inadvertent mechanisms the cns is protected from toxic exposure to some extent but it remains vulnerable to the effects of certain chemicals found in the environment nonpolar lipidsoluble substances eg organic solvents gain the easiest access to the cns where neurons are particularly susceptible due to their high lipid contents and metabolic rates both gray matter and white matter can be easily damaged by lipophilic toxins  3  the term toxic encephalopathy is used to indicate brain dysfunction caused by toxic exposure  4  toxic encephalopathy includes a spectrum of symptomatology ranging from subclinical deficits to overt clinical disorders the clinical manifestations of toxic encephalopathy are related to the affected brain regions and cell types  4  this article schematically reviews the clinical features diagnostic approaches to and toxicological implications of toxic encephalopathy the review focuses on the most significant occupational causes of toxic encephalopathy but does not address iatrogenic pharmaceutical causes or the neurotoxic effects of illicit recreational drugs or alcohol go to basic principles of neurotoxicology several basic principles of neurotoxicology are particularly relevant to the understanding of toxic encephalopathy  5 6  first there is a doseresponse relationship in the majority of toxic encephalopathies that is the higher the level of exposure the more severe the symptoms similarly the greater the duration of exposure the higher the likelihood of irreversible symptoms in general neurological symptoms appear only after the cumulative exposure has reached a threshold individual susceptibility varies over a limited range and idiosyncratic reactions seldom occur second toxic encephalopathy typically manifests as a nonfocal or symmetrical neurological syndrome the presence of significant asymmetry such as weakness or sensory loss of only one limb or on only one side of the body should suggest an alternate cause this principle is very useful when evaluating a patient with a presumed neurotoxic injury however electrolyte glucose and cortisol levels liver function and renal function tests should be used to distinguish toxic encephalopathy from metabolic encephalopathy which also presents symmetrical signs third there is usually a strong temporal relationship between exposure and symptom onset after acute exposure the immediate symptoms are often a consequence of the physiological effects of the chemical maximum symptoms generally occur with maximum exposure and little delay in onset is seen these symptoms typically subside when the chemical is eliminated from the body however delayed or persistent neurological deficits sometimes occur after toxic exposure fourth the nervous system has a limited capability to regenerate compared to other organs such as the liver or hematopoietic system thus more sequelae persist after the removal of a neurotoxic agent compared to toxic diseases of other organs fifth multiple neurological syndromes may occur in response to a single neurotoxin depending on the level and duration of the exposure for example acute highlevel exposure to carbon disulfide produces psychosis whereas chronic moderate exposure causes atherosclerosisrelated health effects  7 8  sixth clinical disorders of the cns have varying presentations often involving a host of nonspecific symptoms furthermore few neurotoxins cause patients to present with a pathognomonic neurological syndrome the symptoms and signs of neurotoxin exposure may be mimicked by various psychiatric metabolic inflammatory neoplastic and degenerative diseases of the nervous system  9  therefore it is crucial to take a good occupational history and perform a detailed neurological examination when diagnosing a toxic encephalopathy seventh asymptomatic toxic encephalopathy may be seen in occupational or environmental settings  10  neuropsychological studies have shown that workers in paint manufacturing or painting facilities often have subclinical neuropsychological deficits  4 11  and recent studies have revealed that asymptomatic toxic encephalopathies are a very common phenomenon  4  subclinical deficits usually recover after the exposure ceases whereas clinical disorders usually do not recover eighth the timing of exposure relative to critical periods of cns development may explain some of the variations in susceptibility the many discrete neuronal populations and interacting systems of the nervous system develop at variable rates throughout the first three decades of life toxic exposures may exert profound effects when the organism is in a particularly vulnerable stage resulting in problems that would not occur in response to exposures at other stages of life the most prominent example of this phenomenon is the susceptibility of infants to lead encephalopathy  12  finally neurotoxins may reduce the functional reserves of the brain potentially making the cells more vulnerable to the effects of aging and leading to accelerated senescence this may explain the observation that in some cases deterioration may continue for many years even after exposure has ceased go to clinical syndromes of toxic encephalopathy the major clinical syndromes of toxic encephalopathy include diffuse acute or chronic toxic encephalopathy cerebellar syndrome parkinsonism and vascular encephalopathy  4 13  various neurotoxins including heavy metals organic solvents and other chemicals have been found to be responsible for these relatively specific neurological syndromes  8 9  acute diffuse toxic encephalopathy acute diffuse toxic encephalopathy reflects a global cerebral dysfunction of rapid onset typically days or weeks and may be associated with alterations in the level of consciousness the neurotoxins that produce acute encephalopathy interfere with basic cell functions in the brain  4  most of these agents gain entry because they are highly lipid soluble and can readily diffuse across membranes the causative agents include organic solvents which can alter cellular membrane function and some gases eg gas anesthetics carbon monoxide hydrogen sulfide and cyanide which can diffusely affect brain function heavy metals can also cause acute encephalopathies this is more commonly associated with organic metals eg methyl mercury tetraethyl lead and organic tin than with inorganic metals eg mercury lead and tin  4  virtually any organic solvent has the potential to produce acute diffuse toxic encephalopathy the clinical manifestations of which depend on the neurotoxin and the intensity of exposure and can range from mild euphoria with a normal examination to stupor seizure coma and even death in general the greater the exposure the more severe the impairment of cerebral function and consciousness the cerebral cortex is more sensitive to these toxins than is the brainstem even when consciousness is lost brainstem function typically remains intact diagnosis does not generally present a challenge for acute syndromes because the exposure and clinical manifestations are likely to be closely linked in time in patients with severe acute toxic encephalopathy magnetic resonance imaging mri of the brain may show focal areas most commonly bilateral basal ganglia or diffuse areas of edema  14  16  the treatment of diffuse acute encephalopathy is primarily supportive starting with removal of the exposure source for most of the neurotoxins that act diffusely on the brain recovery from acute exposure is complete  4  chronic toxic encephalopathy ctecte usually represents a chronic persistent diffuse injury to the brain resulting from cumulative or repeated exposures often over a period of months or years to solvents or occasionally heavy metals the clinical manifestations of cte usually involve varying degrees of cognitive impairment  4  cte is an established internationally recognized condition that results from excessive occupational exposure to solvents via inhalation or skin contact in 1985 the world health organization who published diagnostic criteria for cte caused by exposure to solvents  11 17  the most recent international classification of diseases document no 10 defines cte  18  and the diagnostic and statistical manual for mental disorders fourth edition  19 lists the condition as a form of substanceinduced persistent dementia the severity of cte is graded as iiii or 1 2a 2b and 3  11 17  type i cte and types 1 and 2a cte include subjective symptoms relating to memory concentration and mood at this stage clinicians may miss the diagnosis by considering these symptoms as a psychiatric issue due to altered mood  4  type ii cte and type 2b cte are characterized by objective evidence of attention and memory deficits decreased psychomotor function  11  andor learning deficits  17 on neurobehavioral testing the taking of detailed occupational and medical histories as well as standardized neurobehavioral testing are the cornerstones of the standard diagnostic process workers with a history of repeated episodes indicative of acute solvent intoxication eg lightheadedness dizziness headache and nausea over a period of many years a history of insidious onset of attention memory and mood problems and objective evidence of impairment on standardized neurobehavioral tests ie deficits in attention memory learning andor psychomotor function should be considered as meeting the diagnostic criteria for type ii cte or type 2b cte type iii cte and type 3 cte are often accompanied by neurological deficits and neuroradiological findings this type of cte often manifests clinical features whereas types i and ii show subclinical deficits the mri findings in patients with cte are nonspecific although there may be slight brain atrophy mri findings mainly support the differential diagnosis of cte by ruling out other brain diseases thus nonsolvent etiologies should be considered if there are major findings on the brain mri of a patient with suspected cte  20  most cases of cte are of type ii or 2b  21  the finnish criteria for cte usually includes the criterion of more than ten years of daily exposure at work  22  followup is also important in diagnosing patients with cte subtle changes in mental functioning due to intoxication often go unrecognized unless the clinician specifically assesses these changes using sophisticated neuropsychological tests  8  the high index of suspicion gives clues to diagnosis of cte the diagnosis of cte requires a careful clinical assessment that 1 establishes that there is evidence for abnormality mainly on neuropsychological testing 2 determines that there is good evidence of a relationship to exposure to a potentially hazardous neurotoxin and 3 excludes any other underlying causes specific therapies for cte are limited the patient should be separated from the neurotoxic exposure as soon as possible once the toxin has been removed the reversibility of the brain damage will depend on the grade of cte  4 23  the important question of whether cte can progress to the development of dementia has not yet been answered increasing evidence suggests that most forms of degenerative dementia have a multifactorial cause involving genetic biological and chemical factors  13  further studies are needed to clarify the issue cerebellar syndromes gait ataxia dysarthria intention tremor gazeevoked nystagmus dysmetria and adiadochokinesia can all result from cerebellar dysfunction  13  neurotoxininduced cerebellar syndrome which is a clinical entity that can be differentiated from solventinduced cte or carbondisulfideinduced vascular encephalopathy  13  is sometimes accompanied by other neurological findings if a patient presents with cerebellar dysfunction a detailed history of his or her occupation and neurotoxin exposure should be obtained methyl mercury intoxication minamata diseasemethyl mercury intoxication known as minamata disease causes damage to the granule cell layer in the cerebellum bilateral diffuse cerebellar atrophy and microscopically diffuse loss of the granule cell layer in the cerebellar cortex  24  the major clinical features of the disease include progressive cerebellar ataxia and disturbance of the sensory functions of the cerebral cortex cerebellar ataxia manifests as gait ataxia dysarthria intention tremor gaze nystagmus dysmetria and dysdiadochokinesia in addition injuries to the somatosensory visual auditory or olfactory cortexes of the cerebrum can manifest as visual impairment hearing impairment olfactory problems gustatory disturbance and cerebral cortexrelated somatosensory disturbances  24  concentric constrictions of the visual fields are characteristic findings due to damage to the calcarine cortex  13  in minamata disease atrophy of the visual calcarine cortex and the cerebellum has been demonstrated on computed tomography ct and mri  25  27  and significantly decreased blood flow has been shown in the cerebellum on singlephoton emission computed tomography spect  27  fetal minamata disease is a typical congenital toxic encephalopathy serious disturbances in mental and motor development are observed in all cases of fetal minamata disease affected individuals show significant bilateral impairments in chewing swallowing speech gait other coordination and involuntary movement such as dystonia these symptoms have been associated with the brain damage that is typical of minamata disease  28  methyl bromide intoxication methyl bromide is a highly toxic gas that is used widely as an insecticidal fumigant for dry foodstuffs it can be toxic to both the cns and the peripheral nervous system  29 30  most neurological manifestations of methyl bromide intoxication occur as a result of inhalation chronic exposure can cause peripheral polyneuropathy optic neuropathy and cerebellar dysfunction sometimes with neuropsychiatric disturbances  29 30  typically occupational history is vital to the diagnosis of bromide intoxication organic tin intoxication organic tins such as the dimethyl and trimethyl compounds are widely used as polyvinylchloride stabilizers catalysts and biocides  31  selective cerebellar dysfunction is most prominent upon recovery from coma due to acute severe organic tin intoxication  31  it is easy to diagnose acute organic tin intoxication in patients whose work history and circumstances of exposure are known and whose signs and symptoms are typical and consistent with those reported in the literature a fluid attenuated inversion recovery flair mri taken 15 days after an acute organic tin intoxication showed extensive symmetrical highsignal lesions throughout the white matter of the brain indicating diffuse brain edema  15  in a followup study three years after an acute organic tin poisoning case brain mri showed cerebellar atrophy and 18 ffluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography petct revealed mildly decreased metabolic activity in the pons and in both cerebellar hemispheres  31  parkinsonism manganese intoxication manganismmanganism is one of the most typical forms of parkinsonism chronic excessive exposure to manganese mn can affect the globus pallidus resulting in parkinsonian signs and symptoms sometimes along with psychiatric features called locura manganica or mn madness historically miners developed psychosis due to exposure to mn at levels of up to several hundred milligrams per cubic meter  32  the clinical course of manganism can be divided into three stages at the first stage patients with manganism usually have prodromal neuropsychiatric symptoms such as asthenia apathy somnolence irritability emotional lability or frank psychoses at the second stage bradykineticrigid parkinsonian syndrome with dystonia which is reversible presents as the main clinical feature  4  patients in the last stage are notable for aggravation of the signs and symptoms described as above the clinical progression has been found to be irreversible and persistent after the cessation of exposure in some cases  33  early diagnosis of manganism is therefore important the mechanism underlying this response to mn exposure is not yet clear but it has been suggested that an initial insult to the globus pallidus during mn neurotoxicity can result in increased activity in the subthalamic nucleus which is normally under tonic inhibition by the globus pallidus in the basal ganglia circuitry  34  diagnosis of classical manganism requires a history of occupational mn exposure typical neurological findings such as bradykinesia rigidity and postural instability and the exclusion of other neurological diseases related to the basal ganglia such as parkinsons disease pd secondary parkinsonism due to traumatic vascular or iatrogenic damage and atypical parkinsonism syndromes  35  the differential diagnoses of this disorder can be summarized using clinical features and neuroimaging data  table 1  35  37  the pathological lesions caused by manganism are typically degenerative lesions of the globus pallidus sometimes with lessfrequent and lesssevere injuries to the substantia nigra sn by contrast in pd the sn is typically involved while the pallidostriatal complex is spared  38  table 1comparison of the features of manganism and parkinsons disease a mninduced bilateral and symmetrical increase in signal intensity confined mainly to the globus pallidus and midbrain can be observed on t1weighted mri in mnexposed individuals but no alterations are typically seen on t2weighted mri or ct scans  39  increased signals on t1weighted mri were observed in both asymptomatic mnexposed workers and in patients with experimental or occupational mn poisoning  40  42  however these increased signal intensities generally resolved 612 months after the cessation of mn exposure  42 43  thus a high t1 signal on mri may reflect the target organ dose of recent occupational mn exposure but may not necessarily reflect manganism in the spectrum of mn symptomatology  44  at lower exposure levels less severe subtle and preclinical neurobehavioral effects have been widely reported in various occupational and environmental settings  45  concerns have been raised about whether chronic exposure to low levels of mn can induce pd  43 46  in fact pd is not a single disease but rather a heterogeneous group of clinically similar conditions it is possible that some individuals diagnosed with pd have neurotoxinrelated pd that is likely to have been overlooked because most cases are not attributable to neurotoxin exposure however future work will be required to clarify whether mn exposure induces pd andor affects the progress of this condition others acute carbon monoxide poisoning can result in a delayed extrapyramidal syndrome that begins two to three weeks after recovery from the initial exposure the parkinsonian features can be progressive and are associated with symmetrical degeneration of the globus pallidus  47  abnormalities may be seen in brain ct and mri  48  50  carbon monoxide poisoning can also result in cognitive impairment and akinetic mutism associated with subcortical white matter lesions especially in the bifrontal area  48  50  parkinsonian features have occasionally been associated with methanol  51  carbon disulfide  52  paraquat and rotenone  53 54  and cyanide poisoning  55  vascular encephalopathy carbon disulfide poisoning is a highly typical and frequently encountered vascular encephalopathy  8 56  patients with carbon disulfide poisoning exhibit various clinical characteristics including multiple brain infarctions  57  59  peripheral neuropathy  60  coronary heart disease  61  retinopathy including microaneurysm of the fundus  62  hypertension  56  glomerulosclerosis of the kidney  63  and parkinsonian symptoms  52  these findings indicate that the basic mechanisms underlying carbon disulfide poisoning involve atherosclerotic changes in blood vessels  56 64  the clinical manifestations of vascular encephalopathy eg hemiparesis and speech disturbance in cases of chronic carbon disulfide poisoning are similar to those observed in patients with atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disorders  56 59  many patients presenting with acute cerebrovascular strokelike symptoms sometimes with hypertension or diabetes have been misdiagnosed as having suffered cerebrovascular attacks thus the possibility of carbon disulfide poisoning must not be overlooked when physicians make differential diagnoses in patients with vascular encephalopathy historical records of carbon disulfide poisoning in japan suggest the presence of a doseresponse relationship psychosis and peripheral neuropathy due to carbon disulfide poisoning among rayon industry workers were first reported in 1932 and 1934 respectively  65  in the 1930s when the japanese first began producing rayon carbon disulfide poisoning was the most common occupational disease in japan  66  and psychosis resulting from very high exposure was a predominant health problem since 1949 rayon manufacturers have collaborated with university researchers in japan to control carbon disulfide concentrations in the workplace and to monitor the incidence of carbon disulfide poisoning  66  by the 1960s atherosclerosis which is associated with moderate exposure levels became the main type of carbon disulfide poisoning in japan  66  since 1980s similar clinical features eg atherosclerosis have been observed in korean workers with carbon disulfide poisoning probably due to the transfer of the rayon industries from japan in the 1960s  67  neurodegenerative diseases amyotrophic lateral sclerosis alsals is a neurodegenerative disease with an annual worldwide incidence of 24 cases per 100000 individuals  68  a few cases have been reported in korea  69  the association between als and exposure to solvents or lead is unclear and even the bestdesigned incidence studies have produced conflicting results  70 71  other neurodegenerative diseases it is reported that exposure to solvents aluminum mercury or pesticides is implicated in the development of alzheimers disease which is the most common neurodegenerative disease  2  however evidence for this causal relationship is limited and further studies are required pd was dealt with in the manganism section above go to diagnostic approaches for toxic encephalopathy a diagnosis of toxic encephalopathy can be made after documentation of the following 1 a sufficiently intense or prolonged exposure to the neurotoxin 2 a neurological syndrome appropriate for the putative neurotoxins 3 evolution of symptoms and signs over a compatible temporal course and 4 exclusion of other neurological disorders that may account for a similar syndrome  6  the exposure history physical examination neurological examination and additional laboratory and radiological studies are particularly important for diagnosing a toxic encephalopathy an overt toxic encephalopathy is not difficult to recognize if a patient develops a welldescribed clinical syndrome after exposure to a wellknown neurotoxin or if other workers at the same site develop similar clinical pictures the more difficult and more common situation is when a symptomatic individual presents with either an unclear history of exposure or an apparently trivial exposure to a known or suspected neurotoxin in this situation careful evaluation of the case is essential  5  acquisition of a detailed exposure history the patients exposure history is central to an accurate clinical diagnosis many problems can be overlooked or misdiagnosed because the person has not been questioned about his or her job and its related hazards the occupational history should include information about the persons current occupation job task place of employment and dates of attendance on that job  72  exposure data such as workplace airborne concentrations are crucial a detailed evaluation of the nature duration and intensity of the exposure is essential for every evaluation a description of the availability and use of personal protective equipment will provide further information about the extent of possible exposure it is also important to ask questions about hobbies and inadvertent exposure from any source should be considered  72  for the diagnosis of toxic encephalopathy it is likely to be helpful if information on similar problems observed in others at the worksite is available neurological examination after a careful history is obtained clinical examination should be carried out to establish the type and degree of dysfunction the physical examination should include a general examination followed by a detailed neurological examination nonneurological signs may be a clue to toxic exposure examples of systemic clues include blue gums in lead intoxication mees lines in arsenic poisoning and acrodynia in mercury poisoning  3  the neurological examination will generally comprise assessment of mental function mental status examination cranial nerve function muscle strength and tone reflexes muscle stretch and cutaneous sensation station and gait  5  a complete and rigorous neurological examination is necessary to properly define the clinical neurological syndrome involved once defined a differential diagnosis can be entertained and occupational versus nonoccupation or toxic versus nontoxic causes can be determined clinical laboratories when a patient is seen close to the time of exposure it may be possible to measure the offending chemical such as lead and mercury or its metabolite in blood or urine biomarkers can demonstrate that there has been exposure to the relevant toxin and that the exposure was of sufficiently severity to give rise to a clinical syndrome it is obligatory in those cases in which there is an acute illness in relation to exposure however problems will undoubtedly occur in those cases where there is a delay between exposure and the development of clinical symptoms furthermore for most neurotoxins biomarkers are not readily available  4 13  there may be occasionally be paraclincal features in hematological and biochemical tests indicating red blood cell changes as in the case of lead poisoning or liver function test abnormalities as in the case of some organic solvent poisoning for most of neurotoxins however clinical laboratory tests are not helpful for diagnosis  4 13  neurobehavioral testing neurobehavioral neuropsychological testing which is an accepted methodology for assessing the functional integrity of the cns has been used extensively to evaluate subclinical neurotoxic effects on cognition memory alertness executive function mood and psychomotor skills  73  75  there is a wide spectrum of neuropsychological tests and the selection must be tailored to each situation neurobehavioral testing is generally administered by an examiner as in the neurobehavioral core test battery from the who  73  recently however many of the tests have been adapted for use on a personal computer in toxic encephalopathy due to various neurotoxins eg heavy metals or organic solvents neuropsychological studies have been useful in evaluating subclinical findings  45 75 76  indeed since the 1990s subclinical neuropsychological deficits detected by neurobehavioral testing have replaced overt clinical findings as the basis of occupational exposure limits for various neurotoxicants  44 77  neurobehavioral tests are also used as diagnostic criteria for cte electroencephalography eegeeg which records the electric activity of the brain has been used to evaluate occupational neurotoxic exposures  78 79  the changes that are most obvious on eeg such as diffuse slowing are often associated with toxic encephalopathy  4  however the observed abnormalities are not specific meaning that eeg has only a limited value in detecting and characterizing toxic encephalopathy  9  with the advent of recent technological advances in neuroimaging eeg is now used less frequently as a neurodiagnostic method and more often in evaluating epilepsy evoked potentials evpssensory evps are widely used in clinical neurology as an index of the integrity of the sensory cns pathways compared to eeg evps can provide more quantitative information and can be used to assess a sensory pathway from the receptor to the cortex among the evps the visual evoked potential vep auditory evoked potential aep and somatosensory evoked potential sep are most often used in evaluating neurotoxic disease and other neurological disorders  79  however many variables can confound interpretation and the results are not specific to neurotoxic disease  4 and thus should be interpreted with caution  80  marked aep abnormalities have been associated with toluene exposure  81 82  but these studies were performed in toluene abusers who are exposed to much higher levels than those usually found in occupational settings neuroimaging studies since the invention of ct and mri scanners tremendous progress has been made in the medical imaging of the human body neuroimaging can be divided into two groups morphological neuroimaging anatomybased imaging such as ct and mri and functional neuroimaging physiologybased imaging such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy mrs functional mri diffusion tensor imaging dti spect and pet at present with the introduction of new technologies and the solving of technical problems related to the local production of radioisotopes neuroimaging is shifting from morphological to functional  83 84  ctmodern ct scanners are capable of performing multiple slices with rapid data acquisition and overlapping sections using continuously moving xray emitters spiral ct these methods enable the rapid production of exquisite images with threedimensional reconstruction capabilities in the brain the use of xray contrast agents and angiography has improved intracranial imaging but ct remains almost exclusively an anatomical imaging tool  83  86  in terms of neurotoxinrelated damage ct is valuable for ruling out other naturally occurring disorders of the nervous system and it can reveal nonspecific changes eg cortical atrophy in individuals chronically exposed to organic solvents in the workplace  87  mrimri provides images that enhance either the fatty component socalled t1weighted images or the water component socalled t2weighted images of tissues it has emerged as the preeminent imaging modality for visualizing neurological diseases in the central nervous system because it can distinguish gray and white matter zones of demyelination and brain edema  83 88  the distinction between gray and white matter lesions is crucial because gray matter is more vulnerable to anoxic or ischemic insults due to its higher metabolic demands for oxygen and glucose  89  white matter changes such as leukoencephalopathy are usually better seen on mri whereas calcifications and hemorrhages are readily detectable by ct however the severity and extension of brain lesions on morphological neuroimaging do not necessarily match the severity of clinical status  89  t1weighted mri can detect paramagnetic metals such as mn making it uniquely useful in mn neurotoxicology on t1weighted mri mn exposure causes bilateral symmetrical increases in signal intensity that are confined to the globus pallidus and midbrain  39  41 46  mrsnumerous wholebody mr scanners now operate at magnetic fields of 15 tesla t or above meaning that they can perform localized proton mrs without additional hardware  90  the latest veryhighfield strength ie 3 t or more mri systems generate images that combine anatomical and physiological measurements in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy   1 hmrs is an imageguided noninvasive method for monitoring neurochemical metabolites in the brain  90  currently  1 hmrs is most commonly employed to obtain metabolic information that may aid in the diagnosis of many neurological diseases and also allows the evaluation of disease progression and treatment response  91  although mrs permits noninvasive in vivo measurement of brain metabolites only a few mrs investigations have assessed the neurological effects of neurotoxins in environmental or occupational health aydin et al  92 demonstrated decreased nacetylaspartate naa in the cerebellar white matter and centrum semiovale along with increased myoinositol m i in toluene abusers several recent reports have analyzed the impact of lead exposure on brain metabolism in vivo in adults and children  93  96  while two other studies employed mrs to investigate the potential neurotoxic effects of chronic mn exposure on the brain  97 98  in parparticular guilarte et al  97 assessed the toxic effects of chronic mn exposure on the levels of brain metabolites in nonhuman primates this  1 hmrs study found that the naacreatine naacr ratios in the parietal cortex and frontal white matter were decreased after mn exposure indicating ongoing neuronal degeneration or dysfunction naa is known to serve as a neuronal marker  99  and a reduction in brain naa levels can be interpreted as indicating neuronal dysfunction or loss  100  however kim et al  98 found no significant difference between welders and control subjects in this measure similarly chang et al  101 recently showed that the naacr ratios in both the anterior cingulate cortex and parietal white matter did not differ significantly between welders and controls however they found that the m i levels in the anterior cingulate cortex but not in the parietal white matter were significantly lower in welders compared with control individuals furthermore in the frontal lobe of the brain the m icr ratio was significantly correlated with verbal memory scores and blood mn concentrations this study therefore suggested that the depletion of m i in welders may reflect a possible glial cell effect rather than a neuronal effect associated with longterm exposure to mn more recently dydak et al  102 used the megapress sequence to determine γaminobutyric acid gaba levels in the thalamus and found that mnexposed subjects showed significant decreases in the naacr ratio of the frontal cortex and significant increases in the gaba level of the thalamus further mrsbased studies will be required to fully assess the various brain metabolites in mnexposed workers functional mrifunctional mri f mri uses standard clinical mri hardware to collect information regarding brain metabolism changes associated with neuronal activity as neuronal activity and the resulting demand for oxygen increase the supply of oxygenated hemoglobin correspondingly increases along with the mr signal measured on t2 images this generates bloodoxygenationleveldependent bold contrasts  103  the use of f mri to study neurological diseases has become much more common over the last decade but employing f mri to assess neurotoxicity in humans is a rather novel approach there have not yet been any reports on functional mri findings in metal neurotoxicity chang et al  104 were the first to use f mri and sequential fingertapping to investigate the behavioral significance of additionally recruited brain regions in welders who had experienced chronic mn exposure their findings suggest that f mri may help us uncover evidence of compromised brain functioning in patients with subclinical manganism the observation that the cortical motor network was excessively recruited in the chronically mnexposed group is in line with the emerging concept that adaptive neural mechanisms are used to compensate for latent dysfunctions in the basal ganglia chang et al  105 also combined f mri with twoback memory tests to assess the neural correlates of mninduced memory impairment in response to subclinical dysfunction in the working memory networks of welders exposed to mn for extended periods of time these f mri findings indicated that welders might need to recruit more neural resources to their working memory networks in order to compensate for subtle working memory deficits and alterations in working memory processes dtidti which is a unique method for characterizing white matter microintegrity  106  can reveal the orientation of white matter tracts in vivo and yields indices of microstructural integrity by quantifying the directionality of water diffusion  107 108  a few previous studies have explored the toxic encephalopathy associated with exposure to environmental neurotoxins such as mercury  109  mn  110  methanol  111  and carbon monoxide  112 using diffusionweighted image dwi analysis however few studies have reported dtidetected alterations of microscopic integrity within the white matter of subjects experiencing environmental neurotoxic exposure  113  kim et al  114 used dti to investigate whether welders exposed to mn exhibited differences in white matter integrity white matter microstructural abnormalities decreased fractional anisotropy fa which correlated with deficits in motor and cognitive neurobehavioral performance were observed in welders as compared to controls spectspect is a widely distributed functional imaging modality that is more easily accessible and less expensive than pet but has a lower resolution  39  spect allows the imaging of regional blood flow metabolism and neurotransmitter receptors with relatively good spatial resolution spect of patients with minamata disease showed significantly decreased blood flow in the cerebellum  27  in a case of acute lithium intoxication the ct and mri were normal but a spect scan indicated significant focal perfusion defects predominantly involving the left temporoparietal area and the right posterior parietooccipital area  115  huang et al  116 reported that the striatal 99m tctrodat1 uptake in dopamine transporter dat spect was nearly normal in mninduced parkinsonism but was markedly reduced in pd various ligands that bind to dat such as  123 iβcit  123 ifluoropropylcit and 99m tctrodat1 have been used in spect studies to elucidate the function of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway and thus to differentiate manganism from pd  46 116 117  petpet uses shortlived positronemitting isotopes to mark biologically active compounds pet isotopes have such short halflives that they must be produced in onsite cyclotrons to be available in quantities viable for clinical use pet relies on a visibly labeled ligand to provide image specificity  84 118 119  specific ligands have been developed to help elucidate the function of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway for example the ligand  18 fdopa provides information about the conversion of ldopa to dopamine  120  in nonhuman primates and humans with manganism the  18 fdopa pet scan which provides an index of the integrity of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway is normal  39 121  123  by contrast reduced dopamine uptake occurs in the striatum and particularly the posterior putamen of pd patients  39 124  thus  18 fdopa pet scans have

unrecognized in the absence of a detailed neurological examination and comprehensive work history physicians may overlook the possibility of previous or current neurotoxin exposure the recognition of toxic encephalopathy is important for clinicians for several reasons 1 diagnosis can protect others eg workers at the same worksite from further harm by reducing exposure to the toxin 2 diagnosis often provides some indication of prognosis and 3 recognition of neurotoxic exposure can bring about improved hygiene measures that may protect other workers physicians must be aware of the typical signs and symptoms of toxic encephalopathy and they should also pay attention to less typical rather vague symptoms and signs because the toxicological characteristics of toxic encephalopathy may be less typical particularly in cases of longterm lowdose exposure perhaps combined with the effects of aging close collaborations between neurologists and occupational physicians are needed to determine whether neurological disorders are neurotoxinrelated go to summary cte cerebellar syndrome parkinsonism and vascular encephalopathy are commonly encountered clinical syndromes of toxic encephalopathy few neurotoxins cause patients to present with pathognomonic neurologic syndromes the symptoms and signs of toxic encephalopathy may be mimicked by many psychiatric metabolic inflammatory neoplastic and degenerative diseases of the nervous system so the importance of good historytaking and a comprehensive neurological examination cannot be overemphasized in the diagnosis of toxic encephalopathy
