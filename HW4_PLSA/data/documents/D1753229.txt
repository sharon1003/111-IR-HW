from wikipedia the free encyclopedia redirected from jintropinnavigation search growth hormone therapy refers to the use of growth hormone gh as a prescription medication —it is one form of hormone therapy growth hormone is a peptide hormone secreted by the pituitary gland that stimulates growth and cell reproduction in the past growth hormone was extracted from human pituitary glands growth hormone is now produced by recombinant dna technology and is prescribed for a variety of reasons gh therapy has been a focus of social and ethical controversies for 50 years this article describes the history of gh treatment and the current uses and risks arising from gh use other articles describe gh physiology diseases of gh excess  acromegaly and pituitary gigantism  deficiency the recent

hormone deficiency is treated by replacing gh 1 2 3 all gh prescribed in north america europe and most of the rest of the world is a human gh manufactured by recombinant dna technology as gh is a large peptide molecule it must be injected into subcutaneous tissue or muscle to get it into the blood nearly painless insulin syringes make this less trying than is usually anticipated but perceived discomfort is a subjective value when treated with gh a deficient child will begin to grow faster within months other benefits may be noticed such as increased strength progress in motor development and reduction of body fat sideeffects of this type of physiologic replacement are quite rare still costs of treatment in terms of money effort and perhaps quality of life are substantial treatment of children usually involves daily injections of growth hormone usually for as long as the child is growing lifelong continuation may be recommended for those most severely deficient as adults most pediatric endocrinologists monitor growth and adjust dose every 3–4 months assessing the psychological value of treatment is difficult but most children and families are enthusiastic once the physical benefits begin to be seen treatment costs vary by country and by size of child but us 10000 to 30000 a year is common little except the cost of treating severely deficient children is controversial and most children with severe growth hormone deficiency in the developed world are offered treatment although most accept  citation neededhgh deficiency in adults  editthe endocrine society has recommended that adult patients diagnosed with growth hormone deficiency ghd be administered an individualized gh treatment regimen 4 with respect to diagnosis their guidelines state that adults patients with structural hypothalamicpituitary disease surgery or irradiation in these areas head trauma or evidence of other pituitary hormone deficiencies be considered for evaluation for acquired ghd and that idiopathic ghd in adults is very rare and stringent criteria are necessary to make this diagnosis because in the absence of suggestive clinical circumstances there is a significant falsepositive error rate in the response to a single gh stimulation test we suggest the use of two tests before making this diagnosis 4gh replacement therapy can provide a number of measurable benefits to ghdeficient adults 1 2 3 4 these include improved bone density 5 increased muscle mass decrease of adipose tissue faster hair and nail growth strengthened immune system increased circulatory system and improved blood lipid levels but long term mortality benefit has not yet been demonstrated 6 7 8 9a peerreviewed article published in 2010 indicates that growth hormone gh replacement unequivocally benefits growth body composition cardiovascular risk factors and quality of life less is known about the effects of gh on learning and memory 10other  editas of 2004 gh has been approved by the u s food and drug administration for treatment of other conditions in adults wasting or cachexia caused by aids 11turner syndrome epitomizes the response of nondeficient shortness at doses 20 higher than those used in gh deficiency growth accelerates with several years of treatment the median gain in adult height is about 2–3 in 51–76 cm on this dose the gains appear to be dosedependent 12 it has been used successfully in toddlers with turner syndrome 13 as well as in older girls 1 2 3 14shox  short stature homeobox gene deficiency 1chronic renal failure results in many problems including growth failure gh treatment for several years both before and after transplantation may prevent further deceleration of growth and may narrow the height deficit though even with treatment net adult height loss may be about 4 in 10 cm 1 2prader–willi syndrome a generally nonhereditary genetic condition is a case where gh is prescribed for benefits in addition to height gh is one of the treatment options an experienced endocrinologist may use when treating a child with pws 15 gh can help children with pws in height weight body mass strength and agility  citation needed reports have indicated increase of growth rate especially in the first year of treatment and a variety of other positive effects including improved body composition higher muscle mass lower fat mass improved weight management increased energy and physical activity improved strength agility and endurance and improved respiratory function the praderwilli syndrome association usa recommends that a sleep study be conducted before initiating gh treatment in a child with pws at this time there is no direct evidence of a causative link between growth hormone and the respiratory problems seen in pws among both those receiving and those not receiving gh treatment including sudden death a followup sleep study after one year of gh treatment may also be indicated gh specifically pfizers version genotropin is the only treatment that has received an fda indication for children with pws the fda indication only applies to children 3children short because of intrauterine growth retardation are small for gestational age at birth for a variety of reasons if early catchup growth does not occur and their heights remain below the third percentile by 2 or 3 years of age adult height is likely to be similarly low highdose gh treatment has been shown to accelerate growth but data on long term benefits and risks are limited 1 3 16idiopathic short stature iss is one of the most controversial indications for gh as pediatric endocrinologists do not agree on its definition diagnostic criteria or limits 17 the term has been applied to children with severe unexplained shortness that will result in an adult height below the 3rd percentile in the late 1990s the pharmaceutical manufacturer eli lilly and company sponsored trials of humatrope their brand of r hgh in children with extreme iss those at least 225 standard deviations below mean in the lowest 12 percent of the population these boys and girls appeared to be headed toward heights of less than 63 160 cm and 59 150 cm respectively they were treated for about 4 years and gained 15–3 in 38–76 cm in adult height controversy has arisen as to whether all of these children were truly short normal children since the average igf1 was low it was not surprising that approval for this extreme degree of shortness led to an increase in the number of parents seeking treatment to make otherwise healthy children a little taller 1 2 3 18adverse effects  editthe new england journal of medicine published two editorials in 2003 expressing concern about offlabel uses of hgh and the proliferation of advertisements for hghreleasing dietary supplements and emphasized that there is no evidence that use of hgh in healthy adults or in geriatric patients is safe and effective  and especially emphasized that risks of longterm hgh treatment are unknown one editorial was by jeffrey m drazen m d the editorinchief of the journal 19 the other one 20 was by dr mary lee vance who provided the nejms editorial original cautious comment on a much cited 1990 study on the use of hgh in geriatric patients with low growth hormone levels a small but controlled study of gh given to severely ill adults in an intensive care unit setting for the purpose of increasing strength and reducing the muscle wasting of critical illness showed a higher mortality rate for the patients having received gh 21 the reason is unknown but gh is now rarely used in icu patients unless they have severe growth hormone deficiency gh treatment usually decreases insulin sensitivity 22 but some studies showed no evidence for increased diabetes incidence in ghtreated adult hypopituitary patients 23in past it was believed that gh treatment could increase the cancer risk a large study recently concluded that with relatively short followup the overall primary cancer risk in 6840 patients receiving gh as adults was not increased elevated sirs which is risk of getting cancer were found for subgroups in the usa cohort defined by age 35 years or childhood onset gh deficiency 24the fda issued a safety alert in august 2011 communicating the fact that a french study found that persons with certain kinds of short stature idiopathic growth hormone deficiency and idiopathic or gestational short stature treated with recombinant human growth hormone during childhood and who were followed over a long period of time were at a small increased risk of death when compared to individuals in the general population of france 25history  editperhaps the most famous person who exemplified the appearance of untreated congenital growth hormone deficiency was charles sherwood stratton 1838–1883 who was exhibited by p t barnum as general tom thumb and married lavinia warren pictures of the couple show the typical adult features of untreated severe growth hormone deficiency despite the severe shortness limbs and trunks are proportional like many other nineteenthcentury medical terms that lost precise meaning as they gained wider currency “ midget ” as a term for someone with extreme proportional shortness acquired pejorative connotations and is no longer used in medical contexts by the middle of the twentieth century endocrinologists understood the clinical features of growth hormone deficiency gh is a protein hormone like insulin which had been purified from pig and cow pancreases for treatment of type 1 diabetes since the 1920s however pig and cow gh did not work at all in humans due to greater speciestospecies variation of molecular structure ie insulin is considered more evolutionarily conserved than gh extraction for treatment  editextracted growth hormone was used since the late 1950s until the late 1980s when its use was replaced by recombinant gh in the late 1950s maurice raben purified enough gh from human pituitary glands to successfully treat a ghdeficient boy a few endocrinologists began to help parents of severely ghdeficient children to make arrangements with local pathologists to collect human pituitary glands after removal at autopsy parents would then contract with a biochemist to purify enough growth hormone to treat their child few families could manage such a complicated undertaking in 1960 the national pituitary agency was formed as a branch of the u s national institutes of health the purpose of this agency was to supervise the collection of human pituitary glands when autopsies were performed arrange for largescale extraction and purification of gh and distribute it to a limited number of pediatric endocrinologists for treating ghdeficient children under research protocols canada uk australia new zealand france israel and other countries establish similar governmentsponsored agencies to collect pituitaries purify gh and distribute it for treatment of severely ghdeficient children supplies of this “cadaver growth hormone” were limited and only the most severely deficient children were treated from 1963 to 1985 about 7700 children in the u s and 27000 children worldwide were given gh extracted from human pituitary glands to treat severe gh deficiency physicians trained in the relatively new specialty of pediatric endocrinology provided most of this care but in the late 1960s there were only a hundred of these physicians in a few dozen of the largest university medical centers around the world in 1976 physicians became aware that creutzfeldt–jakob disease could be transmitted by neurosurgical procedures and cornea transplantation cjd is a rapidly fatal dementing disease of the brain also known as spongiform encephalopathy related to “ mad cow disease ” in 1977 the npa gh extraction and purification procedure was refined and improved a shortage of available cadaver gh worsened in the late 1970s as the autopsy rate in the u s declined while the number of pediatric endocrinologists able to diagnose and treat gh deficiency increased gh was rationed often treatment would be stopped when a child reached an arbitrary minimal height such as 5 ft 0 in 152 m children who were short for reasons other than severe gh deficiency were lied to and told that they would not benefit from treatment only those pediatric endocrinologists that remained at university medical centers with departments able to support a research program had access to npa growth hormone in the late 1970s a swedish pharmaceutical company kabi contracted with a number of hospitals in europe to buy pituitary glands for the first commercial gh product crescormon although an additional source of gh was welcomed crescormon was greeted with ambivalence by pediatric endocrinologists in the united states the first concern was that kabi would begin to purchase pituitaries in the u s which would quickly undermine the npa which relied on a donation system like blood transfusion  citation needed as the number of autopsies continued to shrink would pathologists sell pituitaries to a higher bidder the second offense was kabipharmacia’s marketing campaign which was directed at primary care physicians under the slogan “now you determine the need” implying that the services of a specialist were not needed for growth hormone treatment anymore and that any short child might be a candidate for treatment although the crescormon controversy in the u s is long forgotten kabi’s pituitary purchase program continued to generate scandal in europe as recently as 2000  citation neededrecombinant human growth hormone r hgh  editin 1981 the new american corporation genentech after collaboration with kabi developed and started trials of recombinant human growth hormone r hgh made by a new technology  recombinant dna in which human genes were inserted into bacteria so that they could produce unlimited amounts of the protein because this was new technology approval was deferred as lengthy safety trials continued over the next four years in 1985 four young adults in the u s having received npa growth hormone in the 1960s developed cjd  creutzfeldt–jakob disease  the connection was recognized within a few months and use of human pituitary gh rapidly ceased between 1985 and 2003 a total of 26 cases of cjd occurred in adults having received npa gh before 1977 out of 7700 comparable numbers of cases occurred around the world by 2003 there had been no cases in people who received only gh purified by the improved 1977 methods discontinuation of human cadaver growth hormone led to rapid food and drug administration approval of genentech’s recombinant human growth hormone which was introduced in 1985 as protropin in the united states although this previously scarce commodity was suddenly available in bucketfuls the price of treatment us10000–30000 per year was the highest at the time genentech justified it by the prolonged research and development investment orphan drug status and a pioneering postmarketing surveillance registry for tracking safety and effectiveness  national cooperative growth study  within a few years gh treatment had become more common and competitors entered the market eli lilly launched a competing natural sequence growth hormone humatrope pharmacia formerly kabi now pfizer introduced genotropin novo nordisk introduced norditropin serono now emd serono introduced saizen and serostim ferring has introduced zomacton genentech eventually introduced another hgh product nutropin and stopped making protropin in 2004 price competition had begun teva which is primarily a generics company has introduced tevtropin chinese companies have entered the market as well and have introduced more pricing competition neo genica bio science ltd introduced hypertropin gene science introduced jintropin anhui anke biotechnology introduced ansomone shanghai united kefei biotechnology introduced kefei hgh 26 and hygene bio pharm introduced hygetropin these are all recombinant human growth hormone products and they have competed with various marketing strategies most children with severe deficiency in the developed world are now likely to have access to a pediatric endocrinologist and be diagnosed and offered treatment pediatric endocrinology became a recognizable specialty in the 1950s but did not reach board status in the u s until the late 1970s even 10 years later as a cognitive procedureless specialty dealing with mostly rare diseases it was one of the smallest lowestpaid and more obscure of the medical specialities  citation needed pediatric endocrinologists were the only physicians interested in the arcana of gh metabolism and children’s growth  citation needed but their previously academic arguments took on new practical significance with major financial implications the major scientific arguments dated back to the days of gh scarcity everyone agrees on the nature and diagnosis of severe gh deficiency but what are the edges and variations how should marked constitutional delay be distinguished from partial gh deficiency to what extent is normal shortness  a matter of short children naturally making less growth hormone can a child make gh in response to a stimulation test but fail to make enough in daily life to grow normally if a stimulation test is used to define deficiency what gh cutoff should be used to define normal it was the ethical questions that were new is gh not a wise use of finite healthcare resources or is the physician’s primary responsibility to the patient if gh is given to most extremely short children to make them taller will the definition of “extremely short” simply rise negating the expected social benefit if gh is given to short children whose parents can afford it will shortness become a permanent mark of lower social origins more of these issues are outlined in the ethics section whole meetings were devoted to these questions pediatric endocrinology had become a specialty with its own bioethics issues despite the price the 1990s became an era of experimentation to see what else growth hormone could help the medical literature of the decade contains hundreds of reports of small trials of gh use in nearly every type of growth failure and shortness imaginable in most cases the growth responses were modest  citation needed for conditions with a large enough potential market more rigorous trials were sponsored by pharmaceutical companies that were making growth hormone to achieve approval to market for those specific indications turner syndrome and chronic renal failure were the first of these “non ghdeficient causes of shortness” to receive fda approval for gh treatment and praderwilli syndrome and intrauterine growth retardation followed similar expansion of use occurred in europe one obvious potential market was adult gh deficiency by the mid1990s several gh companies had sponsored or publicized research into the quality of life of adults with severe gh deficiency  citation needed most were people having been treated with gh in childhood for severe deficiency  citation needed although the injections are painless many of them had been happy to leave injections behind as they reached final heights in the lownormal range  citation needed however as adults in their 30s and 40s these people who had been children with growth hormone deficiency were now adults with growth hormone deficiency and had more than their share of common adult problems reduced physical mental and social energy excess adipose and diminished muscle diminished libido poor bone density higher cholesterol levels and higher rates of cardiovascular disease research trials soon confirmed that a few months of gh could improve nearly all of these parameters however despite marketing efforts most ghdeficient adults remain untreated though gh use was slow to be accepted among adults with gh deficiency similar research to see if gh treatment could slow or reverse some of the similar effects of aging attracted much public interest the most publicized trial was reported by daniel rudman in 1990 27 as with other types of hormone supplementation for aging  testosterone estrogen dhea  confirmation of benefit and accurate understanding of risks has been only slowly evolving in 1997 ronald klatz of the american academy of antiaging medicine published grow young with hgh the amazing medically proven plan to reverse the effects of aging 28 an uncritical touting of gh as the answer to aging 29 30 this time the internet amplified the proposition and spawned a hundred frauds and scams however their adoption of the hgh term has provided an easy way to distinguish the hype from the evidence in 2003 growth hormone hit the news again when the us fda granted eli lilly approval to market humatrope for the treatment of idiopathic short stature the indication was controversial for several reasons the primary one being the difficulty in defining extreme shortness with normal test results as a disease rather than the extreme end of the normal height range 31recombinant growth hormone available in the u s and their manufacturers included nutropin  genentech  humatrope  eli lilly and company  genotropin  pfizer  norditropin  novo nordisk  tevtropin  teva and saizen  merck

therapy of deficient children in the u s cadaver gh also referred to as npa growth hormone was provided by the national pituitary agency and by other national programs and commercial firms as well in
