entertainment gaming tech breaking gdc interview music xbox rock band 4 is coming this year for xbox one and play station 4by ross miller on march 5 2015 0830 am email29share on facebook tweet share pin after years in hiding  on hiatus the age of instrument controllers is yet again upon us harmonix has announced that rock band 4 — the first rock band title for this generation of home consoles — will be launching this year on xbox one and play station 4 the next rock band will largely be a continuation of the platform insomuch as players will be picking up guitar controllers drum controllers and a microphone to play along with both classic and more modern songs alas there isnt much else to go on at this point when we sat down with harmonix product manager daniel sussman during this weeks game developers conference he was pretty cagey about revealing what was new in rock band 4 instead we talked about the legacy of rock band a game that continues to have hundreds of thousands of players every month — a franchise that made hundreds of millions of dollars across a half dozen iterations and over 2000 songs you could strum drum or sing along to speaking of virtually all those songs you bought for previous rock band games should transfer over to rock band 4 provided you stuck to the same console manufacturer when transitioning from generation to generation eg xbox 360 to xbox one and ps3 to ps4 — and if you have the old hardware harmonix is doing everything it can to make it compatible there will be new hardware to buy of course care of mad catz thats a pretty big promise to those who invested a lot into years past as for what else sussman promises well know more at this summers e3 gaming convention rock band 4 behind the scenes with harmonix your browser does

sussman were here talking about rock band 4 ross miller surprise surprise the rumors are true weve had a team working on this for a couple months it really started in earnest over the summer trying to answer the question why now why are we doing this and out of a certain respect that we have for the brand and for the franchise we felt it was really important not to just port rock band 3 but to do something that would be compelling and interesting for us as developers as creative people and also for our community and to really approach a rock band 4 as an opportunity to innovate in this space i dont think this is a genre that has seen a tremendous amount of gameplay innovation as it relates to the core game a lot of the innovations were in adding instruments and adding game modes and adding things that sat next to the core but the core has been pretty static for a long time that to me is a problem and its a thing that weve put a lot of thought into so first thing we did was play a lot of rock band and these are people that have played a lot of rock band and worked on a lot of rock band games and there was this amazing thing that happened as we dipped into the back catalog and went shit this game is really fun it was a really powerful emotional thing to be able to come back to something we hadnt worked on it we hadnt thought about it and a lot of us hadnt really played it for a good amount of time we thought that dlc would be a really interesting way to poke the sleeping bear is that why those recent dlc packs just kind of showed up were you testing the waters well no that was deliberate and ill get into this but what were really interested in this time around is improving the quality of our dialogue with our community such that we can react to things that they want and we thought that releasing dlc would be a really interesting way to poke the sleeping bear a little bit and get people thinking about rock band and asking the question what does this mean the response was exactly what we hoped for it did exactly that and there was a lot of speculation why are they doing this now and whats up with the song titles and are they doing this on purpose what is this we were able to sit back here and go yes we were we were doing it on purpose but the really phenomenal thing about it was that it sent a message to us that hey there are people that are psyched this is not a game that we want to jam down anyones throat we want to make sure that there is a receptive audience that people are excited to come back to this thing and to see what were doing the response that weve gotten to the dlc to the questionnaire that we put out a few weeks ago has been overwhelmingly positive and to that end i think that we do have a handle on some of the issues that people have in respect to things that they care deeply about in terms of what rock band 4 needs to do and also some thoughts about the rise and fall of the band game genre lets talk about the survey what were some of the highlights and lowlights of the responses a few things one thing that jumped out to me which id sort of forgotten about was the degree to which rock band serves as a vehicle for people to learn about new music and i sort of had forgotten i think about rock band and i think about these parties where everybodys sort of singing livin on a prayer its really important for people to have access to songs that they know and dont know and that was a thing that came out on the survey just in terms of what do you think is important about rock band and what are the things you like this is all related though because were sort of peering back through the lens of history to try to figure out like wheres the opportunity here and why are we doing this what are we psyched about as weve started talking to our fans what weve found is that there are a couple of very fundamental things that people care a lot about that are not necessarily these flashy new features that were all excited about but there are things like what about my dlc library what about the hardware that i have in my house so i want to talk about those two things because they matter on the dlc front we are working very hard to port all of the songs that we have had in our library forward to the xbox one and ps4 and thats a timeintensive process were actually taking a library that took us fiveplus years to accumulate and were doing all of that work in a very compressed window in a matter of months what about my dlc library what about the hardware that i have in my house how many songs is that its over 2000 its a big number so its our hope that players have access to the full catalog of music that has already been licensed to this game only a very small percentage actually own everything but there are a lot of people that have bought lots of songs already and to those folks we want to make sure your library of songs on the ps3 will carry forward to the ps4 and same on the xbox 360 to the xbox one not cross platform not cross platform i wouldnt put the stake through that but thats the one that would take a lot of support from microsoft and sony and frankly thats a political rats nest i dont see it and we have our hands full just getting everything up first so building a library is kind of the first step and respecting the entitlements that people have all this — the legacy hardware and the legacy tracks —by launch by launch yes the one hedge there has to do with the volume of songs by launch it is a process and we have to go through all of the submissions process which includes quality assurance to make sure that nothings getting lost in the transfer so the number of songs at launch is directly proportional to the time it takes to get a song up the challenge then is just dealing with the immense volume of songs that were working with how long does it take to qa a song youd be surprised i would guess a couple of days at least yeah so maybe not all right and again there are pieces that can be automated and were not talking about days per song per se — its not going to take us years to rebuild the catalog we can make a pretty big dent in it in the course of the next couple months a lot of this sounds like a continuation of rock band 3 well theres an element of rock band as a platform the investment people have made in rock band and in their connection to rock band regardless of whatever were doing thats new theres a lot of new stuff but we really want to make sure were being respectful of the financial investment people have made — the songs that theyve bought and the hardware that theyve bought — and if they want to play those songs and they want to use that hardware i think its our responsibility to say okay that makes a lot of sense as a consumer i totally understand where youre coming from at the same time we are working with mad catz to develop new hardware there are people who for whatever reason dont have their old stuff anymore and there are people that never had anything to begin with who we think will be very excited about what were doing so mad catz is developing a new drum a new guitar and a new microphone the form factor and general functionality is consistent with what weve done before mostly because hey if we have a commitment to supporting legacy controllers we dont want to upsell the new controllers by saying hey these have a new thing that lets you get a better score than the old stuff theres functional parity between the two that said theres all sorts of room for improvement from a build quality standpoint and a component quality standpoint there are some incremental wins to be had from building stuff in this particular time so the drums will be four toms and a kick and the guitar will be five buttons ten buttons but yes what is new in rock band 4 what are you looking to do thats not been done in the series before a few things one is sort of our perspective on a longer play here where were not positioning rock band 4 as sort of the first in a long step of subsequent sequels we think of rock band 4 as a successor to rock band 3 but our plan for the long term is to augment rock band 4 to build upon the game in a way that makes sense and is designed through a conversation with our community with respect to content updates what are the songs that people want to see and how many should there be and other areas of content expansion in the game and also features looking at how people are playing the game and doing sort of incremental title updates that grow the franchise in one of any number of directions i think thats actually a novel thing in the context of music games at the end of the day were positioning rock band 4 as the nucleus to an experience that has a much longer tail and a more viable future in a lot of ways i think thats sort of a framing statement around our longterm plan some of the stuff that well have on display at e3 this year i cant really talk about in detail but i do want to cover quickly the specific areas where i feel theres a lot opportunity for innovation and this is the stuff that the team is really dialed in on one of which is improving some of the inroad social dynamics of playing music with other people rock band is perceived as this great party game but when you watch people play in a lot of cases its four people playing a singleplayer game next to someone else whos playing a singleplayer game the opportunities for the drummer to be aware of what the bass player is doing and for the singer to have some sort of relationship with the other people in that band the game doesnt naturally sponsor or reward that type of behavior and i think it should because its huge part of playing music with people so more to come at e3 more to come
