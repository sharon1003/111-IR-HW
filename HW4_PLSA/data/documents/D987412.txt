autochrome color photograph of a french army lookout at his observation post during world war i color or colour photography is photography that uses media capable of reproducing colors by contrast blackandwhite monochrome photography records only a single channel of luminance brightness and uses media capable only of showing shades of gray in color photography electronic sensors or lightsensitive chemicals record color information at the time of exposure this is usually done by analyzing the spectrum of colors into three channels of information one dominated by red another by green and the third by blue in imitation of the way the normal human eye senses color the recorded information is then used to reproduce the original colors by mixing various proportions of red green and blue light  rgb color used by video displays digital projectors and some historical photographic processes or by using dyes or pigments to remove various proportions of the red green and blue

 editcolor photography was attempted beginning in the 1840s early experiments were directed at finding a chameleon substance which would assume the color of the light falling on it some encouraging early results typically obtained by projecting a solar spectrum directly onto the sensitive surface seemed to promise eventual success but the comparatively dim image formed in a camera required exposures lasting for hours or even days the quality and range of the color was sometimes severely limited mainly to primary colors as in the chemically complicated hillotype process invented by american daguerreotypist levi hill around 1850 other experimenters such as edmond becquerel achieved better results but could find no way to prevent the colors from quickly fading when the images were exposed to light for viewing over the following several decades renewed experiments along these lines periodically raised hopes and then dashed them yielding nothing of practical value an entirely different approach to color  editgabriel lippmann is remembered as the inventor of a method for reproducing colors by photography based on the interference phenomenon which earned him the nobel prize in physics for 1908 5in 1886 lippmanns interest had turned to a method of fixing the colors of the solar spectrum on a photographic plate on 2 february 1891 he announced to the academy of sciences i have succeeded in obtaining the image of the spectrum with its colors on a photographic plate whereby the image remains fixed and can remain in daylight without deterioration by april 1892 he was able to report that he had succeeded in producing color images of a stained glass window a group of flags a bowl of oranges topped by a red poppy and a multicolored parrot he presented his theory of color photography using the interference method in two papers to the academy one in 1894 the other in 1906 6threecolor processes  editthe threecolor method which is the foundation of virtually all practical color processes whether chemical or electronic was first suggested in an 1855 paper on color vision by scottish physicist james clerk maxwell 3 4it is based on the younghelmholtz theory that the normal human eye sees color because its inner surface is covered with millions of intermingled cone cells of three types in theory one type is most sensitive to the end of the spectrum we call red another is more sensitive to the middle or green region and a third which is most strongly stimulated by blue the named colors are somewhat arbitrary divisions imposed on the continuous spectrum of visible light and the theory is not an entirely accurate description of cone sensitivity but the simple description of these three colors coincides enough with the sensations experienced by the eye that when these three colors are used the three cones types are adequately and unequally stimulated to form the illusion of various intermediate wavelengths of light in his studies of color vision maxwell showed by using a rotating disk with which he could alter the proportions that any visible hue or gray tone could be made by mixing only three pure colors of light – red green and blue – in proportions that would stimulate the three types of cells to the same degrees under particular lighting conditions 7 to emphasize that each type of cell by itself did not actually see color but was simply more or less stimulated he drew an analogy to blackandwhite photography if three colorless photographs of the same scene were taken through red green and blue filters and transparencies slides made from them were projected through the same filters and superimposed on a screen the result would be an image reproducing not only red green and blue but all of the colors in the original scene 8the first color photograph made according to maxwells prescription a set of three monochrome  color separations  was taken by thomas sutton in 1861 for use in illustrating a lecture on color by maxwell where it was shown in color by the triple projection method 9 the test subject was a bow made of ribbon with stripes of various colors apparently including red and green during the lecture which was about physics and physiology not photography maxwell commented on the inadequacy of the results and the need for a photographic material more sensitive to red and green light a century later historians were mystified by the reproduction of any red at all because the photographic process used by sutton was for all practical purposes totally insensitive to red light and only marginally sensitive to green in 1961 researchers found that many red dyes also reflect ultraviolet light coincidentally transmitted by sutton’s red filter and surmised that the three images were probably due to ultraviolet bluegreen and blue wavelengths rather than to red green and blue 10additive color  editcreating colors by mixing colored lights usually red green and blue in various proportions is the additive method of color reproduction lcd led plasma and crt picture tube color video displays all use this method if one of these displays is examined with a sufficiently strong magnifier it will be seen that each pixel is actually composed of red green and blue subpixels which blend at normal viewing distances reproducing a wide range of colors as well as white and shades of gray this is also known as the rgb color model subtractive color  editthe same three images taken through red green and blue filters which are used for additive color synthesis may also be used to produce color prints and transparencies by the subtractive method in which colors are subtracted from white light by dyes or pigments in photography the dye colors are normally cyan a greenishblue which absorbs red magenta a purplishpink which absorbs green and yellow which absorbs blue the redfiltered image is used to create a cyan dye image the greenfiltered image to create a magenta dye image and the bluefiltered image to create a yellow dye image when the three dye images are superimposed they form a complete color image this is also known as the cmyk color model the k is a black component normally added in inkjet and other mechanical printing processes to compensate for the imperfections of the colored inks used which ideally should absorb or transmit various parts of the spectrum but not reflect any color and to improve image definition at first it may seem that each image ought to be printed in the color of the filter used in making it but by following any given color through the process the reason for printing in complementary colors should become apparent a red object for example will be very pale in the redfiltered image but very dark in the other two images so the result will be an area with just a trace of cyan absorbing just a bit of red light but a large amount of magenta and yellow which together absorb most of the green and blue light leaving mainly red light to be reflected back from the white paper in the case of a print or transmitted through a clear support in the case of a transparency before the technical innovations of the years 1935 to 1942 the only way to create a subtractive fullcolor print or transparency was by means of one of several laborintensive and timeconsuming procedures most commonly three pigment images were first created separately by the socalled carbon process and then carefully combined in register sometimes related processes were used to make three gelatin matrices which were dyed and assembled or used to transfer the three dye images into a single layer of gelatin coated on a final support chemical toning could be used to convert three blackandwhite silver images into cyan magenta and yellow images which were then assembled in a few processes the three images were created one on top of another by repeated coating or resensitizing negative registration exposure and development operations a number of variations were devised and marketed during the first half of the 20th century some of them shortlived others such as the trichrome carbro process enduring for several decades because some of these processes allow very stable and lightfast coloring matter to be used yielding images which can remain virtually unchanged for centuries they are still not quite completely extinct the production of photographic threecolor prints on paper was pioneered by louis ducos du hauron whose comprehensive 1868 french patent also included the basic concepts of most of the color photographic processes which were subsequently developed for making the three colorfiltered negatives required he was able to develop materials and methods which were not as completely blind to red and green light as those used by thomas sutton in 1861 but they were still very insensitive to those colors exposure times were impractically long the red or orangefiltered negative requiring hours of exposure in the camera his earliest surviving color prints are sun prints of pressed flowers and leaves each of the three negatives having been made without a camera by exposing the lightsensitive surface to direct sunlight passing first through a color filter and then through the vegetation his first attempts were based on the redyellowblue colors then used for pigments with no color reversal later he used the primary colors of light with color reversal color sensitization  editas long as photographic materials were usefully sensitive only to bluegreen blue violet and ultraviolet threecolor photography could never be practical in 1873 german chemist hermann wilhelm vogel discovered that the addition of small amounts of certain aniline dyes to a photographic emulsion could add sensitivity to colors which the dyes absorbed he identified dyes which variously sensitized for all the previously ineffective colors except true red to which only a marginal trace of sensitivity could be added 11 12 13 14 in the following year edmond becquerel discovered that chlorophyll was a good sensitizer for red 15 although it would be many more years before these sensitizers and better ones developed later found much use beyond scientific applications such as spectrography they were quickly and eagerly adopted by louis ducos du hauron charles cros and other color photography pioneers exposure times for the problem colors could now be reduced from hours to minutes as evermoresensitive gelatin emulsions replaced the old wet and dry collodion processes the minutes became seconds new sensitizing dyes introduced early in the 20th century eventually made socalled instantaneous color exposures possible color cameras  editmaking color separations by reloading the camera and changing the filter between exposures was inconvenient added delays to the already long exposure times and could result in the camera being accidentally shifted out of position to improve the actual picturetaking a number of experimenters designed one or more special cameras for color photography they were usually of two main types the first type used a system of partially reflecting surfaces to divide the light coming through the lens into three parts each part passing through a different color filter and forming a separate image so that the three images could be photographed at the same time on three plates flexible film had not yet replaced glass plates as the support for the emulsion or different areas of one plate later known as oneshot cameras refined versions continued to be used as late as the 1950s for special purposes such as commercial photography for publication in which a set of color separations was ultimately required in order to prepare printing plates the second type known variously as a multiple back repeating back or drop back camera still exposed the images one at a time but used a sliding holder for the filters and plates which allowed each filter and the corresponding unexposed area of emulsion to be quickly shifted into place german photochemistry professor adolf miethe designed a highquality camera of this type which was commercially introduced by bermpohl in 1903 it was probably this miethebermpohl camera which was used by miethes pupil sergei mikhailovich prokudingorskii to make his nowcelebrated color photographic surveys of russia before the 1917 revolution one sophisticated variant patented by frederic eugene ives in 1897 was driven by clockwork and could be adjusted to automatically make each of the exposures for a different length of time according to the particular color sensitivities of the emulsion being used 16otherwise simple cameras with multiple colorfiltered lenses were sometimes tried but unless everything in the scene was at a great distance or all in a plane at the same distance the difference in the viewpoints of the lenses  parallax made it impossible to completely register all parts of the resulting images at the same time color photography leaves the laboratory  editprior to the late 1890s color photography was strictly the domain of a very few intrepid experimenters willing to build their own equipment do their own colorsensitizing of photographic emulsions make and test their own color filters and otherwise devote a large amount of time and effort to their pursuits there were many opportunities for something to go wrong during the series of operations required and problemfree results were rare most photographers still regarded the whole idea of color photography as a pipe dream something only madmen and swindlers would claim to have accomplished in 1898 however it was possible to buy the required equipment and supplies readymade two adequately redsensitive photographic plates 17 were already on the market and two very different systems of color photography with which to use them tantalizingly described in photographic magazines for several years past were finally available to the public the most extensive and expensive of the two was the kromskop pronounced chromescope system developed by frederic eugene ives this was a straightforward additive system and its essential elements had been described by james clerk maxwell louis ducos du hauron and charles cros much earlier but ives invested years of careful work and ingenuity in refining the methods and materials to optimize color quality in overcoming problems inherent in the optical systems involved and in simplifying the apparatus to bring down the cost of producing it commercially the color images dubbed kromograms were in the form of sets of three blackandwhite transparencies on glass mounted onto special clothtapehinged triple cardboard frames to see a kromogram in color it had to be inserted into a kromskop generic name chromoscope or photochromoscope a viewing device which used an arrangement of colored glass filters to illuminate each slide with the correct color of light and transparent reflectors to visually combine them into a single fullcolor image the most popular model was stereoscopic by looking through its pair of lenses an image in full natural color and 3d was seen a startling novelty in the late victorian age the results won nearuniversal praise for excellence and realism at demonstrations ives sometimes placed a viewer displaying a stilllife subject next to the actual objects photographed inviting direct comparison a kromskop triple lantern could be used to project the three images mounted in a special metal or wooden frame for this purpose through filters as maxwell had done in 1861 prepared kromograms of stilllife subjects landscapes famous buildings and works of art were sold and these were the kromskop viewers usual fodder but a multiple back camera attachment and a set of three specially adjusted color filters could be bought by kromskopists wishing to make their own kromograms kromskops and readymade kromograms were bought by educational institutions for their value in teaching about color and color vision and by individuals who were in a position to pay a substantial sum for an intriguing optical toy a few people did indeed make their own kromograms unfortunately for ives this was not enough to sustain the businesses which had been set up to exploit the system and they soon failed but the viewers projectors kromograms and several varieties of kromskop cameras and camera attachments continued to be available through the scientific shop in chicago as late as 1907 the screen plate era  editthe simpler and somewhat more economical alternative was the joly screen process this required no special camera or viewer just a special colorcompensating filter for the camera lens and a special holder for the photographic plates the holder contained the heart of the system a clear glass plate on which very fine lines of three colors had been ruled in a regular repeating pattern completely covering its surface the idea was that instead of taking three separate complete photographs through three colored filters the filters could be in the form of a large number of very narrow strips the colored lines allowing the necessary color information to be recorded in a single compound image after the negative was developed a positive transparency was printed from it and a viewing screen with red green and blue lines in the same pattern as the lines of the taking screen was applied and carefully aligned the colors then appeared as if by magic the transparency and screen were very like the layer of monochrome liquid crystal elements and overlay of hairthin red green and blue color filter stripes which create the color image in a typical lcd display this was the invention of irish scientist john joly although he like so many other inventors eventually discovered that his basic concept had been anticipated in louis ducos du haurons longsinceexpired 1868 patent 18the joly screen process had some problems first and foremost although the colored lines were reasonably fine about 75 sets of three colored lines to the inch they were still disturbingly visible at normal viewing distances and nearly intolerable when enlarged by projection this problem was exacerbated by the fact that each screen was individually ruled on a machine which used three pens to apply the transparent colored inks resulting in irregularities high reject rates and high cost the glass used for photographic plates at the time was not perfectly flat and lack of uniform good contact between the screen and the image gave rise to areas of degraded color poor contact also caused false colors to appear if the sandwich was viewed at an angle although much simpler than the kromskop system the joly system was not inexpensive the starter kit of plate holder compensating filter one taking screen and one viewing screen cost 30 the equivalent of at least 750 in 2010 dollars and additional viewing screens were 1 each the equivalent of at least 25 in 2010 dollars this system too soon died of neglect although in fact it pointed the way to the future surviving examples of the joly process usually show extremely poor color now the colors in the viewing screens have badly faded and shifted making it impossible to judge their original appearance in some specimens the viewing screen is also misaligned lippmann photography is a way of making a color photograph that relies on bragg reflection planes in the emulsion to make the colors it is similar to using the colors of soap bubbles to make an image gabriel jonas lippmann won the nobel prize in physics in 1908 for the creation of the first color photographic process using a single emulsion the color fidelity is extremely high but the images can not be reproduced and viewing requires very specific lighting conditions the development of the autochrome process quickly rendered the lippmann method redundant the method is still utilized to make singular images that cannot be copied for security purposes the first commercially successful color process the lumière autochrome invented by the french lumière brothers reached the market in 1907 it was based on an irregular screen plate filter made of dyed grains of potato starch which were too small to be individually visible the lightsensitive emulsion was coated directly onto the screen eliminating problems due to imperfect contact between the screen and image reversal processing was used to convert the negative image which was initially produced into a positive image so no printing or screen registration was required the shortcomings of the autochrome process were the expense one plate cost about as much as a dozen blackandwhite plates of the same size the relatively long exposure times which made handheld snapshots and photographs of moving subjects impractical and the density of the finished image due to the presence of the lightabsorbing color screen viewed under optimum conditions and by daylight as intended a wellmade and wellpreserved autochrome can look startlingly fresh and vivid unfortunately modern film and digital copies are usually made with a highly diffused light source which causes loss of color saturation and other ill effects due to light scatter within the structure of the screen and emulsion and by fluorescent or other artificial light which alters the color balance the capabilities of the process should not be judged by the dull washedout oddcolored reproductions commonly seen millions of autochrome plates were manufactured and used during the quarter century before the plates were replaced by filmbased versions in the 1930s the very last film version named alticolor brought the autochrome process into the 1950s but was discontinued in 1955 many additive color screen products were available between the 1890s and the 1950s but none with the possible exception of dufaycolor introduced as film for still photography in 1935 was as popular or successful as the lumière autochrome the most recent use of the additive screen process for nondigital photography was in polachrome an instant 35mm slide film introduced in 1983 and discontinued about twenty years later tripacks  editlouis ducos du hauron had suggested using a sandwich of three differently colorrecording emulsions on transparent supports which could be exposed together in an ordinary camera then taken apart and used like any other set of threecolor separations the problem was that although two of the emulsions could be in contact facetoface the third would have to be separated by the thickness of one transparent support layer because all silver halide emulsions are inherently sensitive to blue the bluerecording layer ought to be on top and have a blueblocking yellow filter layer behind it this bluerecording layer used to make the yellow print which could most afford to be soft would end up producing the sharpest image the two layers behind it one sensitized to red but not green and the other to green but not red would suffer from scattering of the light as it passed through the topmost emulsion and one or both would further suffer by being spaced away from it despite these limitations some tripacks were commercially produced such as the hessives hiblock which sandwiched an emulsion on film between emulsions coated on glass plates for a brief period in the early 1930s the american agfaansco company produced colorol a rollfilm tripack for snapshot cameras the three emulsions were on unusually thin film bases after exposure the roll was sent to agfaansco for processing and the triple negatives were returned to the customer with a set of color prints the images were not sharp and the color was not very good but they were genuine natural color snapshots bipacks using only two emulsions facetoface were the subject of some development although the range of colors which could be reproduced by only two components was limited skin tones and most hair and eye colors could be rendered with surprising fidelity making bipack processes a viable option for color portraiture in commercial practice however the use of bipacks was almost entirely confined to twocolor motion picture systems if the three layers of emulsion in a tripack did not have to be taken apart in order to produce the cyan magenta and yellow dye images from them they could be coated directly on top of each other eliminating the most serious problems in fact some chemical magic was under development which would make that possible color film since the 1930s  editin 1935 american eastman kodak introduced the first modern integral tripack color film and called it kodachrome a name recycled from an earlier and completely different twocolor process its development was led by the improbable team of leopold mannes and leopold godowsky jr nicknamed man and god two highly regarded classical musicians who had started tinkering with color photographic processes and ended up working with the kodak research laboratories kodachrome had three layers of emulsion coated on a single base each layer recording one of the three additive primaries red green and blue in keeping with kodaks old you press the button we do the rest slogan the film was simply loaded into the camera exposed in the ordinary way then mailed to kodak for processing the complicated part if the complexities of manufacturing the film are ignored was the processing which involved the controlled penetration of chemicals into the three layers of emulsion only a simplified description of the process is appropriate in a short history as each layer was developed into a blackandwhite silver image a  dye coupler  added during that stage of development caused a cyan magenta or yellow dye image to be created along with it the silver images were chemically removed leaving only the three layers of dye images in the finished film initially kodachrome was available only as 16mm film for home movies but in 1936 it was also introduced as 8mm home movie film and short lengths of 35mm film for still photography in 1938 sheet film in various sizes for professional photographers was introduced some changes were made to cure early problems with unstable colors and a somewhat simplified processing method was instituted in 1936 the german agfa followed with their own integral tripack film agfacolor neu which was generally similar to kodachrome but had one important advantage agfa had found a way to incorporate the dye couplers into the emulsion layers during manufacture allowing all three layers to be developed at the same time and greatly simplifying the processing most modern color films excepting the nowdiscontinued kodachrome use the incorporated dye coupler technique but since the 1970s nearly all have used a modification developed by kodak rather than the original agfa version in 1941 kodak made it possible to order prints from kodachrome slides the print paper was actually a white plastic coated with a multilayer emulsion similar to that on the film these were the first commercially available color prints created by the chromogenic dye coupler method in the following year kodacolor film was introduced unlike kodachrome it was designed to be processed into a negative image which showed not only light and dark reversed but also complementary colors the use of such a negative for making prints on paper simplified the processing of the prints reducing their cost the expense of color film as compared to blackandwhite and the difficulty of using it with indoor lighting combined to delay its widespread adoption by amateurs in 1950 blackandwhite snapshots were still the norm by 1960 color was much more common but still tended to be reserved for travel photos and special occasions color film and color prints still cost several times as much as blackandwhite and taking color snapshots in deep shade or indoors required the use of flashbulbs an inconvenience and an additional expense by 1970 prices were coming down film sensitivity had been improved electronic flash units were replacing flashbulbs and in most families color had become the norm for snapshottaking blackandwhite film continued to be used by some photographers who preferred it for aesthetic reasons or who wanted to take pictures by existing light in lowlight conditions which was still difficult to do with color film they usually did their own developing and printing by 1980 blackandwhite film in the formats used by typical snapshot cameras as well as commercial developing and printing service for it had nearly disappeared instant color film was introduced by polaroid in 1963 like polaroids contemporary instant blackandwhite film their first color product was a negativepositive peelapart process which produced a unique print on paper the negative could not be reused and was discarded the blight created by carelessly discarded causticchemicalladen polaroid negatives which tended to accumulate most heavily at the prettiest most snapshotworthy locations horrified polaroid founder edwin land and prompted him to develop the later sx70 system which produced no separate negative to discard some currently available color films are designed to produce positive transparencies for use in a slide projector or magnifying viewer although paper prints can also be made from them transparencies are preferred by some professional photographers who use film because they can be judged without having to print them first transparencies are also capable of a wider dynamic range and therefore of a greater degree of realism than the more convenient medium of prints on paper the early popularity of color slides among amateurs went into decline after the introduction of automated printing equipment started bringing print quality up and prices down other currently available films are designed to produce color negatives for use in creating enlarged positive prints on color photographic paper color negatives may also be digitally scanned and then printed by nonphotographic means or viewed as positives electronically unlike reversalfilm transparency processes negativepositive processes are within limits forgiving of incorrect exposure and poor color lighting because a considerable degree of correction is possible at the time of printing negative film is therefore more suitable for casual use by amateurs virtually all singleuse cameras employ negative film photographic transparencies can be made from negatives by printing them on special positive film but this has always been unusual outside of the motion picture industry and commercial service to do it for still images may no longer be available negative films and paper prints are by far the most common form of color film photography today digital photography  editafter a transition period centered around 1995–2005 color film was relegated to a niche market by inexpensive multimegapixel digital cameras which can shoot both in monochrome as well as color film continues to be the preference of some photographers because of its distinctive look and fondness of the format artists perspectives  editphotographers differed in opinion about color photography when it was first introduced some fully embraced it when it was available to the public in the late 1930s while others remained skeptical of its relevance in the art of photography fans of color  editferenc berko a classic photographer  vague who lived during the rise of color film was one of the photographers who immediately recognized the potential of color film he saw it as a new way to frame the world a way to experiment with the subjects he photographed and how he conveyed emotion in the photograph 19john hedgecoe another photographer who lived during this time period  vague was another example of those who preferred color he published a book entitled the art of color photography in which he explained the importance of understanding the special and often subtle relationships between different colors he also described the psychological and emotional power that color can have on the viewer since certain colors he argues can make people feel a certain way 20jan groover a postmodernist noted for her work during the 1970s used color extensively in her work skeptics  editthough color photography had its followers blackandwhite still remained the more popular and respected film when color first came out harold baquet for instance—a relatively current photographer  vague known best for documenting new orleans civil rights—was not keen on color he preferred to take pictures mainly using blackandwhite film when asked about his reasoning for this preference during an interview he replied “the less is more thing sometimes the color distracts from the essential subject sometimes just light line and form is enough and it allows you to explore the sculptural qualities of that third dimension that illusional dimension of depth and it’s fun” 21 this aversion to color was due mainly to a fear of losing simplicity in his pictures he worried that color gave the eye too much to take in 21this worry was not uncommon photographer ansel adams known best for his dramatic blackandwhite landscapes also felt that color could be distracting and could therefore divert the artist’s attention away from creating a photograph to his full potential according to some experts adams actually claimed that he could get a far greater sense of color through a wellplanned and executed blackandwhite image than he had ever achieved with color photography 22 another expert source  vague mentioned that adams was a master of control he wrote books about technique developed the zone system —which helped determine the optimal exposure and development time for a given photograph—and introduced the idea of previsualization which involved the photographer imagining what he wanted his final print to look like before he even took the shot these concepts and methods allowed for nearly total control of all the potential variables that factor into a final print because of this love for control adams disliked color because it lacked this element that he had mastered with blackandwhite  citation neededwhile adams initially was far from thrilled with color he did experiment with it unknown to many a few examples of his color work are available in the online archive of the center for creative photography at the university of arizona his subjects that he shot in color ranged from portraits to landscape to architecture 23 a similar scope to that of his black and white work in fact toward the end of his life adams admitted  citation needed his regret of not being able to master the technique of color according to an expert source  vaguethough a wide range of film preference still exists among photographers today color has with time gained a much larger following as well as a higher level of respect in the field of photography as a whole preservation issues  editexperimentation with creating photographs that mirrored the colors of real life began in the 1840s each process may require different methods of preservation color photographic materials are impermanent and are by nature unstable chromogenic color photographs for example are composed of yellow magenta and cyan organic dyes which fade at different rates even when in dark storage and enclosed in the proper archival materials deterioration is unavoidable however when given the proper preservation care fading color shifting and discoloration can be delayed factors  editnumerous factors can deteriorate and even destroy photographs some examples include high temperature and high relative humidity rhair pollution and dirt light exposure biological threats such as fungi and insects residual processing chemicals base and emulsion deterioration handling and usage improper storage and enclosures three signs of age that affect color photography are dark fading occurs regardless of the procedures taken to preserve a photograph and is unavoidable it is instigated by temperature and rh cyan dyes will typically fade more quickly which will make the image appear too red in color light fading occurs when materials are exposed to light eg while on display the intensity of the light source and ultraviolet uv rays will affect the rate of change and fade magenta dyes will typically fade the quickest highlight staining occurs with older color photographic papers and is a yellowing of the border and highlight areas of a photograph storage  editin general the colder the storage the longer the life of color photographs frostfree refrigeration more commonly known as cold storage below freezing is one of the most effective ways to bring a halt to developing damage to color photographic materials selecting this type of storage environment is costly and requires special training to remove and return items therefore cool storage above freezing is more common and less costly which requires that the temperature is consistently between 10–15 °c 50–59 °f with 30–40 relative humidity with special attention to dew point to eliminate concerns for condensation general dark storage in light tight enclosures and storage boxes is always advised for individual items when materials are exposed to light during handling usage or display light sources should be uvfiltered and intensity kept at minimum in storage areas 200–400 lux is recommended recommended storage  editthe usage of enclosures is the easiest method of preserving photographic materials from being damaged through handling and light exposure all protective materials should pass the photographic activity test pat as described both by the american national standards institute ansi in standard it92–1988 and the international organization for standardization iso in standard 189162007 e photography – processed photographic materials – photographic activity test for enclosure materials the pat is an archival science test that determines what kind of enclosures will preserve prevent andor prolong from further deterioration while in storage the recommended use of archival enclosures includes each item having its own enclosure and that each enclosure is of the appropriate size archival enclosures may come in two different forms paper or plastic choosing either option has its advantages and disadvantages paper enclosures should be nonacidic ligninfree paper and may come in either buffered or nonbuffered stock an advantage of paper is that it is generally less costly than plastic enclosures the opaque quality of paper protects photographs from light exposure and the porous quality protects photographs from humidity and gaseous pollutants however for images to be viewed they must be removed from the enclosure putting the materials at risk for mishandling andor vandalism archival quality plastic enclosures are made of uncoated polyester polypropylene or polyethylene the transparent quality of plastic lends itself to easier access to the image because there is no extra step to remove the photograph plastic is also less resistant to tears in comparison to paper some disadvantages include being prone to static electricity and a risk of ferrotyping the act of moisture becoming trapped between the enclosure and item causing the materials to stick to one another after photographic materials are individually enclosed housing or storage containers provide another protective barrier such as folders and boxes made from archival paperboard as addressed in iso standards 189162007 and 18902 sometimes these containers have to be custommade in order to properly store odd sizes in general flat storage in boxes is recommended because it provides more stable support particularly for materials that are in more fragile condition still boxes and folders should never be overfilled

curves the characteristics of the lumière panchromatic and cadett spectrum plates as of 1896 note that during this period orthochromatic was not intended to mean redblind although most or all commercial products so labeled indeed were which may explain the subsequent evolution in the meaning of the word the wild rollercoaster curves necessitated laborious adjustment and testing of the color filters to obtain the three desired curves in the cases of the red and green filters that could mean quashing over ninetynine percent of the overall sensitivity requiring exposures measured in seconds under circumstances where onefiftieth of a second would have sufficed for unfiltered monochrome use disproportionate blue sensitivity requiring the use of a yellow filter for accurate monochrome rendition in daylight was typical of commercial panchromatic emulsions far into the 20th century see also the previously referenced ives f kromskop color photography price list following page 80 pages 1–2 and the subsequently referenced joly j on a method page 135 for mentions of the use of the lumière panchromatic in those systems the alternative alluded to in ives may be the cadett spectrum but could also be the edwards isochromatic only slightly sensitive to red which ives is on record as having employed at an earlier date the cadett lightning spectrum plate with an improved
