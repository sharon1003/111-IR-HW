portalv t e agorism is a libertarian social philosophy that advocates creating a society in which all relations between people are voluntary exchanges by means of countereconomics thus engaging with aspects of peaceful revolution it was first proposed by libertarian philosopher samuel edward konkin iii at two conferences counter con i in october 1974 and counter con ii in may 1975 both conferences organized by j neil schulman 1 2contents  hide 1 etymology2 origins3 ideology31 countereconomics311 profitable civil disobedience312 opposition to partyarchy313 voluntary association32

referring to an open place for assembly and market in a πόλις  polis ancient greek citystates 3origins  editsymbol for agorism according to konkin countereconomics and agorism were originally fighting concepts forged in the revolutionary atmosphere of 1972–73 4 konkin credits the austrian school particularly ludwig von mises as the base of economic thought leading to agorism and countereconomics 4in the 1960–70s there was an abundance of political alienation in the united states particularly for those in favor of libertarian ideologies whereas murray rothbard chose to create political alliances between the old right and the new left robert le fevre and his west coast followers pursued a nonparticipatory form of civil disobedience 4 ultimately le fevres anticollaboration methods lost favor and faded away after the creation of the libertarian party united states in 1971 the debate shifted from anarchy vs minarchism to partyarchy vs agorism 4ideology  editkonkin characterized agorism as a form of leftlibertarianism specifically leftwing market anarchism  5 6 and generally that agorism is a strategic branch of market anarchism 7the goal of agorism is the agora the society of the open marketplace as near to untainted by theft assault and fraud as can be humanly attained is as close to a free society as can be achieved and a free society is the only one in which each and every one of us can satisfy his or her subjective values without crushing others’ values by violence and coercion— samuel edward konkin iii 7countereconomics  editsee also countereconomics the concept of countereconomics is the most critical element of agorism it can be described as the countereconomy is the sum of all nonaggressive human action which is forbidden by the state countereconomics is the study of the countereconomy and its practices the countereconomy includes the free market the black market the “underground economy” all acts of civil and social disobedience all acts of forbidden association sexual racial crossreligious and anything else the state at any place or time chooses to prohibit control regulate tax or tariff the countereconomy excludes all stateapproved action the “white market” and the red market violence and theft not approved by the state 8profitable civil disobedience  editrather than slowly amass votes until some critical mass would allow state retreat if the new statists did not change sides to protect their new vested interests one could commit civil disobedience profitably dodging taxes and regulations having lower costs and potentially greater efficiency than ones statist competitors – if any 4agorism believes gradual withdrawal of state support through what konkin described as profitable civil disobedience 4 starving the state of its revenue and purpose by transferring these responsibilities over to decentralized institutions is the most feasible way to achieve free markets according to agorism opposition to partyarchy  editpartyarchy the anticoncept of pursuing libertarian ends through statist means especially political parties 9 ”agorism does not support political engagement in the form of political party promotion as a means to transition to a freemarket anarchism the methods of the libertarian party united states are not compatible with agorist principles konkin referred to these attempts to fight for free markets through state approved channels of operation as partyarchy voluntary association  editas with voluntaryists agorists typically oppose electoral voting and political reform instead they stress the importance of alternative strategies outside political systems to achieve a free society agorists claim that such a society could be freed more readily by employing methods such as education direct action alternative currencies entrepreneurship self sufficiency civil disobedience and – most importantly –  countereconomics  9konkins class theory  editkonkin developed a class theory which includes entrepreneurs nonstatist capitalists and statist capitalists entrepreneur nonstatist capitalist statist capitalist good neutral badinnovator risktaker producer the strength of a freed market holders of capital not necessarily ideologically aware relatively dronelike noninnovators the primary beneficiaries of government controls the main evil in the political realmkonkin claimed that while agorists see these three classes differently anarchocapitalists tend to conflate the first and second types while  marxoids and cruder collectivists conflate all three 5concept of property  editthe agorists prefer the term  free market  to  capitalism  mostly since they bear no ties with the implications that the latter term has in history the favoritism of the government towards determined corporations is seen by agorists as the characteristic that renders much more illegitimate the intervention of the state in various sectors stateimposed restrictions in favor of certain companies according to agorists distort the market thus making the aforementioned businesses less responsible and less capable the agorists claim that the debts of businesses cannot be cleared through a governments decree and that every manager has to be responsible for every act taken konkin opposed the concept of intellectual property and wrote in an article entitled copywrongs in support of such a thesis 10 successively j neil schulman criticized this thesis in informational property logorights 11 whereas konkin was opposed to the laws of the state in the cases of patents and copyright seen as creators of monopolies and distortion schulman agreed with konkin that the state could not be a foundation for any class of rightful property yet sought to demonstrate that exclusive ownership rights could apply to what he ultimately termed media carried property  created objects that exist independent of the subjective human mind yet are not themselves made of atoms or molecules 12unlike mutualists agorists defend that there is no need for a property to be continuously used for it to belong to its legitimate owner literature  editkonkins treatise new libertarian manifesto was
