daughter is almost 5 and i noticed this yesterday like every 30 seconds while sitting on the couch the odd thing was she seemed to stop when she was busy playing so i tend to think it is just a habit and when she gets distracted she stops i was condsidering ent visit please post if you have any updates on your childs diagnosis anonymous 42789 replies november 12 2009 0408 am 0 0flag this response i want to thank all of you who have posted to this thread my daughter just turned 5 and has started to take a deep breath every 30 seconds or so i feel like it is probably a habit she has gone through several habits at this point one to be resolved only by the onset of the next however it does seem concerning she doesnt really gasp for air she just takes a deep breath i find it very interesting that so many kids are doing this and so many are in the same age range i wonder if it has anything to do with growing growth spurts etc i feel like all of our children are experiencing the same things which leads me to wonder if there is a common denominator thanks for posting your findings at the doctor er etc i was considering taking my daughter to the hospital but will probably wait until her 5 year old checkup doctors appt next week since you all are coming up with similar diagnosis maybe they will all outgrow it it is a little concerning makes me want to sit by her bed at night and listen to her breath   anonymous 42789 replies november 22 2009 0306 am 0 0flag this response my 5 and a half year old daughter has the same exact condition she is taking deep breaths every 30 seconds as if the air in not enough for her this has started yesterday and i am so surprised to read the same problem that is common to all of us here she may be stressed out with many things such as the fall season short daylight us talking about swine flu such as talking all the time about eating well washing hands not touching face outside etc i think i will stop talking about these things and scaring her too much i will observe her condition in the next couple of days in the meantime i will do everything to make her cheerful and relax anonymous 42789 replies november 23 2009 0447 pm 0 0flag this response my almost 6 yr old child does this too i pretty much only notice it at night when we are reading a story before bed i thought maybe it is anxiety because i know that he does find kindergarten to be hard and a lot of work but it is also occuring on weekend nights when he knows there isnt any school the next day after reading these posts i now wonder if it does have anything to do with allergies i do not believe that he has asthma because he is very active and athletic and never seems to get winded but he does have an allergy to dust mites and peanuts it is close to impossible for him to not be around dust especially in the winter perhaps it is just a tick i have very recently noticed him doing a funny thing with his eyes this past week tooalmost like squinting but hes not closing his eyes in a squint way he is actually periodically opening them a little wider as if he is moving his eyebrows up and down but this lasts only a second and isnt a frequent thing the sighs have been ongoing now for months anonymous 42789 replies december 20 2009 0133 am 0 0flag this response i got here because my daughter has the exact same symptoms a couple of months ago she started to deep breath frequently and now it is a bit worst during dinner i could see she was doing it every 40 seconds sitting on the sofa was being the same she has not doing it while sleeping i am thinking about taking her to the doctor but would love to know what the outcome was for you thank you silvia hi silviai just happened to get back on here tonight sorry it has taken me so long my sons just went away after a month or so and about 3 weeks ago it has come back with a vengance he takes deep breaths constantly and he asks me if he is going to quit breathing this started back after he choked on a cheetoh he does have some reflux but i do believe the breathing thing has become a habit he sleeps fine at night i watch him and his breathing seems normal i am taking him to a pediatric gastro specialist on january 3rd and having an asthma work up on january 5th i want to cover all of my bases it is so frustrating because i cant reason with him he has been breathing so deeply now that he is giving himself hiccups its driving us both crazy i hope your daughter is better i would love to know how she is i am going to save this site to my favorites im unregistered and ill check back to see if you have been on here again i wish i had gotten back to you sooner ill also let you know what the doctors say kelley anonymous 42789 replies december 23 2009 0406 am 0 0flag this responsethis is

things were happening with his eyes now im starting to freak out a bit when i asked him to explain he cant really put it into words he has been doing strange things with his eyes because he says they feel funny if you get back on here let me know what is happening with your child we are going back to our pediatrician tomorrow for testing for asthma and i also hope reflux testing im starting to wonder if it is anxiety he choked this past summer and that is when the breathing started it went away for a few months but came back about a month ago he choked again and i am at my wits end this is the only site i can find anything on please keep me posted kelley anonymous 42789 replies december 30 2009 0226 am 0 0flag this response i remember doing this a lot as a child myself  i am now 20 but it was true now that you mention it that it only happened when i was sitting or resting the reason for me was i couldnt exactly fill my lungs air sacs alveoli all the way with oxygen it felt like i dont know if this was the case or not i was only a child this was just how i pictured it in my head me trying to take deep breaths filling my lungs to maximum capacity but the little sacs just not filling i just couldnt get quite enough oxygen it seemed like and then if i was lucky after about five minutes of this nagging feeling and feeling like i had to get just one good deep breath it would finally work and i would feel better like a nice sigh but by then i would be so aware of my blood gas levels that it was hard to stop being so aware and if i didnt go and do something else i would continue to feel this way for a while unless i could get a lot of good deep fulfilling breaths im not sure if this is relevant or not but the body doesnt sense low oxygen levels in the blood to give us an urgency to take a breath but high carbon dioxide levels so perhaps that has something to do with it maybe some children are just very sensitive to co2 in the blood or maybe not maybe its something totally different at any rate im fine i have no further respiratory issues and it has completely resolved itself by now i hope this gives you mothers some comfort i dont want you worried

taking her to see the pediatrician like many others she is unhibited during physical activity but has been affected playing her instrument at school her deep breadths are also accompanied by burping something i havent read much about here has anyone noticed this problem as well this makes me think theres something gastrointestinal going on this whole issue seems to bother mom and dad more than it does her but were concerned nonetheless im guessing well end up going through the normal course of xrays to try to rule out anything more serious anonymous 42789 replies january 19 2010 0901 pm 0

case since so much time has passed since the cold but he just recently starting with this breathing one thing that has occurred to me as i wrack my brain for a reason for this i just started using

ago he was with his nan and pop for the day and they mentioned it to me in the evening and its been happening ever since in the past few months my son first started blinking lotsthen stuttering quite badly and now he is doing the deep breath thingits really worrying as i think they may be nervous tics and i cant figure out what is making him feel like thishe is only 4 and seems pretty happy otherwise and nothing traumatic that i can pinpoint has happened its a relief in a way to know we are not the only ones i dont really want to take him to a doc as i know we will get the brush off as we did with the blinking so would be good to see how you all went with things i am just going to really try to keep things calmkeep him active and feed him good healthy things i remember reading

condition to go undiagnosed anyway the deep breathing thing started with my six year old boy just a few days ago i woke at 3am to hear him taking deep single breaths he was awake and i asked if he was alright and he told me that he was trying to catch his breath i took him out to the loungeroom and talked to him for a while before he eventually went to sleep as soon as he went to sleep his breathing returned to normal tidal breathing so i assumed it was something psychological but needed to be sure he did it again after dinner the other night but again once asleep breathing was normal he has also had a persistent cough mainly morning and night for about three months but no other symptoms typical of asthma or allergic reaction in the end the specialist confirmed today what i had suspected it is psychological and should go away if ignored try to remove any new stress they are under and that may be the solution but remember always confirm things through medical advice anonymous

getting enough oxygen at age eleven during a school sports physical the doctor found a heart murmer mitral valve prolapse having the mitral valve prolapse increases your chance for anxiety for years ive been coping and dealing with the symptoms of feeling breathless but six months ago i started taking xanax to relax a bit i take it every few days only when symptoms drive me crazy it helps tremendously for younger kids i would look for an alternative for the xanax i would also recommend a magnesiumcalcium  fish oil supplements you can also google the link between anxiety and mitral

storm that scared her i think is was stress and then became habit she also had strep 3 weeks ago which can cause these symptoms in children if left untreated its called pandas she was treated right away so i new it wasnt from that but then i heard strep was going around in her class again and wondered to myself maybe shes walking around with it if this continues i will get her a throat culture again to make sure other than that its probably just a nervous tic that they outgrow if left alone kids do all sorts of weird things ive noticed and they all seem to resolve itself if left alone
