email address rnielsen at purdueeduapid uniform germination and emergence of corn help set the stage for maximum grain yield at the end of the season without a successful start to the season the crop is behind the proverbial eightball right from the beginning the good news is that there are only four simple requirements for uniform germination and emergence of corn the bad news is that one or more of the requirements are sometimes absent in one field or another adequate and uniform soil moisture at the seed zone adequate soil moisture is most simply defined as not too dry and not too wet most growers know what adequate looks and feels like in reality adequate soil moisture is probably close to field capacity uneven soil moisture throughout the seed zone is the primary cause of uneven emergence the results of which can easily be yield losses of 8 to 10 percent  carter et al  uneven soil moisture in the seed zone can be caused by variable soil characteristics tillage patterns unusual weather conditions and uneven seeding depth remember that uneven seedbed soil moisture can be defined as “adequate’ versus “too wet” as well as “adequate” versus “too dry” useful tip when seedbed conditions are dry make sure that your choice of seeding depth ensures uniformly adequate soil moisture for the germination of the seed even though a 15 to 2 inch seeding depth is a good choice for many conditions do not hesitate to increase seeding depth to 25 or 3 inches if that is the depth where uniform soil moisture is located planting shallower than 15 inches increases the risk of poor or uneven germination during subsequent drying of surface soils fig 1 uneven corn emergence in 2006 due to uneven too wet vs just right seedbed soil moisture adequate and uniform soil temperature at the seed zone corn will germinate and emerge slowly andor unevenly when soil temperatures are less than 50f when soils warm to the mid50s or warmer emergence will occur in seven days or less if soil moisture is adequate thermal time from planting to emergence is approximately 115 growing degree days gdds using the modified growing degree formula  nielsen 2012 with air temperatures or about 119 gdds based on soil temperatures uneven soil temperature in the seed zone can be caused by variable soil texture soil color soil drainage surface residue cover in reduced tillage systems and seeding depth control temperature variability during germination and emergence is most critical when average soil temperatures are hovering about the critical 50f minimum threshold value useful tips darkcolored soils will typically warm more quickly than lightcolored soils if soils dry differently across the field the drier areas will typically warm faster than the wet areas uneven residue cover surface trash in reduced tillage systems causes significantly lower soil temperatures under the heavier cover than under barer spots in the field uneven seeding depth exposes deeper planted seeds to slightly cooler seed zones than seeds placed shallower consider rowcleaning attachments for the planter to move aside the surface trash during planting and expose the seedbed to sunlight and its warming effects consider strip tillage practices in the future to better manage surface trash in a reduced tillage system fig 2 example of the effect of soil temperature on the timing of corn emergence adequate and uniform seedtosoil contact in order for the kernel to imbibe absorb soil moisture quickly and uniformly good seedtosoil contact is vital seedtotrash contact results from “hairpinning” of surface trash into the seed furrow during notill planting when soil andor trash are too wet for adequate coulter cutting action seedtoclod contact results from planting into cloddy fields created by working soil too wet seedtorock contact is needless to say not good for proper germination either seedtoair contact results from open planter furrows when notill planting into excessively wet soils germination of kernels lying in open planter furrows is dependent on rainfall keeping the open furrow environment moist useful tips whippers wipers movers fingers and other similar trash management gadgets for the planter are most beneficial when you are challenged with rocky cloddy or trashy surface soil conditions they help clear the way literally for the planters doubledisc openers to more easily do their job of creating an optimum seed furrow other planter attachments that help press the kernels into the seed furrow can improve seedtosoil contact and seeding depth uniformity when seedbed conditions are otherwise challenging surface soil free from crust severe surface crusting or compaction will restrict emergence of the coleoptile and cause underground leafing or plant death severe sidewall compaction can also limit elongation of the mesocotyl and emergence of the coleoptile useful tip avoid excessive tillage prior to planting the crop especially if significant rainfall is forecast prior to emergence of the crop this will help avoid the development of dense surface soil crust avoid excessive downpressure on the closing wheels of the planter in order to avoid compacting the surface soil on top of the seed furow avoid planting on the wet side in order to avoid smearing the furrow sidewalls with the doubledisc openers related reading carter
