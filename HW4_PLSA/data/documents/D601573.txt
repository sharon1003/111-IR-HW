isotherm line drawn on a map or chart joining points with the same temperature isotherms are commonly used in meteorology to show the distribution of temperature at the earth’s surface or on a chart indicating constant level or constant pressure they are also used to show the time variation of temperature with height in the atmosphere or with depth in soil or water the characteristics of heat flow into soil for example are easily visualized from a graph showing temperature as a function of depth and time a convenient way to compare thermal climates is to plot the temperature for each location as a function of time of day vertical axis and time of year horizontal axis arctic map the average location of the 50 °f july isotherm in the northern hemisphere—the climatological limit of the arctic encyclopædia britannica inc learn more in these related articlesmineral use in igneous petrology…contours of the diagram called isotherms represent temperatures at which a mineral melts they define what is known as a liquidus surface as temperatures decrease the minerals will crystallize in the manner defined by the arrows on the boundaries separating the different mineral phases a careful study of the crystalline…read moretemperature temperature measure of hotness or coldness expressed in terms of any of several arbitrary scales and indicating the direction in which heat energy will spontaneously flow—ie from a hotter body one at a higher temperature to a colder body one at a lower temperature temperature is not the equivalent of read more weather map weather map any map or chart that shows the meteorological elements at a given time over an extended area the earliest weather charts were made by collecting synchronous weather reports by mail however it was not until 1816 that german physicist heinrich wilhelm brandes created the first read more earth earth third planet from the sun and the fifth in the solar system in terms of size and mass its single mostoutstanding feature is that its nearsurface environments are the only places in the universe known to harbour life it is designated by the symbol ♁ earth’s name in english the read more map map graphic representation drawn to scale and usually on a flat surface of features—for example geographical geological or geopolitical—of an area of the earth or of any other celestial body globes are maps represented on the surface of a sphere cartography is the art and science of making read more more about isotherm1 reference found in britannica articles assorted referencesphase diagrams in mineral use in igneous petrology external websites article history article contributors feedback corrections updates help us improve this articlecontact our editors with your feedback
