occurred on the trinity river in the years 1844 1866 1871 and 1890 but a major event in the spring of 1908 set in motion the harnessing of the river on 26 may 1908 the trinity river reached a depth of 526 feet 1603 m and a width of 15 miles 24 km 9 five people died 4000 were left homeless and property damages were estimated at  25 million“ now the wreckage of a shed or outhouse would move by followed by a drowned swine or other livestock the construction forces of the texas  pacific worked feverishly to safeguard the long trestle carrying their tracks across the stream suddenly this whole structure turned on its side downstream broke loose from the rest of the track at one end and swung out into the middle of the current and began breaking up first into large sections and then into smaller pieces rushing madly along to some uncertain destination approximately half a dozen of the workmen fell into the torrent at this point exaggerated reports of their drowning swept the city ”— c l moss 9dallas was without power for three days all telephone and telegraph service was down and rail service was canceled the only way to reach oak cliff was by boat 10 west dallas was hit harder than any other part of the city—the dallas times herald said indescribable suffering plagued the area much to the horror of residents thousands of livestock drowned in the flood and some became lodged in the tops of trees—the stench of their decay hung over the city as the water subsided 9the trinity river flooding on 8 july 1908 after the disastrous flood the city wanted to find a way to control the reckless trinity and to build a bridge linking oak cliff and dallas the immediate reaction was citizens and the city clamoring to build an indestructible allweather crossing over the trinity this had already been tried following the 1890 flood—the result was the long wooden bridge that connected jefferson boulevard in oak cliff and cadiz in dallas but the resulting unstable bridge was easily washed away by the 1908 flood george b dealey publisher of the dallas morning news proposed a 15 miles 24 km concrete bridge based on a bridge crossing the missouri river in kansas city ultimately a us 650000 bond election was approved and in 1912 the oak cliff viaduct now the houston street viaduct was opened among festivities drawing 58000 spectators the bridge at the time was the longest
