the cat’s feces kittens and cats can shed millions of parasites in their feces for as long as 3 weeks after infection mature cats are less likely to shed toxoplasma cats and kittens prefer litter boxes garden soils and sandboxes for elimination and you may be exposed unintentionally by touching your mouth after changing a litter box or while gardening without gloves fruits and vegetables may

sample meat until it is cooked usda recommends the following for meat preparation for whole cuts of meat excluding poultry cook to at least 145° f 63° c as measured with a food thermometer placed in the thickest part of the meat then allow the meat to rest for three minutes before carving or consuming for ground meat excluding poultry cook to at least 160° f 71° c ground meats do not require a rest time for all poultry whole cuts and ground cook to at least 165° f 74° c and for whole poultry allow the meat to rest for three minutes before carving or consuming according to usda “a ‘rest time’ is the amount of time the product remains at the final temperature after it has been removed from a grill oven or other heat source during the three minutes after meat is removed from the heat source its temperature remains constant or continues to rise which destroys pathogens”more on fight bac safe food handling freeze meat for several days at subzero 0° f temperatures before cooking to greatly reduce chance of infection peel or wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly before eating wash cutting boards dishes counters utensils and hands with hot soapy water after contact with raw meat poultry seafood or unwashed fruits or vegetables avoid drinking untreated water should a woman breastfeed her infant if she had contracted a toxoplasma infection during her pregnancy yes among healthy women the possibility of breast milk transmission of toxoplasma infection is not likely while toxoplasma infection has been associated with infants who consumed unpasteurized goat’s milk there are no studies documenting breast milk transmission of toxoplasma gondii in humans in the event that a nursing woman experiences cracked and bleeding nipples or breast inflammation within several weeks immediately following an acute toxoplasma infection when the organism is still circulating in her bloodstream it is theoretically possible that she could transmit toxoplasma gondii to the infant through her breast milk immune suppressed women could have circulating toxoplasma for even longer periods of time however the likelihood of human milk transmission is very small back to top
