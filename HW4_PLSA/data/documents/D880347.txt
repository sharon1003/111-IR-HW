definitionmeter posted by margaret rouse what iscom the meter abbreviation m the british spelling is metre is the international system of units  si unit of displacement or length one meter is the distance traveled by a ray of electromagnetic em energy through a vacuum in 1299792458 333564095 x 10 9 of a second the meter was originally defined as one tenmillionth 00000001 or 10 7 of the distance as measured over the earths surface in a great circle passing through paris france from the geographic north pole to the equator one meter is a little more than three english feet or about 3937 inches one foot is approximately 03048 meter there are about 1609 meters in a statute mile the official span was at one time formally defined as the separation between two scratches on a platinum bar in paris this was of course intended mainly for show and not for use in the laboratory powerof10 prefix multiplier s facilitate the derivation of other often more convenient distance units from the meter one centimeter cm is equal to 001 m one millimeter mm is equal to 0001 m and one kilometer km is equal to 1000 m these units are found in nonscientific as well as scientific literature smaller units are the realm of the scientist and engineer one micrometer symbolized m or   also called a micron is equal to 0000001 10 6 m one nanometer nm is equal to 10 9 m one angström unit symbolized ä is equal to 10 10 m or 01 nm the meter and its kin are used to specify the wavelength s of em field s the socalled radio spectrum occupies an informally defined range of wavelengths from roughly a millimeter microwaves to several tens of kilometers myriametric waves a 3m radio wave falls near the middle of the standard fm frequency modulation broadcast band a 300m radio wave is near the middle of the standard am amplitudemodulation broadcast band the range of visible light wavelengths is from approximately 390 nm violet to 770 nm red the speed of emfield propagation in a vacuum to nine significant figures is 299792458 x 10 8 meters per second in this sense the meter can be derived from the second if the latter unit has been previously defined in absolute terms one meter is the distance a ray of light travels through a vacuum in 333564095 x 10 9 second in engineering applications and also in an everyday sense the term meter refers to any instrument used to measure the magnitude of a quantity examples include the volumeunit vu meter in home audio systems the ammeter to measure electric current and the kilowatthour meter to measure electrical energy consumed over a period of time also see international system of units  si and prefix multiplier s this was last updated in september 2005continue reading about meter the national institute of standards and technology provides historical context for the definition of a meter related terms comp tia projectcomp tia project  is the computing technology industry association’s certification program designed to demonstrate validated  see complete definition national security agency nsathe national security agency is the official u s cryptologic organization of the united states intelligence community under the  see complete definitiontransport layer positioned at layer 4 of the open systems interconnection osi communications model the transport layer ensures the reliable  see complete definition
