stillwell cain the tea drinkers and the order of myths and has continued to the present times in general mobile has a more familyoriented mardi gras than new orleans but both can get risque check out

teaching some history below are comments of jon donleymardi gras historian while mobile was first is an article of faith among mobile natives the city does not make this claim neither does new orleans both cities tap dance around the issue because in fact both have some bragging rights in fact the founding fathers of modern mardi gras traditions did not see it as a competition between mobile and new orleans but rather as a cooperative effort between buddies both cities have gone through periods when mardi gras almost died out and each has been instrumental in exporting traditions to the other and keeping the fire going neither new orleans nor mobile started mardi gras of course carnivalmardi gras is a european import celebrated long before columbus was a gleam in his daddys eye in fact long before it was christianized it was a pagan celebration much of catholic  or formerly catholic  europe celebrates carnival under one name or another again as a season of celebration before lent as do many of its former colonies the early explorers and settlers of both new orleans and mobile arrived with a tradition of mardi gras and adapted the tradition to their new home historically the first recorded celebration of mardi gras in what is now the united states occurred in 1699 on a mississippi river island just downstream from modern new orleans the french explorer who threw the party named the place mardi gras island he then moved upriver and staked out the site for modern new orleans mobile skeptics say this celebration is disqualified since the city of new orleans didnt exist except in the explorers dreams but that sounds like sour grapes to us mobiles first recorded celebration was in 1704 in both areas celebrations took place to varying extents from the very beginning of settlement picking up additional traditions as new waves of immigrants arrived partying in new orleans in fact was at times out of control which eventually brought crackdowns from the spanish and new american governments especially focusing on wearing masks and street events this brought the public celebration of mardi gras in new orleans to a sputter in the early 19th century slowly the creoles won back permission to expand mardi gras celebrations until wearing masks and street celebrations were again legalized mobile stepped into the picture in 1857 when members of the cowbellian de rakin society helped blueblood new orleans pals set up the mystic krewe of comus the pioneering parading krewe in the crescent city this launched an explosion of new mardi gras traditions what mobile can accurately claim is a nearly 300year tradition of organized mardi gras celebrations leadership in the creation of some modern mardi gras traditions and exporting at least one of the most important traditions to new orleans  the parading krewe by the way you may be interested to know that gulfport mississippi also claims to have been the site of the first american mardi gras if you take the
