germany and mexico would join in an alliance germany would fund mexicos conflict with the us with victory achieved mexico would regain her lost territories of arizona texas and new mexico release of the telegram ignited a public furor further enflamed by the loss of four us merchant ships and 15 american lives to german torpedo attacks read the zimmermann telegram wilson realized war was inevitable but agonized over the decision for what it might do to the spirit of the nation he feared war would change america forever making her tougher less humane once lead these people into war and theyll forget there ever was such a thing as tolerance  the spirit of ruthless brutality will enter into the very fiber of our national life  every man who refused to conform would have to pay the penalty what else can i do frank cobb was editor of the new york world and a confidant of president wilson on the eve of asking congress for a declaration of war against germany the president asked cobb to visit him at the white house we join his story as cobb enters the presidents private quarters advertisment the night before wilson asked congress for a declaration of war against germany he sent for me i was late getting the message somehow and didnt reach the white house till one oclock in the morning the old man was waiting for me sitting in his study with the typewriter on his table where he used to type his own messages id never seen him so worn down he looked as if he hadnt slept and he said he hadnt he said he was probably going before congress the next day to ask a declaration of war and hed never been so uncertain about anything in his life as about that decision for nights he said hed been lying awake going over the whole situation  over the provocation given by germany over the probable feeling in the united states over the consequences to the settlement and to the world at large if we entered the melee he tapped some sheets before him and said that he had written a message and expected to go before congress with it as it stood he said he couldnt see any alternative that he had tried every way he knew to avoid war i think i know what war means he said and he added that if there were any possibility of avoiding war he wanted to try it what else can i do he asked is there anything else i can do i told him his hand had been forced by germany that so far as i could see we couldnt keep out the consequences for germanyit would mean that we should lose our heads along with the rest and stop weighing right and wrong it would mean that a majority of people in this hemisphere would go warmad quitthinking and devote their energies to destruction the president said a declaration of war would mean that germany would be beaten and so badly beaten that there would be a dictated peace a victorious peace it means he said an attempt to reconstruct a peacetime civilization with war standards and at the end of the war there will be no bystanders with sufficient power to influence the terms there wont be any peace standards left to work with there will be only war standards the president said that such a basis was what the allies thought they wanted and that they would have their way in the very thing america had hoped against and struggled against w w was uncanny that night he had the whole panorama in his mind he went on to say that so far as he knew he had considered every loophole of escape and as fast as they were discovered germany deliberately blocked them with some new outrage the consequences for americathen he began to talk about the consequences to the united states he had no illusions about the fashion in which we were likely to fight the war recruitment poster 1918he said when a war got going it was just war and there werent two kinds of it it required illiberalism at home to reinforce the men at the front we couldnt fight germany and maintain the ideals of government that all thinking men shared he said we would try it but it would be too much for us once lead this people into war he said and theyll forget there ever was such a thing as tolerance to fight you must be brutal and ruthless and the spirit of ruthless brutality will enter into the very fiber of our national life infecting congress the courts the policeman on the beat the man in the street conformity would be the only virtue said the president and every man who refused to conform would have to pay the penalty he thought the constitution would not survive it that free speech and the right of assembly would go he said a nation couldnt put its strength into a war and keep its head level it had never been done if there is any alternative for gods sake lets take it he exclaimed well i couldnt see any and i told him so the president didnt have illusions about how he was going to come out of it either hed rather have done anything else than head a military machine all his instincts were against it he foresaw too clearly the probable influence of a declaration of war on his own fortunes the adulation certain to follow the certain victory the derision and attack which would come with the deflation of excessive hopes and in the presence of world responsibility but if he had it to do over again he would take the same course it was just a choice of evils references this account was originally published in heaton
