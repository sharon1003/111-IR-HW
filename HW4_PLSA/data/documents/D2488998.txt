commonly used in foods because they have characteristics that are prized by food manufacturers for example wheat bread gets its distinctive pleasing elasticity and texture from gluten while cakes and pasta stick together instead of crumbling because of the gluten protein however bread cereal and pasta represent only the tip of the gluten iceberg—gluten is an ingredient in many possibly even the majority of processed food products in certain soups gluten grains act as thickeners allowing manufacturers and cooks at home to use less of expensive ingredients such as cream barley malt meanwhile

isnt enough if youre following a glutenfree diet you need to eliminate every scrap of gluten—even the ingredients that are hidden why eat glutenfree most people who follow a glutenfree diet do so because theyre using it to treat a specific health condition the bestknown health condition that responds to a glutenfree diet is celiac disease in fact the diet was first developed to treat celiac which is caused by an autoimmune reaction to the gluten protein specifically when those with celiac disease consume wheat barley or rye the gluten in the grain triggers the immune system to attack the lining of the small intestine this triggers celiac disease symptoms and can lead to malnutrition anemia osteoporosis and many other potentially serious health consequences people with celiac disease must be glutenfree for life in order to alleviate symptoms and significantly reduce the risk for related conditions even tiny amounts of gluten can keep immune systems in overdrive and prevent intestines from healing people with whats called nonceliac gluten sensitivity also known as nonceliac wheat sensitivity also follow a glutenfree diet this condition was only recently recognized and isnt as well understood as celiac disease its thought that those with glutenwheat sensitivity are reacting to a compound in the grains although not necessarily gluten with symptoms that include digestive upset headaches and fatigue researchers havent yet identified why some people experience these symptoms however theyre considering various culprits including glutenwheatinduced leaky gut in which a permeable intestinal lining allows proteins and microbes to escape into the bloodstream in those with glutenwheat sensitivity a glutenfree diet prevents symptoms just as it does in celiac disease additionally there are other conditions in which some people may benefit from going glutenfree including thyroid disease rheumatoid arthritis and even type 1 diabetes article if youre glutenfree you could be getting too much arsenic from rice list glutenfree watch your levels of these 9 critical nutrients research into all of these conditions—and why the glutenfree diet appears to help alleviate symptoms in some cases—is ongoing doctors recommend that people not start eating glutenfree before being tested for celiac disease thats because you need to be consuming gluten for celiac disease testing to be accurate it can be important to know for sure whether you have celiac so that you can watch for related health conditions that might occur what foods contain gluten to eat glutenfree youll need to avoid everything that contains wheat barley and rye getting rid of the obvious items—bread pasta crackers and cookies—should be pretty easy although it can be rough emotionally to let go of your favorite foods even if youre replacing them with glutenfree substitutes the problem is that gluten can hide under various ingredients on a food label do you have a can of soup in your cupboard that contains starch that starch might contain gluten what about that candy with natural flavors potential gluten there too its seemingly everywhere and youll need to figure out where it hides in order to avoid it the u s food and drug administration fda does not require disclosure of gluten on food labels although manufacturers can disclose it voluntarily under the fdas glutenfree labeling rules legally manufacturers must disclose wheat one of the top eight allergens but they dont need to disclose barley and rye many companies do choose to make it easy for people to identify their glutenfree products without looking at the ingredients theyll use bold labeling that states glutenfree or a symbol that means glutenfree although glutenfree packaged products once were relegated to health food stores the growing popularity of the diet has ensured that all kinds of glutenfree products can be found in many mainstream grocery stores you can also purchase foods specifically certified glutenfree by an independent organization other manufacturers like kraft foods and con agra foods have policies of always disclosing ingredients that contain gluten in their food labels in those cases a glutencontaining starch would be labeled in the ingredients list as starch wheat while a glutencontaining natural flavor might read flavoring barley however foods with no gluten ingredients arent necessarily glutenfree since they could be subject to gluten crosscontamination in processing how to start a glutenfree diet given all of this you might think eating glutenfree seems a bit intimidating but you can actually eat glutenfree without reading a single food label just stick entirely to naturally glutenfree whole foods such as fresh fruits vegetables meats poultry and fish this in fact is the best way to start a glutenfree diet because it prevents you from making rookie mistakes while your body adjusts this approach will also help you isolate any symptoms later on when youve added in more foods furthermore it may help you consume more needed nutrients since packaged goods have less of those allimportant vitamins and minerals than fresh whole foods theres actually quite a long list of reliably and safely glutenfree foods if youre shopping in the produce section for example all the fresh fruits and vegetables are safe to consume on a glutenfree diet although anything that comes prepackaged might not be in the meat section stick to beef poultry pork and seafood that doesnt contain marinades or other added ingredients basically as long as its plain its safe rice and quinoa are both good choices as a starch to add to your diet—just be certain to buy plain varieties with no added ingredients potatoes can also be a good choice although youll need to watch how theyre prepared dessert can be a bit tricky since many of the classic gotos contain gluten think pie cookies and cakes ice cream may be a good choice—unless youre lactose intolerant a common problem in those with celiac disease be especially careful to stick to an ice cream brand and flavor thats considered glutenfree yes ice cream can contain gluten avoid trace amounts you may be surprised to find that once youve started eating glutenfree your body will react to even tiny amounts of gluten with a replay of old symptoms or even new ones you werent expecting such symptoms may include digestive upset and fatigue unfortunately this is pretty common after a gluten exposure and can take several days or more to feel like yourself again also some people are just more sensitive to gluten crosscontamination than others unfortunately this means they have to be extra careful regardless of where you wind up falling on the sensitivity scale youll need to do some homework when you first go glutenfree to minimize the chance of an accidental glutening specifically youll need to decide whether to share a kitchen with household members who eat gluten and if the decision is yes set up that shared kitchen in a way that prevents you from getting sick banish gluten foods and ingredients from your kitchen or from the part of the kitchen youll be using if youre planning a shared kitchen replace kitchen tools since theyre likely to harbor gluten grain residue even though youve scrubbed them thoroughly make the rest of your home glutenfree including your bathroom  shampoo conditioner toothpaste and makeup  your workshop drywall and craft supplies can contain gluten and your medicine cabinet exercise some serious caution when dining out and eating food prepared by a friend or family member there are ways to make the process of going glutenfree easier you can for example download a smartphone app to help you identify products and restaurants that cater to those who are glutenfree you can also check in with your favorite grocery store to see if it maintains lists of glutenfree products or labels the products on their shelves and you can bring your own food to gatherings where you dont think the food provided will be glutenfree enough for you overall starting a glutenfree diet and consistently eating glutenfree will force you to become far more aware of what goes into your food and how its made but the benefit of better health should make all that extra study worthwhile sources national institute of digestive and
