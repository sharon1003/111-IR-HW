june 29 2011 variety reported that actress dichen lachman had signed on as a regular to play a reclusive vampire in season two 8husbandandwife team jeremy carver and anna fricke were tasked with adapting the british series for north american television 1 carver said that he and fricke hoped to use elements of the original series while reimagining a series all of our own i think that starts with many of the new characters and storylines that we created i think youre going to see a show that gives a very nice nod to the original version 9 carver and fricke said they intended to retain the original programs dark and morally ambiguous qualities 10being human cast at the wizard world toronto 2012 the first 13episode season roughly follows the narrative arc of season one of the british original 10 11 however the british version was only six episodes so the north american program developed new stories and arcs to fill out the story line enough for 13 episodes 10 11 some similar elements were also developed in a different manner carver said we explore these moments and what the characters experienced in the british version and say to the writers what if we do this differently 11 however elements of the directorial style of the first two episodes followed the original pilot and first regular episode of the uk series in some cases shotforshot 12one explicit tribute to the british series is the name of the vampire aidan the character is named after irish actor aidan turner who played the vampire mitchell in the original series 13 the other main characters in the north american version at first appear to correspond to their british counterparts werewolves josh and george ghosts sally and annie vampire leaders bishop and herrick  12 but actor sam witwer was keen to stress the differences between the characters in the two programs these are not the same characters there are a lot of similarities but for example bishop is not herrick not in the slightest hes not the same guy 13the north american series writers and actors had avoided watching the british second series when it aired on bbc america 11 until after they had finished filming their north american first season witwer told an interviewer that he had watched only the first episode and avoided watching any more in order to avoid subconsciously mimicking irish actor aidan turners performance 13 at san diego comic con 2011s being human panel the actors confirmed that since finishing filming the first season they had finally caught up with watching the british series but that the writers would deliberately maintain their policy of not watching anything beyond the first series of the british being human in order to ensure the north american series developed down different paths as they moved
