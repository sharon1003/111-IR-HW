the pcv valve is an important part of a cars emissions control system the acronym stands for positive crankcase ventilation the valve takes unburned blowby gases — gases that have escaped the combustion chambers by slipping past the pistons into the crankcase — and funnels them back into the intake manifold where they ultimately rejoin the airfuel mixture and are reburned the pcv valve essentially recycles these escaped gases reducing air pollution and preventing moisture buildup inside the engine in addition to protecting the environment the pcv valve is also an important part of preventative care for a cars engine because it prevents moisture buildup inside the engine the build up of sludge in the oil is also reduced which causes engine oil to last longer and protects the inner workings of the engine a valve that needs replacement may cause a rough idle as a result of pressure buildup within the crankcase ad because of its role in regulating a cars emissions a pcv valve in need of replacement can negatively affect a cars inspection results many mechanics recommend that it be replaced at around 30000 to 50000 miles 48280 to 80467 km specific car manufacturers may have different guidelines so car owners should be sure to check their owners manual andor shop manual a pcv valve is usually inexpensive and relatively easy to replace and it makes a significant difference in the cars performance so it might be advisable to replace the valve with every regularly scheduled tune up the pcv valve is usually located on or near the intake manifold the valve will have a large rubber hose leading to it the hose fits around the pcv so most likely people will not be able to see the valve without removing the hose to remove the hose the hose clamp should be unscrewed and the hose worked loose once the hose has been removed from the pcv an openended wrench can be fitted to the hexagonal base and the valve unscrewed from the manifold note that the dirtier the pcv valve the less distinct the rattle from the interior valve will be when it is shaken ad
