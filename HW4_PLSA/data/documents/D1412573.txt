tuesday tips the classroom mission statement jennifer february 26 2013 tuesday tips previous next last week i shared how i used the consensogram in my class to help students choose areas of focus for the year this week i will share the extension for the consensogram the classroom mission statement after students have determined their five areas of focus i ask them to brainstorm answers to a set of questions these are questions that we regularly use in writing project and that come from the work of leslie patterson royce holladay and glenda eoyang of the human systems dynamics institute  to read more great ideas like this one see their upcoming book radical rules for schools adaptive action for complex change here are the questions1 who are we for this question i ask students to think about identity how do they identify themselves what are two or three ways in which they would define themselves i collect these and then we try to condense them into the most important definitions my class decided that diversity was an important part of their identity so we included that2 what are we about this question is about values i ask the students to brainstorm in their writer’s notebooks of course about the best classes they have ever had this is not about classes that were “cool” by the way have you ever noticed that when a student says “that teacher is so cool” the statement that follows is usually “she never makes us do anything” yeah me too so i ask the students to think about classes a they enjoyed and b in which they actually learned here is our brainstorming about our values notice that they would really like a smaller classes  please take note communities and policy makers i did not prompt them to say that and b candy my class decided that the qualities they enjoy and that help them learn were having fun group activities participation clear lessons that don’t require lots of repetition and challenge yes my friends students like to be challenged they may not remember that when there actually is a challenge but the mission statement will serve as a reminder3 what is our work together the five areas of focus determined by the consensogram should answer this question we wrote the answers to these questions into a statement which i wrote on the board then i typed out the mission statement laminated it and hung it at the front of the room i also printed small copies of the statement and had each student glue it into the front of his or her writer’s notebook as we go through the year the mission statement serves as a reminder of what we have said we value and which areas of literacy we will focus on and measure have any of you tried creating a classroom mission statement what was your process for this patterson l holladay r and eoyang g 2013 radical rules for schools adaptive action for complex change circle pines mn human systems dynamics institute advertisements collaborative learning empathy mission statement student engagementtools and tipswriters notebook share this twitter facebook google loading
