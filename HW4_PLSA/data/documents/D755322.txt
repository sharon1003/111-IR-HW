knee pain and popping knee pain and popping is a common problem many people find they hear strange noises such as knee clicking when they do things such a squatting down or getting up from kneeling in many cases it is more of a nuisance than a real problem but in some cases it may be a sign of an underlying problem in the knee knee popping in itself is very common and can be caused by a number of things it may be as simple as little bubbles of gas popping or indicate a problem in the soft tissues such as a ligament tear another term commonly used for popping in the knee is crepitus which essentially means a noisy joint whether it be popping clicking cracking or snapping knee clicking and popping noises in the knee usually fall into one of three categories1 painfree popping knee popping noises in the knee often occur without any pain in which case they are nothing to worry about2 painful popping noise at time of injury sometimes when the knee is injured eg twisting awkwardly there is a sudden loud pop at the same time indicating damage to part of the knee3 recurrent painful popping noises not caused by an injury knee pain and popping can come on gradually with no obvious cause it may happen sporadically or frequently depending on the cause pain free knee popping if knee popping occurs without any associated pain it is usually due to either a build up of gas bubbles inside the joint which burst or ligamentstendons snapping over the joint there is generally nothing to worry about with this type of knee crepitus1 gas bubbles changes in joint pressure can cause tiny bubbles of gas to slowly form in joints when these gas bubbles burst quickly they make a popping sound in a similar way to when you pop bubblewrap the technical term for this is cavitation there is no harm in this and the myth that it makes you prone to arthritis is unfounded2 ligamentstendons ligaments and tendons are soft tissues that are positioned around all the joints in our body sometimes when you move a joint eg your knee a ligament or tendon may stretch slightly as it goes over a small bony lump and then snaps back into place making a knee clicking sound again there is no harm with this type of knee clicking if there is no pain and despite what people often say it doesn’t make you more prone to knee problems knee popping with an injury if there is a loud pop at the time of injury it usually indicates damage to one of the ligaments the two most common ligament injuries that produce knee pain and popping are acl anterior cruciate ligament and mcl medial collateral ligament injuries1 acl injury what is it the acl the ligament which sits in the centre of the knee gets overstretched and tears either fully or partially sudden knee pain and popping at the time of injury usually indicates a complete tear of thd acl how does it happen blow to the side of the knee sudden twisting or deceleration leg bending backwards too far symptoms approximately 50 of acl tears are accompanied by a popping sound associated with immediate swelling and pain the other classic sign of an acl tear is the knee repeatedly giving way the knee pain and popping only occurs at the time of the injury there isnt usually any recurrent knee clicking afterwards treatment exercises knee brace andor surgery you can find out loads more in the acl injuries section including information on rehab surgery and how to prevent ligament injuries2 mcl injury what is it the medial collateral ligament on the inner side of the knee gets overstretched and tears how does it happen force through the outside of the knee eg tackle or sudden twisting eg skiing symptoms inner knee pain and poppingtearing sensation swelling instability difficulty bending the leg treatment exercises tubigrip knee brace friction massage find out more about the causes symptoms and treatment options in the mcl injury section ongoing knee pain and popping sometimes knee pain and popping develops over time without any obvious injury the knee clickingpopping tends to happen frequently and is usually due to one of these conditions1 cartilagemeniscus tear what is it a tear in the meniscus the special cartilage that lines the joint what causes the noises when the meniscus tears small fragments of it can catch in the knee as it moves which results in knee clicking associated symptoms knee pain locking knee gets stuck swelling frequency knee pain and popping from a meniscus tear tends to come and go rather than happening all the time as the torn fragment moves around the joint treatment exercises or surgery depending on type and severity of tear visit the meniscus tear section to find out more about this common cause of knee pain and popping2 arthritis what is it osteoarthritis is wear and tear of the cartilage that lines the knee joint accompanied by the formation of bone spurs known as osteophytes what causes the noises as the cartilage thins the joint surface becomes rough and friction occurs between the bones resulting in crepitus who does it affect arthritis is the most common cause of knee pain and popping in people over the age of 50 and develops gradually over time associated symptoms toothache type pain stiffness particularly in the morning and swelling frequency knee pain and popping clicking and c repitus associated with arthritis tends to be persistent rather than coming and going treatment exercises knee brace injections surgery find out everything you need to know about this causes of a popping knee in the arthritis section3 chondromalacia patella what is it chondromalacia patella is irritation and inflammation of the cartilage lining the back of the patella kneecapwhat causes the noises the friction between the back of the kneecap and the underlying femur thigh bone seen in chondromalacia patella can cause knee pain and popping who does it affect healthy often sporty adolescents and young adults more common in women than men frequency tends to be

grinding sensation when the knee moves who does it affect it is usually worse with prolonged activity eg running coming downstairs or after prolonged inactivity eg office workers frequency knee pain
