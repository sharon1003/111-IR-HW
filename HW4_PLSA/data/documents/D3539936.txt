agency travelers who use booking buddy to research their trip book directly with a travel provider not with booking buddy as we do not directly sell travel services we do not have your travel itinerary information if you are not sure with whom you booked your travel we recommend checking your credit card statement to see the name of the company that charged your credit card your credit card company should be able to assist with this as well we hope that this information is helpfulpagesreviewstackedshowmorezerotraveler john gibson3 reviews traveler john gibson was invited to write
