nonchromaffin paragangliomas are slowgrowing lesions arising from nests of chemoreceptor tissue located in various parts of the body the four main locations of glomus tissue within the head and neck are 1 at the carotid bifurcation carotid body tumor 2 in the inferior ganglion region ganglion nodosum and cervical portion of the vagus nerve glomus vagale or vagal paraganglioma or vagal body tumor 3 in the jugular bulb region glomus jugulare and 4 in the middle ear cavity glomus tympanicum 1 2 3 4 5 38 39 62 less common locations include the larynx 4 the nasal cavity and nasal sinuses 6

tumors of paraganglionic tissue of which the pheochromocytoma or chromaffin paraganglioma or catecholaminesecreting adrenal intramedullary tumor 20 21 40 is the best known may be responsible for paroxysmal hypertension severe hypertensive crisis and uncontrollable hypertension nintythree percent of the functioning paragangliomas are found in the adrenal medulla functional activity in extraadrenal paragangliomas is rare 14 active glomus jugulare 14 functioning carotid body tumor 7 25 and functioning paraganglioma of the pterygopalatine ganglion region 40 41 have been reported paraganglia are a group of specialized organs chemoreceptors that are distributed throughout the body the paraganglion system includes the adrenal medulla the chemoreceptors ie carotid and aortic bodies vagal body and small groups of cells in association with the head and neck and thoracoabdominal autonomic ganglion cells each of these organs has common features including a neural crest origin a relationship to parasympathetic nerve fibers parasympathetic innervation a similar function and essentially a similar histologic and histopathologic pattern 20 21 62 although they share a common embryologic origin primitive neural crest they manifest certain anatomic differences and functional specialization 16 for example the adrenal medulla is a neuroendocrine organ producing epinephrine and norepinephrine catecholamines its cells are chromaffin positive and tumors arising from the adrenal medulla the pheochromocytomas or catecholaminesecreting adrenal intramedullary tumors are often functionally active on the other hand the carotid and aortic bodies are chemoreceptors their cells are usually chromaffin negative and paragangliomas arising from these organs are seldom functioning the nomenclature of paragangliomas is confusing and before the work of glenner and grimley 20 was poorly standardized glomus tumors are the most common neoplasms of the middle ear and are second in frequency only to vestibular schwannomas within the temporal bone 38 39 glomus jugular tumors are indolent locally destructive lesions arising from the paraganglionic tissue surrounding the jugular bulb located in the jugular fossa 29 glomus tympanicum tumors arise from glomus tissue in the middle ear jugulotympanic glomus bodies are closely associated with jacobsons nerve the tympanic branch of glossopharyngeal nerve and the auricular branch of the vagus arnolds nerve  fig 1 both nerves are supplied by the anterior tympanic artery a branch of the ascending pharyngeal artery ct scanning has been used extensively in the diagnosis of glomus tumors of the temporal bone dynamic ct scan can provide further information in the differential diagnosis of paragangliomas of the head and neck  figs and 3 36 37 38 39 glomus complex tumors paragangliomas are highly vascular and histologically these tumors are composed of nests of cells separated by numerous vascular channels in a fibrous matrix this is seen on mr images as multiple areas of low signal related to the high velocity of rapid arterial and venous blood flow present in the matrix of these tumors  figs and 5 37 olsen et al 44 in a review of 15 patients with paragangliomas found this characteristic in 12 patients mr imaging is superior to ct scanning in providing exact delineation of glomus tumors and better differentiation of tumor from inflammatory tissue and areas of hemorrhages in addition the relationship of glomus tumors to the adjacent jugular vein carotid artery membranous labyrinth facial nerve and intracranial structures is better demonstrated by mr imaging  fig 6 38report of a casea 37yearold woman presented with pain around the right ear 1 year ago within several days the intensity increased and the pain radiated to the upper and lower jaws gradually at the same time she noticed stiffness of the right side of the face inability to close the right eye and difficulty holding the food bolus in the mouth eight days after the onset of facial weakness she was given an injection of adrenocorticotropic hormone acth this resulted in an almost complete recovery after four injections there was still an asymmetry of her smile two months later severe pain around the right ear returned and gradually in the course of 3 days the right face was completely paralyzed she was again given acth and vitamin b 12 injections and received physical therapy ten days of this treatment resulted in return of function this cycle has been repeated and the last three times occurred every month every single episode of pain and paralysis occurred around the time of her menstrual cycle the pain began 7 to 10 days before the period and on the day of bleeding the right facial paralysis appeared each time she was treated with prednisone in tapered doses for 14 days there was never a complete recovery recent ct scan and noncontrast mr imaging scan of the head were reported normal in another institution twenty years ago she had complete right facial paralysis this appeared suddenly was unaccompanied by pain but occurred during her menstrual cycle except for right peripheral facial palsy the ear nose throat and otoneurologic and neurologic examinations were normal her hearing was also normal ct of the temporal bone revealed widening of the geniculate portion of the facial nerve canal mr imaging revealed

patient underwent a right mastoidectomy and middle cranial fossa resection of the facial tumor and greater auricular nerve interposition of the facial nerve at surgery it was found that the bone overlying the geniculate ganglion was eroded by tumor the tumor extended into the middle ear medial to the ossicles extending along the tympanic segment of the facial nerve 3 to 4 mm inferior to its

bone view large image download power point slide discussionglomus complex tumors or paragangliomas are composed of cells of neural crest origin distributed widely throughout the autonomic nervous system 20 21 40 recognized sites of glomus body tissues include the aorta and its major branches carotid bifurcations carotid bodies vagal bodies jugular bodies tympanic bodies ciliary bodies ciliary ganglion sphenopalatine bodies sphenopalatine ganglion the nasal cavity and sinuses the larynx the bladder the paraadrenal area and most notably the adrenal medulla 1 4 5 15 17 2830 49 57 59 these tissues are responsive to changes in blood oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions and p h 2640 functioning tumors of paraganglion tissue glomic tissue of which the pheochromocytoma or chromaffin paraganglioma or catecholaminesecreting adrenal intramedullary tumor is the best known are responsible for the classic clinical picture of paroxysmal hypertension palpitations flushes headaches and irritability 2640 ninetythree percent of these functioning tumors are found in the adrenal medulla with the other 7 occurring at other sites 33 45 46 the majority of extraadrenal paragangliomas are nonfunctioning the possibility of catecholamine production by these tumors was discussed by christie 10 and cragg 11 but was first observed by le compte 33 in 1948 using extracts of carotid body tumor the presence of norepinephrine in considerable amounts in both carotid body tumors and glomus jugulare tumors has been documented in 1962 berdal et al 8 reported the first documented case of a noradrenalineadrenaline–producing nonchromaffin carotid body tumor in 1964 duke et al 14 reported the first documented case of a catecholaminesecreting glomus jugulare tumor presenting as a pheochromocytoma paraganglias are widely dispersed aggregations of specialized neural crest cells paraganglionic cells that develop in the paravertebral region and migrate in association with the segmental or collateral autonomic ganglion cells and in association with the arterial vessels and cranial nerves of the ontogenic gill arches 16 5355 paraganglia are embryologically derived from the primitive neural crest 6 20 21 26 initially two cell lines differentiate from a common stem cell the sympathogonia of the primitive neuroectoderm to form the adrenal medulla and the chromaffinoblast and neuroblast sympathetic ganglia cell which mature into the chromaffin cell and the sympathetic ganglion cell respectively the chromaffin cell is so named because of its capacity to show brown intracytoplasmic granules on treatment with solution of chromin salts a result of oxidation and polymerization of the catecholamine stored in the granules 26 both cell types the sympathetic ganglia cells and chromaffin cells are represented in each paraganglionic organ and the various proportions of each cell govern that particular organs function in paraganglia the chromaffin cells become epithelioid or chief cells type i cells whereas the sympathetic ganglion cells develop into sustentacular cell type ii cells 20 21at birth paraganglionic cells are found in widely dispersed sites the adrenal medulla the paraganglia along the retropleural and retroperitoneal sympathetic chain the organs of zuckerkandl paired structures lying anterior to the bifurcation of the abdominal aorta the chemoreceptor area glomic tissue at the carotid bifurcation along the aortic arch the temporal bone and other less common areas such as the orbit 1 5 19 ciliary ganglion pterygopalatine fossa pterygopalatine ganglion 40 41 nasopharynx 28 buccal mucosa larynx 4 and dermis 26 many of the extraadrenal sites undergo progressive involution until puberty 26 but remnants account for the extraadrenal occurrence of pheochromocytomas reported in all of the areas cited with the exception of the skin 26 the majority of paraganglia are microscopic and consist of only a few cell clusters associated with the automatic nervous system 53 head and neck paraganglia are distributed in relation to the vessels and cranial nerves of the primitive branchial arches these have been called the branchiomeric paraganglia 20 53 55 the glomus jugulare and tympanicum bodies are related to the third arch structures  figs – 10 53 the other paraganglia including laryngeal aortic pulmonary coronary and pulmonary paraganglia are similarly related to branchial arch derivatives 53figure 8glomus jugulare a ct scan shows extension of a glomus jugulare into the petrous bone arrows b axial t2weighted

tumor revealed high intensity indicating its vascular characteristic view large image download power point slide the cells of the paraganglia are capable of producing and storing vasoactive and neurotransmitter substances such as the catecholamines norephinephrine epinephrine and a variety of polypeptide hormones and hormonelike substances including serotonin 18 gastrin 55 somatostatin 55 calcitonin 56 acth 6 and dopamine 41 catecholamines ie norepinephrine epinephrine and indolamines serotonin can be oxidized by chromic acid and chromium salts to form brown polymer this chromaffin reaction has long been used to identify catecholaminecontaining tissue of which the pheochromocytoma or catecholaminesecreting adrenal intramedullary paraganglioma is best known the chromaffin reaction as emphasized by glenner and grimley 20 however is an unreliable procedure for the large quantities of these substances 20 21 and does not always correspond to the functional activity of the tumor moreover normal paraganglionic tissue and nonfunctional tumors such as carotid body and jugulotympanic paragangliomas synthesize and store small amounts of catecholamine 16 because these extraadrenal paraganglionic tissues and their related paragangliomas usually do not give a positive chromaffin reaction they were termed nonchromaffin paraganglia and paraganglioma respectively 20 21 it is now well established by the use of more sensitive methods such as formaldehydeinduced fluorescence that 1 paraganglionic tissue reacts when exposed to vaporous formaldehyde catecholamine forms a green fluorescent dicyclic compound whereas serotonin forms a yellow compound and 2 that extraadrenal paraganglionic tissues do contain catecholamine and the term chromaffic should no longer be used as a prefix for these tumors glenner and grimley 20 suggested that these paragangliomas be named according to their anatomic sites and further modified depending on whether functional activity is documented clinically before the work of glenner and grimley 20 the nomenclature of paragangliomas was confusing and poorly classified through their work the most rational approach to practical classification of the paraganglionic system has been established 16 55 according to glenner and grimley 20 the extraadrenal paraganglion system can be divided into several anatomic groups1the branchiomeric paraganglia which arise in association with arterial vessels and cranial nerves of the head and neck region and include jugulotympanic intrafacial intracarotid carotid body orbital ciliary ganglion sinonasal pterygomaxillary pterygopallatine ganglion laryngeal subclavian coronary aorticopulmonary and pulmonary paraganglia2intravagal paraganglia are located within the perineurium of the vagus nerve and usually at the level of the jugular or nodose ganglion  fig 11 figure 11glomus vagale a sagittal t1weighted mr scan showing a large glomus vagale arrows b axial gradient echo mr scan showing increased vascularity of the mass m within the parapharyngeal space view large image download power point slide3aorticosympathetic visceral autonomic paraganglia are located in association with the sympathetic nervous system particularly at the bifurcation of the aorta organ of zuckerkandl they may also be found along the courses of the iliac and femoral vessels and in the thorax 16 20 55historical backgroundthe first pheochromocytoma was described by frankel in 1886 26 and the name subsequently was given to refer to tumors that are selectively colored by chromium salts 26 carotid paraganglionic body carotid body carotid glomus body was first described by haller 24 in 1762 as a glomus body–like structure at the carotid bifurcation in 1840 valentin 58 discovered glomus bodies within the temporal bone giving the name ganglionum tympanicum in 1878 krause 31 described a structure similar to carotid body within the tympanic canaliculus jacobsons nerve foramen in 1941 guild 22 described the glomus bodies within the temporal bone and shortly after his original description he reported an average of 282 glomus bodies within the individual temporal bone with half located in the jugular bulb and one fourth on the promontory of the cochlea 23 lubbers 35 in 1937 reported the first glomus tumor of the temporal bone describing the lesion as a “carotid body–like” tumor that he incorrectly attributed to the metastasis from a contralateral carotid body tumor rosenwasser 49 was first to recognize in 1945 that certain tumors of the middle ear now termed glomus tympanicum originated from this paraganglionic tissue within the middle ear camuzet et al 9 reported a malignant chemodectoma of the intrapetrous portion of the facial nerve and dutcher and brackmann 15 reported the first paraganglioma arising within the mastoid segment of the fallopian canal the possibility of catecholamine production by extraadrenal paragangliomas was discussed in the 1930s by several authors 10 11 but was first observed by le compte 33 in 1948 using extracts of carotid body tumor it was not until 1962 that berdal et al 8 reported the first documented case of a functional paraganglioma of a carotid body tumor for which the norepinephrine assay was highly positive in 1964 duke et al 14 reported the first documented case of a catecholaminesecreting glomus jugulare there are now many documented cases of functional extraadrenal paragangliomas the majority of which have secreted predominantly norepinephrine 34 matishak et al 40 and nelson and kendall 41 reported three functioning paragangliomas of the base of the skull including a case of a functioning paraganglioma in the pterygopalatine fossa two of their reported cases including the first reported case of a pterygopalatine paraganglioma are probably the same patient our case to the best of our knowledge is the first report of a nonfunctioning paraganglioma arising within the geniculate ganglion and confined in its involvement to the facial nerve the tumor involved the entire geniculate portion of the facial nerve and extended into the attic and along the facial nerve proximal to the pyramidal turn of the facial nerve the tumor was hypointense on t1weighted and hyperintense on t2weighted mr images and demonstrated intense enhancement on postcontrast t1weighted mr images see fig 7 the tumor was completely excised and an interposition greater auricular nerve graft was used to reconstruct the facial nerve the patient gained return of facial function a year postoperatively review of literature suggests that only seven cases of primary facial nerve paraganglioma have been reported 8 9 15 30 47 our case is the first report of a glomus faciale arising at the geniculate portion of the facial nerve the tumor in the case of camuzet et al 9 involved the labyrinthine segment of the facial nerve and presented as a cerebellopontine angle enhancing mass on ct scan the tumor in the case of dutcher and brackmann 15 involved approximately 2 cm of facial nerve in the descending fallopian canal just proximal to the stylomastoid foramen and extended extratemporally 1 cm proximal to the bifurcation of the nerve there was no ct scan performed in their case to the best of our knowledge none of the seven patients reported in the literature underwent mr imaging except in the case of kania et al 30 the tumor in their case originated from the distal tympanic segment of the facial nerve to the stylomastoid foramen the ct and mr imaging characteristics of our case are identical to faciale neuroma both faciale neuroma and glomus faciale can be distinguished on mr imaging from a congenital cholesteatoma at the geniculate region by use of paramagnetic contrast the cholesteatoma does not enhance following intravenous administration of paramagnetic contrast materials glomus faciale may also be difficult to differentiate from hemangioma of the facial nerve  fig 12 and facial nerve metastasis or perineural extension of a parotid gland tumor calcification and ossification are characteristic of hemangiomas of facial nerve arising adjacent to geniculate region of temporal bone 12 the clinical presentation of our case was interesting in terms of the worsening of the patients symptoms during menstrual cycles and partial recovery of the facial nerve palsy following acth injection we believe her increased body water volume during menstruation caused increased compression of the nerve within the fallopian canal resulting in the worsening of her facial dysfunction the recovery of facial dysfunction following acth injection may be explained by the antiinflammatory and decreased extracellular fluid around the tumor in response to acth figure 12facial nerve hemangioma axial postcontrast t1weighted mr scan showing marked enhancement of a facial nerve hemangioma arrow view large image download power point slide in 1969 pearse 46 introduced the concept of the amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation apud cell apud represents a necessary step in the biosynthesis of neurotransmitter substances 56 all paraganglion cells are thought to be part of the apud system 56 such as they are capable of producing a wide variety of polypeptide hormones the diffuse neuroendocrine apud system consists of cells of proved neural crest origin that secrete an amine neurotransmitter proved apud cells include the type i the ultimobranchial c or calcitonin cell the catecholaminesecreting cell of the adrenal medulla and melanoblasts unproven apud cells include pituitary cells alpha beta and delta pancreatic cells and stomach g or gastrin cells paragangliomas have been reported to produce acth 6 serotonin 18 calcitonin 56 and dopamine 41 however most functioning tumors produce norepinephrine the familial syndromes that involve the apud cells are referred to as multiple endocrine adenomatosis or multiple endocrine neoplasia men histophysiologythe normal carotid body is found at the bifurcation of the common carotid as an adherent 5 to 6mm pink mass on the adventitia of the medial side of the vessel 20 55 it is composed of epithelial cells chief cells or type i cells that originate from the neural crest 20 21 these cells are arranged in clusters forming the socalled zellballen these cell nests are surrounded by thin richly vascular fibrous septa between the chief cells are the schwannlike sustentacular cells that are difficult to identify by light microscopy but are found by electron microscopy at the periphery of the clusters 21 62 the carotid bodies monitor and respond to changes in blood oxygen c o 2 and p h levels the chief cell is thought to be the actual chemoreceptor cell and contains dense granules and numerous organelles that contain acetylamine catecholamine and serotonin in response to hypoxia the cell secretes acetylcholine and stimulates parasympathetic nerve receptors in addition to being hypoxic receptors glomus bodies are also thought to be receptors for monitoring changes in p h concentration of c o 2 and rate of blood flow 62 in response to these stimuli glomus bodies increase their activity resulting in a stimulation of brain stem respiratory centers these centers then initiate a series of cardiopulmonary changes including an increased ventilatory rate and an increased cardiac output 62 each glomus jugulare body anatomically consists of an encapsulated ovoid structure ranging between 01 and 15 mm in size 62 the structure is divided into lobules by fibrous septa histologically glomus jugulare body is identical to the carotid body glomus the glomus vagali bodies are small dispersed collections of paraganglia which follow the cervical course of the vagus nerve particularly at the level of the jugular and nodose ganglia these paraganglia usually lie just beneath the perineurium but occasionally they are embedded in the substance of the nerve 16histopathologyhistologically carotid body paragangliomas closely replicate the morphology of the normal carotid body 16 55 in contrast to the normal glomus body the zellballen of the paragangliomas are larger and more irregular in shape and the cells are usually larger and more atypical than normal chief cells 16 mitotic activity is not common and is usually absent 55 areas may be found where the cells are spindleshaped sarcomatoid foci and other areas may be so highly vascular that they are suggestive of an angioma or hemangiopericytoma 4360 the histologic differential diagnosis includes hemangiopericytoma angiosarcoma metastatic medullary carcinoma melanoma and epidermoid carcinoma 43 51 frequently the classic zellballen pattern may not be present and the cells may be arranged in short ribbons or cords similar to those in a carcinoid tumor in pseudoglands as in an adenocarcinoma or in pseudorosettes as in a neuroblastic tumor 16 paragangliomas with these patterns are often misdiagnosed in addition to the specific stains for paraganglioma formaldehydeinduced fluorescence and immunohistochemical analysis glycogen and mucin stains are occasionally useful because they are negative in paragangliomas and often positive in carcinomas 16immunohistochemical analysisimmunohistochemical study of paragangliomas has shown neuronspecific enolase and neurofilament protein within the chief cells of most if not all branchiomeric paragangliomas 16 25 50 55 60 a variety of other polypeptides and hormones such as serotonin leuenkephalin substance p gastrin somatostatin vasoactive intestinal peptide vasopressin melanocytestimulating hormone acth and calcitonin 25 50 can also be demonstrated within the chief cells clinical considerationscarotid paragangliomas are the most common tumors of the head and neck paraganglia comprising between 60 and 67 of the total 16 55 they are considerably more frequent in areas of high altitude such as peru mexico and colorado 16 25 they occur at all ages from children to patients in the ninth decade of life but the mean age is between 45 and 50 years 16 25 carotid paragangliomas present as slowgrowing painless masses located in the upper neck often below the angle of the jaw  fig 13 between 2 and 10 of patients have bilateral tumors either initially or subsequently  figs and 14 16 55 60 rarely carotid body tumors may be functional 16 48 53 55 62 paragangliomas have a tendency to occur multifocally either synchronously or metachronously 16 53 55 62 carotid body paragangliomas may occur along with jugulotympanic or intravagal paragangliomas  fig 15 or with pheochromocytomas 2 3 13 47 bilateral glomus jugulares have been noted in 1 to 2 of reported cases 62 a glomus tumor occurring in association with one or more carotid body tumors has been noted in about 7 of the cases reported 62 other sites of multicentricity include the buccal mucosa the retroperitoneum the lung and areas along the vagus nerve carotid body tumors and glomus vagale tumors should be differentiated from neurogenic sympathetic nerve vagus nerve and rare cases of parapharyngeal hemangiopericytoma  fig 16 glomus jugulare tumors on the other hand should be differentiated from jugular fossa schwannomas and hypoglossal nerve schwannomas  figs 1 – 21 glomus tumors have been reported in association with medullary carcinomas of the thyroid other visceral neoplasms and in patients with neurofibromatosis and multiple mucocutaneous neuromas and familial men syndromes 16 34 42 45 53 a definite relationship between paraganglionic tumors and carcinoma of the thyroid has been shown to exist 2 3 53 the men type i syndrome consisting of pituitary adenomas parathyroid adenomas and pancreatic islet cell adenomas has been definitely associated with paragangliomas 53 on the other hand sipples syndrome or men type ii consisting of medullary carcinoma of the thyroid parathyroid adenomas and adrenal pheochromocytomas has not been found to be associated with extraadrenal paragangliomas the men type iii or multiple mucosal neuroma syndrome consists of papillary carcinoma of the thyroid pheochromocytomas multiple neuromas and ganglioneuromas

reports of cases of synchronous paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas 8 53 these reports along with simultaneous involvement in familial men syndromes and the common embrylogic origin neural crest and
