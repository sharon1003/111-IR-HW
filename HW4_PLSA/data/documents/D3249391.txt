gu xietian was lost in his own thoughts when the question was raised so he was quite taken back by the sudden accusation he took a while to recall the incident it all happened when he struck a hit at gu xijiu while trying to save his son his expression changed – there was a slight remorse i didn’t hit her deliberately it was all in the moment of desperationdesperation what kind of desperation di fuyi tapped the table lightly what kind of desperate situation would make you decide to strike her so immediately gu xietian stammered over his words it was…general gu what kind of atrocious crime had she committed that had triggered you to sacrifice your ties of blood to righteousness and punish her together with the elders of jiu xing clan asked di fuyi icily gu xijiu was surprised too in fact she was hurt the day before yesterday but as luck would have it she happened to have with her the goldinflicted remedy which was a very effective remedy she felt so much better after taking the medicine otherwise she would not have gone out to search for a new home with the company of rong jialuo they even went for a tea afterwards after going back to her new home she felt a little unsettled and shorttempered she could even feel the rush of blood in her circulation which was abnormal from her usual body condition she examined herself and found out that the reverberation of the blood vessels was the root of the problem although it was not a big deal she took another medicine to recover quickly just yesterday she took a rest for the entire day and she felt as if she was fully recovered she never thought that di fuyi would expose everything just by taking her pulse she could feel a little pain at her wrist due to the tight grasp of di fuyi she tried to pull her hand back but failed instead she was given a stern look as a sign of warming behave gu xijiu kept quiet about it di fuyi turned his look towards gu xietian who was already kneeling on the floor do you want to speak for yourself or do you want me to find it out by myself gu xietian broke out in a cold sweat as he knew clearly that once di fuyi became suspicious of something nothing could ever escape his eyes and ears he would definitely uncover it at its very core it would be better if he spoke for himself he steeled his heart and described the scenario certainly he could not repeat what every person had said on that day so he roughly made a description with a broad outline he told that it was caused by some squabbles between the mother the son and gu xijiu thus provoking her to cause the fight within his words he clarified again that he only meant to save the people and not to hurt anyone silently di fuyi listened to his words he turned and looked at rong jialuo did you have the voice recording crane in your arms the other day come play it in front of everyone i was really curious about what the mother and son had said that would trigger the rage of my little xijiu and make her try to kill her own brother naturally he called her his little xijiu out loud that made her heart skip a beat she never thought that he would come forward and lift her up because of the incident his kind gesture was somewhat heartwarming rong jialuo had still kept the voice recording crane so he played the voice recordings out loud in front of everyone the recording function of the voice recording crane worked really well and the playback was excellent all the voices remained as they were without the least difference it was so quiet in the hall that every single word from the playback voices of the voice recording crane could clearly be heard by everyone the hall was filled with complacent words of leng xiangyu and intimidation of gu tianchao once the playback was over numerous people in the hall turned their attention to gu xietian – there were taunts astonishments and disbeliefs on the outside leng xiangyu always appeared to be accomplished and wellmannered no one would have thought that she could be so vicious to her foster daughter her behavior was a complete disgrace yet gu xietian treasured her like a darling for so many years his face flushed bright red he was so embarrassed that he desperately wished to drill a hole and hide from the world after being exposed with such a disgraceful family scandal
