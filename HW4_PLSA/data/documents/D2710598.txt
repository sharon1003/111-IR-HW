against other people i tried doing a microphone test through sound recorder on windows and in the game options razer told me to reinstall syanpse 20 and i did that they told me to recallibrate the headset they told me to make the headset the default microphone and headset etc nothing of that worked i went on razer support website and nothing of them worked the game sound works and everything else on youtube etc its just the mic is the mic like defective razer told me its a problem with windows or steam but it doesnt work on origin too i have 67 games on steam and none worked with mic im not sure if skype works but it should because i did sound recorder through windows and etc i tried on csgo it doesnt work but you can test mic in the options area i did that and it played back perfectly lights all work i have triple checked the synapse area is this with headset or pc my pc is newly built and same with headset i bought headset of a third party seller on e bay and he looked genuine except for where he came from was singapore headset looks genuine and boxing tooo cant be fake everything other than mic works am i missing a program or something i hope someone can help see

either didnt work or created os issues in three of the five cases it was faulty hardware in the last two cases it was a driver conflict from some older software that was installed if the razer support team cant assist you with their own product its highly possible that its a steam or skype issue as ive seen a ton of problems with various hardware when using both or either of them id make sure to install any available patches or updates for those items and be certain there is no firmware available for the headset if its a version with upgradeable firmware share pranzzz april 14 2015 10106 pmdidnt turn out faulty the solution was simple and had a few bugs to it first you need to open up razer synapse and for some reason it always mutes you ingame volume and then you go ingame and turn up the volume so stupid but yes nothing to do with the windows controls razer has disappointed me so much with their products but have no other choice score0related resources razer synapse 20 problem

probably learned a great deal about the unit during the process sucks to have to do that but at least its not faulty hardware and you can use the device as it was intended to be used now good luck
