results etymology novel glands discovered in this study were termed ventral urodeal glands this terminology is appropriate because these glands are positioned in a ventral aspect in respect to the cloaca furthermore these glands empty into the urodeum at its most caudal extremity see below thus collectively “ventral urodeal” was used to distinguish these novel glands from glands described previously that empty into the ventral aspect of the proctodeum in lizards for review see whiting 1969  ventral urodeal glands ventral urodeal glands are present in every taxon of nerodia examined except for n cyclopion there was no evidence of ventral urodeal glands in any other genus of thamnophiini nor in the genera examined for outgroup comparison ventral urodeal glands open into the caudal extremity of the urodeum and two gland masses are always present lateral to where the urodeal sphincter branches from the ventral extremity of the urodeum compare fig 1 a 1 b the two gland masses are embedded between circular smooth muscle fibers lining the urodeal chamber and skeletal muscle of the body cavity ie the position of the glands is caudal to the plane of section where the cranial region of the ventral aspect of the urodeum frees from the body cavity we found little qualitative variation in the histological structure of the glands when examining the two specimens from each

version of this figure is available online one primary glandular duct empties each ventral urodeal gland into the urodeum  fig 2 a these ducts project dorsocranially from the urodeum and are lined by a stratified epithelium with intensely basophilicstaining columnar apical cells ie the primary ducts that empty ventral urodeal glands into the urodeum possess the same epithelial lining as that of the urodeum appearing as specialized ventral folds of the urodeum fig 2 b the apical cells are nonciliated and the cytoplasm is not granular in appearance whereas cells found more basally are cuboidal and lack intense basophilic staining  fig 2 b the lamina propria of the primary glandular ducts is typical of the lamina propria of the urodeum proper and is composed primarily of dense irregular aggregations of collagen fibers and fibroblasts  fig 2 benlarge figure fig 2 histological structure of a ventral urodeal gland from nerodia fasciata transverse sections stained with hematoxylin and

online the primary glandular ducts branch into secondary gland ducts interlobar ducts in the ventral aspect of the lamina propria of the urodeum that form distinct lobes of the individual ventral urodeal gland masses  fig 2 a the lining of these ducts is stratified squamous epithelium with apical cells and some of the basal cells fixing eosin  fig 2 b the cytoplasm of other basal cells does not stain with eosin or hematoxylin and appears clear  fig 2 b the lamina propria surrounding secondary glandular ducts is filled with lymphocytes and has the appearance of typical lymphatic tissue  fig 2 b the secondary glandular ducts continue to branch into tertiary glandular ducts interlobular ducts within the lamina propria of the urodeum proper forming lobules within the lobes of each ventral urodeal gland  fig 2 c these ducts exit the main body of the urodeum and the majority of these ducts reside between the smooth muscle lining of the urodeum proper and the skeletal muscle of the body cavity  fig 2 d layers of smooth muscle encompass the entire ventral urodeal gland complexes at their position between the body cavity and the cloaca  fig 2 d the epithelium of tertiary ducts is pseudostratified nonciliated and columnar with apical cells staining slightly basophilic  fig 2 e basal cells have small dark nuclei compared to larger euchromatic nuclei of apical cells  fig 2 e basal cells also lack cytoplasmic staining with hematoxylin and eosin and most likely represent myoepithelial cells  fig 2 e the lumen of the tertiary ducts is folded on account of the pseudostratification and is often filled with an eosinophilic secretory material that appears to originate from the columnar apical cells lining the lumen of the ducts  fig 2 e the lamina propria of the tertiary ducts is thin and represented by only narrow bands of collagen fibers and fibroblasts  fig 2 e tertiary glandular ducts branch multiple times into quaternary glandular ducts intralobular ducts that lead to the terminal alveolar secretory units of each lobule  fig 2 f some tertiary glandular ducts end blindly however and some quaternary ducts further branch before terminating at an alveolus  fig 2 f in culmination ventral urodeal glands should be categorized as complex alveolar glands the quaternary ducts are lined by a simple columnar epithelium with slightly eosinophilic nonciliated epithelial cells  fig 2 f clear basal cells are generally lacking but can be observed basal to the columnar epithelial cells at some regions along the lengths of quaternary ducts the collagenous bands encompassing tertiary ducts are continuous with the lamina propria of quaternary ducts  fig 2 f eosinophilic secretory material is rarely observed in the lumina of quaternary ducts the secretory units of each ventral urodeal gland complex are alveolar in appearance  fig 2 gh and reside at the periphery of the glandular lobules  fig 2 g alveoli are lined by a simple columnar epithelium that stains weakly with hematoxylin  fig 2 h basal cells that do not stain with either hematoxylin or eosin are observed occasionally beneath the columnar epithelial lining of the alveolar epithelium  fig 2 h the lumina of alveoli are typically filled with an eosinophilic secretion that appears to originate from the alveolar epithelial linings  fig 2 h the lamina propria of alveoli is very narrow and is composed of a single layer of collagen fibers that is continuous with that of the fibrous content surrounding quaternary ducts  fig 2 h because of the peripheral position of alveolar terminal units within each lobule smooth muscle surrounding the entire ventral urodeal gland abuts the collagenous bands surrounding individual secretory units  fig 2 h in culmination secretions produced by secretory epithelial cells of the glandular apparatus travel through quaternary glandular ducts tertiary glandular ducts secondary glandular ducts and primary glandular ducts on their path to the urodeum histochemically primary glandular ducts stain identical to that of the urodeum epithelium ie apical epithelial cells contain neutral and acidic carbohydrate moieties but lack proteins as indicated by their staining positive with periodic acidschiffs and alcian blue but negative with brilliant blue and fast green the epithelium of secondary glandular ducts did not take up any stain the apical epithelia of tertiary and quaternary glandular ducts and alveoli stain positive with periodic acidschiffs and alcian blue  fig 3 a and negative with brilliant blue  fig 3 b the epithelia of tertiary and quaternary ducts and alveoli possess granules that stain intensely with fast green  fig 3 c therefore protein production is minimal based on the nonlinear relationship of fast green staining to protein concentration in contrast to the direct linear intensity of brilliant blue staining with protein concentration thus tertiary and quaternary glandular ducts and alveoli stain positive for neutral and acidic carbohydrate moieties and also for proteins secretion in the lumen of the glandular ducts stains positive only with periodic acidschiffs  fig 3 a and fast green
