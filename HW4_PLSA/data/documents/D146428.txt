as you age more than you may realize hormones are biochemical messengers that influence your metabolism mental focus memory cognition aging sleep and even sex drive they also play a role in cardiovascular health bone growth and blood sugar regulation think of your body as a symphony and your hormones as the instruments those instruments must play together in sync when even one is off balance you begin developing problems including skin issues such as dryness acne fine lines wrinkles and rosacea your body goes through constant changes including your hormones as you age production of certain hormones such as estrogen and progesterone changes affecting your skin don’t worry though you can take steps to counteract these changes naturally how to support hormonal balance in your body there are several things you can do to support the hormone balance in your body manage stress eat a nutritious whole foodsbased diet get enough quality sleep and exercise regularly a clean nourishing diet helps with both hormone production and metabolism a healthful diet supports your liver’s detoxification pathways improving its ability to break down hormones this in turn helps you maintain hormonal balance foods that help boost liver detoxification include cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli cauliflower and cabbage onions and garlic the twoweek program in my book clean skin from within and the online program demonstrates which foods you need to add and the lifestyle changes you can implement to help improve detoxification at the same time you improve skin health and overall health which hormones have the greatest affect on skin and health there are four hormones that have the most profound effect on skin and health as you age these are estrogen testosterone thyroid hormones and cortisol how estrogen hormones affect your skinas we age estrogen levels decline creating significant changes in how the skin looks and feels specifically skin becomes dry less elastic and more fragile for women over the age of 40 declining estrogen levels is the leading cause of dry sagging skin skin appears thin and sallow with fine lines turning into deep creases the areas around the eyes and lips may droop slightly and lose firmness due to reduced blood flow and circulation and skin starts to appear less vibrant if you’re over 40 and have any of the symptoms of declining estrogen such as bone loss hot flashes insomnia mood changes night sweats or vaginal dryness you may need additional estrogen support phytoestrogens plant estrogens are compounds found naturally in plant foods one you may have heard of is flaxseed although it’s known as a natural estrogen mimicker eating flaxseed actually helps estrogen metabolism improving the breakdown and removal of estrogen to help avoid excess levels in your body too high levels of estrogen can cause other problems which we will get to various herbs and botanicals such as maca black cohosh and hops have also been shown to help address symptoms of low estrogen in some cases women may benefit from bioidentical hormone therapy bht which requires the support of a welltrained hormone specialist having estrogen levels that are too high is not good either as it may trigger melasma a condition that occurs in many pregnant women melasma causes hyperpigmentation of the skin and can worsen pms and if estrogens aren’t properly metabolized it may increase your risk for certain types of cancer such as breast cancer eating seaweed and cruciferous veggies broccoli and kale seasoning foods with turmeric and taking supplements such as dim diindolylmethane found in cruciferous vegetables can help boost the way your body metabolizes estrogen which helps lower hormone levels naturally how testosterone hormones affect your skinanother important hormone involved in skin health is testosterone testosterone stimulates the sebumproducing glands which are important for protecting skin with natural oils but overproduction can lead to acne testosterone estrogen and progesterone are hormones needed to help your body maintain the delicate balance known as homeostasis agerelated hormonal changes such as experienced during puberty and menopause may cause shifts in testosterone and metabolism this can make your skin more oily or prone to breakouts you may even experience acne as an adult when you never had a problem as a teenone way to help curb extra sebum production is to avoid dairy dairy products are made with the milk of pregnant and recently pregnant cows which means it contains hormones that can potentially throw your own hormones out of balance in addition for many people eating dairy products triggers inflammation in the body additionally i recommend getting your omega3s in fish and supplements and zinc omega 3 fatty acids are essential fatty acids which means we have to get them in the foods we eat or supplements we take a diet short of these nourishing fats can leave your skin dry itchy and prone to acne so make sure you get enough you can get zinc in a supplement or by eating green beans sesame seeds and pumpkin seeds if you still have trouble with excess sebum and breakouts taking a saw palmetto supplement may help but check with your healthcare provider before starting any new supplement you could have a negative reaction if you take too much of something or you could have an interaction with medications you’re taking also if you’re supplementing with testosterone or dhea a hormone that converts to testosterone it could increase the size and secretion of sebaceous glands if your doctor has prescribed these for you and you have acne double check to make sure you are on the right treatment regimen how thyroid hormones affect your skinthyroid is another hormone that influences your skin’s appearance an overactive thyroid can cause warm sweaty and flushed skin while an underactive thyroid can lead to dry coarse skin with a reduced ability to perspire if you suffer from any of these skin problems and have weight digestion constipation or diarrhea or energy issues fatigue or feeling overly stimulated talk with your doctor about thyroid testing if your thyroid is low high or you have antibodies you’ll want your treatment tailored specifically to the problem tsh thyroid stimulating hormone free t3 free t4 thyroid antibodies and reverse t3 are the blood tests to ask your doctor to run when the results come back ensure they’re within optimal ranges rather than the broad “normal” range to help achieve optimal thyroid function consider working with a licensed naturopathic physician or functional medicine practitioner how cortisol hormones affect your skincortisol is your stress hormone your adrenal glands release cortisol and surges of this hormone may cause increased sebum production an acne trigger excess cortisol also amps up inflammation which can make almost any skin condition worse chronically high levels of cortisol also lead to sugar cravings and we know that excess sugar increases both skinflammation and breakouts not all stress is bad and your body is well equipped to handle it this physical response helps us react quickly when faced with a dangerous situation however balance is key p roblems occur when we are exposed to repeated or continuous stress this is when your body has a hard time maintaining homeostasis triggering physical reactions and eventually overwhelming your systems chronic stress can worsen conditions including acne eczema rosacea and vitiligo practicing relaxation techniques such as breath work moderate exercise and meditation can help manage stress effectively especially when you make them a daily practice in my twoweek program i cover specific powerful stressbusting techniques imbalanced cortisol levels also known as adrenal fatigue often leave you feeling “tired but wired” have you noticed weight gain around the midsection are you experiencing fatigue insomnia or sugar cravings if so you need extra support for your adrenals to balance your cortisol levels adaptogenic herbs such as rhodiola ashwagandha astragalus and ginseng may help an easy saliva test of your cortisol level determines what your levels are so talk to your healthcare provider for more information about testing if you do suffer from imbalances in cortisol the recommendations i give in my book help support adrenal function you can also support your skin externally with skincare products containing adaptogenic herbs such as ginseng eleutherococcus senticosus root extract ginseng is a powerful adaptogen herb that increases your overall resistance to all types of stress and helps rejuvenate and invigorate tiredlooking skin there are many other hormones that play a role in skin
