diffuse large bcell lymphoma diffuse large bcell lymphoma dlbcl is the most common type of nonhodgkin lymphoma nhl in the united states and worldwide accounting for up to onethird of patients with newly diagnosed nhl in the united states dlbcl is an aggressive fastgrowing nhl that affects blymphocytes lymphocytes a type of white blood cell lymphocytes carries along by the lymph fluid are part of the immune system and fight infectionare one type of white blood cell bcells are lymphocytes that make antibodies to fight infections and are an important part of the lymphatic system the channels tissues and organs that store and carry lymphocytes that fight infection and other diseases although it can occur in childhood the occurrence of dlbcl generally increases with age and most patients are over the age of 60 at diagnosis dlbcl can develop in the lymph nodes small beanshaped glands located in the small vessels of the lymphatic system there are thousands of lymph nodes located throughout the body with clusters of them in the neck under the arms the chest abdomen and groin lymph nodes filter lymph fluid trapping and destroying potentially harmful bacteria and virusesor in “extranodal sites” areas outside the lymph the watery fluid in the lymph system that contains white blood cells lymphocytesnodes such as the gastrointestinal tract testes thyroid skin breast bone brain or essentially any organ of the body it may be localized in one spot or generalized spread throughout the body despite being an aggressive lymphoma lymphomas that are fast growing and generally need to be treated immediately also called intermediategrade or highgrade lymphomas dlbcl is considered potentially curable diffuse large bcell lymphoma everything you need to know your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available click here to visit our frequently asked questions about html5 video000  906subtypes of dlbcla number of dlbcls have been categorized into subtypes which differ with respect to certain characteristics tcell a type of white blood cell that participates in immune responses by destroying harmful substances or cellshistiocyterich bcell lymphoma when viewed under a microscope this form of dlbcl looks like a few scattered large and atypical bcells in a background of many normal t cells and histiocytes which are cells that migrate from bone marrow spongy material found inside the bones containing stem cells that develop into three types of cells red blood cells that deliver oxygen to the body and take away carbon dioxide white blood cells that protect the body from infection and plateletsinto tissues primary dlbcl of the central nervous system cns this refers to all dlbcls that originate in either the brain or the eye occasionally patients who do not have this subtype may still develop secondary dlbcl of the cns which occurs when the lymphoma moves into the brain or spinal cord at a later time primary cutaneous dlbcl leg type this type of dlbcl consists of large transformed bcells that typically appear as red or bluishred tumors despite its name the disease can involve the trunk arms legs buttocks or anywhere on the body these lymphomas can also spread to areas other than just the skin epsteinbarr virus ebvpositive dlbcl of the elderly this form of dlbcl usually occurs in patients who are age 50 or older and test positive for ebv dlbcl not otherwise specified nos when dlbcl doesn’t fall into one of the subtypes listed above it is classified as dlbcl not otherwise specified nos a large number of diagnoses fall into this category in western countries about 25 to 30 percent of nhl cases diagnosed in adults are dlbclnos and this percentage is higher in developing countries there are other ways of categorizing cases of dlbclnos into molecular subgroups based on their genetic and immunophenotypic characteristics to learn more about dlbcl download the diffuse large bcell lymphoma fact sheet to learn more about a specific type of lymphoma select from the following menu select
