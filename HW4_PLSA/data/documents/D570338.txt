editestablished in 1973 the depository trust company dtc was created to alleviate the rising volumes of paperwork and the lack of security that developed after rapid growth in the volume of transactions in the u s securities industry in the late 1960s before dtc and nscc were formed brokers physically exchanged certificates employing hundreds of messengers to carry certificates and checks the mechanisms brokers used to transfer securities and keep records relied heavily on pen and paper the exchange of physical stock certificates was difficult inefficient and increasingly expensive in the late 1960s with an unprecedented surge in trading leading to volumes of nearly 15 million shares a day on the nyse in april 1968 as opposed to 5 million a day just three years earlier which at the time had been considered overwhelming the paperwork burden became enormous 6 7 stock certificates were left for weeks piled haphazardly on any level surface including filing cabinets and tables stocks were mailed to wrong addresses or not mailed at all overtime and night work became mandatory turnover was 60 a year 8to deal with this large volume which was overwhelming brokerage firms the stock exchanges were forced to close every week they chose every wednesday and trading hours were shortened on other days of the week two things solved the crisis the first was to hold all paper stock certificates in one centralized location and automate the process by keeping electronic records of all certificates and securities clearing and settlement changes of ownership and other securities transactions the method was first used in austria by the vienna giro and depository association in 1872 9one problem was state laws requiring brokers to deliver certificates to investors eventually all the states were convinced that this notion was obsolete and changed their laws for the most part investors can still request their certificates but this has several inconveniences and most people do not except for novelty value this led the new york stock exchange to establish the central certificate service ccs in 1968 10 at 44 broad street in new york city 8 anthony p reres was appointed the head of ccs nyse president robert w haack promised we are going to automate the stock certificate out of business by substituting a punch card we just cant keep up with the flood of business unless we do 11 the ccs transferred securities electronically eliminating their physical handling for settlement purposes and kept track of the total number of shares held by nyse members 12 this relieved brokerage firms of the work of inspecting counting and storing certificates haack labeled it top priority 5 million was spent on it 13 and its goal was to eliminate up to 75 of the physical handling of stock certificates traded between brokers 11 one problem however was that it was voluntary and brokers responsible for twothirds of all trades refused to use it 7by january 1969 it was transferring 10000 shares per day and plans were for it to be handling brokertobroker transactions in 1300 issues by march 1969 14 in 1970 the ccs service was extended to the american stock exchange 15 this led to the development of the banking and securities industry committee basic which represented leading u s banks and securities exchanges 9 and was headed by a banker named herman beavis and finally the development of dtc in 1973 16 which was headed by bill dentzer the former new york state banking superintendent 17 all the top new york banks were represented on the board usually by their chairman basic and the sec saw this indirect holding system as a temporary measure on the way to a certificateless society 9the second method involves multilateral netting and led to the formation of the national securities clearing corporation nscc in 1976 in 2010 robert druskin was named executive chairman of the company and in july 2012 michael bodson was named president and chief executive officer in 2008 the clearing corporation and the depository trust  clearing corporation announced ccorp members will benefit from ccorps netting and risk management processes and will leverage the asset servicing capabilities of dtccs trade information warehouse for credit default swaps cds 18 19 20 21on 1 july 2010 it was announced that dtcc had acquired all of the shares of avox limited based in wrexham north wales deutsche börse had previously held over 76 of the shares on 20 march 2017 it was announced that thomson reuters acquired avox 22dtcc entered into a joint venture with the new york stock exchange nyse known as new york portfolio clearing that would allow investors to combine cash and derivative positions in one clearinghouse to lower margin costs 23legislation  editthe dtcc supported the customer protection and end user relief act h r 4413 113th congress arguing that it would help ensure that regulators and the public continue to have access to a consolidated and accurate view of the global marketplace including concentrations of risk and market exposure 24controversy over naked short selling  editseveral companies have sued the dtcc without success over delivery failures in their stocks alleging culpability for naked short selling furthermore the question of whether dtcc is culpable for naked short selling has been raised by senator robert bennett and the nasaa and discussed in articles in the wall street journal and euromoney 25 26 dtcc contends that the suits are orchestrated by a small group of lawyers and executives to make money and draw attention from the companies problems 26critics blame dtcc noting that it is the organization in charge of the system where it happens alleging that dtcc turns a blind eye to the problem and complaining that the securities and exchange commission sec has not taken sufficient action against naked shorting 26 dtcc has responded that it has no authority over trading activities cannot force buyins of shares not delivered 27 and suggests that naked shorting is simply not widespread enough to be a major concern were not saying there is no problem but to suggest the sky is falling might be a bit overdone said dtccs chief spokesman the sec however viewed naked shorting as a sufficiently serious matter to have made two separate efforts to restrict the practice 26 dtcc has said that the sec has supported its position in legal proceedings 27 28 29 dtcc general counsel larry thompson calls the claims that dtcc is responsible for naked short selling pure invention 29in july 2007 senator bob bennett republican of utah suggested on the u s senate floor that the allegations involving dtcc and naked short selling are serious enough to warrant a hearing the committees chairman senator christopher dodd indicated he was willing to hold such a hearing 30 to date no such hearing was ever held and no further action on naked short selling is anticipated representing state stock regulators the north american securities administrators association nasaa filed a brief in a 2009 suit against dtcc arguing against federal preemption as a defense to the suit nasaa said that if the investors’ claims are taken as true as they must be on a motion to dismiss then the entrepreneurs and investors before the court have been the victims of fraud and manipulation at the hands of the very entities that should be serving their interests by maintaining a fair and efficient national market 31 this suit was later dismissed by the courts critics also contend that dtcc and the sec have been too secretive with information about where naked shorting is taking place 26 dtcc says it has supported releasing more information to the public 27in recent years this controversy has died down as the impact of changes to sec rule 203 under regulation sho adopted in 2008 dramatically curtailed longterm short positions and complaints about naked short positions declined subsidiaries  editdtcc has several subsidiaries the depository trust company dtc – the original securities depository 32 33established in 1973 it was created to reduce costs and provide efficiencies by immobilizing securities and making bookentry changes to show ownership of the securities dtc moves securities for nsccs net settlements and settlement for institutional trades which typically involve money and securities transfers between custodian banks and brokerdealers as well as money market instruments in 2007 dtc settled transactions worth 513 trillion and processed 325 million bookentry deliveries in addition to settlement services dtc retains custody of 35 million securities issues worth about 40 trillion including securities issued in the united states and more than 110 other countries dtc is a member of the u s federal reserve system and a registered clearing agency with the securities and exchange commission most large u s brokerdealers and banks are full dtc participants meaning that they deposit and hold securities at dtc dtc appears in an issuer’s stock records as the sole registered owner of securities deposited at dtc dtc holds the deposited securities in “ fungible bulk” meaning that there are no specifically identifiable shares directly owned by dtc participants rather each participant owns a pro rata interest in the aggregate number of shares of a particular issuer held at dtc correspondingly each customer of a dtc participant such as an individual investor owns a pro rata interest in the shares in which the dtc participant has an interest because the securities held by dtc are for the benefit of its participants and their customers ie investors holding their securities at a brokerdealer frequently the issuer and its transfer agent must interact with dtc in order to facilitate the distribution of dividend payments to investors to facilitate corporate actions ie mergers splits etc  to effect the transfer of securities and to accurately record the number of shares actually owned by dtc at all times dtc operation stocks held by dtc are kept in the name of its partnership nominee cede  co 9 not all securities are eligible to be settled through dtc dtc eligible what is dtc eligibility this means that a companys stock is eligible for deposit with dtc aka cede  co aka the street your companys security holders will be able to deposit their particular shares with a brokerage firm clearing firms as full participants with dtc handle the dtc eligibility submissions to dtc transfer agents were responsible for eligibility coordination years ago now in order to make a new issue of securities eligible for dtc’s delivery services a completed and signed eligibility questionnaire must be submitted to dtc’s underwriting department eligibility parties that may submit the questionnaire include one of the following lead managerunderwriter issuer’s financial advisor or the dtc participant clearing the transaction for its correspondent the lead manager underwriter must ensure that dtc’s underwriting department receives the issue’s offering document eg prospectus offering memorandum official statement and the cusip numbers assigned to the issue within the time frames outlined in dtc’s operational arrangements 34what is fast processing fast processing is functionality that can be turned on for issuers whom are fully dtc eligible participation in fast fast automated securities transfer allows issuers security holders and brokerage  clearing firms to move stock electronically between one another transfer agents as limited participants file for fast participation dtc approves each issuer on a merit review basis into this system what are “chills” and “freezes” and why does dtc impose them occasionally a problem may arise with a company or its securities on deposit at dtc in some of those cases dtc may impose a “chill” or a “freeze” on all the company’s securities a “chill” is a restriction placed by dtc on one or more of dtc’s services such as limiting a dtc participant’s ability to make a deposit or withdrawal of the security at dtc a chill may remain imposed on a security for just a few days or for an extended period of time depending upon the reasons for the chill and whether the issuer or transfer agent corrects the problem a “freeze” is a discontinuation of all services at dtc freezes may last a few days or an extended period of time depending on the reason for the freeze if the reasons for the freeze cannot be rectified then the security will generally be removed from dtc and securities transactions in that security will no longer be eligible to be cleared at any registered clearing agency chills and freezes are monitored by dtcs office of regulatory compliance dtc imposes chills and freezes on securities for various reasons for example dtc may impose a chill on a security because the issuer no longer has a transfer agent to facilitate the transfer of the security or the transfer agent is not complying with dtc rules in its interactions with dtc in transferring the security often this type of situation is resolved within a short period of time chills and freezes can be imposed on securities for more complicated reasons such as when dtc determines that there may be a legal regulatory or operational problem with the issuance of the security or the trading or clearing of transactions involving the security for example dtc may chill or freeze a security when dtc becomes aware or is informed by the issuer transfer agent federal or state regulators or federal or state law enforcement officials that an issuance of some or all of the issuer’s securities or transfer in those securities is in violation of state or federal law if dtc suspects that all or a portion of its holdings of a security may not be freely transferable as is required for dtc services it may decide to chill one or more of its services or place a freeze on all services for the security when there is a corporate action dtc will temporarily chill the security for bookentry activities in other instances a corporate action can cause a more permanent chill this may force the issuer to reapply for eligibility altogether when dtc chills or freezes a security it will issue a “participant notice” to its participants these notices are publicly available on dtc’s website 35 when securities are frozen dtc also provides optional automated notifications to its participants these processes provide participants the ability to update their systems to automatically block future trading of affected securities in addition to alerting participant compliance departments dtc has information regarding these processes on its website national securities clearing corporation nscc –
