isotope stability chemistry tutorial key concepts an unstable isotope emits some kind of radiation that is it is radioactive a stable isotope is one that does not emit radiation or if it does its halflife is too long to have been measured it is believed that the stability of the nucleus of an isotope is determined by the ratio of neutrons to protons observations of the atomic number of isotopes show us that⚛ isotopes with atomic number z  82 are unstable⚛ of the elements with atomic number z  82 all have one or more stable isotopes except technetium z  43 and promethium z  61 which do not have any stable isotopes⚛ isotopes with atomic number z ≤ 20 and with a neutron n to proton p ratio of about 1 are more likely to be stable n ÷ p  1observations on whether the nucleus contains odd or even numbers of protons and neutrons leads us to believe that a nucleus with⚛ odd numbers of protons and odd numbers of neutrons is most likely to be unstable⚛ even number of protons and even numbers of neutrons is most liklely to be stable composition of the nucleii of known stable isotopes protons neutrons  stable isotopes stability trendodd odd 15 least stableodd even 18 ↓even odd 205

make it easier to see them the first generalisation we might make is that if the neutron to proton ratio is about 1 then the isotope is likely to be stable if we pull out all the isotopes with np not close to 1 say those with np ≥ 129 and those with np ≤ 0775 we can construct a new table as shown below 1 np ≤ 0775 or np ≥ 129stable isotope unstable isotope3 h3 he7 li10 be14 c32 si42 ar46 ca47 ca48 ca as a first approximation we predict that a neutron to proton ratio that is very small or very large will result in an unstable isotope notable exceptions are for the small isotopes 3 he and 7 li which are both stable unfortunately a number of unstable isotopes have neutron to proton ratios of about 1 lets take a closer look at thesenp ≈ 1unstable isotope no protons z no neutrons22 na 11 1126

both protons and neutrons we could generalisation and say that if the neutron to proton ratio is close to 1 and the nucleus contains an even number of protons and an even number of neutrons then this isotope is most likely to be stable do you understand this join ausetutetake the test nowstability of isotopes of other elements so far we have made a couple of generalisations about the stability of isotopes elements with atomic number z greater than 82 have no stable isotopes isotopes of elements with atomic number z less than 20 are likely to be unstable if the neutron to proton ratio is either a very smallor b very large isotopes of elements with atomic number z less than 20 and with a neutron to proton ratio of close to 1 are more likely to be stable if the nucleus contains an even number of protons and an even number of neutrons how good is the generalisation that an isotope is more likely to be stable if it has an even number of protons and an even number of neutrons and a neutron to proton ratio close to 1 for atomic numbers between 20 and 82 first consider the element technetium z43 it has an odd number of protons so we predict from our generalisation that the likelihood of it having stable isotopes is low we observe that it has no known stable isotopes similarly promethium z61 has an odd number of protons so we would predict from our generalisation that the likelihood of it having stable isotopes is low we observe that it has no known stable isotopes lets take a look at the isotopes of period 4 elements with even atomic numbers that are greater than 20 period 4

isotopes listed above the generalisation is disobeyed just 5 times in general an isotope with an even number of protons is more likely to be stable than an isotope with an odd number of protons if you
