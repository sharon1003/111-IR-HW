 – jecinc jncia  ccna 1 point 4 years ago so im fairly well versed with the hp network management center tools nnmi i spi performance for trafficmetricsqa i spi mplsmulticast i spi net network automation my experience isnt typically in production but rather demonstrations of functionality around automating configuration changesconfiguration snapshotingbulk ios upgrades  associated work flows etc its a really powerful tool with a lot of active development going into it from new feature function to new device support as well as being massively scalable when you talk about integrations what do you mean integrations into 3rd party tools or into the rest of the hp itpspermalink embed save – maxx break ccp rs  ccda 1 point 4 years ago quick question i dont know if youre familiar with a program called hp imc but is there something better out there that does the same thingpermalink embed save parent – jecinc jncia  ccna 1 point 4 years ago yeh i know of hp imc intelligent management centre i think the high level non political answer to that is hp imc is hp networks infrastructure management tool with an amount of network management capability built into it it has its pitfalls in certain areas event managementroot cause analysisscalability however having said that it really has a wide range of plugins extending capability into the byod security management and wireless infrastructure management domains when you say better what do you mean something with heterogeneous device support better discovery root cause analysis etc i would position something along the lines of nnmi hp softwares network management platform historically openview back in the daypermalink embed save parent – exseven  s 1 point 4 years ago we already have nnmi and ombsm so im looking into how well it will integrate with those but also if it will integrate at all with bmc remedy or any cmdb out there all devices are managed manually right now and we are bordering 10001500 devices so personally i think we will start to need something whether it be na or lms or something else i like the fact that na isnt just cisco 90 of the network and the device support matrix is hugena seems to have more functionality suited to what we may need as far as i can sell it to the people above me ive looked quickly at solarwinds offerings and i personally think they dont suit our environment very wellpermalink embed save parent – jecinc jncia  ccna 1 point 4 years ago oh awesome so ill go through the integrations one at a time nnmi  depending what version youre running current with patches 922 and xx3 patch has just been released you would get the ability to push notifications from na to nnmi so when a device config is changed etc you would see an incident come into nnmi reflecting that also when na goes away and does diagnostics and finds misconfigured devices you would see events to that nature as well duplex mismatch as an example fed into nnmi you also get some nice config analysis panes within nnmi so you know when you drill right the way down into a node and you get to the node homepage and you have a set of tabs top right and a set of tabs bottom left and it shows things such as performance metrics etc you would get to see the current configuration snapshot there as well as the ability to crosslaunch into na and view currenty and last config snapshots also worth noting that you can configure nnmi to synchronise discovered devices with na for easier deployment ombsm nnm  om theres two integrations available to you here you have an om agent based integration  a web services integration go with the om agent integration nnmi can feed up through the agent snmpv2 incidents for even consolidation you also have the ability to launch some nnmi tools from om layer 2 neighbour viewsstatus polling if you add na to the mix you then start na related trapsincidents fed into om and consolidated at that higher level in regards to the wider bsm theres also a really nice topology integration that if you have multiple infrastructure monitoring tools you can consolidate topologies to reflect networkserverapp monitoring into a single view rtsm  run time service model bmc remedy  cmdb  hp software does have its own cmdb u cmdb which is fairly fundamental to the above point around rtsm cmdbs arent my area though so im not much help there im afraid in regards to integrating into any 3rd party tools in this sort of instance all the integrating would be done via nnmi i think its done by nnmi forwarding snmpv2 traps so that would therefore include any na incidents also  worth mentioning nnmi can forward traps to anything as you can tell im probably partial to a certain company however i really do think solarwinds are great tools they do as with all tools out there have their limitations  so depending on requirements they wont fit no single vendor is going to have the perfect fit for everyonepermalink embed save parent
