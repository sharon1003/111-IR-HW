co star terminal emulator faqwhat is co star co star is powerful terminal emulator development tool that provides you with a 3step rejuvenation process for your legacy application including autogui clientserver and webtohost integration with co star the rejuvenation takes place without requiring any modifications to the existing codebase the co star interface interacts directly with your host application providing innovative rejuvenation capabilities while protecting the investment in your application how is co star different from tools like visual basic and delphi other development environments products are designed to completely recreate your application in a windows® clientserver format this path is usually chosen to provide a windowsnt or windowsunix specific version of the application with a clientserver oriented database product typically the only piece of the legacy application salvaged in the rewrite is the database information and even that is only accessible through a gateway or warehouse product which can also add considerable costs this approach includes the following risks typically there is no support for a mixedterminalequipment and pc workstation environment new programming skills may be required these other products do not use the existing base of stable debugged and functionally robust code long development cycles may be incurred two sets of code ie legacy and clientserver may need to be supported for many years end users may require more time to purchase new workstations servers etc and introducing windows literacy into the workforce may in turn push out revenue returns on your development efforts why choose co star your clients may be demanding windows features or your textbased applications may not be as robust as they could be without having access to windows features or you might want to add windows clientserver enhancements windows program data transfer and other features that will add value to your textbased application products to meet any of these needs you will undoubtedly have to explore windows enhancement products co star is an excellent choice to rejuvenate your application for the following reasons co star makes your application competitive with other windows clientserver products without totally redeveloping your product co star is the lowest risk method for providing windows features and adding clientserver features to your existing application co star is the most costeffective way to add clientserver functionality to your existing application co star lets you preserve your existing stable code base co star lets your organization define a competitive enhancement path for your products without retooling your developer teams co star enhancements are transportable across all language and operating system environments co star lets you introduction clientserver eventdriven tools and expertise into your organization at your own controlled pace co star lets your application run in mixed windows workstation and terminal environments how does co star enhance my application using a 3level rejuvenation process the co star product family transforms your application from the traditional characterbased greenonblack screen to a new intuitive graphical user interface gui that leverages your investment in your organization its people and its software applications the first level of rejuvenation autogui is ready to go right outofthebox start creating a windows lookandfeel for your legacy application by allowing developers and endusers to use autosizable fonts and colors create recessedraised 3d effects and sculptured graphical linedrawing other autogui features include userdefined buttonbars to perform keyboard macros toolbars to activate functions within your application or launch other windows applications and hotspots to mouseenable your legacy screens the second level of rejuvenation introduces clientserver functionality our application programming interface api and script language dramatically enhance the legacy application’s lookandfeel and provide added functionality to your application some examples of api commands include displaying images pushbuttons and message boxes playing audio and video files and creating listboxes and pulldown menus the script language is a robust cbased language that enables the creation of clientside routines that are accessible to the legacy application through the script language you can create dialog boxes and graphical controls additionally you can perform dde conversations with other windows applications and access the native windows sdk api calls the second level also provides an active x custom control for integration with other gui development languages you can use this ocx with languages such as visual basic visual c and delphi to create custom gui applications that frontend the legacy application this also opens the door to utilize other available thirdparty custom controls the third level of rejuvenation provides webtohost integration co star for the web csftw provides persistent highperformance browserbased access to missioncritical applications from a standard web browser such as microsoft internet explorer® or netscape navigator® additionally with its api and scripting capabilities csftw is well suited for different host screen appearances without requiring hostside modifications whether your users prefer the traditional greenonblack or a guiized screen the co star product family has the customization tools necessary to provide a newly rejuvenated interface among a variety of host applications don’t the tools from my language database and 4gl vendors provide the same windows access features many of these products provide some of the enhancements that co star provides but most of them lack the dynamic aspects of co star’s 3level rejuvenation process enhancing the lookandfeel of your application is simply not competitive with the clientside functionality that you get with co star once the visual enhancements are complete you have in effect only facelifted your application with these other products over the long run will your clients be satisfied with a facelift or will they also demand new and competitive application features from greenscreen to webenabled gui co star provides all the uptodate application features you will need how is the 3level rejuvenation achieved without extensive rewriting of my code the added windows functionality is accomplished with a windows development product such as visual basic visual c or delphi or power builder etc if new database integration is desired microsoft and other vendors require developers to completely rewrite the application with their products with co star however you can use these products to write new pieces for the existing host application co star manages the interaction between the windows program and the host application with co star you take advantage of the strengths of the clientserver development products without incurring the risk of completely abandoning your existing code base alienating nonwindows users or supporting two completely different products this means that my developers may have to learn a new tool learning a new tool is a possibility however clearview believes that your organization will eventually need these skills co star introduces these development skills in a controlled manner without overwhelming you this is significantly less risky and less expensive than making the transition all at once while your staff learns these skills you continually add functionality and value to your products plus clearview offers training that quickly gets your development staff up to speed while building on their existing skills which platforms does co star support and how is it distributed to our clients co star runs completely in windows so there are no host requirements developers can use co star to rejuvenate their application in the following ways screen watch — resides on the windows pc and monitors the data stream for predesignated character strings before activating the co star rejuvenation process coded apis — the apis in co star are embedded in print statements ie print put etc  and are activated on the windows pc where co star is running co star is only installed where you desire windows access or enhancements if your client requires three windows workstations and seventeen terminals you only need to provide your client with three co star licenses can i share copies of co star yes a server version of the co star product allows client pcs to access shared copies of the co star runtime files as well as your custom button bars toolbars color schemes etc what about security everyone should be concerned with
