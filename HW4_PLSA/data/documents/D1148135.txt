a personal computer pc is a computer whose price size and capabilities make it useful for individuals we may never know who coined the phrase with the intent of a small affordable computing device but john w mauchly described such a device in a november 3 1962 new york times article entitled pocket computer may replace shopping list six years later a manufacturer took a risk at referring to their product this way when hewlett packard advertised their powerful computing genie as the new hewlett packard 9100a personal computer this advertisement was too extreme for the target audience and replaced with a much drier ad for the hp 9100a programmable calculator during the next 7 years the phrase had gained usage so when byte magazine published its first edition it referred to its readers as being in the personal computing field while creative computing defined the personal computer as a non timeshared system containing sufficient processing power and storage capabilities to satisfy the needs of an individual user two years later when the 1977 trinity of preassembled small computers hit the markets the apple ii and the pet 2001 were advertised as personal computers while the trs80 was a microcomputer used for household tasks including personal financial management by 1979 over half a million home computers were sold and the youth of the day had a new concept of the personal computer microcomputers and home computers are types of personal computers often the term personal computer is used exclusively for computers running a microsoft windows operating system but this is erroneous for example a macintosh running mac os and an ibm pc compatible running linux are both personal computers this confusion stems from the fact that the term pc is often used as a shorthand form for ibm pc compatible and historically mac os has run on nonibm compatible hardware like the power pc architecture linux runs on virtually any kind of hardware but was developed later and has not achieved popularity comparable to microsoft windows contents  showhistory mainframes and large minicomputers before the introduction of the microprocessor in the early 1970s computers were generally large costly systems owned by large corporations universities government agencies and similarsized institutions end users often did not directly interact with the machine but instead would prepare tasks for the computer on offline equipment such as card punches a number of assignments for the computer would be gathered up and processed in batch mode after the job had completed users could collect the results in some cases it could take hours or days between submitting a job to the computing center and receiving the output a more interactive form of computer use developed commercially by the middle 1960s in a timesharing system multiple computer terminals let many people share the use of one mainframe computer processor this was common in business applications and in science and engineering a different model of computer use was foreshadowed by the way in which early precommercial experimental computers were used where one user had exclusive use of a processor some of the first computers that might be called personal were early minicomputers such as the linc and pdp8 and later on vax and larger minicomputers from digital equipment corporation dec data general prime computer and others by todays standards they were very large about the size of a refrigerator and cost prohibitive typically tens of thousands of us dollars and thus were rarely purchased by an individual however they were much smaller less expensive and generally simpler to operate than many of the mainframe computers of the time therefore they were accessible for individual laboratories and research projects minicomputers largely freed these organizations from the batch processing and bureaucracy of a commercial or university computing center in addition minicomputers were relatively interactive and soon had their own operating systems the minicomputer xerox alto 1973 was a landmark step in the development of personal computers because of its graphical user interface bitmapped high resolution screen large internal and external memory storage mouse and special software the minicomputer era was an intermediary step from mainframes to personal computer usage computers at home one early use of the term personal computer appeared in a november 3 1962 new york times article reporting john w mauchlys vision of future computing as detailed at a recent meeting of the american institute of industrial engineers mauchly stated there is no reason to suppose the average boy or girl cannot be master of a personal computer 11the minicomputer ancestors of the modern personal computer used early integrated circuit microchip technology which reduced size and cost but they contained no microprocessor this meant that they were still large and difficult to manufacture just like their mainframe predecessors after the computeronachip was commercialized the cost to manufacture a computer system dropped dramatically the arithmetic logic and control functions that previously occupied several costly circuit boards were now available in one integrated circuit making it possible to produce them in high volume concurrently advances in the development of solid state memory eliminated the bulky costly and powerhungry magnetic core memory used in prior generations of computers there were a few researchers at places such as sri and xerox parc who were working on computers that a single person could use and could be connected by fast versatile networks not home computers but personal ones a programmable terminal called the datapoint 2200 is the earliest known device that bears any significant resemblance to the modern personal computer 12 13 it was made by ctc now known as datapoint in 1970 and was a complete system in a small case bearing the approximate footprint of an ibm selectric typewriter the systems cpu was constructed from a variety of discrete components although the company had commissioned intel to develop a singlechip processing unit there was a falling out between ctc and intel and the chip intel had developed wasnt used intel soon released a modified version of that chip as the intel 8008 the worlds first 8bit microprocessor 14 the needs and requirements of the datapoint 2200 therefore determined the nature of the 8008 upon which all successive processors used in ibmcompatible pcs were based additionally the design of the datapoint 2200s multichip cpu and the final design of the intel 8008 were so similar that the two are largely softwarecompatible therefore the datapoint 2200 from a practical perspective can be regarded as if it were indeed powered by an 8008 which makes it a strong candidate for the title of first microcomputer as well development of the singlechip microprocessor was an enormous catalyst to the popularization of cheap easy to use and truly personal computers the altair 8800 introduced in a popular electronics magazine article in the january 1975 issue at the time set a new low price point for a computer bringing computer ownership to an admittedly select market in the 1970s this was followed by the imsai 8080 computer with similar abilities and limitations the altair and imsai were essentially scaleddown minicomputers and were incomplete to connect a keyboard or screen to them required heavy expensive peripherals these machines both featured a front panel with switches and lights which communicated with the operator in binary to program the machine one didnt simply power up one first had to key in the bootstrap loader program in binary then read in a paper tape containing a basic interpreter using a massive papertape reader keying the loader required setting a bank of eight switches up or down and pressing the load button once for each byte of the program which was typically hundreds of bytes long this was before one could begin to do any computing at the first west coast computer faire a threeyearold girl amused herself by flipping random switches and pressing the load button which were at her eye level then moving on to the next demo by doing so she had inserted a random number into the location whose address was in the program counter thus crashing the machine she was followed by gasps and screams as the vendors discovered that they had to repeat the whole startup cycle—her parents found her by heading for the commotion the next computer faire banned small children a few years later personal computers lost the switches and lights thirty years later they have memory protection so that crashing a single program doesnt crash the machine citation neededin 1976 the kooro manufacturing  electronics cooperative in skopje macedonia produced in limited quantities an all in one integrated keyboard monochrome monitor 8 inch floppy disk drive and 16k of ram for use by government officials similar in appearance to the trs80 model iii computer using a proprietary operating system 15it was arguably the altair computer that spawned the development of apple as well as microsoft which produced and sold the altair basic programming language interpreter microsofts first product the second generation of microcomputers — those that appeared in the late 1970s sparked by the unexpected demand for the kit computers at the electronic hobbyist clubs were usually known as home computers for business use these systems were less capable and in some ways less versatile than the large business computers of the day they were designed for fun and educational purposes not so much for practical use and although you could use some simple officeproductivity applications on them they were generally used by computer enthusiasts for learning to program and for running computer games for which the personal computers of the period were less suitable and much too expensive for the more technical hobbyists home computers were also used for electronics interfacing such as controlling model railroads and other general hobbyist pursuits the mos technology 6502 series microprocessor lead to a reduction in the expense of creating computing systems the commodore pet the trs 80 and the apple ii also known as the 1977 trinity by byte magazine are often cited as the first personal computers specifically the commodore pet which byte called the first 16 the design of the commodore pet a single integrated machine with a built in monitor keyboard and datasette device and the operating system of the xerox alto went on to inspire the popular macintosh computer by apple a 1978 ad for the apple ii used the wording apple the personal computer there was no trademark symbol three years later the term personal computer was a trademark of ibm which had decided to invade the microcomputer market and had done it successfully a few years later a judge declared that personal computer was no longer an ibm trademark but a generic term for any personal computer not made by apple back to business it was the launch of the visi calc spreadsheet initially for the apple ii and later for the atari 8bit family commodore pet and ibm pc that turned the microcomputer into a business tool in fact an apple employee discovered in 1980 that ibms san jose research lab had purchased several apple iis solely to run visi calc citation neededthis was followed by the august 12 1981 release of the ibm pc which would revolutionize the computer market the lotus 123 a combined spreadsheet inspired by visi calc presentation graphics and simple database application would become the pcs own killer application good word processor programs would also appear for many home computers in particular the introduction of microsoft word for the apple macintosh in 1985 while earlier versions of word had been created for the pc it became popular initially through the macintosh in the january 3 1983 issue of time magazine the personal computer was named the person of the year for 1982 today a modern university computer lab during the 1990s the power of personal computers increased radically blurring the formerly sharp distinction between personal computers and multiuser computers such as mainframes today higherend computers often distinguish themselves from personal computers by greater reliability or greater ability to multitask rather than by brute cpu ability alone in todays common usage personal computer and pc usually indicate an ibm pc compatible due to this association some manufacturers of personal computers that are not ibm pcs avoid explicitly using the terms to describe their products due to networks the internet and such factors as digital rights management modern personal computers are no longer the exclusive tools of their users support of desktop computers in business now requires as much bureaucracy and professional training as did operating a timesharing system with the drawback of much lower security and many users skilled enough to get into trouble but not skilled enough to get out modern computers are thousands of times more powerful than those of only twenty years ago multicore processors a gigabyte of ram and hard drives of several hundred gigabytes have become the norm these numbers eclipse even supercomputers from past decades uses personal computers are normally operated by one user at a time to perform such general purpose tasks as word processing internet browsing internet faxing email and other digital messaging multimedia playback computer game play computer programming etc the user of a modern personal computer may have significant knowledge of the operating environment and application programs but is not necessarily interested in programming nor even able to write programs for the computer therefore most software written primarily for personal computers tends to be designed with simplicity of use or userfriendliness in mind however the software industry continuously provide a wide range of new products for use in personal computers targeted at both the expert and the nonexpert user configuration an exploded view of a modern personal computer monitor motherboard cpu  microprocessorprimary storage  ramexpansion cards power supply optical disc drive secondary storage  hard diskkeyboard mouse personal computers can be categorized by size and portability desktop computers laptops or notebooks personal digital assistants pdasportable computers tablet computers wearable computers this section describes the desktop computer because its the most complete and one can easily look inside the case the others have the same basic setup but usually lack the peripherals computer components main article computer hardware a minimal setup of a typical contemporary desktop computer would be computer case with power supply usually sold togethermotherboard processor with a heat sink and fan usually sold togetherat least one memory card mass storage keyboard and mouse for input monitor for output the motherboard connects everything together the memory card s graphics card and processor are mounted directly onto the motherboard the processor in a socket and the memory and graphics cards in an expansion slot  the mass storage is connected to it with cables same for keyboard and mouse except that they are external and connect to the back plate the monitor is also connected to the back plate except not usually directly to the motherboard but to a connector in the graphics card the mass storage can be hard disk floppy drive or zip drive both with mediaoptical drive  cd or dvd the operating system eg  microsoft windows mac os x linux or many others can be located on either of these but typically its on one of the hard disks a live cd is also possible but very slow and used for either installation of the os demonstrations or problem solving on top of these a typical computer also has sound card network card modem and possibly router common additions connected on the outside peripherals are printer scanner webcam speakers microphone headset card reader gaming devices such as a joystick several functions implemented by chipsets can be integrated into the motherboard such as typically usb and network but also graphics and sound but even if these are present a separate card can be added if what is available isnt sufficient the graphics and sound card can have a break out box to keep the analog parts away from the electromagnetic radiation inside the computer case for really large amounts of data a tape drive can be used or extra hard disks can be put together in an external case these components can usually be put together with little knowledge to build a computer if something shouldnt go somewhere it usually doesnt fit this used to not always be the case in the past and if it does fit it can usually do little harm most personal computers are standardized to the point that purchased software is expected to run with little or no customization for the particular computer many pcs are also userupgradeable especially desktop and workstation class computers devices such as main memory mass storage even the motherboard and central processing unit may be easily replaced by an end user this upgradeability is however not indefinite due to rapid changes in the personal computer industry a pc that was considered topoftheline five or six years prior may be impractical to upgrade due to changes in industry standards such a computer usually must be totally replaced once its no longer suitable for its purpose this upgrade and replacement cycle is partially related to new releases of the primary massmarket operating system which tends to drive the acquisition of new hardware and tends to obsolete previously serviceable hardware see planned obsolescence the hardware capabilities of personal computers can sometimes be extended by the addition of expansion cards connected via an expansion bus some standard peripheral buses often used for adding expansion cards in personal computers as of 2005 are pci agp a highspeed pci bus dedicated to graphics adapters and pci express most personal computers as of 2005 have multiple physical pci expansion slots many also include an agp bus and expansion slot or a pci express bus and one or more expansion slots but few pcs contain both buses motherboard the motherboard or mainboard is the primary circuit board within a personal computer many other components connect directly or indirectly to the motherboard motherboards usually contain one or more cpus supporting circuitry—usually integrated circuits ics providing the interface between the cpu memory and inputoutput peripheral circuits main memory and facilities for initial setup of the computer immediately after being powered on often called boot firmware or in ibm pc compatible computers a bios in many portable and embedded personal computers the motherboard houses nearly all of the pcs core components often a motherboard will also contain one or more peripheral buses and physical connectors for expansion purposes sometimes a secondary daughter board is connected with the motherboard to provide further expandability or to satisfy space constraints central processing unit the central processing unit or cpu is that part of a computer which executes software program instructions in older computers this circuitry was formerly on several printed circuit boards but in pc class machines has been from the first personal computers a single integrated circuit nearly all pcs contain a type of cpu known as a microprocessor the microprocessor often plugs into the motherboard using one of many different types of socket ibm pc compatible computers use an x86compatible processor usually made by intel amd via technologies or transmeta apple macintosh computers were initially built with the motorola 680x0 family of processors then switched to the power pc series a risc architecture jointly developed by ibm motorola and apple computer but as of 2006 apple has switched again this time to x86 compatible processors main memory a pcs main memory ie its primary store is fast storage that is directly accessible by the cpu and is used to store the currently executing program and immediately needed data pcs use semiconductor random access memory ram of various kinds such as dram or sram as their primary storage which exact kind depends on costperformance issues at any particular time main memory is much faster than mass storage devices like hard disks or optical discs but is usually volatile meaning it does not retain its contents instructions or data in the absence of power and is much more expensive for a given capacity than is most mass storage main memory is generally not suitable for longterm or archival data storage mass storage mass storage devices store programs and data even when the power is off they do require power to perform readwrite functions during usage although semiconductor flash memory has dropped in cost the prevailing form of mass storage in personal computers is still the electromechanical hard disk the disk drives use a sealed headdisk assembly hda which was first introduced by ibms winchester disk system the use of a sealed assembly allowed the use of positive air pressure to drive out particles from the surface of the disk which improves reliability if the mass storage controller provides for expandability a pc may also be upgraded by the addition of extra hard disk or optical drives for example dvdroms cdroms and various optical disc recorders may all be added by the user to certain pcs standard internal storage device interfaces are ata serial ata scsi and cf type ii in 2005 video card the video card  otherwise called a graphics card graphics adapter or video adapter  processes and renders the graphics output from the computer to the computer display also called the visual display unit vdu and is an essential part of the modern computer on older models and today on budget models graphics circuitry tended to be integrated with the motherboard but for modern flexible machines they are supplied in pci agp or pci express format when the ibm pc was introduced many existing personal computers used textonly display adapters and had no graphics capability laptop computers a laptop computer or simply laptop also called a notebook computer or notebook is a small personal computer designed for mobility usually all of the interface hardware needed to operate the laptop such as parallel and serial ports graphics card sound channel etc are built in to a single unit most laptops contain batteries to facilitate operation without a readily available electrical outlet in the interest of saving power weight and space they usually share ram with the video channel slowing their performance compared to an equivalent desktop machine one main drawback of the laptop is that due to the size and configuration of components relatively little can be done to upgrade the overall computer from its original design some devices can be attached externally through ports including via usb however internal upgrades are not recommended or in some cases impossible making the desktop pc more modular see also the full article on wikipedia stub this article is a stub an article too short to provide more than rudimentary information about a subject you can help the microsoft wiki by
