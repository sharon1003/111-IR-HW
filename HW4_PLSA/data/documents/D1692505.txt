chances of getting pregnant after depo provera last updated on feb 02 2013by alyssia granger rate this article rating 31 5 8 votes castthe average time frame that it takes most women to get pregnant after depo provera is around four to ten months but some women even take years to get pregnant after depo provera what is depo provera depo provera is a form of birth control that comes in an injection form it can be a great choice for many women who are looking to prevent pregnancy since it is easier to remember than a daily oral pill you only get one shot of depo provera every three months and most women enjoy not having to worry about their birth control any more than that depo provera works by preventing the body from forming any uterine linings this is a great thing when you are trying to prevent pregnancy because depo provera also prevents regular menstruation most women do not complain about that however what effects can depo provera have after you stop getting the shot and decide that you want to get pregnant read on to find out more claim your 20 free pregnancy tests – click here problems getting pregnant many women find that after they stop taking depo provera they have a hard time getting pregnant sometimes this difficulty is quickly remedied however it may last a long time the reason for the problems getting pregnant is because once you start taking depo provera your periods become irregular and in some cases stop all together this makes it hard to calculate when you will be ovulating and therefore harder to get pregnant another reason to experience trouble getting pregnant after depo is because women don’t realize how long it can remain in their systems the effects of a single depo provera shot can remain in the body for up to eight months sometimes even a bit longer at around four months after your last depo provera shot your chances to get pregnant will gradually start to increase however it can sometimes take up to two years before your chances of getting pregnant are the same as what they were before taking depo provera how long does it take of course there is no magic number to determine how long it will take for you to become pregnant as we said before about four months after your last shot your chances of getting pregnant will slowly start to increase your chances of getting pregnant will not be the same as they were before you started depo provera until around two years after your last shot the average time frame that it takes most women to get pregnant after depo provera is around four to ten months but the times can vary greatly between women some women even take years to get pregnant after depo provera ask your doctor if you have any additional questions on getting pregnant after depo provera conceive
