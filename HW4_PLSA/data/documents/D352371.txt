velocity created by sal khan google classroom facebook twitter email questions tips  thanks top recent video transcript in the last video we talked about the idea that if i start with some type of a string there and if i were to take the left end of the string i could just have equally have done the right but if i take the left end of the string and jerk it up then all the way down and then back to its resting position itll generate this disturbance in the string and the disturbance might initially look like this after ive done that jerking up and down once and that disturbance is going to propagate down the string its going to move down the string like that let me color this in black so this is right after i do that first cycle that first jerking up and down the string might look something like that and if we wait a little while the string might look something like this assuming that i only did that once the string might look something like this where that pulse has actually propagated down the string that pulse has propagated down the string and in the last video we said hey this disturbance thats propagating down the string or propagating down this medium although it doesnt necessarily have to have a medium we called this a wave and in particular this wave right here this is a pulse this is a pulse wave because we only have essentially one perturbation of the string now if i kept doing that if i kept going up and down and up and down essentially if i periodically did it at regular intervals then my string would look something like this doing my best to draw it neatly it might look something like this where once again the perturbations are going towards the disturbances are going to move to the right theyre going to move to the right with some velocity and what i want to do in this video is really focus on this type of wave this type of wave right here which you can imagine since im periodically moving this left side up and down up and down and creating these periodic movements in the wave we call this a periodic wave this is a periodic wave the motion is repeated over and over again so what i want to talk about is some of the properties of a periodic wave now the first thing you might say is hey how far are you jerking it up and down how far are these movements from rest so if this is the resting position right there how far are these movements above the resting position and below the resting position and we call that the amplitude of the wave so that distance right there ill do it in magenta that distance right there is the amplitude sometimes mariners will have an idea of wave height wave height they normally refer to from the bottom from the trough of a wave to its peak amplitude were talking about from the resting position to its peak so let me label peak i think you know what peak means peak is the highest point on the wave thats the peak and thats the trough if youre in a fishing boat and you wanted to see how big a wave is youd probably care about the wave height not so much if your boats sitting down here you have to care about this whole distance but anyway we wont talk too much about that so thats the first interesting idea behind a wave and not all waves are being generated by sal jiggling a string on the lefthand side but i think you get the idea that these waves can represent many different this graph can represent many different types of wave forms and this essentially displacement from the resting position or from the zero position that is your amplitude now the next question you might ask is ok i know how far youre jiggling this string up and down but how quickly are you doing it so how long does it take for you to go all the way up all the way down and back again so how long for each cycle cycle is me going up down back again how long for each cycle or you might say how long for each period were saying this is periodic each period is each repetition of the wave so this idea of how long for each cycle we call that the period and this is going to be a unit of time maybe im doing it every two seconds it takes me two seconds to go up down back again up down back again thats going to be two seconds a very related term is how many cycles am i doing per second so in other words you could say how many seconds for each cycle we could even write that so for example a period might look like something like 5 seconds per cycle or maybe its 2 seconds per cycle but what if were asked how many cycles per second so were asking the opposite question its not how long how many seconds does it take for me to go up down and back again were saying in each second how many times am i going up down back again so how many cycles per second thats the inverse of period so period the notation is normally a big capital t for period this is frequency its normally denoted by an f and this youre going to say cycles per second so if youre going 5 seconds per cycle that means youre doing 15 of a cycle or 15 of a cycle per second all i did is invert this right there and that make sense because the period and the frequency are inversions of each other this is how many seconds per cycle how long does one up down back again take and this is how many up down back agains are there in a second so they are inverses of each other so we could say that frequency is equal to 1 over the period or you could say that period is equal to 1 over the frequency so if i told you that im vibrating the left end of this rope at 10 cycles per second and by the way the unit of cycles per second this is a hertz so i could have also written this down as 10 hertz which youve probably heard before 10 hertz just means 10 cycles per second if my frequency is 10 cycles per second my period is going to be 1 over that so 1 over 10 seconds per cycle which makes sense if in 10 times i can go up and down a whole up down back again if i can do that 10 times in a second its going to take me 110 of a second to do it each time now another question we might ask ourselves is how quickly is this wave moving in this case to the right since im jiggling the left end of the string how quickly is it moving to the right so the velocity so to do that we need to figure out how far did the wave go after one cycle or after one period so after i jiggled this once how far did the wave go what is this distance from this resting point to this resting point there and we call that a wavelength and theres a lot of different ways you can define a wavelength you could view a wavelength as how far the initial pulse went after completing exactly one cycle or you could view it as the distance from one peak to another peak that is also going to be the wavelength or you could view it as a distance from one trough to the other trough thats also the wavelength or in general you could view the wavelength as one exactly equal point on the wave from that distance to that distance that is also one wavelength where youre completing between that point and that point youre completing one entire cycle to get exactly back to that same point and when i say exactly back to that same point this point doesnt count because this point although were in the same position were now going down we want to go to the point where were in the same position and notice over here were going up we want to be going up again so distance is not one wavelength to go one wavelength we have to go back to the same position and were moving in the same direction so this is also one wavelength so if we know how far weve travelled after one period let me write it this way wavelength is equal to how far the wave has traveled after one period or you could say after one cycle because remember a period is how long does it take to complete one cycle one to complete up down and back again notion so if we know how far weve traveled and we know how long it took us it took us one period how can we figure out the velocity well the velocity is equal to distance divided by time for a wave your velocity and i could write it as a vector but i think you get the general idea your velocity whats the distance you travel in a period well the distance you travel in a period is your wavelength after one up down back again the wave pulse would have traveled exactly that far that would be my wavelength so ive traveled the distance of a wavelength and how long did it take me to travel that distance well it took me a period to travel that distance so its wavelength divided by period now i just said that 1 over the period is the same thing as the frequency so i could rewrite this as wavelength and actually i should be clear here the notation for wavelength tends to be the greek letter lambda so we could say velocity is equal to wavelength over period which is the same thing as wavelength times 1 over my period and we just said that 1 over the period this is the same thing is your frequency so velocity is equal to wavelength times your frequency and if you know this you can pretty much solve all of the basic problems that you might encounter in waves so for example if someone tells you that i have a velocity of i dont know 100 meters per second to the right so in that direction velocity you have to give a direction and they were to tell you that my frequency is equal to lets say my frequency is 20 cycles per second which is the same thing as 20 hertz so literally if you had a little window where youre only able to observe this part of your wave youd only observe that part of my string if were talking about 20 hertz then in 1 second you would see this go up and down twenty times 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 in exactly one second you would see this go up and down 20 times thats what we mean by the frequency being 20 hertz or 20 cycles per second so they gave you the velocity they gave you the frequency whats the wavelength here so the wavelength in this situation you would say the velocity your velocity is equal to your wavelength times your frequency divide both sides by 20 and actually let me make sure i get the units right so this is meters per second is equal to lambda times 20 cycles per second so if you divide both sides by 20 cycles per second you get 100 meters per second times 120 seconds per cycle and then this becomes a 5 this becomes a 1 so you get 5 and then the seconds cancel out so you get 5 meters per cycle so this is equal to 5 meters per cycle which would be your wavelength in this situation so its 5 meters you could say 5 meters per cycle but wavelength implies that youre talking about the distance per cycle so in this situation if this is moving to the right at 100 meters per second and this frequency i see this moving up and down 20 times in a second then this distance right here must be 5 meters likewise we can figure out the period very easily the period here is just going to be 1 over the frequency its going to be 120 seconds per cycle so using these formulas and i dont want you to memorize a formula it should be intuitive for you and hopefully this video made it a little bit intuitive but using this you can really answer almost any question if youre given two of these variables and you need to solve for the third anyway hopefully you found that helpful
