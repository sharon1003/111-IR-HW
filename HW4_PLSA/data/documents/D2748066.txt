materials to install a vent maybe that would help narrow the vague price range thanks02212012 0338 pm  5coconut pete coconut petes paellajoin date jan 2010location charlotte nc  denmark posts 1320 rewards points 504view coconut petes album quote originally posted by jmcphers not sure why the huge range or what other information is needed thanks you cant really estimate cost based on hey i need a vent in my bathroom even just trying to estimate materials is impossible based on the one sentence you provided if you live in a 1 story house in montana it could be easy and cheap but if you live in a 3story brownstone in manhattan and your bathroom is on the 1st floor it would be a huge pain and very expensive of course you could always tell the contractor but some guy on the internet said it should only cost xyz  contractors love that02212012 0348 pm  6jmcphers newbie join date aug 2011posts 16 rewards points 18view jmcpherss album ok i thought i said in my first post that i already have a bathroom fan i wasnt clear on the floor i have a single family 2 story home the bathroom is located on the second floor the bathroom fan is vented into the attic right above the roof is not that far from the bathroom fan its about 67ft the bathroom fan was just installed in that bathroom i didnt think materials would vary in costs depending on your location based on your experience would the installation be different from home to home on a single family home where the bathroom fan is located on the second floor and would need to be vented through the roof if so can you give me some guidelines on materials i would need to do the job and how to do such a job thanks02212012 0410 pm  7willie told school join date jan 2009location st petersburg fl minds of moderate caliber ordinarily

materials i would need to do the job and how to do such a job thanks just to get you up to speed here there are all sorts of variables that will alter costs the simple fact that you said you have a 2story home ups the cost by 15 to 30 you have not given an indication of the type of roof covering you have we do not know the pitch angle of your roof can workmen get to your roof in that area are there trees or fences or another building that might cause problems how accessible is the interior area above your bathroom can a man get there from the attic or does all the work have to be done either through a hole in the roof andor a hole in the bathroom ceiling is the fan now installed of sufficient power cfpm airflow to efficiently exhaust a vertical column of air as far as is needed how much insulation and of what type is going to be displaced and perhaps need replacing is there anything in the way in the attic such as duct work or any structural elements this would possibly require rerouting the fan vent ducting and maybe necessitate the installation of another type fan altogether sometimes a second fan is necessary up at the roof connection then there is permitting and code inspections to think about all different in different areas of the country its winter right now and that is going to also affect the cost and im sure others here can add to this short list of considerations thats why it is always best to get yourself several quotes from local contractors true eloquence consists in saying all that is necessary and only that which is françois duc de la
