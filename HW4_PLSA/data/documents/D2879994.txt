parasite alert 3 signs to watch out forthe defining characteristic of a parasite is an organism that benefits at the expense of another if you harbor a parasite any work you may do to heal your gut will be constantly undermined in many cases you could be carrying a parasite without even knowing it once parasites have been treated and removed you can begin to repair the damage that has been done to the gut wall with a daily probiotic like the bifidus power blend capsules while this seems straightforward enough sometimes a parasitic infection goes completely undiagnosed parasitic infections are more common than you may think many times a parasite can thrive in the human body and show no signs of its presence other times a person will feel constantly ill be on several medications including antipsychotic drugs and have no idea that a chronic parasitic infection is at the root of their problems parasites come in many shapes and sizes one of the most common parasites to infect human beings is the yeastlike blastocystis hominis a singlecelled parasitic organism that causes abdominal cramping bloating gas and sometimes anal itching other common parasites are tapeworms which can grow as long as 60 feet while living in the human intestines there are currently more than 5000 different species of tapeworm hookworms if given the chance they will suck blood from your intestinal walls giardia a singlecelled parasite that is usually the result of drinking infected waters it typically survives in chlorinated water and commonly lives in mountain streams earning it the name “backpacker’s diarrhea” about 25 million cases are reported annually 1blood flukes they mature first in snails and then complete their life cycle by burrowing through human skin and swimming through veins blood flukes infect more than 200 million people there are also other species of flukes found living in the liver lungs and pancreas in the case of malaria a new generation of parasitic microbugs will burst from a single red blood cell pinworms the most common roundworm in the united states worldwide roughly 209 million people are infected 2 the most common sign of pinworm infestation is anal itching at night which is when the female pinworm migrates to the perineum to lay her eggs children are the most common carriers the strength of your immune system can determine whether or not you know that you are hosting a parasitic bug while it is true that many times one person can harbor a parasite without ever knowing it another person could be infected with the same parasite and feel completely devastated and fatigued without ever knowing that a parasitic infection is at the root of a lingering illness new to body ecology get started here with the body ecology blueprint why is this when the immune system is weakened by fatigue there is always the danger of initiating an inflammatory cascade throughout the body this is especially true of the gut which has a direct line of communication to the brain via the vagus nerve3 red flags that may indicate you are carrying a parasite1 chronic digestive issues if you harbor a parasite any work you may do to heal your gut will be constantly undermined this is because parasites often create intestinal inflammation and destroy the intestinal lining of the gut if you are eating a highly alkaline diet ingesting good bacteria and cultured foods on a daily basis and still experience severe digestive pain gas bloating and fatigue you may want to consider a parasite cleanse remember even without a parasite it may take as long as six months to begin to see improvements in digestion while following the body ecology principles this is because it can sometimes take as long as six months to completely cool down an inflammatory response in the gut2 various forms of mental distress this includes depression anxiety body aches headaches eye aches visual hallucinations behavioral changes and a strange sensation that something is stuck in the head very often these symptoms are treated with antidepressant pharmaceuticals and go unresolved diagnosis can even go so far as schizophrenia 3additionally these symptoms are usually paired with digestive issues the gut is full of both neurons and neurotransmitters specifically serotonin it makes up what is known as the enteric nervous system as we mentioned above the gut and the brain have a direct relationship commonly called the gutbrain axis this relationship means that distress in the gastrointestinal tract can show up in the nervous system when there is inflammation in the gut this can lead to inflammation in the brain likewise inflammation in the brain has also been linked to directly cause inflammation in the gut inflammation of the brain will cause mental distress like depression anxiety and cognitive disorders if something about your health feels “off” it could be a dormant virus our antiviral protocol can help get you back on track3 autoimmune disorders many times autoimmune conditions have a relationship to one another the autoimmune flareups that have been documented to be specifically related to parasitic infection are gut and joint related such as irritable bowel syndrome ibs and reactive arthritis 45parasites infecting the gut can ignite an inflammatory cascade within the body finding the root cause of a disorder keep in mind that the strength of a person’s immune system and endocrine system largely determines how severely a parasitic infection will affect that individual this depends on how the parasite lives off its host the toxins or waste products it eliminates how a parasite activates the immune system if an individual’s immune system is weak or fatigued chronic disease can be troublesome to treat mainly because it is necessary to find the initial cause of the dysfunction ready to learn more about your health our be 101 courses offer the tools for transformation consider help from the body ecology parasite cleanse if you eat a perfect diet practice stress management and still struggle with digestive disorders mental distress autoimmune disease many times its a lack of a strong inner ecosystem and a lack of good bacteria inside of us that have much to do with a large amount of us who are infected with parasites today some amount of parasites living in the body is considered normal but most of us have far too many an untreated parasitic infection can have a huge impact on health mood and behavior what to remember most about this article in many cases a parasite infection will go completely undiagnosed yet parasite infections are more common than many people realize the strength of your immune system will determine whether or not you are vulnerable to a parasite infection here
