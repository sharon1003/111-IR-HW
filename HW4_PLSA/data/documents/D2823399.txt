spodoptera exempta  also called okalombo kommandowurm or nutgrass armyworm is a moth of the family noctuidae the larvae often exhibit marching behavior when traveling to feeding sites leading to the common name armyworm 1 the caterpillars exhibit densitydependent polyphenism where larvae raised in isolation are green while those raised in groups are black these phases are termed solitaria and gregaria respectively 2 gregaria caterpillars are considered very deleterious pests capable of destroying entire crops in a matter of weeks the larvae feed on all types of grasses early stages of cereal crops eg corn rice wheat millet sorghum  sugarcane and occasionally on coconut 3 4 the solitaria caterpillars are less active and undergo much slower development 1 the species is commonly found in africa but can also be seen in yemen some pacific islands and parts of australia 5 african armyworm outbreaks tend to be devastating for farmland and pasture in these areas with the highestdensity outbreaks occurring during the rainy season after periods of prolonged drought 6 7 during the long dry seasons offseason the population densities are very low and no outbreaks are seen 3contents  hide

described by francis walker in 1856 the species of spodoptera are distributed around the world mostly inhabiting tropical and subtropical areas there are 30 known species in the genus and roughly half are considered agricultural pests there are two final larval stages based on the mandible structure of the species serrate like mandibles and chisel like mandibles along with s exempta the following species and subspecies have chisellike mandibles that were evolved to consume silicarich leaves s triturata s m mauritia s m acronyctoides s umbraculata s cilium s depravata and s pecten like s exempta a few species are migratory as adults and travel downwind for hundreds of kilometers namely s exigua s frugiperda and s litura due to the broad distribution of the species the origin of the genus is unknown however dating of phylogenic trees reveal that the common ancestor for the genus lived between 22 and 307 million years ago and began diversification during the miocene epoch 8geographic range  editthe african armyworm is commonly found in the grasslands of africa and asia within africa it is mostly seen near the sahara in the following countries tanzania kenya uganda ethiopia somalia malawi zimbabwe zambia and south africa outside of africa the species also inhabits southwest saudi arabia southeast asia australia and new zealand 9habitat  editmapping of african grasslands and other biomes akin to other species of the genus spodoptera s exempta lives in tropical and subtropical environments near cereal crops and dense vegetation where the larvae of the species can easily feed 9 because these larvae thrive in highdensity populations african armyworm outbreaks occur in which fields become overrun by caterpillars the surrounding vegetation is then consumed in large amounts often with devastating effects 9 while seasonal winds and rains allow adult s exempta to migrate across countries and continents they are often confined to coastal areas and marshes during dry seasons where the occasional rainfall supports enough vegetation growth for the moths survival 10food resources  editoplismenus undulatifolius a type of poaceae s exempta larvae feed almost exclusively on poaceae also called gramineae poaceae is a family of flowering grasses which includes cereal grasses and the grasses of grasslands and pastures 1 the species targets most cereal crops including maize sorghum rice millet and other grasses 11 young caterpillars are also known to feed on wheat and oat seedlings 12 the larvae eat the upper and lower surfaces of the plant tissue first preferring to feed on younger and recently germinated crops studies have shown that two larvae can completely consume a 10dayold maize plant with 67 leaves indicating the devastating potential of a highdensity outbreak 9life cycle  editeggs  editthe female can lay a maximum of about 1000 eggs in her lifetime she can lay 100400 eggs per night with an overall average of 150 11 9 the number of eggs females can lay is positively correlated with their pupal weight 1 african armyworms primarily lay their eggs in clusters on the lower side of leaves their eggs are relatively small at 05 mm in diameter they are white when first laid but will turn black prior to hatching 9 the eggs hatch into larvae within two to five days 11larvae  edits exempta undergo six larval instars that altogether can last between 14 and 22 days depending on the temperature and vegetation in the environment fully grown sixthinstar larvae are 25–33 mm long 9the larvae display densitydependent polyphenism where the appearance of the individual depends on the population density in which it was reared the terms gregaria and solitaria were given to the caterpillars raised in groups and in solitude respectively these two phases can also be referred to as gregarious and solitary or crowded and isolated gregaria larvae have black bodies and thin yellow horizontal stripes along their bodies solitaria larvae have green coloration with a brown stripe down their backs this green coloration is due to both pigmentation and ingested plant material visible in the gut the differences in appearance between the solitaria and gregaria phases become apparent in the third instar and remain until the last instar 13 the species is most damaging to crops during its gregaria phase because the blackbodied caterpillars are more active and densely concentrated than solitaria caterpillars 1 solitaria larvae are less active and tend to stay curled up by the base of the crops leading to less exposure to the sun 14 because gregaria caterpillars have darker coloration and maintain positions higher up on the crops they have increased exposure to the sun resulting in more rapid development than solitaria caterpillars 1 generally african armyworms are not noticed by farmers until the caterpillars are ten days old and start exhibiting the gregaria phase 15larvae that are transferred from isolated to dense conditions or vice versa display the gregaria appearance 13 the darkness of the gregaria phase is positively correlated with the population density of the environment two larvae raised together will have a dark brown appearance while larvae raised in larger groups will be completely black 13 the caterpillars phase is determined by nonspecies specific larval interaction but can be influenced by temperature isolated larvae that are raised in low temperatures can gain a darker appearance while larvae raised in crowded groups at high temperatures will not be as dark as typical gregaria 13 despite how sensitive the developing larvae are to larval contact high densities of solitaria caterpillars have been recorded due to a vegetationdense environment limiting interaction 13 because the developmental and pupal stages for gregaria caterpillars are shorter than the solitaria caterpillars gregaria phase larvae tend to be smaller but have more efficient feeding behavior 1pupae  editpupation occurs beneath the surface of host plants and away from bare ground roughly 2–3 cm underground 9 12 this pupation event leads to a sudden synchronized disappearance of the larvae especially if the soil is moist 9adults  editadults emerge in 7 to 10 days and can live up to 14 days 16 9 the moths migrate over hundreds of kilometers from their emergence sites to their oviposition sites 17 this migration often causes outbreaks to occur suddenly in areas that were previously free of the pests 18 while polyphenism is observed in the larvae the two phases lead to indistinguishable s exempta adults however the two larval phases go on to display different migratory behavior the gregaria larvae tend to produce adults that travel longer and further during the migration period 1the adult moth wingspan is between 20–37 mm with dull graybrown forewings and offwhite hindwings with visible veins 9 females and males can be distinguished by the number of bristles on their frenulum where males have a single bristle while females have multiple females are also identifiable due to their racquetshaped abdomen tip and black scales 9 males have been observed to mature earlier than females 10migrations  editwhen african armyworms first emerge after pupation they allow their bodies to dry off and their wings to harden before climbing trees 9 the moths then fly hundreds of meters above the ground and rely on winds to carry them to their next location 19 therefore migration is based on winds brought by the intertropical convergence zone which move northwards or southwards depending on the season the moths only travel during the day and descend during dusk to hide in the grass until dawn this process is repeated for several days until an acceptable destination is reached or the moths encounter rain 9 because rain causes the moths to descend s exempta are less likely to migrate during frequent rainfall 11 after the moths land back on the ground they drink water mate and lay their eggs 9 migration is beneficial because it allows the species to travel to a new location with fewer predators and less possibility of parasitism and infection 10outbreak behavior  edits exempta are a serious pest for crops often thriving during the wet seasons and leading to outbreaks there are two types of african armyworm outbreaks primary and secondary primary outbreaks occur with relatively inconspicuous lowdensity populations that can survive without frequent rainfall secondary outbreaks occur when the moths from the primary outbreak are carried downwind and the adults mate and lay eggs in same location due to wind patterns 9 during these secondary outbreaks gregaria larvae emerge from the ground synchronously and their density may exceed 1000 larvae per m 2 9 5 these larvae display highly active feeding behavior leading to excessive consumption of the nearby vegetation especially the leaves of cereal crops and grasses if extremely hungry the gregaria larvae may also consume the stem and flowers of the plants 9 the highdensity gregaria larvae may then pupate and emerge as adults leading to a large migration event of moths that travel downwind together these moths will then develop their eggs together resulting in more outbreaks 5 the intensity of outbreaks also increases during the start of the wet season after a drought which allows moths to lay eggs in areas of dense vegetation which supports the larval stage growth 11enemies  editoverview  editnatural enemies have limited effects on african armyworms due to the species unpredictable migration paths and variable population densities the large number of moths traveling during migration can also lead to predator swamping overwhelming the predator by exceeding its capacity eat the moths 19 despite these challenges s exempta still faces predators parasites parasitoids diseases and viruses during the pupal and prepupal stages the species is susceptible to a cytoplasmic virus high humidity and temperature lead to attacks from the fungi nomuraea rileyi 9 although parasitoids do not accumulate rapidly enough to kill a s exempta population before migration occurs if the moths happen to return to the same spot high levels of parasitism are experienced 19 most significantly the species is infected by the speciesspecific baculovirus s exempta nucleopolyhedrovirus spex npv spex npv  editspex npv abbreviated from s exempta nucleopolyhedrovirus is a baculovirus that can be transmitted vertically from adults to offspring 20 spex npv can kill 90 of an african armyworm larvae population in their last instar the high mortality rate is due to the vertically transmitted diseases capability of traveling with the diseased individual during migration 19 9 because vertically transmitted diseases benefit from the host species survival and are less pathogenic than horizontally transmitted diseases spex npv can persist in an individual with no symptoms 20 s exempta attempt to reduce the risk of contracting spex npv via densitydependent prophylaxis which allows the species to invest more in resisting disease and stimulate migration to less dense locations 19mating  editfemalemale interactions  editpheromones  editvirgin female s exempta adults are observed to release pheromones that attract males in particular this includes the following six compounds z914 ac z9tetradecenyl acetate ze91214 ac ze912tetradecadienyl acetate z1114 ac z11tetradecenyl acetate z914 oh z9tetradecen1ol z914 ald z9tetradecenal and z1116 ac z11hexadecenyl acetate while the compounds z914 ac ze91214 ac z1114 ac and z914 oh are commonly found sex pheromones in lepidoptera species the latter two compounds have only been seen in other spodoptera species 21physiology  editthermoregulation  editwhile dark coloration in species usually indicates a thermoregulatory function this does not appear to be true under normal conditions in s exempta the black gregaria larvae do not exhibit basking behavior which is usually present in darkcolored species that want to increase their body temperature via exposure to the sun although the gregaria larvae are shown to heat up more rapidly than the solitaria larvae gregaria caterpillars have less body mass which is the main contributing factor to the increased effect of temperature however darker coloration was favored in high temperatures when the species is more likely to overheat suggesting that the coloration between the two phases could be more significant at extreme temperatures 13interactions with humans  editpest control  editarmyworms marching the gregaria phase of the s exempta species are considered agricultural pests due to their high densities and feeding behavior because it is hard to identify and eliminate all primary outbreaks the main focus for pest control has been to target secondary outbreaks in the past cheap broaduse pesticides such as ddt bhc and dieldrin were commonly used to target the caterpillars 9 now newer insecticides such as azadirachtin and aqueous neem  azadirachta indica seed extracts are often applied but these methods are dose dependent and have adverse side effects on both human health and crops 11 more focused rapid and environmentally friendly intervention techniques now exist to limit the spreading of s exempta for example the s exempta nucleopolyhedrovirus virus spex npv a naturally present disease that preys on the species is now being investigated as a method of biological pest control 11infestations  editin midapril 1999 an african armyworm infestation started in southern ethiopia spreading into the north the following month and into the jubba valley of somalia in early may similar outbreaks affected the rift valley province of kenya and parts of uganda at the same time while ethiopian officials had stocks of pesticides to treat 350000 hectares of affected land neither kenyan nor ugandan officials had sufficient supplies to combat the insect and no central government was present to respond to the emergency in somalia 22star radio in liberia reported in january 2009 that zota district in bong county had been invaded by african armyworms which had consumed vegetation polluted creeks and running water 23 and were moving toward guinea and sierra leone 24 on january 28 2009 the president of liberia declared a state of emergency to deal with the infestation of army worms in the country 25african armyworms marching along a road in tanzania december 2009 had an infestation of ten regions of tanzania the infested regions include three of the five main grainproducing regions the other two major grainproducing regions were at risk of infestation tanzania has trained farmers in fighting armyworms since 2007 and responded to forecasts of the late 2009 infestation by sending out hundreds of liters of pesticides to rural farmers the first infestation was reported on december 22 and quickly spread to surrounding regions the previous growing season saw tanzania produce 10872 million tons of grain after 10337 million tons of domestic consumption the remaining 0534 million tons were exported by december 31 almost 1400 acres 57 km 2 of grain had been destroyed by armyworms in just the lindi region of tanzania 26in january 2015 armyworm outbreaks were reported in zimbabwe and by november there were reports of similar outbreaks in botswana 27 28in 2016 the fall armyworm  spodoptera frugiperda a species of american origin that behaves similarly invaded maize crops in zambia 29 by january 3 2017 about 90000 hectares were affected according to reports released by the zambian governments disaster management and mitigation unit 30 the zambia national farmers union indicated that some farms were completely wiped out the zambian president directed the air force to help airlift pesticides to fight the outbreak 30in 2017 fall armyworm infestations were detected in more
