on april 11th 2016i am a person with multiple rare chronic conditions as a young disabled single mother with chronic pain and invisible conditions i am used to being disbelieved and often even flat out accused of being a drugseeker 95 of the doctors i see have never even heard of my condtions even as specialists in the area as a result i have significant trust issues when it comes to doctors and i usually go in expecting another bad experience dr brown an ent not only was familiar with all of my conditions and how they might affect what he specializes in but he never showed a flicker of doubt in his face he was kind friendly had a great sense of humor put me at ease and i could tell he saw me as a person not an impossibility or medical oddity he gave me multiple options explained everything thoroughly looked for problems associated with my conditions beyond what my actual complaints were and even apologized for needing to do a test that wasnt altogether overly pleasant i dont think ive come across such a kind doctor in a very long time and should i need any further help from an ent id be right back in his office in a heartbeat i say this very rarely but i have no reservations recommending this doctor the truth is hes restored my faith in the medical profession just a bit his kindness went beyond me just being confident in the care he could provide he was good enough that he gave me a bit of faith in regards to maybe finding other doctors out there with his level of compassion as well rating breakdown three stars selfverified patient of dr seth m brown
