frederic j brownafpthe next big fight in income inequality is about to go down in california can the entire bay area raise the minimum wage to 15 per hour by david dayen july 31 2014congress can barely name a post office without partisan rancor so it’s light years away from taking any meaningful action on income inequality that’s why hope has shifted to states and cities seattle led the way in june with a successful drive to raise the minimum wage to 15 an hour but further down the pacific coast in the san francisco bay area a coalition of labor and community groups has put together a much more ambitious comprehensive and muscular plan to raise the minimum wage—one that doesn’t stop at the limits of any single city over time they want to create a regional living wage across eight counties lifting the fortunes of the working poor two measures will appear before voters this november in oakland and in san francisco where a ballot initiative to raise wages to 15 an hour by 2018 for all workers in the city qualified tuesday similar measures will appear in the next two years in berkeley and richmond and if they succeed more will follow as far north as sonoma and napa and as far south as san mateo opponents of the higher minimum wage in seattle argued that it would drive businesses to lowerwage pastures if california’s regionwide gambit works businesses will have nowhere to flee if they want to tap into the wealthy customer base in northern california they’ll simply have to treat their workers well the movement is led by the service employees international union seiu local 1021 but the benefits would be enjoyed by all workers in the covered area they have joined with statewide organizing groups like the alliance of californians for community empowerment as well as different community faith and labor groups in each city the san francisco group is called the coalition for a fair economy in oakland it’s lift up oakland organizers have approached the minimum wage as a rare economic justice wedge issue allowing for a boldness not typically seen in modern labor fights like seattle they want to raise it to 15 an hour but they have also added several new core principles indexing the minimum wage to the cost of living rejecting any exemptions or carveouts for categories of workers protecting tipped workers from having their tips taken by their employer and including paid sick days combined this would create the most fullservice set of benefits for lowwage workers in the nation in san francisco seiu 1021’s strategy worked perfectly the city already has laws for paid sick days and protecting workers’ tips making it a natural starting point in april the coalition for a fair economy led by seiu 1021 released its ballot measure to raise the minimum wage to 15 an hour by 2017 with cost of living adjustments thereafter the san francisco chamber of commerce immediately denounced it as outrageous but minimum wage measures are popular—the last one in san francisco in 2003 passed with well over 60 percent of the vote so the threat of the ballot measure forced the chamber and mayor ed lee into negotiations with the coalition eventually the two sides reached a consensus endorsing a new ballot measure that delayed the move to 15 until 2018 while retaining every other aspect it will head to voters for approval in november oakland’s business leadership proved more stubborn so with the backing of nearly 50 groups and 1000 volunteer hours lift up oakland collected 33000 signatures to qualify a referendum that would immediately raise the minimum wage for everyone in oakland to 1225 an hour with inflationbased indexing thereafter and paid sick days as well organizers estimate that the wage would hit 15 an hour by 2021 roughly the same time frame as seattle the local chamber of commerce attempted a rearguard action partnering with the president of the oakland city council pat kernighan to submit a lastminute alternative it would have delayed the increase to 2017 and exempted workers younger than 26 years old as well as those working at small businesses lift up oakland saw this as a backdoor effort to deny raises to franchise workers in bigbox stores and fastfood joints by categorizing them as small businesses so it sent actors dressed as colonel sanders and the burger king to tuesday night’s city council meeting to “endorse” the measure “we want to thank the oakland chamber of commerce and pat kernighan” colonel sanders said “we can keep finding excuses to keep workers in poverty”the city council voted 53 to reject the alternative ballot proposition only the lift up oakland version will get a vote in the fall despite a billboard campaign claiming lowwage workers will get replaced with i pads if they demand higher wages polling shows nearly threequarters of voters supporting the initiative in oakland “but it must be just one step in raising working standards for all workers in the bay area and nationally” said roxanne sanchez president of seiu 1021 to that end the coalition plans to expand out in the coming years starting with richmond and berkeley both cities passed minimum wage increases in may but richmond’s includes several exemptions like one for businesses that primary export goods a carveout specifically designed for its large chevron refinery and berkeley’s law has no cost of living adjustment or paid sick days so seiu plans to use the ballot in 2015 and 2016 to replace the current laws with loopholefree alternatives they’ve also begun work on future fights in emeryville albany hayward concord sunnyvale and sonoma once the biggest cities in the bay area switch to a higher minimum wage seiu leaders believe the smaller ones will follow “we want to get the entire region” said 1021 vice president gary jimenez “the standards are much easier to enforce from the same starting place” and the momentum appears contagious los angeles is planning its own 15 an hour measure and san diego’s city council just passed a more modest increase which republican mayor kevin faulconer plans to veto  to be sure the california bay area’s strong liberal population gives organizers lots of leverage in minimumwage fights but raising the minimum wage is broadly popular particularly in communities with high levels of lowwage workers if the city allows for ballot initiatives coalitions can leap past the cautiousness of politicians and business leaders and take their fight directly to the people it also gives the seiu an opportunity to recast itself ahead of future fights “the unions are standing up for the working class as a whole instead of being seen as a special interest defending their membership” said rich yeselson a longtime labor organizer seiu has its own interests at heart too it has made a bet on the lowwage sector underwriting the fastfood worker movement with hopes of eventual unionization combined with a national labor relations board ruling yesterday making mc donald’s liable for actions of its franchisees the lowwage sector could help labor revive its flagging fortunes and prove itself relevant in the inequality debate liberals have long searched for an issue that can attract widespread support and generate tangible economic progress this minimum wage battle tailormade for metropolitan areas with strong leftlabor coalitions provides an opportunity“this economic downturn touched people across the nation” said gary jimenez of seiu 1021 “people have been hit so hard that they understand the problem of inequality and a need to address it people will vote to do the right thing because it’s in their hearts and their minds”david dayen is the author of chain of title how three ordinary americans uncovered wall street’s great
