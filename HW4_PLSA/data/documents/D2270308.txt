northcom russian cruise missile threat to u s grows u s defenses ‘overmatched’ for missile threats share tweet email russias kh101 longrange cruise missile  national air and space intelligence center by bill gertz follow bill gertz march 20 2015 540 pm russia is developing a longrange cruise missile that poses a new threat to the united states the commander of the u s northern command warned this week russia is progressing toward its goal of deploying longrange conventionallyarmed cruise missiles with ever increasing standoff launch distances on its heavy bombers submarines and surface combatants augmenting the kremlins toolkit of flexible deterrent options short of the nuclear threshold adm william gortney northcom chief who heads the u scanadian north american aerospace defense command norad said thursday should these trends continue over time norad will face increased risk in our ability to defend north america against russian cruise missile threats he said in prepared testimony to the house armed services subcommittee on strategic forces a defense official said the missile that concerns the northcom commander is the russian kh101 cruise missile which russia has developed as a weapon to attack critical infrastructure in the united states such as the electrical grid the comments highlight what defense officials and military analysts say is the growing threat of longrange cruise missiles cruise missiles pose unique threats because they can defeat defenses by flying at low altitudes avoiding radars and hiding behind terrain some newer cruise missiles have radarevading stealth features making them even less visible to radar or infrared detectors the lowflying missiles also can overwhelm defenses by attacking with multiple missiles coming from different directions and defeating air defenses at their weakest points they also can fly circuitous routes to reach targets avoiding radar and air defenses testimony by gortney and other senior officials at the hearing raised concerns that growing missile capabilities could overwhelm u s defenses vice adm james syring director of the pentagon’s missile defense agency testified that north korea’s missile development in particular is a major concern syring said because of funding cuts he may have to advise gortney that the missile defense system is overmatched subcommittee chairman rep mike rogers r ala said he is very concerned about funding shortfalls for missile defense the united states of america is on its way to losing its military edge not just in terms of the ability to project power but to even defend the homeland rogers said this situation is intolerable gortney in his testimony said we remain concerned with the development of conventional cruise missiles that could provide near peer adversaries with options to strike the united states without the perceived risk of retaliation of a nuclear exchange the threat was highlighted in early september when two russian tu95 strategic bombes conducted practice cruise missile bombing strikes on the united states from launch areas off the coast of eastern canada u s defense officials said across capitol hill adm cecil d haney commander of the u s strategic command also voiced concerns about the growing cruise missile threat that he said is affecting u s defenses and deterrence the concept of mating advanced weapon systems with commonplace items—such as surfacetosurface cruise missiles disguised as shipping containers—blurs the line between military and civilian environments and complicates our deterrence calculus haney said in testimony to the senate armed services committee thursday haney said the air force is developing a new airlaunched longrange standoff nuclear cruise missile to replace the aging airlaunched cruise missiles now in use the new missile is needed to defeat sophisticated air defenses like those that china is developing neither admiral gave specific technical details on the new russian cruise missile however former pentagon nuclear strategist mark schneider said the russian missile is the kh101 the russians describe the kh101 as a 5000kilometer 3106mile range conventional cruise missile he said the kh102 is the nuclear version the kh101 is configured for launch on russian strategic bombers there have been russian press reports that a seabased variant is deployed on russia’s severodvinskclass nuclear attack submarines a report by the national air and space intelligence center nasic said at least nine nations are developing landattack cruise missiles and several will make them available to foreign customers the cruise missile threat to u s forces will increase over the next decade the report said russias club k cruise missile  national air and space intelligence center according to nasic russia’s clubk cruise missile is sold in a container launcher that looks like a standard shipping container the clubk can launch cruise missiles from cargo ships trains or commercial trucks china also has a new longrange cruise missile called the dh10 and iran’s landattack cruise missile is the 1242milerange meshkat the new missiles challenge u s dominance in the field of precision conventional cruise missiles the emerging capability of near peers to generate similar longrange strike effects could complicate our decisionmaking the fourstar admiral said to counter the cruise missile attack threat the united states has deployed a sensor system called the joint land attack cruise missile defense elevated netted sensor system jlens the first system was deployed at the army’s aberdeen proving ground in maryland and a second will be deployed later this year gortney said jlens will be a key element of countering the cruise missile threat and said his command in charge of u s homeland defense needs better intelligence on the cruise missile threat near u s airspace and shores whether it is a strategic bomber a submarine or a surface combatant defeating the archer is technically more feasible and affordable than defeating the arrow he said the ability to locate intercept and if necessary destroy these platforms before they can launch a strike is crucial the u s military is working with the canadian military to modernize or replace sensors systems designed to detect air intrusions into u s and canadian defense zones before we can engage an airborne threat we must be able to see it gortney said adding that doing so requires developing advanced surveillance to detect track and monitor aircraft cruise missiles and drones the new surveillance capabilities will when necessary cue our defense systems against the full spectrum of air threats of all sizes at all altitudes and at all speeds he said retired air force lt gen dave deptula a former senior intelligence official said gortney’s concerns are warranted the threat of accurate low observable conventional cruise missiles requires more attention in the form of deterrent capability systems that yield improved situational awareness and effective defenses said deptula now dean of the mitchell institute of aerospace studies these increasing threats underscore why we need build the kind of deterrent and situational awareness capabilities resident in a new longrange sensor shooter aircraft he said they also should be a wake up call for us not to neglect our northern tier bases schneider the former pentagon strategic nuclear policy official said the kh101 is one of several new cruise missiles being developed by the russians there is a very large asymmetry in cruise missile capability developing between the u s and russia schneider said we have eliminated our only nuclear submarinelaunched cruise missile are ending production of our tomahawk conventional ship launched cruise missile and the range of our airlaunched conventional cruise missile is less than 1000 kilometers he said our followon nuclear airlaunched cruise missile is not until late 2020s all of this reflects the fact that the russians are preparing to fight us while we are preparing to fight terrorists this entry was posted in national security and tagged military russia bookmark the permalink
