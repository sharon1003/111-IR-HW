jun 6 2011ammunition share military ammunition and why green tip m855 is not armor piercing by bryan black over the weekend i attended the final hours of my nra rso range safety officer rifle and shotgun instructors training while i won’t get into the nra’s embargo on the word “weapon” or that a few instructors freaked out when i carried a firearm with the muzzle pointed at the ground i did learn something from our readers on facebook i’d like to share with everyone throughout my time in the military i’d always referred to m855ss109 556 ammunition green tip as armor piercing rounds or ap for the life of me i can’t recall where i first heard that mentioned but it was fairly common for it to be referred to as that one of the final taskers for the nra courses was to construct a training aid and you’ll see a photo below of what i put together armor piercing as you’ll see i have the green tip marked “ap tip” which is how i explained my training aid to the class as well if you’re wondering it was made from a cardboard tube floral foam paint and a little creative thinking after a few people pointed out that m855 isn’t ap in the facebook comments of the photo i posted i started doing some digging it turns out that sure enough m855 was removed from the atf’s list of ap rounds i haven’t been able to track down when this change took place but i thought it was important to share to all those that have considered m855 to be ap rounds like i did while having a steel penetrator tip this doesn’t constitute m855ss109 as “armor piercing” the round was designed for increased penetration at longer ranges to combat saw squad automatic weapon issues though things may or may not be clearer once you read how the federal government defines ap ammunition in 18 usc sec 921 a 17 definition 17 a the term “ammunition” means ammunition or cartridge cases primers bullets or propellent powder designed for use in any firearm b the term “armor piercing ammunition” means i a projectile or projectile core which may be used in a handgun and which is constructed entirely excluding the presence of traces of other substances from one or a combination of tungsten alloys steel iron brass bronze beryllium copper or depleted uranium or ii a full jacketed projectile larger than 22 caliber designed and intended for use in a handgun and whose jacket has a weight of more than 25 percent of the total weight of the projectile c the term “armor piercing ammunition” does not include shotgun shot required by federal or state environmental or game regulations for hunting purposes a frangible projectile designed for target shooting a projectile which the attorney general finds is primarily intended to be used for sporting purposes or any other projectile or projectile core which the attorney general finds is intended to be used for industrial purposes including a charge used in an oil and gas well perforating device what does all that mean a few things to take note of is that the classification as “armor piercing” is for bullets only not the complete cartridge despite the mention of handgun caliber above you can take that to mean that it’s a round that has been made as a handgun caliber at some point the bullet projectile must also have a core made entirely out of the metals listed above or be a full jacketed bullet with a jacket weighing more than 25 of its overall weight this means that the ss109m855 bullets wouldn’t be covered as their cores are partly steel and partly lead lead isn’t listed in the metals above furthermore as you’ll see in the list below the atf has specifically stated that the ss109m855 bullets are exempted from ap status atf ap classified rounds all ktw arcane and thv ammo czech made 9mm para with steel core german made 9mm para with steel core msc 25 acp with brass bullet black steel armor and metal piercing ammunition762mm nato ap and slappmc ultramag with brass bullet not copperomnishock 38 special with steel core762×39 ammo with steel core bullets atf exempted rounds556 ss109 and m855 nato rounds with steel penetrator tip3006 m2 ap ammo hopefully that clears up some confusion for you like it did for me you can rest easy that when a range calls for no ap rounds that you’ll be safe using m855 if desired if you’re in the market for ammo be sure to check out our sponsor lucky gunner for great online ammo prices
