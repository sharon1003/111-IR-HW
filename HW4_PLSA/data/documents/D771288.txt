angle the torque on a current loop a uniform magnetic field exerts no net force on a current loop but it does exert a net torque lets say the magnetic field is in the plane of the loop and is parallel to two sides if the loop has a width a a height b and a current i then the force on each of the left and right sides is f  ib b the other sides experience no force because the field is parallel to those sides the two forces are in opposite directions so theres no net force but there is a torque that tends to make the loop rotate about an axis running through the center of the loop the torque about this axis isτ  f a2  f a2  fa  iab bab is the area of the loop so the torque is in this caseτ  iab this is actually the maximum possible torque when the field is in the plane of the loop when the field is perpendicular to the loop the torque is zero in general the torque is given byτ  i a × bwhere the area vector is perpendicular to the plane of the loop its direction can be found from another righthand rule curl the fingers on your right hand in the direction of the current and your thumb stuck out points in the direction of the area vector
