how long should a washing machine cycle takeblueisthecolour posts 13930forum member✭✭070810  21001ok so my last washing machine was given to me by a relative it was old and had a few faults the main one being that the programme cycle were broken so i had to turn the machine off manually however it did a job so i would just let it run for an hours or so and then switch it off a couple of weeks ago that one finally gave up the ghost so i got myself a new but basic beko washing machine however ive put on the normal cycle today and after 2 14 hours it is still going is this right should it really take this long
