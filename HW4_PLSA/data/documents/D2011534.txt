where does love come from1john 4721does it seem strange to you that john exhorts his readers to  love one another  v7 does it not go without saying that we should love one another the apostle john i suspect admonishes us to love one another for a specific reason john admonishes us to love one another in order to clarify for us the precise origin and meaning of love in the greek language there are different words that can be translated into the english word  love  one of the greek words for love means to have a brotherly love towards someone another one of the greek words means to have a passionate love towards someone but the word used by john here agapao from the word agape  means something quite different in some translations agape is actually translated as  charity  agape then can be described as selfgiving love it is this selfgiving love that john is calling us to f f bruce provides an excellent definition of agape love when he writes that it involves a consuming passion for the wellbeing of others bruce the epistles of john 107 this is an important distinction because humanity is predisposed to love in a selfcentred fashion we are prone to love those who are loveable we are prone to love those who are able to provide us with pleasure and satisfaction i like to call this transactional lovemost of us are only willing to love if we get something in return most of us fit into the ill scratch your back if you scratch mine mentality but this is not the love john is commanding us to practice the love that john is commanding us to practice is a love that involves a consuming passion for the wellbeing of others how are we going to pull this off if human nature is prone to love in a selfcentred fashion how are we to have selfgiving agape love towards one another the key to practicing agape love is closely tied to where agape love comes from john tells us in verse 7 that agape love  is from god  john goes on to say that  everyone who loves is born of god and knows god  it is safe to say that the reverse is also true everyone who is born of god loves our ability to demonstrate agape love john tells us is a direct consequence of our status as gods children the type of love john is calling us to here is critical it is critical because this is not the way we normally love we love those who love us we love those who are good to us but do you remember what jesus says about this kind of love in luke 632 33 jesus asks rhetorically  what credit is it to you if you love those who love you for even sinners love those who love them and if you do good to those who do good to you what credit is that to you for even sinners do the same when john commands us to  love one another  then he is commanding us to love without any regard to merit he is commanding us to love those who have mistreated us why is john requiring that we love one another in this manner because this is the way god loves john actually takes this one step further when he states in verse 8 that  god is love  the origin of true love is in the nature of god and because true love is bound up in the very essence of god we as human beings are incapable of fabricating this on our own this is why john can say that those who practice agape love are born of god while those who do not practice agape love demonstrate that they are not born of god v7 20 as we might expect the example of agape love that john cites is the cross  9 by this the love of god was manifested in us that god has sent his only begotten son into the world so that we might live through him 10 in this is love not that we loved god but that he loved us and sent his son to be the atonement for our sins how is the cross an example of agape love were we the recipients of gods love deserving no the apostle paul says that we were  enemies of god  rom 510 far from deserving or meriting gods love paul says that we  all have sinned  rom 323 and that  the wages of sin is death  rom 623 this is not a transaction salvation is  the free gift of god  given to undeserving sinners rom 623 so when we read that  god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son  jn 316 we must not infer that we were lovable to god there is no sense in which our nature was lovable to god before he saved us the good news is however is that gods love makes us lovable gods love makes us capable of loving others this is why john can say  11 beloved if god so loved us we also ought to love one another  gods unconditional love for us is the basis for our unconditional love for others johns next point in verse 12  12 no one has seen god at any time  i admit seems unrelated to our topic of love but in fact it is quite relevant to our discussion though god throughout history has manifested himself to humans in various ways john is reminding us that no human being has actually seen god in all his glory what does this have to do with love well john says that  god is love  and at the same time he says that  no one has seen god  how then can we see what love looks like how is gods love manifested it was manifested in life and death of jesus christ of course but where is christ now now that the son has returned to the father how is gods love to be revealed this is johns answer  if we love one another god abides in us and his love is perfected in us  how is gods love to be revealed it is to be revealed in us it is to be revealed as we demonstrate agape love towards one another john says that when we do this  gods love is perfected in us  this statement begs the question how is gods love less than perfect the word for  perfect  here teleioo telio also means  to complete  this i would argue is a better translation because we know that gods love is perfect in nature god does not need us to perfect his love how then can it be said that  gods love is completed in us  what is gods love lacking gods love is lacking a body gods love is lacking a body and so by abiding in us by giving us  his spirit  v13 god is able to testify through us that he  has sent his son to be the savior of the world  f f bruce describes this as the strongest apologetic that god has in the world bruce the epistles of john 109 as the communities of beeton and tottenham continue to grow so does the number of nonchristians in our community the question is how are we going to communicate the gospel to them do we share the gospel as individuals using clever theological arguments sure do we invite these people to our church and hope that they will be impressed with the music and the preaching now theres an idea but personally i agree with f f bruce and i think f f bruce is simply agreeing with the apostle john and i suspect the apostle john is simply agreeing with the words of his lord and saviour jesus christ  by this all men will know that you are my disciples if you love one another  jn 1335 the greatest apologetic for the god revealed in jesus christ is the love of god displayed in his people and gods love is wholly different than the worlds love god loves the unlovable god loves the undeserving gods love is sacrificial in nature to love in any other way is to simply love as the world loves not that this is altogether bad but as long as we love no differently than the rest of society we will not convince people of the reality of christs love if we are to expect the people of our community to come to know christ we must love them and we must love each other with a love that can only come from god amen
