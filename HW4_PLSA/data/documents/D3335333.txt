might think relates well to the general public may or may not be popular in the eyes of others focusing only on a general zodiac or sun sign this is also the issue of generalizing any answer to either zodiac or basic sun signs as robert kimball wisely notes in several of his posts here on quora “if you only focus on sun signs it will often not give you the reliable insights you are looking for”i completely agree with robert sun sign astrology is extremely generalistic and limited in its scope look at the entire natal chart in order to determine popularity it’s important to evaluate the entire natal chart when analyzing general popularity consider the lights which are the sun and the moon sun and moon are important indicators of popularity you should also look at the planetary rulers of the sun and moon as well as their placement in the 12 signs houses and any aspects they make if the sun and moon are wellplaced and in favorable aspect sextile and trine to each other it’s most likely you will get along well with the majority of others in your world if the sun and moon are unfavorably aspected by square or opposition it may indicate general unpopularity moon and venus in good aspect while it’s important to emphasize the necessity of evaluating the entire natal chart rather than isolating a few indicators many astrologers place importance on positive moon and venus aspects a well placed moonvenus sextile trine can often indicate a pleasing lovable personality which is easy to like venus is the planet of love when the moon and venus blend well together it traditionally brings a natural gentleness and sweetness to the personality it also indicates compassion as well as the natural ability to show empathy a positively aspected moon and venus will generally attract a general popularity other positive natal aspect sextile or trine which might indicate popular include but aren’t limited to natal sunnatal moon – attractive and positive personality which is generally very likeable sun venus – generally an outgoing friendly personality sunuranus – this combination brings a broad vision along with a dramatic great talent which attracts a lot of attention as well as

and 11m answer views originally answered whats the most popular zodiac sign in what sense do you mean that please understand that when we talk about zodiacal signs we are not actually talking about human beings who have their sun in a particular sign of the tropical zodiac so if you are thinking about people with a particular sun sign i cannot respond to your question a person could have his sun in a “popular” sign like leo and still be a very arrogant and narcissistic person again you should get to know the signs for what they actually are fundamental archetypal principles that exist in all of us this may be new information to you each sign represents a basic life principle that is part of the architecture of the human psyche for example we all have the aries principle the fundamental need to assert ourselves to go after what we want to pioneer to be first to win etc we all have the taurus principle to feel comfort to be secure and stable to be sensually gratified to in touch with all things earthly etc so from that standpoint there is no one “popular” sign they are all essential767 views · view upvoters nirban jyoti das works at technology solutions code answered jan 19 2017 ·

what they can do  their violence character  which is required to win a war  scorpio sometimes violent this does not mean their could be a criminal or could commit crime easily the violence character of scorpio is mainly aggressiveness this aggressive ness makes them a good worker  a hard worker scorpio is a risk takers this also does not mean they through stones blindly each and every risk taken
