cleaning challenge to organize and clean for a thrifty and healthy homeare you ready to face the toilet well it will treat you much nicer if you clean it nicely and by nicely i mean naturally it is safe for everyone to clean your toilet naturally – the kids the cat the dog the toilet and your homei would much rather walk into a bathroom and smell the lovely scent of not smelling a toilet than try to inhale the chemical fumes from a freshly and harshly cleaned toilet but even better the “natural cleaning agents” i will be showing you actually leave a mild nature smelling cleani try to do this intensive of a clean about once a week with our daily chores the toilet gets a wipe down with the homemade natural antibacterial disinfecting wipes or with one of the 3 spray cleaners and a cloth that keeps it nice in between – and for a family of 7 – the toilet gets a lot of usage dailyso let me walk you through the 5 steps to a very simple very natural and very effective toilet cleaningthe 7 best essential oils for cleaningbefore we start i use essential oils for many things including cleaning these are the “secret” ingredients to make these cleaners have their “antibacterial effect” read up on the top oils for cleaning and how to get them cheap herehere’s the simple and ingredients and supplies needed – i don’t measure just pourpumice stone gloves toilet brush i love the black ones from ikea as black hides everything and they are cheap and so i don’t feel bad by replacing them every time i go to ikea – i really don’t like these things hanging around for long vinegar baking soda any of the 7 best essential oils for cleaning but my personal favs for the toilet are the tea tree and lemonstep 1 – using your pumice stone remove any rings and stains in the bowl on the underside of the lids and aroundunder the rim then flush the toilet to flush the remaining granules from the stone down the drain this has always by far been way more effective than any action a chemical cleaner has done but… we are just getting rid of the stain not the bacteria is leaves behind that’s why we do the next steps please note only use a pumice stone during the cleaning times that you need to if you “over pumice” or use the stone when not necessary it may scratch your bowl just use it to get rid of the rings and stainsstep2 – once it has flushed just pour some vinegar down the toilet and swish a little i probably pour about 2 cups worth – i want enough to cover when the “ring” or water line tends to be step 3 – then i add about 4 drops of any of the 7 best essential oils for cleaning  i personally usually add a couple of drops of lemon and a couple of drops of tea tree but any of them will work then let this vinegaroil mixture set for 30 minutes step 4 – pour some baking soda into the toilet and it will react with the vinegar and “bubble up” which you then swish and scrub at the same time and scrub until you are satisfied with the cleanstep 5 – continue the freshening by adding 10 or so total drops of the 7 best essential oils for cleaning in the top tank of the toilet so that every time you flush it gets a bit of oil freshening which will keep the bacteria at bay help to smell nice and keep it looking clean in between deep cleanings let me be honest i love clean looking naturally clean smelling and continually working to be clean toilets with that i actually add about 2 drops of all 7 oils for 14 total drops it is probably overkill but i know that each oil has similar properties but they each are best at attacking a different type of bacteria microorganism or whatever – so all 7 get to work together to kill it all your toilet is now a happy clean toilet and every living thing in your home is happy as no one is getting sick from chemicals or from the lack

it is actually a cloth diaper sprayer the box says “diaper sprayer bidet” and so although that is it’s primary purpose it can be both if you want to easily install one yourself we try to use cloth diapers when we are at home during the day and disposable at night or while we are out and the sprayer is a huge help between amazon’s cheap online diapers and the cloth diapers we only spend 20 a
