filled coatcracks smooth advertised waste chips instructionsdry directions followed hairline matched gelscratches top customer reviews d ritchie50 out of 5 stars worked great for our ceramic floor tiles with large cracks june 11 2016color snow white verified purchase i used this to repair a huge crack covering about 5 of our large floor tiles i tried using it on hairline cracks as well but the tile wasnt even so it didnt do as good a job as long as the surface is even it works great also used it to fix a crack on our microwave outer door panel this was just one coat im going to put another over it today looked really bad in person right in the middle of the room and now unless you really look for the lines you dont even notice very happy and since were listing the house for sale next week also a life saver well worth the price for us a lot cheaper then replacing the tiles the first pic is so you can see where i started on the crack to make sure it would work 2nd pick is before these are large 18 tiles and with a crack this big it looked terrible but pic 3 you can see did a great job helping cover the crack be patient and try using the end to push the paste smooth in different ways until it blends in i tried a few different times until i got a good method down for this repair comment 12 people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no report abuse will o20 out of 5 stars not what i expected october 7 2017color snow white verified purchase i bought white chip fix and applied it to a 132 deep gouge on my white boat color matches well but the substance was not what i expected drying took several days to fully cure to get hard it dries to a sandy texture like fine cement it does not at all match the texture of the gel coat on my boat i was expecting a result of a hard coat and instead i get a sandy substance i do not understand the favorable reviews i will be removing this stuff and applying something else comment 3 people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no report abuse d czapiga30 out of 5 stars looks like a liquid but is kinda the consistency of wood  june 22 2016color snow white verified purchase looks like a liquid but is kinda the consistency of wood putty when dry it has a rubbery consistency not hard may or may not bother you but i would have chosen something else had i known also seems easily discolored waiting on hi grit sand paper and rubbing compound to make this fix not look so bad if results improve i will update rating i did have a pretty deeplarge chunk to fix tho it cured harder i did have to sand down and cover with hairline crack product to get the color back to white after sanding results are decent for moneytime invested but not perfect or magically easy lol comment 4 people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no report abuse amazon customer50 out of 5 stars i love this april 13 2017color oyster white verified purchase this product is amazing it far exceeded my expectations a good portion of these kitchen floor tiles were covered in dark cracks i purchased the oyster white color hoping to mask the obvious crack while also hardening so they dont come loose the 9 second fix works like a super glue  really quick drying so you have to work fast with the level edge to smooth it out i worked one crack at a time including some bigger chips this little tube lasted the whole kitchen and a couple of tiles in the front entry way granted i squeezed out every last bit the color i ordered is a little bit lighter than the tile but you cant really tell from a distance and i think it will blend nicely over time please note the pictures are after a first pass only a few touch ups in the dark spots would make it perfect overall works great i would definitely recommend my tile guy working on the bathrooms was shocked at the before and after he thought i had replaced the tiles while he wasnt there comment 3 people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no report abuse zack50 out of 5 stars great productapril 7 2018color oyster white verified purchase i was actually impressed a lot of these type of gelcoat repair products are either difficult to work with or do a crappy job this was really simple i had some smaller chips and stress cracks a couple coats of this stuff and they were basically invisible even after the first coat i had a hard time finding the chips to give them a second coat yes it’s a gritty type of product but gelcoat itself is very hard like this if you want to really make your repair not stand out after it’s been cured for awhile wet sand with 2000 grit and then go over it with your normal buff and wax routine as you do the rest of your boat  it sands down nice and smooth sounds like the negative reviewers were not interested in taking this extra step there is no miracle fix but this stuff is close if you do some extra work oyster white was an absolute perfect match for my 2000 pursuit make sure you study your boat’s color before ordering white isn’t always white if you know what i mean comment was this review helpful to you yes no report abusesteven napier50 out of 5 stars omg july 26 2017color matterhorn white verified purchase this stuff is amazing i had several deep gouges in the bow of my deckboat once it arrived and i got home from work i followed the instructions applied this to the gouges scratches and other affected spots sat down smoked a cigar went back to check on it and it was hard the spotsgougesscratches were gone and were only noticeable because the color i selected was slightly off matterhorn white is slightly a darker white had i purchased oyster white you would never have noticed that i ever had damaged spots on my bow i did all of this while still wearing the clothes i wore to the office i am amazed at how effective how fast and more importantly how simple this is comment one person found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no report abuserver50 out of 5 stars works as advertised november 30 2014color cream verified purchase works great i had gouges about 14  18 inch deep on fiberglass body of my motorhome and filled both in less than a minute it seems like a solid repair as hard as the surrounding material its only been a month so only more time will tell about endurance but im happy with the simplicity of the whole process its now 6 months since i applied this and it still looks great i communicated with the manufacturer about painting it since its a conspicuous area on a motor home and they didnt guarantee adhesion but suggested i try a primer first followed by paint i used a glidden outdoor primer and a gold outdoor spray paint from home depot last month to this point its been through several heavy rain storms and looks great comment 15 people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no report abuse jake20 out of 5 stars strong chip fix  very poor color match march 19
