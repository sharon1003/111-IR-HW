meanwhile was concerned by the poor preaching of joseph noyes and by the initiation of anglican services in new haven to avoid loss of students to the college of new jersey now princeton  founded by those who had defended brainerds expulsion and to defend orthodoxy he convinced the trustees to appoint him as professor of divinity and to authorize separate worship for the students each sunday both the old lights and the episcopalians objected to this in 1753 rev samuel johnson wrote to clap that were he to continue with separate worship the episcopalians would complain and that the charter of 1745 would be found to be invalid as only the king could make a corporation and that yale would cease to exist clap agreed to let the anglican students attend their own church perhaps more important to clap than questions of religion the new lights increased their political power in the connecticut assembly and the state established congregational church in 1754 thomas fitch an outspoken old

1756 6 noyes offered to share his pulpit with the new professor agreeing to subscribe to the assemblys catechism and the savoy confession of faith and the students returned to his first church for worship clap however became disenchanted with noyes old light orthodoxy and poor preaching and obtained a decision that not only could yale students worship separately they could form their own congregation and administer communion the announcement of the corporations decision on june 30 1757 was bitterly controversial and in the aftermath discipline at the college collapsed the general assembly intervened threatened a yale visitation despite being now distrusted by both old and new light factions claps defense of the college as separate from the state caused the assembly to ultimately side with clap he was not so successful with his own tutors and students the student body was caught up in the rebellious spirit of the 1760s resolving to drink no foreign spiritous liquors any more and declaiming in chapel against the british parliament and petitioning the corporation with their grievances insisting on the removal of the disciplinarian clap the students stopped going to classes and prayers and generally abused the tutors who resigned the corporation ordered an early spring vacation and few undergraduates returned president clap offered his resignation at the
