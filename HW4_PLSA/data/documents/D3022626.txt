it may be legal to smoke tobacco but that doesnt mean your employer cant hold it against you smoking tobacco may be unhealthy but it’s your choice whether to do it or not and although it may be an unpopular choice these days the last thing you’d expect is your career suffering because of it believe it or not many states as well as the federal government allow employers to decide whether or not they want to hire smokers and work with smokers no federal protection extensive federal laws protect certain groups of people such as immigrants and the disabled from various types of discrimination in the workplace but no laws exist to protect workers who smoke from employment discrimination since smokers aren’t a protected class under the equal protection clause and the government doesn’t recognize smoking as a protected liberty or right employers who refuse to hire you or subject you to treatment that puts you at a disadvantage in the workplace are not breaking any federal laws but depending on whether the state you work in has antidiscrimination laws that protect smokers you may have legal rights that guarantee your freedom to use tobacco without discriminatory interference by your employer states allowing discrimination because theres no federal protection for smokers every state has the authority to establish its own laws preventing employer discrimination against employees who smoke as of this writing 21 states don’t have legislation giving employees who smoke legal rights against an employer who discriminates against them for example washington state is home to alaska airlines – a company wellknown for its antismoking culture at alaska airlines job applicants who interview for positions in washington or another state that doesnt protect smokers from employment discrimination must submit to a test that detects nicotine use within the last six months and receive a nicotinefree result before any offer of employment is made state antidiscrimination laws the other 29 states and the district of columbia do however have laws in place to protect smokers from employer discrimination seventeen of these states and the district of columbia expressly prohibit discrimination against employees who legally use tobacco when not at work eight other states have enacted broader legislation that protects employees who use any lawful product – not just tobacco the laws of california new york colorado and north dakota provide the greatest levels of protection to all employees by forbidding employers from making job related decisions based on lawful activities their employees engage in when off duty however your rights in these jurisdictions don’t require employers to accommodate your smoking while at work smoking at work many states also want to protect the health of their residents who don’t smoke and have enacted laws that prohibit smoking at work vermont and new york for example don’t allow you to smoke indoors at any facility where people are working – regardless of whether it’s a government building or not some employers even take it a step further and have designated smoking areas located away from building entrances if you violate a state law or your employer’s smoking policies you may be penalized for doing so and it would not be considered discrimination references tobacco control legal consortium there is no constitutional right to smoke – 2008the u s equal employment opportunity commission federal laws prohibiting job discrimination questions and answers national conference of state legislatures discrimination laws regarding offduty conduct vermont department of health vermonts smoking in the workplace law new york state department of health regulation of smoking in public and work places alaska airlines frequently asked questions about the author michael marz has worked in the financial sector since 2002 specializing in wealth and estate planning after spending six years working for a large investment bank and an accounting firm marz is now selfemployed as a consultant focusing on complex estate and gift tax compliance and planning photo credits comstockcomstockgetty images more mustclicks can a person get fired after complaining about the inappropriate behavior of another employee is betting on sports in the workplace ethical can an employer install video cameras who is responsible for workplace safety secular and religious symbols in the workplace does a state have to give employees days off for federal holidays
