reviews oh my god i am so effing disappointed i cannot believe what i have just seen28 may 2017  by will wineinger – see all my reviews gonna try not to cuss i will start by saying i wasam fanatical about all three of the first ones yes the original is still the best but the second is almost every damn bit as good the plot was creative enough that it felt necessary the writing was on par with the first and davy jones is so freaking good oh my god he is literally my favorite villain of all time save for agent smith the third one has its flaws though i really cant think of any besides keira knightleys acting being occasionally over the top but as a whole its a wonderful movie like sweet jesus hans zimmers freaking score for that movie alone is goddamn legendary and as a result i totally bought into the romance between will  elizabeth and really just felt an emotional connection to the whole series because of it much like the emotion howard shores music invokes for lot r but what makes the third one so impressive is how well it handles all of that crazy plot while still introducing great new sht like the brethren court but im not here to talk about how great the original trilogy was odds are most of you liked them too what i want to talk about briefly before i tear dead men tell no tales to shreds is on stranger tides from what i gather the fourth installment wasis not very popular i like it and ill tell you why while it didnt have the same epic sense of scale and adventure and romance and everything that made the first three so great it still had good writing it was clever and witty and funny as ever and this is because ted  terry were still writing them not fricking jeff nathanson omfg ill get to him later i would urge you though to go back and give on stranger tides another chance especially if youve now seen the fifth installment i think youll find that even though it doesnt quite hold up against the first three it still feels like a pirates of the caribbean and for all the reasons that dead men tell no tales did not and here they are 1 johnny depp has completely lost it its like he forgot how to play jack sparrow there were seriously times watching him when i thought he was more mad hatter than he was jack sparrow and its so sad to watch the old jack was an idiot sure but he was always clever he was always suave always cool in this hes just silly its embarrassing im serious when i say he acts like the mad hatter youll see what i mean in the fourth one he at least still felt like jack sparrow 2 zimmers so called protege geoff zanelli is so forgettable i was actually trying to listen for his music but the only times the music stood out was when he was rehashing zimmers themes and some of you may be like sissy voice oh thats all zimmer did was rehash badelts themes bish please not only did he make badelts original theme sound even better he introduced so many new ones jacks theme davy jones theme will  elizabeths theme even on stranger tides added a fun new spanish twist to the old stuff 3 salazar henry  carina are also all completely forgettable theyre worse than blackbeard who i actually quite liked philip and syrena there is hardly any character development for them and what little there was felt so forced i feel terrible for them especially thwaites and bardem because theyre not bad actors bardem is actually a fantastic actor but they just got saddled with one of the worst freaking scripts of all time which brings me to my final and primary complaint with the fifth installment 4 jeff nathanson is cancer i mean my biggest only concerns from the start because lets be honest the trailers gave no hint that the movie would be this bad were the fact that zimmer wasnt composing and that jeff nathanson the idiot who ruined indiana jones was writing it but i never thought he could have fd up this movie not as badly as he did like the movie had so much going for it salazar could have been another great villain to put alongside jones and barbossa but he was totally wasted with minimal and poor dialogue carina smith a female astronomer could have been a great female character and her romance with henry could have been done beautifully instead what did we get well i wont spoil it for you but i will say there is one of the most forced predictable and painstakingly banal twists ive ever seen in a movie regarding her character so as i said i absolutely loved the first three and i really did like the fourth one enough that i was very excited about what they could do with the next one the fifth one all my friends said the franchise was dead but i maintained that the fifth installment had the potential to be amazing which it did and i waited six goddamned years for this fifth one and it was just god awful so bad that i actually now dont want to see another installment and i will honestly probably never watch it again because its so bad that it almost taints my love for the first four i tried to think of reasons to give it more than the lowest possible rating any reason and all i could think of was the visual quality that the two norwegian directors brought to it so good for them i give the fifth pirates of the caribbean a whopping two stars thank you this has been my angrily hastened unedited review of dead men tell no tales219 of 365 people found this review helpful was this
