chestnutth ies im one day i was upstairs p and said “hey you think and it was gene ammons honist so i did get better but there was a lot going you got the opportunity to nd at a fairly young age july new releasecember of ’86 i was about the time i was about 15 to nding berklee and studying rmer jazz messenger i also e and was spending a lot with art then donald was the opportunity to sit in with n terms of that opportunity wed july 9to sit in on that last set art asked me to come back the next night but all i had were clothes on my back a pair slacks a shirt and a sweater i had taken a plane down there and i didn’t even have anywhere to stay so i stayed with james williams when i came back the next night he said “where’s your sport coat and your tie” and i said “i’m sorry i don’t have it” “are you a professional musician” well i thought i was but he kind of let me have it all my clothes were in boston but i was definitely not going to try to explain all that so that was the first thing he said to me that night that you have to look a certain way when you are going on stage and that is something i’ve never forgotten you’ve also said before that art was instrumental in teaching you to be a professional a jazz artist on the highest level absolutely remember i was 21 at that time so i kind of grew up in his band i learned a lot of things traveling and touring all over the world experiencing things through him and the other musicians in the group you can’t pay for anything like that if i got one thing from him i got fifty again he’s the reason why we’re talking right nowand a brilliant mind he was just a very indepth individual a very brilliant manwho’ve been playing with me for a little time now but not all that music anyway the energy was great and i felt everything really came together quickly so in just a few years you’ve worked with two of the greatest drummers of all time where do you go from there so think on me was written by my good friend george cables i have a lot of respect and admiration for him and i just love this composition i also really enjoyed the guys’ interpretation mr taylor is a piece of music that i wrote for a great friend of mine and i have always enjoyed where is the love and the rendition performed by roberta flack and donny hathaway champian fultonand then you worked with elvin jones was that immediately after your time with art

farnsworth dit really sounds like a band too let’s talk a little about the music on expression you open with wayne shorter’s one by one which you probably listened to a lot over the years and steve wonder’s don’t you worry ’bout a thing well then i started working with freddie hubbard which was again through art i met freddie because a lot of artists would do special guest opportunities with the band and he came in a couple of different times as a former messenger i would call him and stay in touch and finally got the chance to play with him that was another incredible demanding opportunity demanding in the sense that he played so very well and in such an organic kind of way he had the ability to really get his emotions out to the audience that is not always something that is easily done he was able to get to his audience express himself with his playing in a manner that i haven’t heard many that can he played the trumpet at times well i actually got this from a conversation with mc coy but he said that freddie played the trumpet like it was a toy right one by one is a piece of music that originally was recorded by art blakey and the jazz messengers live at birdland it was one of my favorites with the sextet that art had in the 1960s with freddie curtis wayne cedar and reggie workman i feel very close to it and on occasion we would perform it when i was with art as for stevie he is one of my favorite composers and i’m just a real fan i’ve actually recorded don’t you worry ’bout a thing before we do more of a modal introduction into the melody here and i felt really good about orrin and his involvement and his freshness at the beginning it is definitely a hip arrangement next is your original t j you’ve worked with so many people over the years who are some of the people you’d like to work with in the future t j i wrote for my father as i mentioned earlier i really am fortunate to have him and my mother who really took me out and supported me in my interest in the music they supported me all the way through so after all these years i finally wanted to write something for him as a dedication well there are obviously many many artists out there that i would love to collaborate with that would help me grow differently i’m kind of strange though…i mean maybe not strange in general but i would love to play with aretha franklin i’d love to play with bob dylan i’d love to play with b b king…i’d love to do something with prince i guess just listening to all this different music you’d love to try to embrace it on a deeper level in terms of performing with these other giants and for me i feel that these different experiences would enhance my music my musical perspective what can you add about when i fall in love well i am very much in love with this piece of music when i fall in love and i’m in awe of the miles davis and nat cole recordings i’ve always liked those performances and i just love the melody right so now by the middle of the album the band sound the band feeling is very strong these middle three tunes they weren’t recorded in this order of course but they definitely establish a band identity the first think on me is followed by mr taylor and then the great ’70s classic where is the love maybe it’s kind of like playing with a new band right this was the first time in my life i had ever played with orrin i really enjoyed his playing he was very fast in his ability to assimilate with corcoran and mc clenty next is your beautiful ballad how do you pronounce it it’s lelia pronounced “leeleeah” it was written for my first cousin who we lost to cancer recently my family loved her very much and this is a tribute to her and the kind of individual that she was it is beautiful finally what can you add about the last two your originals richard’s r a p and 88 strong richard’s r a p is for richard davis he has an organization at the university of wisconsin in madison where he teaches that explores race issues we’ve done several concerts together so i wrote something for richard and that particular organization that he helped to spearhead 88 strong is written for mc coy tyner it’s written to show my appreciation for mc coy and his genius as a musician when you hear him play everything has such meaning such depth and integrity thank you javon for sharing that insight and some of your personal history hopefully it will help to connect listeners in a different way to this wellbalanced record not that it’s difficult to connect to music that is so unaffected and enjoyable expression proves again that great music can be relaxed and natural but also full of depth integrity and meaning it’s an important artistic message from one of the defining artists of our time javon jackson  damon smithfacebook “f ” logo after art passed i started working on two or three different things at once i started working with charlie haden’s liberation music orchestra which was a very great experience and then from there i began to work with elvin jones i’d met elvin during my time with art blakey when he made a couple of guest appearances so i had known elvin and his wife keiko when i got my first recording as a leader james williams encouraged me to reach out to him about playing on it i was kind of nervous about calling him but i get the chance to have him on the recording the chance to know him a little bit then i was offered the opportunity to play in his band so that was obviously life changing another musical highlight he was without question a genius in my opinion a genius of the drums sonny clark john hicks two heartbeats 458wed july 2cmyk  epsthey came through town to of us anyway—from berklee te obviously impressed with eet mulgrew miller so it was ence blanchard and donald

concert at the prospect park bandshell jun 12th would be enough to put into the record the sphere of influence of the man of the hour but simply listing names might suggest that this was your typical walkon walkoff tribute many who took the stage stuck around for the unhurried concert not the least of whom being the honoree himself and so the audience witnessed coleman sharing the stage with flea david murray and henry threadgill backed by denardo coleman’s vibe listening with a broad grin more often than playing they watched patti smith dedicate a poem to coleman as he sat at her side cradling his white plastic sax they heard bachir achtar nels cline ravi coltrane savion glover bruce hornsby joe lovano branford marsalis thurston moore and james “blood” ulmer all take on familiar coleman tunes they witnessed two renditions of “lonely woman” for the first bill laswell carried the familiar theme on electric bass while john zorn surrounded him with saxophone textures and laurie anderson played glistening arpeggios against soft waves of controlled feedback emanating from a row of guitars belonging to the late lou reed the second was initiated by geri allen at the piano soon

audiences so completely in the creative process that they leave with beaming faces mc ferrin worked his improvisational alchemy on town hall fans jun 13th accompanied by the roots’ drummerdj questlove aka ahmirkhalib thompson who after warming up the preshow crowd with funky beats humbly introduced himself as mc ferrin’s “sidekick randomguy” not quite true—it was mc ferrin’s show yes but questlove proved more than an apt match for the singer’s musical hijinks mc ferrin wisely drew on popular repertoire referencing tunes well familiar to many listeners bob marley’s “i shot the sheriff” buddy miles’ “them changes” cole porter’s “i love paris” the gershwins’ “summertime” paul mc cartney’s “blackbird” and “rocky raccoon” prince’s “kiss” led zeppelin’s “rock  roll”

coleman  henry threadgill the student and professional musicians who convened prism at the new school over the first weekend in june for the annual international society for improvised music festival conference spent much of their time— according to jin hi kim who introduced the culminating concert at the alvin johnsonj m kaplan hall auditorium jun 7th—talking about the use of time and space in performance complex notions of time were on clear display from the outset with drummers samir chatterjee and bobby previte meshing counterrhythms then adding students—trombone flute clarinet—each entering in a slow circle each given generous space a trio of drummer bobby previte saxophonist dave liebman and trumpeter wadada leo smith was unsurprisingly on point from the get go previte—who announced before their piece that playing with the two was “a dream of his”—seemed to revel in shifting settings every few minutes steering a series of concise blistering solos a sextet played john coltrane’s “india” led off by chatterjee with liebman setting the theme on a small straight flute before switching to soprano saxophone but it was when michael jefry stevens came in on piano playing full twohand chords that they found not just the indian but the coltrane vibe a final improvisation brought nine players to the stage including kim on komungo and drum and seemed a continuation of the coltrane feeling reaching back through time perhaps to the early days of free improvisation kg4 july 2014  the new york city jazz recordquartet presented the third and final installment of its heritageevolution series at symphony space leonard nimoy thalia jun 12th this one featuring the compositions and performances of saxophonists david liebman soprano and greg osby alto setting the mood for a twopart evening the quartet opened alone with four movements from jennifer higdon’s short series the sheer beauty of the saxophones’ collective sound sweet and virtually without vibrato is incredible demonstrating an aesthetic in many ways closer to that of a classical string quartet than that of a jazz sax section after navigating the complex harmonies counterpoint and hypnotic chorales of higdon’s opus liebman and osby came onstage for directortenor saxophonist matthew levy’s “serial mood reflection” liebman loosing breathy flurries over lush chords osby later dueting with baritone saxophonist taimur sullivan in a phrygian mode the first set concluded with the world premiere of osby’s “covenant of voices” written for prism and inspired by the bulgarian women’s choir demonstrating admirable control over his dynamic range osby began with a lowpitched motif soon joined by soprano saxophonist timothy mc allister— whose beautiful high register rivaled that of a coloratura vocalist—leading the quartet through a gorgeous chorale which also showcased alto saxophonist zachary shemon’s dulcet tone and liebman’s ever boisterous soprano tg adam vision festival 19 celebrating charles gayle lifetime rudolph has been ‘playing the band’ to paraphrase the ellingtonian ideal as conductor of various iterations of his go organic orchestra for well over a decade but he never had the band he did at roulette jun 4th the premiere of his go organic guitars comprised of rez abbasi damon banks marco cappelli nels cline tomas doncker liberty ellman david gilmore joel harrison jerome harris michael gregory jackson miles okazaki brandon ross marvin sewell and kenny wessel a convincing crosssection of trendsetters but it was to rudolph’s credit and experience with various instrumentation that the resulting music was far more wash—as opposed to wall—of sound the currency was simple melodic fragments in the opening 18minute conduction fleshed out by eerie slides and wails fusion leavened by avant garde filigrees harrison’s acoustic opened the second eightminute piece joined by wessel’s banjo and abbasi twittering in the background oozing forward slowly with an emphasis on pick attack the third 12minute piece featured the most aggressive ‘guitary’ opening and more tremolo picking than you could shake a vibrolux at rising in intensity on a variation of the opening piece’s funk groove as rudolph pulled out soloists the final 10minue exposition functioned as “green sleeves” a spacey pastoral foundation for exploring string harmonics this kind of nonegodriven guitar expo couldn’t have happened 30 years ago  andrey henkinof achievement kicked off at roulette jun 11th with a night of music showcasing the versatile artistry of this year’s honoree in three different settings the evening began with gayle costumed as his alter ego streets playing bass on a series of duets with drummer michael t a thompson then moving to piano soon to be joined by daniel carter first on muted trumpet then various reeds blowing atmospherically as miriam and patricia nicholson parker danced expressionistically to the music the concert’s middle set featured gayle playing tenor saxophone the instrument on which he is best known leading a commanding quartet featuring pianist dave burrell bassist william parker and drummer michael wimberly wasting no time the foursome jumped right into a collective improvisation which found gayle blowing gritty speechlike cries that at times recalled both sonny rollins and albert ayler but remained steadfastly in his own distinctive voice as burrell hammered out percussive monkish chords over parker’s whirlwind bass and wimberly’s sprawling rhythms the music moved from raging free jazz through boppish and bluesy intervals and then back a short encore began with a drum solo leading into a breakneck unison line before ending abruptly the night ended with gayle at the piano with the vision artist orchestra in an “ascension”like piece which featured individual solos between group motifs  russ musto pianist jason moran has had his contract as the kennedy center’s artistic director for jazz extended for three

been quite confused for the duration of the 48minute set and the other obvious demographic— the interstellar space crowd—got only about 5 minutes of a ‘typical’ energy saxdrum pairing 15 minutes in the rest of the time the audience was actually witnessing a trio the third member a preprogrammed electronics track the set began with that track two minutes of loud harsh buzzing which just reached the point of being overwhelming when it dropped into muffled spacey noise krauss’ alto sax lines when he entered were the merest puffed flecks enabled by wollesen and a spring attached to his snare drum when the electronics moved into a bitlike pattern krauss’ baritone answered with trills and wollesen added his own apiarylike electronics and radio static after the aforementioned coltraneali tribute the electronics track reasserted itself and krauss switched to electric guitar playing it through processing and with a whisk which resulted in a surprisingly pretty section a brief flurry of alto gusts yielded to guitar once more this time heavily overdriven and manic in pacing then back to yowling sax punctuated by wollesen insectile weirdness on guitar gave way to circularbreathed

album caribbean tinge live at dizzy’s club cocacola motéma with a return engagement at the jazz at lincoln center club the group featured the leader at the piano heading a hardbopping sextet with a frontline of alto saxophonist vincent herring tenor saxophonist greg tardy trombonist steve turre and the rhythm team of bassist carlos henriquez and drummer lewis nash plus percussionists jonathan troncoso and nelson mateo gonzales they kicked off their saturday night jun 14th second set playing the disc’s title track an uptempo flagwaver by villafranca in the tradition of gillespie’s “things to come” which featured burning solos from the horn players and pianist with rousing drum and percussion interludes alternating between fiery swing and afro cuban rhythms the leader ’s “blues for paula” proved the cuban pianist to be a fine purveyor of the distinctively afro american song form as he slowly built an engaging melodic line that recalled monk’s “misterioso” tardy was especially engaging blowing old school tenor on pat martino’s “el hombre” the group swung ferociously on villafranca’s “sunday stomp at congo square” a reminder of the crescent city’s afro caribbean heritage

gift of gab of course he was pimping— you had to have the gift of gab to do that jelly roll was a hustler black people in those days especially in the south thought they needed to hustle to survive so as much of a pianist as jelly roll was he was doing a lot of stuff on the side to make money understand that jelly roll didn’t get any money from ascap because ascap at that time wasn’t paying black people eventually they were forced to start paying black people royalties but by that time jelly roll was dead tnycjr on “buddy bolden’s blues” you’re singing continued on page 33by alex henderson pianistsinger henry butler has not been an easy artist tocategorize often compared to mc coy tyner in the ‘80s the new orleans native who left that city after flooding from hurricane katrina destroyed his home in 2005 and now lives in brooklyn emphasized modal postbop on his first two albums 1986’s fivin’ around and 1987’s the village both released by impulse records but butler moved in many different directions after the ‘80s and viper’s drag his new album with new york citybased trumpeterarranger steven bernstein is heavily influenced by the new orleans jazz of ‘20s30s yet also draws on blues funk and soul during a recent interview the 64yearold butler who has been blind since infancy had a lot to say about his past and his present the new york city jazz record you started out your recording career on impulse records 28 years ago when the label was reactivated by mca records and now that impulse is being reactivated again you’re back on the labellistening to this album but there’s also the influence of the funk soul and blues that were so important to new orleans and you also acknowledge some artists who weren’t from new orleans such as fats waller on the title track and bessie smith with “gimme a pigfoot and a bottle of beer” hb if we were going to have a subtitle we would call it new orleans and beyond because all of the guys on this album have done a lot of different things and can play a lot of different styles they’ve played all over the place some have played with wynton marsalis some have played with levon helm some have played with lou reed—who just died—and they’re having a lot of fun with this new orleansish repertoire tnycjr viper’s drag is credited to henry butler steven bernstein and the hot 9 how did you end up calling the group on this album the hot 9 henry butler yes it’s the second time around for me on impulse and we’re hoping they will do some good things on the business side we’ve done as much as we can do musically so the next thing to see is what they do on the business side hb laughs well there’s actually ten people in the group but i think the producer joshua feigenbaum was caught up in louis armstrong’s hot 5 and hot 7 and he thought this would be a great name for the group tnycjr viper’s drag is the first release from the new incarnation of impulse which has an interesting setup this time impulse has distribution via blue note records in the united states but is being reactivated by universal music group france that’s an intriguing combination tnycjr the name hot 9 certainly has a strong ‘20s prohibitionera connotation hb it’s a little different from the last time i was on impulse of course in those days both my records— fivin’ around and the village—were on cd vinyl and cassette and i think those were the last records i did that came out on cassette tnycjr you have a wide variety of influences on the new viper’s drag album hb we have fats waller we have jelly roll morton we have a little bit of a new orleans street parade thing—not totally catering to the new orleans style but there’s enough of it so you know that there’s some new orleans stuff going on there tnycjr steven bernstein is a fixture in new york city and really brings out the new york element hb definitely in his horn arrangements we have different things in our repertoire some of them come from new orleans some of them come from just the blues style but we always take it somewhere else we believe that everything we do has to have our creative stamp on it tnycjr one can learn a lot about new orleans jazz hb yeah and i think that’s what joshua was thinking tnycjr one thing you and steven bernstein have in common is your very eclectic tastes hb this is a dream for me i’ve always wanted an album with an arranger who was as eclectic as steven bernstein i was a student of alvin batiste who was sort of like that steven is sort of like alvin in that sense and i’m having fun working with him sometimes it’s a blessing to play in so many different styles and sometimes it’s a curse—and when you collaborate with a guy who has great arranging skills that’s a beautiful thing but when you play it live it still goes to a different place every time you play it tnycjr you have three songs from jelly roll morton on viper’s drag hb oh boy that’s right we have “wolverine blues” “king porter stomp” and “buddy bolden’s blues” i suggested all three and it’s fun because steven bernstein with his arranging style takes them to different places tnycjr jelly roll morton died in 1941 and the fact that you’re performing

2012 • tim berne snakeoil  shadow man ecm 2013by ken waxman after a year ’s unhappy experience in the late ‘90s trying to establish himself in new york city pianist matt mitchell 38 escaped as he terms it to his hometown of philadelphia and got a day job at the university of the arts’ library “i swore i’d never again play one music gig i didn’t want to play and i haven’t” he’s certainly lived up to that pledge mitchell is still in philly but he now divides his time working in such highprofile ensembles as dave douglas’ quintet rudresh mahanthappa’s bird project tim berne’s snakeoil darius jones’ quartet john hollenbeck’s large ensemble rez abbasi’s invocation plus his own band with bassist chris tordini drummer dan weiss and tenor saxophonistclarinetist chris speed mitchell has also been widely praised for fiction his pi recordings debut which is a series of duets with snakeoil drummer ches smith at the turn of the century mitchell wanted to free himself from having to play jobs that were devoted to what he calls “utilitarian” rather than creative music since he had spent the previous few years dedicated to studying his craft growing up in exton pa he started playing the familiar socalled classical repertoire at five “although i remember ‘improvising’ at the piano before taking lessons” he says but wasn’t exposed to jazz until his early teens when his father brought home two tapes the best of thelonious monk and wynton marsalis’ j mood “i was attracted to the music because it sounded crazy and new to me” he recalls “also i was looking to get into playing ‘other things’” the other things soon escalated into playing house sessions with the likes of bassist reid anderson and drummer ari hoenig and eventually an undergraduate degree in music from indiana university iu and a masters from the eastman school of music esm with one of the oldest university jazz departments iu was an easy choice while “eastman initially came about because i frankly had no idea what to do after iu and i was also interested in other things such as the music history and composition and orchestration classes” serendipitously trumpeter ralph alessi was one of his teachers and the trumpeter subsequently became a friend and “vital figure” with whom mitchell continues to play regularly the pianist also teaches for a week each year at alessi’s brooklynbased school for improvisational music sim his busy schedule permitting mitchell admits that another reason for attending esm was “not feeling ready to plunge into any scene at the time i’m not sure i ever felt ready in a way maybe i sort of gradually materialized into the scene instead once it finally happened” so after his disappointing nyc experience he continued to hone his skills in philadelphia where in the late ‘90s he and a group of friends started scrapple records to document their playing in various configurations vapor squint antique chromatic is an electroacoustic cd released in 2007 on which he played then processed edited and reassembled the tracks “i’m definitely proud of that disc and i have continued working on similar types ofapproaches” he explains but i keep getting hired to play piano so it’s hard to find enough time to do everything justice” hiring mitchell to play piano may cut into his own musical explorations but it’s proven to be a boon to others’ bands most of his gigs he explains come about in “the typical ‘jazz way’ one leader sees me play with someone and hires me or i got recommended by someone for something else john hollenbeck rez abbasi rudresh mahanthappathat was a chain that happened for me one year which was nice to experience i think dave douglas was tracking me for a little while from afar before hitting me up for his group” the affiliation with berne actually has a longer genesis “i corresponded with tim in 1996 when i was at eastman i wrote him and asked him for some scores but i didn’t start playing with him until 2008 when we both taught at sim one summer we had a rehearsal with just the two of us he hired me at the end of it and we’ve played together ever since” by coincidence the origins of fiction grew out of his gigs with snakeoil “the concept began as a series of études intended to maximally stretch my abilities as a pianist and improviser and also to focus my thoughts as a composer i wanted to compose free of any concerns involving practice time for anyone other than myself” he recalls “ches became involved as a result of his playfully joining in with me on snakeoil tours while i’d practice the pieces during soundchecks we played once or twice prior to snakeoil but snakeoil is where it really took off” the smithmitchell duo is one focus of the pianist’s threeday residency this month at ibeam brooklyn featured will be three duo sets with smith plus three sets by an extended ensemble called normal remarkable persons performing all mitchell compositions the other bandmembers are berne trumpeter shane endsley tenor saxophonist travis laplante tyshawn sorey on drums trombone and melodica plus smith on drums vibes and percussion “the sextet was a quintet until i decided to add ches as a member” mitchell elucidates “we’ve done a couple of gigs before but this will be the first concentrated run we’ve done i’ll be writing a new piece for it since with that band i like to explore longer more sprawling forms” mitchell would also like to find time to record normal remarkable persons however he expects that his next cd release will feature the quartet with speed weiss and tordini all of whom with the exception of mitchell live in brooklyn as for his overall concept for the future the pianist states “i definitely will continue exploring the areas of music that i documented on fiction as i feel there’s a lot more to be discovered but by no means will it be my only focus basically i like to try and follow ideas to what seems like some sort of logical fruition and how this happens usually depends on the groups i play with” v louis moholomoholo unit “for the blue notes” ogcd 042electrifying live performance from the 2012 aperitivo in concerto series in milan with pianist

jazz cubacom  18889655647 toll free o n t he co ver photo by richard termine bill charlap musical destiny by ken dryden it’s hard for bill charlap to imagine becoming anything other than a jazz pianist the son of the late broadway composer moose charlap and vocalist sandy stewart is recognized as one of the top interpreters of the great american songbook charlap credits his parents with giving him strong musical roots explaining “i don’t ever remember a time when i didn’t play piano i tried to imitate what my father was doing he had great energy and was very dynamic he wasn’t a pianist or singer he was a songwriter and a great theater writer his playing was so infectious that other composers asked him to do backer auditions of their songs for them” the pianist is influenced by his mother too “sandy is a great singer i’ve always heard her turn a phrase in my inner ear i hear certain things that she does musically she sang with benny goodman in the ‘60s we’ve made records for ghostlight and blue note we performed together for years at the algonquin and feinstein’s she’ll join us at the y a child hears his mother ’s voice and it must do something psychically but neither parent was a jazz musician so a kid has to find his own way” his early musical education included studies with dick hyman who has remained an important mentor “dick is a distant cousin on my father ’s side my mother sent me to his home when i was in my early teens he knew my mom when she was very young and accompanied her at her high school graduation dick and i just played together in chicago we shared the bill dick played solo and i joined him then my trio played and dick joined me on one piano with the trio” the jazz in july series at the 92nd street y has been a high point of the pianist’s schedule for the past decade “it was hosted and curated by dick hyman for 20 years when he decided to give it up he recommended me i love the venue it was gerry mulligan’s favorite concert hall in new york and the first place i played with him” this year’s series includes tributes to hoagy carmichael leonard bernstein miles davis sarah vaughan and fred astaire plus a three piano concert with dick hyman and christian sands in honor of marian mc partland charlap’s introduction to gerry mulligan led to his first appearance on a recording the saxophonist’s lonesome boulevard “i had admired bill mays for some time we became friends when i was in my 20s i’d gone to hear him a lot and he’d heard me play he was leaving gerry mulligan and recommended me i played with gerry and he hired me i was so young i wish i could play with him now there were so many things going on that were musically over my head but it was seeping in too the way that gerry would play a melody just sing the song like a singer brubeck said something fantastic about gerry ‘he sounds like he’s playing the past the present and the future all at the same time’ gerry had a very unique melodic gift his improvisations were informed by lester young some charlie parker harmony and plenty of gerry’s own stamp on it too the baritone sax never sounded like that two things that caught my ear was gerry’s arrangement of ‘godchild’ for miles followed by gerry’s ‘ontet’ featuring his tentet with gerry playing the shout figure from ‘godchild’ at the piano but slower so you could hear the inner voicings i knew then i was really hearing a different kind of pianist when i played with gerry i asked him to show me some of the things that he was doing and he even wrote out ‘godchild’ for me that was a great break for me” charlap was friends with saxophonist jon gordon in high school he recalled “we both idolized phil woods because he was such a virtuoso when he played we’d go hear him” not long after leaving mulligan charlap joined phil woods’ quintet and stayed 15 years “i was younger than the other guys in phil’s group so it was a trial by fire phil would just eat up the music i didn’t know what he was going to call from night to night you need different sets of tools to play that music we weren’t getting a second chance with phil in the studio it’s one take he has the highest work ethic the guys in the band brian lynch steve gilmore and bill goodwin were so unpretentious— they were serious about the music but having some laughs when we weren’t playing” charlap has enjoyed the opportunity to play a few solo concerts yet he has almost as much freedom playing in his longtime trio with the unrelated washingtons “we’ve been together for 18 years and have so much music that the sets change from what we planned it’s nice to have that chemistry” he had recorded several cds for criss cross jazz but wanted to make a change “i wanted to get a rhythm section that felt the way that peter washington and kenny washington sounded together because i already knew their playing individually and together i loved the way they sounded on their many records as a rhythm section i thought ‘why not get them’ they were available and there was chemistry right away it was one of those magical moments when you’re listening to and playing with someone that we looked at each other and thought ‘this is really nice’ i asked them a few days later if they would like to do some gigs i wasn’t playing at the vanguard or the 92nd st y then i was playing places that weren’t on the same tier peter and kenny were already working with dizzy milt jackson and tommy flanagan one thing led to another after we started working together we got some good notices and ended up recording quite a few more” in recent years bill has played numerous duo concerts with his wife renee rosnes recently they played in phoenix san diego and at the healdsburg festival where bobby hutcherson guested with them their duo cd double portrait blue note drew critical acclaim and a followup will eventually take place charlap explained that piano duos take some work noting “two pianos can be difficult if you don’t have simpatico the idea to me is not to be competitive it’s about making the whole greater than its parts whether it’s a pianist horn player bass and drums it should be something that you communicate together it doesn’t have to be one person’s concept that everyone else comes along with it should be a combination there’s always been a natural chemistry with me and reneeyou can’t make it happen it does or doesn’t it’s the ability to listen and not clutter the palette you naturally orchestrate with each other renee has exquisite taste style and command but her ear is unlike anyone’s i’ve ever encountered if you drop the needle on any record she instantaneously knows every note she’s hearing it sounds impossible but it’s not she’s almost incapable of playing something that’s going to clash we have ways of continuing each other ’s thoughts” when asked about which jazz musicians influenced him charlap immediately joked “this is going to be a very long list and not comprehensive dick hyman hank jones tommy flanagan cedar walton sonny clark bill evans oscar peterson george shearing wynton kelly and red garland it’s our peers too the people we grow up hearing play also influence us not just pianists i’ve learned a lot from kenny washington and peter washington over the years also from renee naturally everything from armstrong to bird to coltrane wayne shorter dizzy roy eldridge miles monk the arranging of johnny mandel gil evans and duke ellington jimmie lunceford earl hines and james p johnson i listen to classical music too the biggest challenge for me was getting good my first gig was in my teens playing at the first amendment improvisation company in new york it was a comedy troupe that would take suggestions from the audience and invent skits on them i would play solo piano as people filed in and out i could play anything i wanted from scott joplin to cecil taylor working with the troupe was like being a pianist in a silent movie i would underscore whatever was going on onstage” charlap had other ways to expand his knowledge “i would take any gig and do it as well as i could if i was working with a singer who had many tunes i didn’t know i tried to find original sheet music and listen to as many recordings as possible to be overprepared for anything now i don’t have time to do anything but prepare just enough i know how to get where i need to quickly just from experience i wondered what records of ‘body and soul’ coleman hawkins and benny goodman heard and try to find out their reference points i think it’s a key in deepening your craft you see the

approach to just about everything—music cooking teaching coaching ball games—is to improvise with the sounds words ideas and actions in the moment “i like creating environments where things can happen that are unpredictable that involve everybody’s real energy” he explains to the jazz world inspired playing and expansive compositions are lande’s tour de force but to lande himself music is just one of the many mediums that he uses to interact with others “music is more of a language for me” he explains “i’m not so intrigued with music on its own but as a means of sharing communicating and creating energy” even so lande’s music credentials are impressive he’s got more than 45 albums to his name as a soloist ensemble player composer producer or any combination of these he’s worked with a multitude of allstar instrumentalists and headlining singers and in 1987 he received a grammy nomination for his solo album hardball great american music hall records the same year he received the grammy nomination lande settled in boulder colorado after almost 20 years of playing and teaching musicians don’t gravitate to boulder the way they do to los angeles or new york but lande isn’t looking for the mainstream he knew early on that he wasn’t the performer type “i’m not out touring all the time with strangers for money and recognition” he reveals “that’s not the way my life works” what does work is trusting himself the musicians and the audience—wherever he is—to create the music that needs to be played in that time and that space on that day this kind of musicmaking requires more than just spontaneity and solid chops lande says that over time he’s learned tobecome less imposing more relaxed and more receptive physically and emotionally so that the audience and musicians’ “responses are more authentic deeper more spacious everybody has their say and contributes to the whole” because the music arises organically out of an immediate collective need every performance is a success whether it’s in a living room or a studio or a concert space “every time i play…i say that was the best music i ever played in my life” lande avows lande’s approach to performance is not without process he writes structured pieces for specific performances and he typically performs with highly skilled players whose styles he knows well to prepare for a gig the band will rehearse but not too much “we need to know enough to be able to create something but not so much that we become glib” he says “it’s about knowing just enough to get into trouble” and if one of the players shows up with a new idea or something happens in real time to change the course of the gig that’s fine too lande can’t predict what he himself might do he will carry a book of poems with him on stage and open to a random page during a performance for instance and “by magic” he’ll find a poem to read that exactly matches the aesthetic of the music or perhaps the band will pause in the middle of a tune and wait—one two three minutes—before resuming the performance lande doesn’t leave the audience out of the musical collaboration however from the stage he’ll actively invite them to participate in creating the shared experience it’s okay he says if the resultant sounds are weird or boring the point is to leave space for the exceptional to happen people “yearn for this kind of interaction” lande asserts “they’re ready to meet something fresh and authentic” lande’s ability to create safe spaces for collaboration factors prominently in his work with students he first began teaching almost 40 years ago and since then he’s been affiliated with several learning institutions such as the cornish institute in seattle jazz school of migros klubschule in st gallen switzerland naropa institute in boulder and presently the university of colorado boulder to name only a few aside from coaching students in the technical aspects of jazz lande “sponsor s the energyof the young ones” to help them bring clarity receptiveness and honesty to their musical expression in young musicians today he sees similarities to himself as an upandcoming instrumentalist in the ‘60s “they’re communal—they want to participate” he observes lande does too when he plays “it feels like we’re all doing something together” he says and no matter what happens it’s as it should be there’s a beauty to that v ellis in 1962 he began his tenure with charles mingus where his wideranging pianistic style flourished byard’s own recordings as a leader beginning with 1961’s here’s jaki revealed him to be a more than capable frontman and composer heading a trio of bassist ron carter and drummer roy haynes on a program of five diverse originals and reinventions of coltrane’s “giant steps” and the gershwins’ “it ain’t necessarily so” subsequent dates as a sideman with rivers rahsaan roland kirk and booker ervin showed that his eclectic stylings could enhance the music in a variety of settings—from texas tenor blues to modal freebop his own series of recordings as a bandleader and multiinstrumentalist doubling on saxophones vibes and drums featuring the likes of kirk joe farrell and elvin jones received broad critical acclaim but did little to gain him bookings for the groups beginning in the ‘70s byard worked primarily as a soloist either alone or with bassist major holley with whom he regularly held forth every sunday at bradley’s for most of 197475 the recently released three volumes of solo piano dates on high note recorded at the keystone korner during the decade show off the pianist’s far reaching style to great effect as does the superb 1982 duo date with tommy flanagan the magic of 2 live at keystone korner resonance during the ‘80s the pianist also led his own big band the apollo stompers basically a pair of rehearsal groups comprised of firstcall journeymenplayers in new york and students from his new england conservatory classes in boston byard’s legacy as an educator is perhaps as important as his work as a pianist having nurtured a large number of today’s finest players flutist jamie baum who leads the group yard byard a byard repertory group made up of the pianist’s former students notes “jaki never put different styles of music into categorical boxes he had a deep understanding of the jazz tradition as well as of classical music and any other style that he found interesting and could incorporate them into his solos and compositions in a way that was personal convincing and authentic” byard’s work as a composer continues to gain attention having

make believe rag by jon weber so i’m playing “the maple leaf rag” on this ancientpiano at a minsk belarus coffee house valiantly focusing upon every note every riveting pulse deserving my laserlike concentration i revere “the maple leaf rag” and consider it the most important american composition of all time because it paved the way for so much music that i love scott joplin’s twominute masterpiece was the first instrumental composition to sell one million copies of sheet music an older belorussian guy recognizes it smiles and barks out “the make believe rag” close enough seriously how many 1899 compositions survive that fickle journey from the year 1899 all the way into our collective musical consciousness in the year 2014 quoting stephen sondheim “damn few” if you consider what american popular music sounded like at the turn of the 20th century “the maple leaf rag” truly represented a new era artistically and socially american original music sounded a lot like scottish and german folk songs—europe jr until scott joplin’s great american wakeup call blindsided the music industry of its day in 1899 this eversoslightly africanized treatment of familiar european folk music lured millions of consumers to sheet music stores where people of modest means forked over their hardearned cash in exchange for a chance to navigate joplin’s ragged syncopated creations i am astonished that any piece as technically challenging as “the maple leaf rag” and the thousands that would follow would become blockbuster sellers conventional wisdom would suggest that “simpler is more sellable” yet pianists at all skill levels sought out the more intricate rags apparently having outgrown the ordinary they must’ve been so eager to raise the bar and perform the new magical parlor trick—over and over the ragtime craze achieved the early 1900s equivalent of viral american creativity began taking a more respected place on the world stage even claude debussy started composing joplinesque works europeans were beginning to imitate us where did this enormously popular and extremely radical sound come from by 1899 africans had lived on this continent for three centuries why did it take so long for their music to surface simple answer they were slaves deprived of freedom and any chance to express themselves artistically andor actively participate in mainstream american culture in 1899 few white americans had any clue what african american music sounded like there was simply no exposure to it and no commercial mechanism in place to provide it for mass consumption “the maple leaf rag” launched us into the uncharted artistic waters of genuine american music occasional glimpses of africanamerican music awareness would emerge for a white audience but would quickly disappear in 1842 charles dickens attended a performance by juba at the bowery amphitheatre juba is generally regarded as the pioneering figure for american tap dance and his accompanying trio consisted of a trumpeter violinist and drummer one reviewer wrote “the drummer sweats profusely and plays contrary to all laws of rhythm” wow i want to hear that “the corpulent trumpeter plays redhot needles of sound” i definitely want to hear that eight decades later louis armstrong would lead his groundbreaking jazz ensembles the “hot five” and “hot seven” perhaps he read juba’s reviews clearly in 1842 white mainstream americans still considered africanamerican music threatening and indecipherable but by 1899 african influence finally found a welcome entry via ragtime maybe a general optimism drove everyday americans toward reaching for something better smarter more enlightened…at the dawn of the 20th century joplin’s millionsselling compositions probably attracted a lot of folks into the music business who may not have otherwise paid attention to the fledgling industry enormous amounts of cash quickly seduced cold steely business sharks who didn’t care as much about the art as they did about the profitability of the hot sellers there’s a joker in every deck isn’t there for better or worse thanks to alliances holy and unholy the money flowed the floodgates rushed open andcreativity for creativity’s sake often ruled the day over the past 11 decades whom do i specifically thank i am grateful to the millions of people who found africanized european music irresistible 115 years ago and even more grateful to the adventurous geniuses who created something seemingly out of nowhere their impact upon american culture is incalculable i couldn’t repay them in

sound of the voice on cell phones” jonathan horwich the man behind international phonograph inc ipi makes no bones about his likes or dislikes directness seems integral to his character and the strength of his opinions serves as a foil for the boundless enthusiasm with which he approaches every aspect of his life’s passion which is music upon reconsideration music is only a part of what motivates horwich to such heights of excitement the way the music sounds is absolutely paramount in his vision of how it should be understood and the sonic fidelity of his reissues is just as much a part of the whole experience as the visual presentation the combination sets ipi apart from the countless labels of varying repute devoted to reintroducing neglected or longunavailable items into the catalogue and hopefully to a larger public “it was very simple” horwich smiles when asked about the name of his label “i started it back in 1981 in the days when we were issuing everything on vinyl” the label released one title at that time rendezvous by pianist richie beirach and bassist george mraz but the story leading to that pivotal moment is as rich with discovery as is the music the label preserves “i remember listening to lots of elvis and rhythm and blues on the radio in the ‘50s just after my family moved to chicago” muses horwich “but it wasn’tuntil i was just about to go to college that the epiphany came” his sister brought him a copy of herbie mann’s nowubiquitous at the village gate album and he was thunderstruck “what’s this what have i been missing” his voice rises the words quickening with anticipation as he describes hearing charles mingus’ tijuana moods and then jeremy steig’s flute fever released on columbia in 1963 and which horwich has just reissued “then i really started to get it what an absolutely burnin’ record” one of those lucky situations that can determine life’s entire aftercourse occurred for horwich at occidental college where pursuing an english literature degree he met john william hardy ornithologist down beat columnist and horwich maintains one of the finest liner notes writers the music has ever had “he started mentoring me i’d go to his house and he’d be showing me how to listen to this music ‘listen to that moment how that group is interacting how the rhythm section is playing as a single unit hear how they’re avoiding clichés’” after a year or so the two founded revelation records to record underserved musicians in the l a area their most readily available work constitutes the bobby bradford and john carter collaborations reissued by mosaic in their select series but the catalogue became fairly large reaching to about 50 records piano studies with clare fischer and alto lessons with gary foster augmented horwich’s knowledge and experience with the music and he learned the fundamentals of recording and mastering on the job while revelation is still under horwich’s controldogon a d julius hemphill intents and purposes bill dixon extension clare fischer orchestrahe began ipi in 1981 with engineering maverick dean roumanis as both hardy and roumanis are deceased horwich has kept the home fires burning “when i came back to chicago after 40 years out in california and michael cuscuna asked me to mix master and produce the bradfordcarter set i started looking around for other music that i felt should be given a second chance that’s why i reactivated ipi it seemed to be a way for me to get back into the music” he began with bill dixon’s 1967 album intents and purposes which had never been available on cd and was in production at the time of dixon’s 2010 passing “i told him that i was going to reissue the album just as it was complete with original artwork and liners but with improved sound” horwich reminisces “and he was thrilled that was just how he wanted it” even for those of us who had long treasured the excellently recorded rca lp ipi’s transfer proved revelatory boasting what might be described as a fuller more open but incredibly detailed and still highly visceral sound julius hemphill’s dogon a d ipi’s second project garnered similar praise and its popularity necessitated multiple printings “we go back to the masters” horwich explains “and we transfer direct to digital nothing in between we’ve also developed a proprietary method of making the digital copy sound as full as possible” the level of reproduction is readily apparent on clare fischer ’s extension an album for which horwich clearly maintains a special affection “it’s his masterpiece” he states

parker  fred frith n estledamong the hills and dairy farms of central quebec the good news is that the offthebeatentrack town of victoriaville remains a prime showcase for a broad selection of improvised and experimental music it once produced furniture and hockey sticks but once again fans gathered for the 30th edition of the festival international de musique actuelle de victoriaville fimav the 20 concerts may 15th18th constituted a crosssection with nothing terribly extreme or outlandish of what makes this a happening scene it reflects the scope and ambiguity of the french word “actuelle”—coined at the first group of concerts held in an automobile showroom in 1983 to mean new immediate and spontaneous with almost 5000 tickets sold over four days and an estimated 10000 visitors to eight free outdoor musical installations artistic director michel levasseur said he was satisfied with matching last year ’s gate especially lacking the star power of that edition’s zorn  60 marathon this year ’s lineup amounted to something of a retrospective in that its highest profile performers saxophonist evan parker and electric guitarist fred frith have had everything to do with opening new vistas for improvised music over the past 30 years parker 70 and frith 65 playing together as a duo for only the third time did what great improvisers do so well—they created something from nothing but their instinct experience and the vibe from an expectant crowd sitting around tables in the town coliseum its walls draped in black and decorated by new abstract art parker roamed and explored mainly on tenor sax crafting long complex lines enabled by his remarkable circular breathing and curiosity frith sounded more adventurous and dramatic using his guitar as a rhythmic and percussive device with his instrument sitting on his knees as often as on his hip parker and frith reappeared sunday each leading larger ensembles the former ’s electroacoustic septet —peter evans trumpet okkyung lee cello ned rothenberg clarinets and ikue mori sam pluta george lewis electronics—kicked off the 50minute opener with junglelike sounds and silences building into a big orchestral creation lee in particular impressed with her passionate and idearich bursts at times injecting drama and passion when it was needed frith’s 11member gravity band—a mix of former students such as crackerjack guitarist ava mendoza and bay area musicians aaron novik clarinet and william winant percussion—reprised frith’s 1980 dance album with its joyful celtic slavic and “dancing in the streets”

north of düsseldorf did not take place in what had been claimed to be the largest circus tent in all of europe a longterm investment in the festival was made in the form of repurposing an old tennis hall and if some of the sense of spectacle was missing the sound and sightlines were better and actual bathroom facilities must have been a welcome change from years past what didn’t change was an eclectic program of 20 concerts plus latenight performers across the festival’s four days jun 6th9th full of ambitious projects of varying degrees of success and full audiences whose attention spans were remarkable across widely disparate ensembles one surprisingly enjoyable portion were the morning sessions taking place at the musikschule moers improvising groups with personnel drawn from festival acts and some musicians brought in specifically for the sessions played thoughtful and committed short sets to eager audiences the antithesis of the typically dreaded latenight jams put on by most festivals guitarist marc ribot’s solo acoustic set on friday dubbed “protest songs” was less folksy sitin and more lofi punk show the songs were pithy mostly originals about topics like security in airports the physical breakdown of aging a diatribe against santa claus minorkey reworking of the traditional song “the dying cowboy” and a pairing of dylan’s “masters of war” and ribot’s original “masters of the internet” ribot’s charm and intellect subsumed in larger groups was on full display another highlight of the evening was the marchnovember dutch pairing of pianist oscar jan hoogland and drummer han bennink the latter has lots of experience in this format and could have easily dominated the proceedings with his signature histrionics but hoogland countered with both strong unfettered playing and his own hijinks which included toy megaphones placed on bennink’s various drumtops and a homemade electrified clavichord at 72 one can marvel at bennink’s energy but the focus should instead be that no matter what he is doing even dropping sticks he does so with perfect swing the indefatigable paal nilssenlove opened the second day with his large unit it was fascinating to see the drummer both as one of the oldest members of his ensemble and as de facto conductor of the zealous hourlong set the 11piece band which had a fiveman horn line including the tuba of børre mølstad electronics courtesy of lasse marhaug and two basses and a second drummer played three pieces which were themselves made up of several compositions like a mathematician nilssenlove charted

danmark diva danish international visiting artists programme residency in copenhagen and one could sense his playing has grown exponentially with new collaborations his piano trio featured one of the festival revelations and perhaps the youngest 20something drummer matias wolf andreasen who seamlessly shifted jazz and rock tempos though straightahead piano trios were in the minority thomas clausen one of denmark’s most valued in the bill evans tradition made up for it with an exquisite rendition of “bye bye blackbird” with osgood who played in 19 groups total and a rarely subdued highly melodic blake elsewhere the bassist literally shook the stage with his inimitable rhythmic force and synced wordless vocals he performed solo fronted a group with five danish bassists and played in trumpeter

orrin evans has an attitude in his playing whether hammering dense twofisted chords or stroking a delicate ballad it seems fitting therefore that he would choose to record with a 20something piece big band when almost no one else can afford to do it in 2010 evans’ captain black big band cbbb named after his father ’s choice of tobacco recorded a series of live tracks selected from the tail end of a tour at chris’ jazz cafe in philadelphia and new york city’s the jazz gallery released as a selftitled album though the audio fidelity was a bit underwhelming it captured evans’ vision—seesawing intensity between peaks of aggression and valleys of soulfulness on their first studio recording cbbb picks up right where it left off recruiting new york city staples like saxophonists marcus strickland and stacy dillard along with trombonist david gibson and trumpeter tatum greenblatt and the leader penning six of the nine songs with arrangement credits to other artists the album opens with the aptly titled “in my soul” never straying far from its rhapsodic melody which swells and twists between brass and wind sections reminiscent of a great thad jonesmel lewis jazz orchestra piece strickland is effusively lyrical and soars over stabbing horns on “dita for karyn warren” bass clarinets muted brass and flutes color the edges of alto saxophonist todd bashore’s tearful meandering and evans’ exceedingly delicate twinkling two choice covers add to the album’s dynamism the elusive wriggling lines of drummer donald edwards’ “tickle” seems playful at first until riled up by dillard and evans’ steely riffing turning into a show of blazing brass bassist eric revis’ “maestra” gets a nice workout too the band building around a hip bass ostinato while horns inject swelling question marks evans’ closing “prayer for columbine” is a tough tune to pin down its power is largely derived from drummer anwar marshall whose subtle dynamism controls the purposeful shift between dense

blues” and chestnut knows the blues thoroughly he plays them on “bags’ groove” like he owns them he brings a similar ‘livedit’ emotion to ballads imbuing “to be determined” and “i wanted to say” with compassion and lyricism the feelings deepen on a scintillating version of “chelsea bridge” chestnut immediately doubles down on strayhorn with “u m m g” which begins as a lullaby and accelerates into one of his typically joyous and nimble romps this sets up the album’s defining moment a blistering version of “giant steps” which segues ingeniously with orchestral flourishes and drama into another coltrane classic “central park west” lewis is a rhythmic whirlwind on uptempo tunes and wistfully softvoiced on ballads lundy who likely absorbed some of the same enduring lessons and tongue lashings from carter that chestnut did keeps a steady pulse in paraphrasing one of the many valuable lessons betty carter taught him chestnut once said “if i’m gonna win people over i gotta do it with skill”

simply a musician hersch uses his life as material for his music thus giving his albums and concerts the feeling of some great project he’s a special musician in a totally unselfish way hersch lives life as a theater piece as an act of performance art so even as his music can be categorized as jazz—he covers standards and uses swing and afro cuban rhythms in original material with the occasional ballad—he bares himself so generously in his music typically composing for multiple idioms and formats beyond jazz that it’s sophisticated orchestral emotional and ultimately pristine hersch plays with a beautiful touch and a rare broadranging gift for melody but also a unique forward motion hersch’s 2011 theater piece my coma dreams documented his months lost to a coma wherein among other things he dreamt of being in a contest with a laughing thelonious monk swung like mad and featured the pianist and his trio onstage as the action occurred around them floating is pure music but the sense of theater is just as deep opening with “you and the night and the music” hersch improvises on the standard in an incredible practically throughcomposed solo touching on monk brahms and perhaps a little james p johnson he continually changes focus finding new ways to express the melody drummer eric mc pherson has never sounded so creative and bassist john hébert remains the pianist’s longstanding anchor the title track begins as a nocturnal almost nightmarish vision then as depicted in the cd artwork darts as lightly as fireflies over a starlit lake there is a song written for esperanza spalding “arcata” for hébert “home fries” for pianist kevin hays “autumn waltz” a teasing cover of monk’s “let’s cool one” and a stately cover of “if ever i would leave you” from camelot

douglasuri caine greenleaf music by stuart broomer trumpeter dave douglas has always had a gift for clarity his ideas thoughtfully and directly expressed without fuss and extra notes that clarity achieves new dimension here in part because it’s a duo with a longtime collaborator pianist uri caine the two forming a barebones ensemble of very precise musicians further though it’s an exploration of the shapenote singing tradition embodied in various collections of american hymns shapenote notation is a reductive system inwhich note shapes take the place of information usually found in key signatures simplifying sightreading and harmony for congregational singing five of the pieces heard here are drawn from shapenote songbooks like the sacred harp ye olde newengland psalmtunes and the southern harmony and musical companion collections still in use today the other five are compositions by douglas in the same spirit along with the frequent simplicity of the diatonic melodies and triadic harmonies there comes a clear evocation of mood from the determination evident in a m cagle’s “soar away” or floyd m frederick’s “supplication” the former ’s “present joys” is absolutely celebratory its declarative major scale melody taking on suggestions of albert ayler ’s “ghosts” in douglas and caine’s handling of it oliver holden’s “confidence” is more pensive while douglas’ own compositions extend the materials further “seven seas” takes an exploratory bent “end to end” is a comic series of climaxes and “old putt” played solo by caine develops a special floating beauty through subtle harmonies it’s all played beautifully douglas and caine improvising with a handinglove familiarity reminiscent of earlier forays into folk music by musicians like jimmy giuffre john

music composed in 2003 which receives its long overdue documentation an eightpart suite inspired by james thurber ’s 1939 book the nuanced performance highlights the writing and playing of pianist diane moser structuring her antiwar musical fable so that the brutal noises of combat and bucolic intimations of love peace and flowers are present moser never overplays the programmatic concept ensuring that the suite makes its point through hearty helpings of advanced yet swinging jazz following a cacophonous freeforall introduction the dynamic theme is first exposed reappearing in diverse guises throughout the suite the invigorating work of fleet trombonist ben williams is impressive on the moving “…love is reborn…” for instance when a polyphonic theme variation arrives his balanced tongue flutters incite a staccato response which soon includes sharp boppish lines from marty ehrlich’s alto saxophone while rhythmic connections bubble underneath via moser bassist mark dresser and drummer gerry hemingway strummed bass percussiveness and measured drum clipclops are put to good use when the writingcalls for bellicose emphasis moser ’s sophisticated composing includes space to reflect violence with sequences of tremolo emphasis but tranquility is expressed with the same facility tracks such as “…when love is no longer…” and “…she finds a flower…” are the most moving moser ’s richly textured syncopation almost making one feel the childlike despondency with the first and subsequent joy in germinating floral discovery in the second “…a hope for peace…” connects earlier narrative variations with harmonized horn parts presaging moser ’s cunning note placement and dresser ’s moderated plucks to create a sense of normalcy this cheerful concept is reinforced with a

gottschalk i remember bessie art hodes euphonicdelmarkthe art tatum solo masterpieces vol 1 ojc art tatum pabloconcordby stuart broomermusic is often described as music of communication and interaction rather than a study in contrasts and combativeness that being said some of the most engaging improvised music has presented images of the latter approaches for instance the peter brötzmann trio with drummer han bennink and pianist fred van hove through cultivating a language of discursive layered introspection and elemental concision van hove occupied a space opposite both the brusque expressionism of brötzmann and the subversive aggression of bennink spanning 45 years and numerous albums as a soloist and collaborator van hove’s work is not discussed nearly as much as those of his fellow european architects perhaps it is the kinship of geographical obscurity that unites van hove and taiwanese pianist shihyang lee one of taiwan’s most celebrated instrumentalists on the cddvd set galactic alignment recorded at zhongshan hall in taipei city in december 2012 after all neither belgium nor taiwan are discussed as hotbeds of creative music the set features two solos each of about 15 minutes and whetting the appetite for nearly 40 minutes of duo improvisation lids off the pianists begin arranging their implements itself a musical act for the terse and snaky game of pingpong “games inside wooden frames” sonically they blend massive latticework yet on film the piece is clearly an inspired balancing act of cocreation at times the pair reflect one another spinning pointillist rivulets against a gutsy metallic pulse or fabricating a resonant field of color and sinew the romanticism and chunky boppishness lee exhibits in his soli are subsumed to a degree in the duets though in “counterpoint” a bit of graduallypaced off minor rhythm emerges and van hove offers monkish gymnopedies in return while the number of improvised piano duos isn’t exactly huge galactic alignment is a beautiful edition to the pantheon burns longer is an altogether different and rougher beast recorded in 2008 at l’archiduc in brussels the three improvisations feature van hove on piano and accordion in a trio with belgian bassist peter jacquemyn and american bassist damon smith on whose balance point acoustics label this digital album was released a rush of bullish arco fiddling bridge grinding and spiky pizzicato begins the first lengthy piece and it’s as though van hove is the harmonic referee responding to and guiding their rosined force with glassine arpeggios and a bony minefield of chords it’s odd to think about but apart from the heady early years of european free music the pianist hasn’t worked with that many bassists in this sense burns longer looks to van hove’s early outfits albeit the way this music coagulates and refracts is certainly not only a reflection of the ‘60s and its lean and hungry trademarks the closing “archiduc 3” beginning with manhandled accordion and a bulwark of churning glissandi and ropy staccato is controlled enough not to be bogged by absurdity and once van hove switches to piano the trio engenders a sprightly sense of forward motionremarkable that solo performance—which has become such a significant part of alexander von schlippenbach’s work over the last decade—had barely been a part of his repertoire for decades before in 1972 having released two large ensemble albums the pianist recorded the tracks that would be released by enja as payan later that year five years later he issued the simplytitled piano solo on fmp neither album garnered the attention paid to his powerful global unity orchestra guo and both fell to the wayside the latter did see a reissue on fmp in 2009 after he’d begun releasing solo recordings again and now the former itself is seeing itself on cd by its original label payan is something of a tour de force recorded when the pianist was 33 years old the ten tracks on the album some of which would later be arranged for guo read a bit like a cv opening with a brief track that isn’t only in name a fugue the program goes on to include some fantastically full stride playing some allout free exploration bits of doubletracked drums and some wonderfully lyrical passages it almost tries too hard but only almost it ends up a bit disjointed but is saved by the sheer excellence of the performance it may be von schlippenbach’s work with guo that brought him to the attention of norway’s 15piece kitchen orchestra the freewheeling orchestra has worked with lotte anker steve beresford evan parker keith tippett and franz hautzinger as well as presenting a live soundtrack for the classic silent vampire film nosferatu providing musical accompaniment to volleyball games and giving annual christmas concerts the ensemble is neither inflexible nor humorless the orchestra has been working under von schlippenbach’s baton on and off since 2010 a relationship that has resulted in the orchestra’s first release and in fact the second track on kitchen orchestra with alexander von schlippenbach is titled “globe unity 40” so there’s no confusion about where they’re coming from but that hardly sums it up with electric guitar electronics a fender rhodes and the talented vocalist stine janvin motland the disc covers an awful lot of ground the disc opens with a bit of ceremony but quickly launches headlong into the guo tribute which swings between free energy and composed sections sounding a bit like a swingle singer lost in the forest they reshape that formula in any number of ways across the nine tracks jiggering between and overlaying structure and spontaneity in surprising ways with plenty of schlippenbach’s piano both muscular and sublime a rhodes solo by øyvind dale seems broken and laid over a nonmatching horns and drums other sections sound like film scores or brassy funk but generally get the rug pulled out from under them before too long and if that’s not enough the disc ramps up with a fairly massive take on eric dolphy’s “hat and beard” and quickly morphing rendition of monk’s “let’s cool one” with this enjoyable set of germannorwegian unity von schlippenbach shows that—at 74—he’s still not beholden to any borders arts hodes and tatum were both born in the first decade of the 20th century though hodes was born in the ukraine and tatum in toledo ohio both came of age in the midwest in the ‘20s despite those similarities these two solo reissues might represent the poles of jazz piano from hodes’ deceptively simple approach focused on emotional depth to tatum’s flamboyant invention and jawdropping technique growing up in chicago art hodes was saturated in blues and new orleans jazz and soon became a vital part of the swiftly evolving chicago school despite hodes’ prominence as a spokesperson for traditional jazz in the ‘40s his playing is vigorous and artful in a way that will confuse anybody expecting a primitive he’s an inventive twohanded improviser but his technique has a special focus using a legato phrasing that can blur one note into the next creating an almost vocal effect akin to the best blues pianists on i remember bessie recorded in 1976 he pays tribute to bessie smith the greatest of the ‘20s blues singers and one whose repertoire and influence extended beyond blues to include popular tunes ragtime and jazz novelties divested of their lyrics in hodes’ hands these pieces achieve a kind of timelessness whether it’s w c handy’s “st louis blues” a blues with a tango in the middle or irving berlin’s “alexander ’s ragtime band” here heard as ragtime restored with pristine clarity though it lacks smith’s own moving account of a flood her own “back water blues” retains its force through hodes’ consistent rhythmic drive changing dynamics and percussive accents while clarence williams’ “cake walkin’ babies from home” has all its original strutting energy in his notes to the hodes disc bill mitchell lists hodes’ favorite artists smith ma rainey and louis armstrong mentions art tatum as someone hodes listened to then quotes hodes’ remark “sometimes tatum goes into a few bars of swinging fats waller stuff but then he suddenly goes into his act” that “act” is precisely what distinguishes the two where hodes clarifies and embellishes a tune tatum tickles dissects reharmonizes interrupts and overwhelms it the solo masterpieces which run to eight cds were recorded in four sessions between 1953 and 1955 a year before tatum’s death with volume 1 drawn from all four sessions it’s immediately apparent why tatum has always been treated as a titan of the keyboard awing jazz and classical pianists alike he combined the harlem stride style of james p johnson and waller and the trumpetlike leads of earl hines with an unbridled technical brilliance and insouciant creativity which extended to cascading runs sudden digressions and counterpoint all of it delivered with a carefree lilt he influenced both the best and worst pianists in jazz and his harmonic and rhythmic imagination were central to the development of bop with charlie parker profoundly inspired by his chordal extensions any of the 16 tunes here will reveal tatum’s genius but cole porter ’s usually poignant “love for sale” might stand out for its welter of mood shifts sudden eruptions of stride

with bassist chuck israels whose playing brought new emphasis on a swinging pulse to the band the two riverside sessions alternated ballads and faster tempos but the two lps it produced divided them into a ballads album moonbeams and how my heart sings featuring faster tempos of what evans calls in his original liner notes “a more moving kind though there is in the trio’s approach to all material a desire to present a singing sound” those who cherish the evans of george russell’s “all about rosie” or his work on oliver nelson’s blues and the abstract truth will thoroughly enjoy this album which abounds in keen penetrating even humorously clever creative moments from a “summertime” abandoning its lullaby roots for a buoyant shuffle an “i should care” displaying the impressionistic harmonies evans pioneered at a more scintillating than usual tempo a title tune that “sings” in alternating 34 and 44 and an original “showtype tune” gently tweaking and parodying the histrionic

material with flowing and volatile improvisation and the result is impeccable reichman is prominent on“novemberdoodle” his lonely melodic lines assuming new shapes as the band fills out the unraveling harmony and subtle counterpoint rainey doubles on xylophone—at times it sounds more like marimba— and adds still more textural elements halvorson’s solo feature comes at the beginning of “chant” which goes on to highlight gress and davis in startling bowed unison passages the abstract lyrical interplay of piano and cello toward the end is a highlight of the set it’s on “chant” that laubrock steps forward decisively on tenor sax and she remains very present on “matrix” inviting spirited dialogue with arthurs’ breathy and unsettled trumpet reichman and halvorson have their own deep duo moment as well toward the conclusion but if there’s a centerpiece of zürich concert it’s the nearly 20minutelong “nightbus” it starts with solo piano rubato mingusian discords from the band a brief taste of the fascinating laubrockrainey duo beautifully conceived sectional counterpoint emerging in layer after layer and then a tightly grooving rainey solo that opens another new section soon noble is off with

interprets eight timeless standards each with a fresh approach ably supported by pianist bill o’connell bassist kenny davis and drummer donald edwards his expressive detour from the usual paths makes up the centerpiece to his setting of “isn’t it romantic” while o’connell’s strident intricate solo marks a veteran soloist also worthy of greater recognition stan getz may have set the standard for tenor players who tackle “yesterdays” but bowen gets points for originality with his choppy rendition arranged by o’connell which begins in the midst of the famous theme “you don’t know what love is” has always been an emotional ballad and everything comes together perfectly in this brilliant scoring by the pianist bowen’s almost vocallike solo o’connell’s thoughtful backing and superb work by davis and edwards in the background “spring is here” is full of surprising moments opening with a tense vamp a brief partial theme statement by the leader then a sudden shift to feature both o’connell

throughout his career serving a stint with count basie and becoming a part of the jazz at the philharmonic touring allstars his early years as a leader haven’t been widely documented on recordings so the discovery of this previously unissued concert of a 1947 show adds to his legacy his band at the time included his older brother russell and joe newman on trumpets the latter taking most of the solos baritone saxophonist leo parker in his only known live recording pianist sir charles thompson bassist al lucas and drummer shadow wilson the music is a blend of swing bop and a foreshadowing of rhythm and blues an enthusiastic crowd is audible throughout this concert and it seems likely that there was dancing in the aisles as well the sound is more than acceptable for a vintage live

drummer morten hæsum now augmented by four brass two woodwinds and a string quartet soukup’s tenor or soprano sax and pabst’s piano provide most of the improvisational interest the extra players

trombonistbandleader david white’s new album the band bursts forth immediately with “mister shepherd’s misadventures” saxophones wailing a theme over the brass section saxophonist sam dillon digs in for a hot solo accompanied by the pointed jabs of the rhythm section and ‘sings’ on through several choruses soon complemented by smart accents from the band those accents continue over a fiery solo by trumpeter miki hirose the end of the tune comes as a true surprise the band disappearing and the rhythm section left to riff the basic rhythm to a simple but satisfying end in one fiveminute track white has utilized the power of the full band the textures of the sections and that approach that never quite lets on exactly where it’s going white gives himself only one solo feature but it’s a beauty “persistence” is the composer has noted inspired by steve reich’s music for 18 musicians it’s a repeated rhythmic groove over which darkly pitched saxophones and then the whole band play apposite figures white’s playing is forceful and insistent and as it moves forward the orchestra comes back with more of that rich palette just before and then during the impassioned wailing of alto saxophonist andrew gould who is also featured on “the shakedown” a funky danceable 24bar composition with a perpetuum mobile feeling he’s joined by trombonist dan reitz for another potent and tothepoint solo there’s a beautiful ode in white’s “sally draper blues” a moody 12bar blues dedicated to a character on the popular tv show mad men white’s favorite the melody is attractively sinuous and insinuating with rick parker yet another trombonist taking the first solo it’s burly and raucous but perfectly in keeping with the color of this piece as a whole omar daniels on alto follows suit

particular about the caliber of their bass players so that should give an indication of pavone’s abilities but it’s his own material recorded for alacra knitting factory and playscape where one really gets to hear an exceptional bassist forwardlooking group leader and composer of great skill street songs continues that tradition pavone has always gravitated toward unusual ensembles preferring sextets and septets which gives his music a greater expanse but the big difference here is the accordion player adam matlock the impetus was pavone’s memories of growing up in connecticut among italian and portuguese neighbors where that instrument was king but the music here is anything but nostalgic it’s bristling intelligent modern jazz in the tradition of pavone’s previous albums pavone is ably assisted by frequent collaborators familiar with his aesthetic trumpeter dave ballou who also arranged two tracks pianist peter madsen who adds his characteristic mainstreammodern approach and drummer steve johns deftly maneuvering his way through the complex rhythms pavone also adds second bassist carl testa to give the music even more texture in the lower end the program consists of old and new “mythos” is repurposed for this ensemble a slightly slower tempo and the presence of accordion giving the piece a completely different flavor the newer material contains pavone’s

line peter brendler positone by tom conrad outside the line is peter brendler ’s debut as a leader it reveals him to be an authoritative bassist and a promising composer but there is bigger news here brendler has assembled a most improbable quartet the frontline is trumpeter peter evans and tenor saxophonist rich perry the former is an eclectic avant garde extremist known for lunacy and chops the latter a modern mainstream tenor player given to minimalism and subtlety it works this juxtaposition of two intriguing dissimilar sensibilities benefits both in the presence of evans perry floats free his ideas gliding across new open terrain his sense of form graceful as always but less symmetrical in the presence of perry evans is driven toward jagged cathartic lyricism on “pharmacology” perry comes out of brendler ’s twisting melody with a glancing solo like all perry solos it dances on air but it also sweeps and veers when evans enters his response to perry sounds rational but quickly derails and plunges off the edge of the song some pieces start slow as dirges but develop inner turmoil like “the darkness” and “indelible mark” within both evans spatters rarefied designs even on tunes that stay quiet and rapt like “blackout reunion” there is an underlying tension it comes from the listener ’s awareness that evans might blow the song to hell at any moment the common ground where these four minds meet is wit “walk on the wild side” is deadpan it is high entertainment to hear evans and perry have their way with lou reed’s obsessive little shufflestep busting it all up while brendler and drummer vinnie sperrazza hold the line like everything on the album it is funny and serious the full potential of this ensemble emerges on “una muy bonita” over brendler ’s dark

supple workouts on the album like the mercurial “interior motive” “new journey” and evans’ “don’t fall off the l e j” “i don’t give a damn blues” swaggers with an attitude that smirks at its circumstances and shoves them aside as a balladeer jones is peerless putting his honey smooth tonality and poignant phrasing on “morning after” smoky and sensual “we’ll meet under the stars” and lovely trumpetpiano duet “not while i’m around” the standard “how high the moon” is given a nonstandard reading playing muted jones and the quartet deconstruct the song by using a minor key and stretching it beyond its usual chordal and melodic boundaries jones’ version of jackie mc lean’s “dr jekyll” is a perfect structural and stylistic tribute to midtolate ‘60s miles davis who played the tune on his album milestones jones comes in about a third of the way through delivers jagged flurries of notes in fits and starts and doesn’t state the theme until the end “dark times” is a masterpiece a passionate sunday morning sermon the rhythm section provides the sound of a congregation’s anticipatory murmuring before jones testifies with anguished blasts of shrieking high notes temperedalternated with penitent low moaning evans picks up his thoughts and confirms their truth with exclamatory block chords leading to some good old callandresponse between trumpet and piano jones’ excellence speaks for itself but it’s the rhythm section that takes this album to the next level evans curtis and calvaire don’t merely comp behind jones to mark time before their own solos

two percussionists from the ‘90s edition of his lounge lizards billy martin and calvin weston got together to work on new material and in short order discovered that they had a viable unusual band on their hands what might have been most exciting about that new band—evidenced at the time by their sole release 1993’s men with sticks—was that it made undeniable what a great saxophonist lurie who has since retired from music and now dedicates himself to painting really was the lounge lizards was a cool band way cool they dressed sharp and played danceably eccentric music in the band’s later years

two thirds of the playing time and the fidelity makes them worthy of issue beyond mere archival purposes and the music itself is not quite like anything else it seems ritualistic animalistic maybe slightly savage but not exactly dangerous it is certainly evocative of something beyond lurie’s talents as a saxophonist composer and painter the man has a way with words the titles he gives his

johnson saxophonist ingrid laubrock violist mat maneri and drummer tomas fujiwara relates to musical not visual challenges—there’s no reason to know that mc goohan’s character was called no 6 or his nemesis no 2 to appreciate the interpretations johnson’s scope in working out his musical ideas is demonstrated on tracks named for less prominent characters “no 12 schizoid mangemini” is particularly commanding its mercurial structure as unpredictable as a schizophrenic’s moods beginning and ending with scrapping string abrasiveness and laubrock’s shrills in dogwhistle register the middle section is pastorally unthreatening as a violin cello and flute chamber piece with measured drumbeats the concluding violasaxophone callandresponse fittingly arranges the stiletto sharpness of the two into proper context “no 48 living in harmony” relies on a walking bassline to regularize what is initially a contrapuntal faceoff between harsh viola spiccato and altissimo sax squeals with the bass part strengthened by confident drum thumps maneri’s multistring emphasis and laubrock’s shaking vibrations eventually join the others for a satisfying finale with a good director ’s pacing johnson allows the closing “no 2 once upon a time  no 1 fallout ” to recapture some of the suite’s previous highlights before building up to a climactic finale after laubrock and maneri outline the theme in different tempos fujiwara like a character actor hitherto content to remain in the background moves to center stage with a solo that’s swinging without being flashy his martial percussion climax is the scene changer leading to a near appalachian fiddle feature from maneri and some strained reed textures from laubrock the entire band’s multiphonic crescendo then subsides into a proper conclusion

selfpenned and appropriated contrafacts of standards he’s been playing since the middle of the last century his intimate familiarity with those tunes makes his improvisations less of a tightrope act than they appear to be and yet mightily impressive in that he rarely repeats himself standards live true to its title consists of six great american songbook tunes while first meeting mixes in jazz standards like “billie’s bounce” and “giant steps” as well as “subconscious lee” konitz’ intricate boppish contrafact of “what is this thing called love” the only overlap is “stella by starlight” not only is the repertoire more expansive on first meeting it also finds konitz on soprano sax on three of eight tracks and the trio of pianist dan tepfer bassist michael janisch and drummer jeff williams is more unpredictable than the trio minsarah german pianist florian weber american bassist jeff denson and israeli drummer ziv ravitz on standards live while konitz’ tone and timbre sometimes falter on the vanguard date his ideas remain creative if at times a bit maundering minsarah is a subtle and empathetic trio interacting fluidly with konitz but he at times sounds frail some notes bleating away and except for a “just friends” surprisingly referencing charlie parker the standards here can all be found in more fulfilling versions on other konitz recordings the first thing that hits you on “billie’s bounce” the opening track of first meeting is the provocative nature of the trio challenging konitz with a fusillade of rhythmic and chordal textures and clangor williams stirs up whirlwinds on his kit coaxing konitz into ornettelike ravenous bluesy lines “stella by starlight” begun as an alto and bass duet on standards live begins here with unaccompanied piano alto entering with a piercing tone at the bridge developing a solo over busy piano and agitated quasisuspended rhythms which morph into rolling drums before a ruminative alto slows things down and is joined by bowed bass and tinkling piano in a rubato coda konitz’ lushtoned soprano work is a highlight of the album featured on a suave “all the things you are” with just bass and drums an interactive duet with tepfer ’s piano on “body and soul” and a long “alone together” fluidly unfolding from opening bass cadenza through piano and sax to a supple coda from konitz and williams’ brushes compared to standards live

keeper of the flame george lewis storyville by stuart broomer n ot to be confused with george lewis the eminentavant garde trombonist and composer george lewis the clarinetist is nestled at the opposite end of jazz history its new orleans beginnings born 114 years ago this month lewis first achieved some measure of attention in the early ‘40s enthusiasts seeking the origins of jazz discovered trumpeter bunk johnsonpurportedly born in 1879 just two years after buddy bolden the legendary founder of jazz with whom he may have played johnson was touted as an exemplar of the ‘true’ jazz becoming a point of contention between modernists and ‘moldy figs’ in the first of the jazz wars the younger and more vigorous george lewis was at johnson’s side when johnson retired in 1948 lewis assumed leadership of the veteran band becoming the figurehead of the new orleans revival and eventually touring the world today his memory is kept largely by a cult of musicians and fans devoted so exclusively to the minutiae of early jazz that they resemble civil war reenactors insofar as it keeps lewis from a larger audience that’s a shame as anyone listening to him will soon notice beyond lewis’ richly grained woody sound his flowing runs and soaring wail his clarinet sounds like a pure conduit for spirit and emotion for joy sorrow and devotion his associate trombonist jim robinson has an expressive power and nuanced mastery of tone and pitch that is just as compelling it is jazz as it first grew out of the wedding of blues gospel ragtime and brass bands music that in the ‘40s50s must have sounded much like it had 30 years before though it had acquired new pop tunes and was itself influenced by early jazz records jazz had changed by the time king oliver louis armstrong and jelly roll morton first recorded the music evolving rapidly as it moved to the northern metropolises and found the new venues that made them stars lewis’ music is closer to the original community spirit—less virtuosic and less solooriented his band picks up a hymn or a rag and it becomes a pulsing contrapuntal wail within moments a kind of jazz ideal that resonates to this day this eightcd set collecting all of the lewis recordings issued on the danish storyville label is focused intensely on a brief period in his career with seven of the cds recorded between october 1953december 1954 with just an occasional substitution the band is usually the one lewis inherited from johnson with robinson and other masters of the mature new orleans idiom pianist alton purnell banjo player lawrence marrero bassist alcide “slow drag” pavageau and drummer joe watkins avery “kid” howard usually plays trumpet the set is a window on lewis’ expanding world as he took his music to very different audiences the first two cds present a complete concert at ohio state university with the band including the college’s anthem and an instructive funeral medley compressing the journey to and from the cemetery discs 4 7 and 8 are all radio broadcasts from a longrunning engagement at san francisco’s club hangover exuberant performances with guest appearances by blues singer lizzie miles propelled by an enthusiastic announcer and a boisterous crowd the hymns and blues are less apparent in this repertoire and there are plenty of hoary pop tunes like “alexander ’s ragtime band” and “darktown strutters ball” mixed with the masterpieces of early jazz composed by oliver armstrong morton and kid ory the best performances though come from shorter recording sessions whether with or without an audience cd 3 is divided between recordings from bakersfield and new orleans made just three weeks apart in spring 1954 at the bakersfield performance “tin roof blues” moves at a perfect mediumslow tempo with howard’s trumpet alive with a burred and raucous insinuation while lewis brings a kind of droll pleading and robinson’s trombone slide seems to bend pitch towards dreamtime as the blues get deeper lawrence marrero’s banjo tremolo becomes the lead voice almost suggesting a zither the new orleans session is particularly serene with lewis and robinson playing with a different band of crescent city musicians that includes trumpeter percy humphrey drummer paul barbarin and guitarist johnny st cyr aveteran of the early oliver and armstrong bands cd 5 another new orleans session with the regular band minus robinson has lewis in a particularly effusive mood peppering tunes with elegant florid runs the one recording that falls outside the set’s otherwise narrow time frame is cd 6 lewis is heard in copenhagen in 1959 with papa bue’s viking jazzmen demonstrating the remarkable spread of the new orleans revival led by trombonist arne bue jensen the danish musicians play the style with skill and excitement tempering their enthusiasm with the same sense of reverence that marks lewis’ own performance for more information visit storyvillerecordscom the quiet fight

abated composers and coleaders soprano saxophonist phillip johnston and pianist joel forrester unearthed previously unrecorded charts like “hang it on a line” and “no time” as well as freshly penned

dworkin along with two other wellseasoned members alto saxophonist don davis and tenor saxophonist mike hashim the group plays with the familiarity and familiality once common to the heavilytouring big bands of the swing era indeed it is amazing how this foursaxophone section compiled of markedly idiosyncratic soloists can blend together so seamlessly drawing on various roots styles the program veers from the bouncy minor swing of “when you get in over your head” cowboy lope of the title track hardfunking “obeying the chemicals” and “hang it on a line” and gospelinflected “star turn” to the coolschool “you got that right” but the album is more than a retrospective of jazzified americana it is a revitalization of these roots in the spirit of discovery last month the micros hosted a twoset

previous album friday the 13th live the group is even zanier and more rambunctious than their records might suggest sparked by acting emcee johnston’s waggish repartee forrester ’s outlandish comping and a friendly rivalry among the horn players to impress each other with outrageous musical behavior johnston and forrester made lively dialogue on “a snapshot of the soul” everyone seemed inspired but davis seemed to be having a particularly great night soloing with aplomb on “star turn” and “let’s coolerate one” which also featured a fine turn by sewelson for more information visit

chesky records’ typically high standards at the hirsch center for the performing arts formerly st elias church in brooklyn the music resonates with a bold presence and immediacy not often heard on

a forest surrounded by the symphony of nature and that’s no exaggeration there’s a serene sense of pacing of ebb and flow of dynamic continuity as natural listening to a river “stank” opens the cd

album for the tv documentary a boy named charlie brown 50 years ago this year the documentary—a profile of artist charles schultz—never aired but its soundtrack jazz impressions of “a boy named charlie brown” established pianist vince guaraldi as a contemporary jazz composer with enormous popular appeal the following year guaraldi used some tracks from thatrecording for a charlie brown christmas the perennial hit cartoon that has introduced many new generations to the cool clean happy lines of west coast jazz this year concord released the first digitally mastered version of guaraldi’s 1964 album renamed simply a boy named charlie brown and it’s as happy as ever despite its namesake’s proclivities the rerelease contains all of the tunes from the original the most recognizable being the bouncy danceable “linus and lucy” sometimes mistakenly called “the peanuts theme” what you hear on this newly mastered tune and what you might miss if you hear it only as background music for the peanuts characters’ antics is the relentless bassline in guaraldi’s left hand against the block harmonies in his right monty budwig bassist for the recording doesn’t seem to play on this track you might also miss guaraldi’s delightfully concise improvisations the driving tempo of the shaker and the welltimed strike on the cowbell at the end courtesy of drummer colin bailey it’s sophisticated stuff for a children’s cartoon and therein lies its brilliance the disc also contains two tunes not on the original an impressionistic version of “fly me to the moon” shows off guaraldi’s chops as an interpreter of both lyrical romantic melodies and bebop and the alternate take of “baseball theme” is lighter breezier and almost a full minute and a half shorter than the version that made it onto the original recording listening to these bonus tracks it’s hard for those of us who first heard guaraldi’s music in the peanuts cartoons to accept that he might have

cheerful melodies never change it’s a nice place to revisit every once in awhileimpassioned poetry on religious and secular matters gels nicely within the scope of lewis’ concept the album’s centerpiece is “wading child in the motherless water” an 11½ minute tour de force that melds two classic spirituals “wade in the water” and “sometimes i feel like a motherless child” into a powerful

and jason kao hwang his music as the title of his new cd suggests has a decidedly spiritual component while also drawing on free jazz and postbop divine travels is lewis’ second album as a leader and it has the feel of a major release it’s a trio outing placing lewis in the deep end of the avant garde pool with bassist william parker and the drummer gerald cleaver two of the music’s most formidable improvisers and over 30 and 20 years older respectively than the leader but lewis is undaunted by his heavyweight company and immediately establishes that he’s in firm control of the

but the addition of busy cornetplayerabouttown kirk knuffke completes a trio of quickwitted improvisers who demonstrate throughout five originals and eight collective pieces that you don’t need to go beyond conventional registers to uncover untapped seams of invention by way of introduction gauci parades his easygoing burly tenor saxophone blending emphatic motifs amid roller coaster lines in a limber double act with filiano’s nimblefingered stylings which fuse melody with rhythmic attack on the opening “epee” that’s followed by a similarly involved pairing of cornet and bass at the outset of “ghosting” before gauci joins to inaugurate a spirited threeway interaction it’s immediately obvious that as a group they are fully formed missing nothing a feeling confirmed by charts extracting maximum impact from the resources at hand gauci’s jauntily contrapuntal “boogaloo” constitutes one of the early highlights with its vibrant interlocking parts but even within the tight arrangements there exists ample space for individual expression knuffke and filiano enjoy a special rapport as evinced by both their mercurial exchange of halfvalve splutters and plosives and creaky bow work on “probing for places” and subsequent reflective dialogue to close “speaking of you gently” however filiano’s title track is the standout piece even among a consistently engaging set and he excels throughout whether in the dramatic contrast between his startling arco unisons with gauci’s tenor and his fulltoned pizzicato or his concluding solo which splices gravitas and urgency for more

loved as musician and man the new and aptly titled biography by edward berger embodies wilder’s deep gentle spirit unlike many new biographies that document and magnify their subject’s flaws berger and wilder met in 1981 and they worked on this book for nearly a decade the biography has three intertwining stories one is wilder’s growth as a musician from his childhood in pennsylvania to being one of the most respected trumpet players in the world working with lionel hampton gunther schuller louis armstrong count basie duke ellington billie holiday benny goodman alec wilder benny carter ernie kovacs and a hundred more in his recollections of six decades as a professional musician we observe jazz changing from a popular dance music played everywhere to a rarefied phenomenon in clubs parties and festivals the second strand is wilder’s unheralded part in the long struggle to have racial equality in the united states his stories and berger’s careful research of discrimination and legalized abuse— personal and institutional—are painful when we reach 1980 in the book and it is evident that the struggle is coming to a close it is a relief and the third is a sweet chronicle of wilder himself a delightful man genuine humble witty compassionate “mr social” as one of his daughters calls him he emerges as a remarkable person who would have been so if he had never played a note sensitive to injustice and ready to act against it a gracious and kind individual berger’s writing is worthy of his subject the biography makes one feel as if wilder is close at hand fully realized

steve fidyk positone by terrell holmes heads up is a robust mix of originals and popular tunes honed to a fine point by drummer and composer steve fidyk whose firstcall quintet is comprised of tenor saxophonist tim warfield trumpeter terell stafford guitarist shawn purcell and bassist regan brough fidyk evinces a high reverence for the classic style of jazz throughout this album but what makes it invigorating is that he does so without the slavish fidelity to its structures that sometimes leads to empty parroting the quintet soars on tunes like the pulsating bop blueprint “untimely” and strutting “last nerve” which purcell peppers with flurries of single notes accented with octaves he later throws down some bluesy distorted rockoriented lines on “the flip flopper” fidyk strips the band down to the essentials of a drumsguitarbass rhythm section on “might this bebop” and although the setup is reduced the music loses none of its vigor brough’s propulsive bass is more evident he doesn’t pluck as much as he vocalizes talks as he walks purcell who wrote the song supplies some understated but elegant guitar while fidyk’s soft playing with his hands and brushes academy records

“t t j” he gives the upbeat and optimistic tunes “make someone happy” and “i can see clearly now” more measured almost somber readings stafford is the central voice here and he plays his muted trumpet and flugelhorn with a flawless tonality thoughtfulness and expert phrasing that gives each song poignancy without descending into sadness in the end however it’s the archetypes that guide this album and its crown jewel is “the bender” a burner whose richness and precision sounds like a treasure snatched from the blue note vaults the quintet’s perfect execution on this tune gives it an immediate feeling of timelessness fidyk reimagines “love for sale” cole porter ’s anthem to the demimonde as an edgy hybrid of hardbop and funk the band really stretches out on what is essentially a jam session and has a blast picking it apart all the way up to the last fading drumbeats fidyk has appeared on many recordings but this stellar positone debut should solidify his spot as a toptier jazzmanand turnarounds on the gershwins’ “our love is here to stay” the tv show audio tantalizingly suggests the stage business and skits that we only hear but vocally features a full panoply of stafford’s gifts in settings ranging from duets with weston and english singer tommy johnson to the orchestral extravaganza—with vocal chorus—version of “st louis blues” highlights include an insouciant “old devil moon” fast perky “tomorrow mountain” a duke ellington tune a multitempo “i’ll remember april” and closing “i’ll be seeing you” which is meltingly sentimental in the best sense for more information

jo stafford sepia by george kanzler f or much of her career jo stafford who died 6 years ago this month at age 90 was a disembodied voice by 1955 she’d sold more recordings than any other female singer yet she rarely appeared in person preferring recording radio and tv studios to live performances— almost all of them on theater stages as she disliked nightclubs and most of her live performances were for the troops at uso canteen shows during and immediately after world war ii—so much so that she earned the sobriquet “g i jo” so this cd the majority of it culled from the audio portion of a british tv show val parnell’s saturday spectacular the jo stafford show is a rare opportunity to hear stafford performing in fullblown stage shows although she was the most popular female vocalist of the war years and following decade stafford was also what today would be called a ‘singers’ singer ’ or ‘musicians’ musician’ like frank sinatra her closest male peer during her heyday and with whom she shared a lifelong love of the great american songbook she was a consummate purveyor of ballads singing with perfect intonation fluid legato ease and an exquisite sense of melody and empathy for the often sentimental message of the songs her influence was vast spanning jazzpop singers from rosemary clooney to jane monheit as well as country’s patsy cline and folkpop’s judy collins but her vocal fluidity extended to swing and latin tempos too as can be heard here the first four songs come from a palladium concert with the skyrockets orchestra and demonstrate her command of varying tempos and moods husband paul weston’s arrangements especially of “anyplace i hang my hat is home” are the equal of nelson riddle’s charts for sinatra and stafford’s ability to suggest little jazz liberties is evident on her melismas the term “fusion” is seldom used in connection with tenor saxophonist stan getz best remembered for his contributions to cool jazz and ethereal lester younginfluenced lyricism but in the early ‘70s getz did in fact experiment with jazzrock with help from members of two of the top fusion bands of the ‘70s filmed at the 1972 montreux jazz festival in switzerland this excellent dvd finds getz leading a fusionpostbop quartet that boasts chick corea electric keyboards and acoustic piano stanley clarke acoustic bass and tony williams drums all of whom were on getz’ 1972 columbia album captain marvel recorded three months before this concert and providing five of the tunes played here corea clarke and williams were all vital contributors to fusion—corea both with miles davis and later with clarke in return to forever williams with his own group lifetime—and they bring plenty of rock muscle to “captain marvel” “la fiesta” “time’s lie” and “day waves” all corea songs while the approach is more straightahead on inspired performances of corea’s “windows” billy strayhorn’s “lush life” and benny golson’s “i remember clifford” and even though clarke doesn’t play any electric bass at montreux his appreciation of rock and funk comes through all that rock and funk energy brings out a more aggressive side of getz at times throughout much of his career getz was the essence of subtlety and understatement but on the flamencoinfluenced “la fiesta” his playing takes on a harder edge latin influences from spanish to brazilian to afro cuban are plentiful on this dvd and that mutual appreciation of latin music is one of the reasons why getz and corea got along so well musically getz of course was one of the leaders of the early ‘60s bossa nova explosion live at montreux 1972 is a gem not only because of the performances but also because of the quality of the sound and the picture eagle rock entertainment obviously had a wellpreserved print to work with and this dvd is a fine document of getz’ brief but satisfying exploration of fusion for more information visit eaglerockcom the new york city jazz record  july 201431 boxed setthe original mono recordings miles davis columbialegacy by brian charette miles davis had been lying low and without a working band in 1955 when he made a surprise appearance with thelonious monk and zoot sims at the newport jazz festival in the audience that night was george avakian the head of jazz at columbia records blown away by davis’ performance of “’round midnight” avakian immediately wanted to sign davis but was hesitant because of the trumpeter ’s reputation for drugs and missing gigs after the two met again in new york avakian voiced his concerns and miles agreed to get a steady band together and stay clean the deal was sealed and so began one of the greatest marriages of label and artist in jazz history the first thing you will notice about this great boxed set which has the first nine albums miles did for columbia is the sexiness of the packaging the disc sleeves are made to look like small lps with the original liner notes on the back albeit in smallertype the set is also remastered in the original mono stereo recordings were not in fashion until the mid ‘60s so this is how a listener would have originally heard the music back when it first came out without the vinyl scratches of course in comparing these remasters with the stereo versions the music has a more dry and direct sound the trumpet comes right out at you as if you were standing right there the castanets of “concierto de aranjuez” on sketches of spain have a gentler woody sound and drop away very dramatically to let the solo trumpet cry the larger ensemble albums with gil evans—miles ahead and porgy and bess—also sound much different from their younger stereo brothers the horns are more homogenized because nothing is panned left or right low brass sounds darker and the high reeds more shrill because most of the compression used on the stereo versions has been removed dynamics are more dramatic the crescendos start from nothing then explode the set begins with ‘round midnight the album that codified miles’ sound in the midlate 50’s clipped muted lyrical lines replacing the bebop he played with charlie parker the decade before the tunes also have a dark introspective vibe that seem to be the personification of miles’ quiet intensity on the title track harmon mute is used to state the melody with a breathy tone and offthecuff riffs before surprise full trumpet blasts cue john coltrane’s soulful entrance one of the best albums in the set is milestones tony williams is rumored to have said that this is the only album you need to listen to if you want to play jazz drums philly joe jones is killing for sure the relentless swing feel he perpetuates creates anedgy urgency that really locks the rhythm section with the soloists also check out davis’ piano playing on the track “sid’s ahead” there are a lot of rumors swirling around what happened at the session that day but it seems there was some sort of beef between davis and red garland which prompted the latter to sit the tune out and let the former play an unaccompanied trumpet solo and unusual piano comping behind saxophonists cannonball adderley and john coltrane give a special listen to the single tonic note davis keeps playing in the beginning of his chord comping it sounds like he’s trying to figure out what key the tune is in a fast stomp off begins the album miles and monk at newport this session is a little unusual in the fact that the titular leaders don’t actually play together it’s basically a ‘side’ of each of their groups live miles’ portion comes from 1958 on “ahleu cha” the rhythm section sounds a little ragged at the top but is soon swinging hard you can really hear davis count off the tunes get mad when he blows a riff and snap his fingers during the drumless bass solo on “straight no chaser” we also get to hear a young bill evans still coming heavily from bud powell at this point turning in a beautifully crafted bop solo the great packaging and sound of this collection make it a must have for jazz aficionados the individual cds have a great retro look and the nifty program booklet has lots of great photos and little anecdotes about the

inspiration album in 1990 people heard a different side of you and saw what you could do with blues and soul and you haven’t become any less diverse since then hb not only that but jelly roll was one of the first people in jazz to actually commit a lot of this stuff to paper there were other pianists in that time who didn’t some of them were supposedly a little more creative a little more spontaneous than he was but they didn’t commit anything to paper tnycjr now that you are recording for impulse again does impulse plan to reissue either fivin’ around or the village hb you know i haven’t asked them about that tnycjr there’s still an enthusiastic audience for your ‘80s recordings a copy of fivin’ around was recently selling on amazoncom for 7885 hb several times i’ve seen people selling the village on vinyl for 80 or 90 bucks tnycjr fivin’ around and the village were full of horn players but when you were living in los angeles back then you performed a lot of gigs with small piano trios and it was interesting to hear what “swing it” or “my coloring book” sounded like without horns is there any chance that some recordings of those trio gigs in l a will ever become commercially available hb i had a lot of that stuff but a lot of it i lost in hurricane katrina i’m realizing how much stuff i lost hb everybody i knew back in the ‘80s the ‘90s the ‘70s was eclectic

other than new orleans over the years—l a new york illinois now you’re living in brooklyn but wherever you are the new orleans influence in your music remains hb every time i reflect on new orleans’ history i come away realizing how unique that town is it’s probably one of the two or three most unique cities in this country in some ways it’s probably the most unique because it still has the

mark the 100th anniversary of sun ra’s birth may 22nd montreal’s 18piece ratchet orchestra led by bassist nicolas caloia invited alto saxophonist marshall allen to join a commemorative celebration after a first part based on caloia’s charts with some serious sounding improv and spoken word allen leapt to center stage to take over the direction with his unique sliding sax phrasing allen injected a sense of immediacy and enthusiasm to the ensemble as he summoned individual and group improvs based on a ‘50s sun ra composition it was challenging and fun ggril was supposed to be 12 but 15 young musicians from the even more remote quebec town of rimouski 333 miles northeast of montreal performed classic free jazz what was missing in terms of an ensemble sound was compensated by palpable enthusiasm at one point both bassist éric normand and violinist raphaël arsenault took to directing the same section of musicians simultaneously haram arabic for forbidden was anything but in an uplifting display of classicalsounding arabic music by an 11member group led by vancouver guitarist oud player gordon grdina combining traditional and western instrumentation it was a joyous experience— no mournful laments here—with some improvisations from strings violins and brass but more a folk outing than a freejazz experience chicago’s everproductive saxophonist ken vandermark brought his audio one tentet for an engaging set of originals the songs were well crafted for his multitalented group including the energetic and inventive frontline of saxophonists mars williams dave rempis nick mazzarella and trombonist jeb bishop occasional duos featuring violist jen paulson and vibraphonist jason adasiewicz contrasted nicely with the dominant brassy sound it was a blowout though vandermark can be encouraged to be more adventurous other highlights and near the top at many fans’ “best of” lists was the opening concert by vocal acrobat and singer meredith monk who with her dramatic hand gestures and honeytinged clarity presented a collection of songs that recall the native music of the u s southwest spacey americana she clicked hummed and ululated and accompanied herself on jew’s harp and piano callandresponse duets with mezzosoprano katie geissinger were so tight you couldn’t tell the two apart and norwegian singer maja ratkje delighted with her expressive solo vocal contortions chants and electronic effects as she busily worked a table of devices noise as a genre was offered in two concerts featuring the deathrock musical attack of guitarist vocalist keiji haino with his mane of silvery hair hanging below his armpits and dressed in black he cut a dramatic figure as he screamed and pitched highvolume riffs from his electric guitar in a gig with french electric guitarist richard pinhas everpropulsive drummer tatsuya yoshida and the wallofsound electronics of masami akita known as merzbow the prince of darkness was a keystone of the dronelike sound produced with australian drummer oren ambarchi and american electric bassist stephen o’malley collectively known as nazoranai v for more information visit fimavqcca moers continued from page 13 the discovery for this reporter was frenchbelgian italian trumpetbassdrum trio jean louis later that evening despite their instrumentation the group’s foundation was drawn from progressive rock bands like king crimson or meddleera pink floyd uprightbassist joachim florent was especially impressive thickening the industrial stew songs taken from their latest album including a dedication to kim jong il and whose cover is a picture of the group attacked by one of ray harryhausen’s claymation monsters perhaps not for the purists but it is refreshing to hear a young group bringing new aesthetic influences to jazz another francophone ensemble orchestra national de jazz olivier benoit followed with a 48minute suite that recalled some of the full symphonic outings of the mahavishnu orchestra guitarist and leader benoit’s compositions jumping off the stage with rockish energy instead of the mawkish and fluffy arrangements one usually associates with any large ensemble that calls itself an orchestra the compositions were farranging and compelling the set nearing rockopera status by its conclusion sunday featured a german legend in drummer jaki liebezeit perhaps best known as a founding member of can there may have been some attendees of the festival old enough to remember him playing decades earlier in nearby köln with manfred schoof’s quintet his duo set with laptopper marcus schmickler was far closer to his later work shmickler setting up a series of slowly morphing electronic soundscapes underneath which liebezeit played insistent industrialstyle rhythms without respite some people zoned out others danced still others got caught up in the clublike lightshow that accompanied the music local boys well local to us ideal bread played a magnificent set drawn from their latest album fêting the compositions of late soprano saxophonist steve lacy leaderbaritone saxophonist josh sinton told a touching story of first getting into progressive jazz and hearing albums recorded at early moers festivals that he was now playing at one was “a dream come true” the band who has been together for a decade translated their unique take on lacy’s music from the usual tens of people in brooklyn to 2500 enthusiastic moersites sinton and cornet player kirk knuffke forming a cogent frontline buoyed by drummer tomas fujiwara and new bassist adam hopkins speaking of brooklyn the reworking of fred frith’s seminal 1980 album gravity performed at roulette last fall fit the moers aesthetic perfectly artrock flourishes mixing with circus music and a tongueincheek version of “dancing in the streets” this mammoth interpretation featured guitarist ava mendoza more on her later in its most incendiary moments as well as william winant’s kitchensink percussion and the leader on both guitar and electric bass the last set of the evening was another welcome surprise letieres leite’s orkestra rumpilez was billed as a brazilian big band but exceeded that label with avant garde flourishes in the saxophone solos complex rhythms from a thicket of percussionists centerstage and the leader ’s buoyant flute that the band wore matching cabana gear and sat on deckstools just added to the fun the festival closed on monday with a onetwo punch guitarist ava mendoza’s wayside wayfarer with electric bassist tim dahl and drummer nick podgurski was stunning in its brutality like jean louis two days earlier mendoza’s group didn’t draw on typical jazz guitar tropes but instead recalled the classic mid ‘80s corrosion of conformity trio lineup podgurski even looks like reed mullin and the east bay rayklaus fluorided h peligro version of the dead kennedys mendoza takes the cheerfulness out of surfrock guitar and dahl is like an alien punching through your chest mendoza’s anguished vocals on “dogsbodies” and “feral twin” added to the postapocalyptic vibe the closing set was a typically raucous one from mostly other people do the killing appearing as a sextet and a festival favorite peter evans has been replaced by steven bernstein bass trombone legend dave taylor has been added to the mix but it was two other new members pianist ron stabinsky and banjo player brandon seabrook mind42 july 2014  the new york city jazz recordtwistingly catholic in their tastes that brought a new dimension to bassistleader moppa elliott’s slapdash tunes named after pennsylvania towns during one of stabinsky’s solos he quoted bruce hornsby and elton john this was matched by drummer kevin shea quoting u2 later in the set jazz nazis have a special concentration camp just for bands
