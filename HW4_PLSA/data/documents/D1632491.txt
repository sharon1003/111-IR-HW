rs232 ethernet wireless pcmcia or ata memory card and usb communications these are the different ways to load programs and data to your machine tool the most common is rs232 many machine tool companies are now going to windows based operating systems with hard drives and usb ports below you will find communications with rs232 information there will be more on the other communications devices to come buy a rs232 cable or usb to serial port converter from the cnc store rs232 cables  custom cables usb to serial port converter pc card adapters cnc cheat sheets hardware set up for rs232 communications you can purchase a cable through the cnc store the nonhandshaking is the most popular and is made to the fanuc and mitsubishi rs232 specifications this has been fully tested on many controls including mitsubishi fanuc brother yasnac and many others we also offer the standard rs232 cable which has the handshaking capabilities as well as custom built rs232 cables most laptops now do not come with a serial port in this case you must purchase a pmcia to serial or a usb to a serial port adapter there are a lot of mixed reviews on the usb to serial converters though i have found one that seems to work for every application i have thrown at it its been tested on many cnc machines as well as automation devices such as plcs light curtains servo drives and more the only thing about using a usb to serial adapter is to make sure you plug it in the same usb port every time this will enable you to keep the same com port number that you have set up in your rs232 software programs see how to find out what com port number or communication port your device is registered as in windows standard rs232 fanuc serial port  db25 female to hondai am surprised at the few people that actually understand on how to set up all the different parameters for communications once you get it to work most people write them down and use it on all of their machines i myself still do not understand the full purpose of all the different settings but i am usually able to get communications working without a problem unfortunately there is little documentation on how all of the different settings are used i will be adding a troubleshooting section on rs232 communications in the near future i will also include some recommendations on software and parameters for the different controls lastly it will include the use of ata or sram cards and how to configure computers and read them for free rs232 software see free cnc software communications standard non handshaking cable for more
