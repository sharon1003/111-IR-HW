some ceos are selling their companies short jane sasseen february 25 2010 20000 pm pstfor investors in switch  data facilities sdxc a telecom services startup 2008 was a wild year from a low of 860 in midmarch shares more than doubled to 1817 three months later further gains seemed likely in late july when ceo keith olsen boosted the guidance he had given wall street analysts but with revenue growth slowing even as debt payments and other costs jumped switch  data was in the red by yearend by november 2008 the shares had fallen to 421 one shareholder avoided much of that drop the ceo on june 19 the day the stock peaked olsen contracted with an investment bank to hedge 150000 shares—a quarter of his stock in the company—against losses if the price fell below 18 as part of the complex maneuver he agreed to sell his shares to the bank one year later and got an advance of 22 million olsen who disclosed his hedging in public filings declined to comment for this story hedges are ways to contain losses if a stock declines while still keeping some upside potential if the price keeps rising see table for a full explanation its a strategy anyone in the market can employ but the way hedging is done by ceos directors and other senior executives may deprive investors of clues about impending problems at companies many grant executives stock as compensation largely because they want them to have a stake in the companys success or failure investors routinely follow insiders sales and purchases of company stock as a gauge of a corporations prospects hedging though reduces an executives exposure to stock price drops in a way that investors have a hard time detecting the complex transactions are structured so that executives still technically own the shares and though some really big hedges get noticed at the time they are made disclosures of hedging are often vague or buried deep in the footnotes of obscure public filings there is no question these transactions should be a red flag for investors says carr bettis the cofounder of forensic accounting firm gradient analytics and coauthor of a recent study on hedging the evidence is pretty compelling that hedges tend to be used before bad news hits the market bettis research found that in the year after executives and directors had engaged in hedging their companys stock often dropped markedly he also found evidence of an increase in financial restatements and shareholder lawsuits during the same period executives at mci enron im clone imcl krispy kreme—companies that suffered some of the great stock meltdowns of the last decade—hedged their shares some 107 instances of executive hedging were reported to the securities  exchange commission in 2009 up from a decade low of 48 in 2007 according to bettis and regulators are beginning to scrutinize the transactions kenneth feinberg the u s treasury pay czar has banned executives from hedging at the banks and automakers that received government bailouts we wanted to make sure they couldnt undercut the links we created between compensation and longterm performance says feinberg if executives at the companies could hedge their stock he adds they wouldnt have to worry about how the stock does in 2000 and 2001 billionaire philip anschutz hedged shares of two companies in which he held major stakes union pacific unp and anadarko petroleum apc shorting stock is typically done as part of a hedging strategy in anschutzs case the bank that arranged the deal donaldson lufkin  jenrette now part of credit suisse group shorted anschutzs own shares rather than borrowing shares in the market to short that was a common technique until tax authorities cracked down on it in 2006 in a case pending before u s tax court in washington the irs is arguing that anschutzs deals were effectively stock sales rather than hedges and is seeking 1436 million in capital gains taxes tax lawyers are watching the case because they say many other executives who early in the decade allowed their own shares to be shorted the way anschutz did are now being audited if the irs wins its case these hedgers could face big tax bills earlier than expected anschutz disputes the irss argument and would not comment for this story there are plenty of reasons a senior executive would hedge if he thought his companys stock was going to slide in one type of hedge called a prepaid variable forward contract he can get a cash advance of up to 85 for shares he agrees to sell eventually to an investment bank because he still technically owns the shares the irs doesnt consider a hedge a sale so long as the bank doesnt short the executives own shares so the executive need not pay capital gains taxes until the hedge expires meanwhile he can still vote the shares and collect dividends u s executive hedging first took off in silicon valley during the dotcom era when transactions averaged around 290 a year investment banks—morgan stanley ms goldman sachs gs jpmorgan chase jpm and citigroup c—rushed to provide hedge services i dont know of a bank that doesnt have a department doing this says mark leeds a tax lawyer with greenberg traurig by middecade he adds transactions worth several billion had likely been sold the hedge business helps the banks cement ties with top executives which comes in handy when a bank is pitching other services and the banks reap rich fees suspect correlationsbettis and his coauthors examined 2010 hedging transactions reported in filings by 1181 executives at 911 firms between 1996 and 2006 in the year preceding executives hedges their companies shares outpaced the market anywhere from 17 to 31 on average depending on the type of hedge used according to bettis analysis which was completed last year after the executives hedged its a different story shares in companies where the ceos directors and other top executives had hedged using a variable forward sale lagged the market by 162 on average those where a collar another popular hedging transaction had been used fell behind by 25 roughly 11 of the companies where an executive used a collar had to restate financials within two years of the hedge transaction comparable companies where no hedging occurred had half as many restatements bettis says some 11 of the firms that let their executives buy a variable forward contract faced securitiesrelated suits within a year double the number at companies that didnt hedge the poor performance following hedging suggests a number of these trades are potentially based on privileged information argues bettis the trades appear to be tied to events that were known or could reasonably have been anticipated by the executives he adds sec officials say executives who hedge fall under the same rules as those who sell their stock if an executive were to use a hedge to protect himself against losses at a time when he possessed specific material information that the companys performance had stumbled or was about to that could potentially bring an insider trading charge but sec spokesman john heine says the agency has never pursued an insider trading case against an executive following a hedge missed earnings in the wake of a hedge appear common bettis research shows chattem chairman and ceo alexander guerry placed a hedge on 60000 shares of the chattanooga tennbased maker of gold bond foot powderbull frog sun block and other products according to public filings guerry made with the sec the stock peaked at 8145 on feb 13 2008 the day after guerry hedged

transactions he made since 2003 was meant to diversify his portfolio the stock performed well after those earlier hedges he points out moreover with less than 20 of guerrys holdings hedged bosworth argues that guerry was still exposed to the fall in share price executives also have hedged shares just prior to the eruptions of some real messes at krispy kreme kkd in september 2003 a family partnership run by thenvicechairman and executive vicepresident john mc aleer hedged 15 million of the doughnut chains shares receiving an advance of 50 million from its investment bank the deal hedged against further losses if the shares dropped below 3930 according to mc aleers public filings that protection lasted on one tranche of 750000 shares until september 2007 while a second tranche of 75000 shares was protected against further downside until march 2008 at the time the stock was trading around 42 by november 2003 as questions mounted about earnings the stock had started to drop the sec launched an investigation krispy kreme restated earnings and three executives eventually settled charges of securities fraud when the second tranche of the hedge ended in 2008 the shares were trading at 259 mc aleer who was not cited in the sec investigation left the company in 2005 he was a defendant in a shareholder class action against the company and its former executives and directors that was settled in 2006 for 75 million mc aleers lawyer timothy ehlinger said in a written statement that the family partnership which had been funded by stock inherited from his father was advised by jp morgan in early 2001 to diversify its holdings in the companys shares the partnership hedged shares in september of 2001 2002 and 2003 successively according to plan the fourth transaction set for 2004 was cancelled jack mc aleer did not have any material nonpublic information regarding the stock says ehlinger who adds that mc aleer did not hedge any of the 500000 shares he owned in his own name bettis who is also an associate research professor at arizona state readily acknowledges that it is impossible to know exactly whats behind any individuals trades by looking at public filings many executives say they hedge to diversify holdings heavily weighted toward their companys shares these deals are dictated by so much more than whats happening at the company says robert gordon whose firm twentyfirst securities sets up hedges i dont think people do them because theyre bearish but they do want to take some chips off the table when alan g hassenfeld hedged over 1 million shares before his 2006 retirement as executive chairman of toymaker hasbro for example the company said the move was to diversify his investment portfolio realize liquidityand provide funding against charitable pledges to track most hedges an investor generally has to look up a form 4 an sec filing where top executives are required to report sales purchases and other transactions in the companys stock many details on hedges arent actually listed in the two tables that make up form 4 they show up instead in footnotes and details are often incorrectly reported or missing says bettis according to sec regulations companies must include such information as the exercise price of a hedge and the dollar value locked in the term of the transaction and the number of shares the executive would have at the end of the hedge theres no mandated format however for conveying that information which seems to have left companies unclear as to the requirements morad tahbaz a director of air methods a provider of emergency medical travel disclosed he was hedging 55000 shares on sept 25 2007 his filings didnt say how long his hedge lasted or what the floor price was beyond which he would be protected against a drop in the stock the company says it believes it met all disclosure rules chester spatt the secs chief economist from 2004 to 2007 who teaches finance at carnegie mellons tepper school of business believes details of hedges should be spelled out more clearly its potentially misleading if a proxy says a guy owns 1 million shares but only has an economic interest in half that says spatt meredith cross director of the secs corporate finance div says the agency is starting several studies to see if disclosure rules are adequate still she says shareholders have access to substantial information about executive hedging some companies including procter  gamble pg and kellogg k ban executive hedging but they are a minority lucian bebchuk head of the program on corporate governance at harvard law school predicts growing problems with hedges as companies make executives hold on longer to shares as a way of prodding them to work for longterm gains a manager might have to keep a stock award for three years after it vests for example if he can hedge his shares and essentially cash out of them before the holding period ends he eludes that restriction thats why bebchuk sees an allout ban as the only solution allowing executives the freedom to hedge he says defeats the purpose of equity compensation before its here its on the bloomberg terminal learn morehave a
