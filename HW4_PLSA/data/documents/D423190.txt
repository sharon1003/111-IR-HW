biology  editdiet and teeth  editspecimen of the troodontid jinfengopteryx elegans with seeds preserved in the stomach region theropods exhibit a wide range of diets from insectivores to herbivores and carnivores strict carnivory has always been considered the ancestral diet for theropods as a group and a wider variety of diets was historically considered a characteristic exclusive to the avian theropods birds however discoveries in the late 20th and early 21st centuries showed that a variety of diets existed even in more basal lineages 7 all early finds of theropod fossils showed them to be primarily carnivorous fossilized specimens of early theropods known to scientists in the 19th and early 20th centuries all possessed sharp teeth with serrated edges for cutting flesh and some specimens even showed direct evidence of predatory behavior for example a compsognathus longipes fossil was found with a lizard in its stomach and a velociraptor mongoliensis specimen was found locked in combat with a protoceratops andrewsi a type of ornithischian dinosaur the first confirmed noncarnivorous fossil theropods found were the therizinosaurs originally known as segnosaurs first thought to be prosauropods these enigmatic dinosaurs were later proven to be highly specialized herbivorous theropods therizinosaurs possessed large abdomens for processing plant food and small heads with beaks and leafshaped teeth further study of maniraptoran theropods and their relationships showed that therizinosaurs were not the only early members of this group to abandon carnivory several other lineages of early maniraptors show adaptations for an omnivorous diet including seedeating some troodontids and insecteating many avialans and alvarezsaurs  oviraptorosaurs ornithomimosaurs and advanced troodontids were likely omnivorous as well and some early theropods such as masiakasaurus knopfleri and the spinosaurids appear to have specialized in catching fish 8 9diet is largely deduced by the tooth morphology 10 tooth marks on bones of the prey and gut contents some theropods such as baryonyx lourinhanosaurus ornithomimosaurs and birds are known to use gastroliths or gizzardstones the majority of theropod teeth are bladelike with serration on the edges 11 called ziphodont others are pachydont or phyllodont depending on the shape of the tooth or denticles the morphology of the teeth is distinct enough to tell the major families apart 12 which indicate different diet strategies an investigation in july 2015 discovered that what appeared to be cracks in their teeth were actually folds that helped to prevent tooth breakage by strengthening individual serration as they attacked their prey 13 the folds helped the teeth stay in place longer especially as theropods evolved into larger sizes and had more force in their bite 14 15skin scales and feathers  editfossil of a anchiornis showing large preserved feather imprints mesozoic theropods were also very diverse in terms of skin texture and covering feathers or featherlike structures are attested in most lineages of theropods see feathered dinosaur  however outside the coelurosaurs feathers may have been confined to the young smaller species or limited parts of the animal many larger theropods had skin covered in small bumpy scales in some species these were interspersed with larger scales with bony cores or osteoderms this type of skin is best known in the ceratosaur carnotaurus which has been preserved with extensive skin impressions 16the coelurosaur lineages most distant from birds had feathers that were relatively short and composed of simple possibly branching filaments 17 simple filaments are also seen in therizinosaurs which also possessed large stiffened quilllike feathers more fully feathered theropods such as dromaeosaurs usually retain scales only on the feet some species may have mixed feathers elsewhere on the body as well scansoriopteryx preserved scales near the underside of the tail 18 and juravenator may have been predominantly scaly with some simple filaments interspersed 19 on the other hand some theropods were completely covered with feathers such as the troodontid anchiornis which even had feathers on the feet and toes 20size  editmain article dinosaur size size comparison of selected giant theropod dinosaurs tyrannosaurus was for many decades the largest theropod and bestknown to the general public since its discovery however a number of other giant carnivorous dinosaurs have been described including spinosaurus carcharodontosaurus and giganotosaurus 21 the original spinosaurus specimens as well as newer fossils described in 2006 support the idea that spinosaurus is larger than tyrannosaurus showing that spinosaurus was possibly 6 meters longer and at least 1 metric ton heavier than tyrannosaurus though tyrannosaurus could still be taller than spinosaurus 22 there is still no clear explanation for exactly why these animals grew so much larger than the land predators that came before and after them the largest extant theropod is the common ostrich up to 274 m 9 ft tall and weighing between 635 and 14515 kg 140  320 lb 23the smallest nonavialan theropod known from adult specimens is the troodontid anchiornis huxleyi at 110 grams in weight and 34 centimeters 1 ft in length 20 when modern birds are included the bee hummingbird mellisuga helenae is smallest at 19 g and 55 cm 22 in long 24recent theories propose that theropod body size shrank continuously over the past 50 million years from an average of 163 kilograms 359 lb down to 08 kilograms 18 lb eventually evolving into modern birds this was based on evidence that theropods were the only dinosaurs to get continuously smaller and that their skeletons changed four times as fast as those of other dinosaur species 25 26stance and gait  editan ostrich walking on a road in etosha national park namibia as a hugely diverse group of animals the posture adopted by theropods likely varied considerably between various lineages through time 27 almost all known theropods are known to be bipedal with the forelimbs reduced in length and specialized for a wide variety of tasks see below in modern birds the body is typically held in a somewhat upright position with the upper leg femur held parallel to the spine and with the forward force of locomotion generated at the knee scientists are not certain how far back in the theropod family tree this type of posture and locomotion extends 27nonavian theropods were first recognized as bipedal during the 19th century before their relationship to birds was widely accepted during this period theropods such as carnosaurs and tyrannosaurids were thought to have walked with vertical femurs and spines in an upright nearly erect posture using their long muscular tails as additional support in a kangaroolike tripodal stance 27 beginning in the 1970s biomechanical studies of extinct giant theropods cast doubt on this interpretation studies of limb bone articulation and the relative absence of trackway evidence for tail dragging suggested that when walking the giant longtailed theropods would have adopted a more horizontal posture with the tail held parallel to the ground 27 28 however the orientation of the legs in these species while walking remains controversial some studies support a traditional vertically oriented femur at least in the largest longtailed theropods 28 while others suggest that the knee was normally strongly flexed in all theropods while walking even giants like the tyrannosaurids 29 30 it is likely that a wide range of body postures stances and gaits existed in the many extinct theropod groups 27 31nervous system and senses  editalthough rare complete casts of theropod endocrania are known from fossils theropod endocrania can also be reconstructed from preserved brain cases without damaging valuable specimens by using a computed tomography scan and 3d reconstruction software these finds are of evolutionary significance because they help document the emergence of the neurology of modern birds from that of earlier reptiles an increase in the proportion of the brain occupied by the cerebrum seems to have occurred with the advent of the coelurosauria and continued throughout the evolution of maniraptorans and early birds 32forelimb morphology  editmummified enantiornithean wing from cretaceous amber shortened forelimbs in relation to hind legs was a common trait among theropods most notably in the abelisaurids such as carnotaurus and the tyrannosaurids such as tyrannosaurus  this trait was however not universal spinosaurids had well developed forelimbs so also did many coelurosaurs one genus xuanhanosaurus has also been claimed to have been quadrupedal because of its comparatively robust forelimbs but this is no longer thought to be likely 33the hands are also very different among the different groups the most common is an appendage consisting of three fingers the digits i ii and iii or possibly ii iii and iv 34 with sharp claws some basal theropods  herrerasaurus eoraptor had four digits and also a reduced metacarpal v ceratosaurians usually had four digits while most tetanurans had three 35the forelimbs scope of use is also believed to have also been different among different families the spinosaurids could have used their powerful forelimbs to hold fish some small coelurosaurus  dromaeosaurids scansoriopterygids are believed to have used their forelimbs to climb in trees  citation needed and modern birds which are theropod dinosaurs use them for flight forelimb movement  editdiagram of deinonychus left and archaeopteryx right forelimbs illustrating winglike posture contrary to the way theropods have often been reconstructed in art and the popular media the range of motion of theropod forelimbs was severely limited especially compared with the forelimb dexterity of humans and other primates 36 most notably theropods and other bipedal saurischian dinosaurs including the bipedal prosauropods could not pronate their hands—that is they could not rotate the forearm so that the palms faced the ground or backwards towards the legs in humans pronation is achieved by motion of the radius relative to the ulna the two bones of the forearm in saurischian dinosaurs however the end of the radius near the elbow was actually locked into a groove of the ulna preventing any movement movement at the wrist was also limited in many species forcing the entire forearm and hand to move as a single unit with little flexibility 37 in theropods and prosauropods the only way for the palm to face the ground would have been by lateral splaying of the entire forelimb as in a bird raising its wing 36in carnosaurs like acrocanthosaurus the hand itself retained a relatively high degree of flexibility with mobile fingers this was also true of more basal theropods such as herrerasaurs and dilophosaurs coelurosaurs showed a shift in the use of the forearm with greater flexibility at the shoulder allowing the arm to be raised towards the horizontal plane and to even greater degrees in flying birds however in coelurosaurs such as ornithomimosaurs and especially dromaeosaurs the hand itself had lost most flexibility with highly inflexible fingers dromaeosaurs and other maniraptorans also showed increased mobility at the wrist not seen in other theropods thanks to the presence of a specialized halfmoon shaped wrist bone the semilunate carpal that allowed the whole hand to fold backward towards the forearm in the manner of modern birds 37paleopathology  editmain article theropod paleopathology in 2001 ralph e molnar published a survey of pathologies in theropod dinosaur bone he found pathological features in 21 genera from 10 families pathologies were found in theropods of all body size although they were less common in fossils of small theropods although this may be an artifact of preservation they are very widely represented throughout the different parts of theropod anatomy the most common sites of preserved injury and disease in theropod dinosaurs are the ribs and tail vertebrae despite being abundant in ribs and vertebrae injuries seem to be absent or very rare on the bodies primary weight supporting bones like the sacrum femur and tibia the lack of preserved injuries in these bones suggests that they were selected by evolution for resistance to breakage the least common sites of preserved injury are the cranium and forelimb with injuries occurring in about equal frequency at each site most pathologies preserved in theropod fossils are the remains of injuries like fractures pits and punctures often likely originating with bites some theropod paleopathologies seem to be evidence of infections which tended to be confined only to small regions of the animals body evidence for congenital malformities have also been found in theropod remains such discoveries can provide information useful for understanding the evolutionary history of the processes of biological development unusual fusions in cranial elements or asymmetries in the same are probably evidence that one is examining the fossils of an extremely old individual rather than a diseased one 38swimming  editthe trackway of a swimming theropod the first in china of the ichnogenus named characichnos was discovered at the feitianshan formation in sichuan 39 these new swim tracks support the hypothesis that theropods were adapted to swimming and capable of traversing moderately deep water dinosaur swim tracks are considered to be rare trace fossils and are among a class of vertebrate swim tracks that also include those of pterosaurs and crocodylomorphs the study described and analyzed four complete natural molds of theropod foot prints that are now stored at the huaxia dinosaur tracks research and development center hdt these dinosaur footprints were in fact claw marks which suggest that this theropod was swimming near the surface of a river and just the tips of its toes and claws could touch the bottom the tracks indicate a coordinated leftright leftright progression which supports the proposition that theropods were wellcoordinated swimmers 39evolutionary history  editpossible early forms herrerasaurus large and eoraptor smallduring the late triassic a number of primitive prototheropod and theropod dinosaurs existed and evolved alongside each other the earliest and most primitive of the theropod dinosaurs were the carnivorous eodromaeus and the herrerasaurids of argentina as well as possibly the omnivorous eoraptor  the herrerasaurs existed during the early late triassic late carnian to early norian  they were found in north america and south america and possibly also india and southern africa the herrerasaurs were characterised by a mosaic of primitive and advanced features some paleontologists have in the past considered the herrerasaurians to be members of theropoda while other theorized the group to be basal saurischians and may even have evolved prior to the saurischianornithischian split cladistic analysis following the discovery of tawa another triassic dinosaur suggests the herrerasaurs likely were early theropods 40the earliest and most primitive unambiguous theropods or alternatively eutheropoda – true theropods are the coelophysoidea the coelophysoidea were a group of widely distributed lightly built and potentially gregarious animals they included small hunters like coelophysis and possibly larger predators like dilophosaurus these successful animals continued from the late carnian early late triassic through to the toarcian late early jurassic  although in the early cladistic classifications they were included under the ceratosauria and considered a sidebranch of more advanced theropods 41 they may have been ancestral to all other theropods which would make them a paraphyletic group 42 43the somewhat more advanced ceratosaurs including ceratosaurus and carnotaurus appeared during the early jurassic and continued through to the late jurassic in laurasia they competed alongside their more anatomically advanced tetanuran relatives and—in the form of the abelisaur lineage—lasted to the end of the cretaceous in gondwana the tetanurae are more specialised again than the ceratosaurs they are subdivided into the basal megalosauroidea alternately spinosauroidea and the more derived avetheropoda megalosauridae were primarily middle jurassic to early cretaceous predators and their spinosaurid relatives remains are mostly from early and middle cretaceous rocks avetheropoda as their name indicates were more closely related to birds and are again divided into the allosauroidea the diverse carcharodontosaurs and the coelurosauria a very large and diverse dinosaur group including the birds thus during the late jurassic there were no fewer than four distinct lineages of theropods—ceratosaurs megalosaurs allosaurs and coelurosaurs—preying on the abundance of small and large herbivorous dinosaurs all four groups survived into the cretaceous and three of those—the ceratosaurs coelurosaurs and allosaurs—survived to end of the period where they were geographically separate the ceratosaurs and allosaurs in gondwana and the coelurosaurs in laurasia of all the theropod groups the coelurosaurs were by far the most diverse some coelurosaur groups that flourished during the cretaceous were the tyrannosaurids including tyrannosaurus  the dromaeosaurids including velociraptor and deinonychus which are remarkably similar in form to the oldest known bird archaeopteryx 44 45  the birdlike troodontids and oviraptorosaurs the ornithomimosaurs or ostrich dinosaurs the strange giantclawed herbivorous therizinosaurs and the avialans which include modern birds and is the only dinosaur lineage to survive the cretaceous–paleogene extinction event 46 while the roots of these various groups are found in the middle jurassic they only became abundant during the early cretaceous a few paleontologists such as gregory s paul have suggested that some or all of these advanced theropods were actually descended from flying dinosaurs or protobirds like archaeopteryx that lost the ability to fly and returned to a terrestrial habitat 47on july 31 2014 scientists reported details of the evolution of birds from other theropod dinosaurs 25 48 26 among the features linking theropod dinosaurs to birds are a furcula wishbone airfilled bones brooding of the eggs and in coelurosaurs at least feathers classification  edithistory of classification  editothniel charles marsh who coined the name theropoda photo c 1870o c marsh coined the name theropoda meaning beast feet in 1881 49 marsh initially named theropoda as a suborder to include the family allosauridae but later expanded its scope reranking it as an order to include a wide array of carnivorous dinosaur families including megalosauridae compsognathidae ornithomimidae plateosauridae and anchisauridae now known to be herbivorous prosauropods and hallopodidae subsequently revealed as relatives of crocodilians due to the scope of marshs order theropoda it came to replace a previous taxonomic group that marshs rival e d cope had created in 1866 for the carnivorous dinosaurs goniopoda angled feet 33by the early 20th century some paleontologists such as friedrich von huene no longer considered carnivorous dinosaurs to have formed a natural group huene abandoned the name theropoda instead using harry seeley s order saurischia which huene divided into the suborders coelurosauria and pachypodosauria huene placed most of the small theropod groups into coelurosauria and the large theropods and prosauropods into pachypodosauria which he considered ancestral to the sauropoda prosauropods were still thought of as carnivorous at that time owing to the incorrect association of rauisuchian skulls and teeth with prosauropod bodies in animals such as teratosaurus  33 in w d matthew and barnum brown s 1922 description of the first known dromaeosaurid  dromaeosaurus albertensis 50  they became the first paleontologists to exclude prosauropods from the carnivorous dinosaurs and attempted to revive the name goniopoda for that group but other scientists did not accept either of these suggestions 33allosaurus was one of the first dinosaurs classified as a theropod in 1956 theropoda came back into use  as a taxon containing the carnivorous dinosaurs and their descendants  when alfred romer reclassified the order saurischia into two suborders theropoda and sauropoda this basic division has survived into modern paleontology with the exception of again the prosauropoda which romer included as an infraorder of theropods romer also maintained a division between coelurosauria and carnosauria which he also ranked as infraorders this dichotomy was upset by the discovery of deinonychus and deinocheirus in 1969 neither of which could be classified easily as carnosaurs or coelurosaurs in light of these and other discoveries by the late 1970s rinchen barsbold had created a new series of theropod infraorders coelurosauria deinonychosauria oviraptorosauria carnosauria ornithomimosauria and deinocheirosauria 33with the advent of cladistics and phylogenetic nomenclature in the 1980s and their development in the 1990s and 2000s a clearer picture of theropod relationships began to emerge jacques gauthier named several major theropod groups in 1986 including the clade tetanurae for one branch of a basic theropod split with another group the ceratosauria as more information about the link between dinosaurs and birds came to light the more birdlike theropods were grouped in the clade maniraptora also named by gauthier in 1986 these new developments also came with a recognition among most scientists that birds arose directly from maniraptoran theropods and on the abandonment of ranks in cladistic classification with the reevaluation of birds as a subset of theropod dinosaurs that survived the mesozoic extinctions and lived into the present 33major groups  editceratosaurus a
