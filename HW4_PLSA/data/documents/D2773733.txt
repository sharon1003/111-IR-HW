the obvious answer to the question and won – david k nov 6 14 at 1932i actually got it from an arthur c clarke novel the ghost from the grand banks where a child prodigy does the same thing – ian f1 nov 6 14 at 1934the incident im thinking of occurred in the early 1980s so clarke may well have gotten the idea from that – david k nov 6 14 at 19463some details i have since found this question was on the october 1980 psat and was challenged successfully by daniel lowen the story was reported in early 1981 see this account or this – david k may 20 15 at 1822david k excellent thanks for digging that out the proof involving two pyramids side by side in your second link is very elegant and would have been the answer i accepted here  – ian f1 may 20 15 at 1954add a comment6 answers active

the front facing faces of both pyramids are obviously coplanar and the pink face of the subtended tetrahedron is obviously on the same plane its three vertices lie on the faces of the pyramids no formulas or calculations required – nicolas miari aug 22 16 at 1257add a commentup vote7down vote recall that the regular tetrahedron is selfdual it is its own dual polyhedron thus for a regular tetrahedron of edge length 2 consider its compound with its own dual such that both tetrahedra share the same circumradius the resulting compound is known as the stella octangula the intersection of the two tetrahedra ie the region of space common to both is a regular octahedron of edge length 1 and half of this octahedron as bisected by a plane perpendicular to a fourfold axis forms the aforementioned square pyramid this pyramid upon which a smaller regular tetrahedron of edge length 1 is attached is the figure of interest but from this description it becomes immediately obvious that two of the three faces of the small tetrahedron are coplanar with two of the triangular faces of the square pyramid thus there are only 5 distinct faces to this polyhedron explanatory figure taken from the math world link above here we see that the coplanarity is evidentshare cite improve this answeranswered nov 6 14 at 1905heropup573k 6 55 911much more elegant obviously than my own attempt 1 and will accept it unless anyone somehow makes it even plainer anytime soon – ian f1 nov 6 14 at 1907an equivalent explanation can be given by considering the first stellation of a regular octahedron which is equivalent to adding eight regular tetrahedra to each octahedral face resulting in the stella octangula and from this again the coplanarity immediately follows the only subtlety is to establish that stellation produces a regular tetrahedron this follows from the fact that joining the midpoints of the 6 edges of a regular tetrahedron results in a regular octahedron – heropup nov 6 14 at 1912add a commentup vote6down vote let be the base square of the pyramid its tip and the midpoint of the segment is a hinge connecting two equilateral triangles therefore the plane of the triangle intersects orthogonally it follows that the angle is the angle between two adjacent walls of the pyramid using the cosine theorem one obtains the angle between two faces of the tetrahedron is the angle at the tip of an isosceles triangle with sides and so it follows that therefore the resulting solid does not have faces as expected but only of them the base square and one triangular side

at 1701add a commentup vote3down vote i believe that it would be the number of faces of the tetrahedron   plus the number of faces of the pyramid   minus the two faces that got glued together since they will not be on the outside surface of the resulting polyhedron so faces totalshare cite improve this answeranswered nov 6 14 at 637mike pierce103k 9 30 67im afraid this is an instance where the obvious solution is not the correct one – ian f1 nov 6 14 at 638ian f1 oh if you are getting at what i think you are then the definition of face becomes important if there are still edges there along where the two original polyhedra are glued together then would we get rid of those edges just because the incident faces are flush with each other in the same plane – mike pierce nov 6 14 at 642ive edited the question does that resolve the definition problem – ian f1 nov 6 14 at 6471ian f1 that edit definitely makes it clear this is a pretty cool question ive worked in topology more recently than in solid geometry so that subtlety completely got by me – mike pierce nov 6 14 at 651ian f1 i dont understand why this answer is not the correct one may you expand on your comment – taladris nov 6 14 at 800show 4 more commentsup vote3down vote one way to think about this problem is as follows in your mind take 2 pyramids and place them together on a flat surface square side down with the edges touching note that each of their 2 adjacent sides are parallel to the equivalent sides on the other pyramid and are in the same plane draw a line between the tips think of the length of that line it covers half of the square base of each pyramid thus it is equal to the square base the shape formed from this line and the closest side of each pyramid is the tetrahedron described the other 3 dimensions are defined by the triangular sides of the pyramids which are also equal to the square base the two added sides are in the same plane as those of both pyramids forming a single shape with 6 sides now take off one of the pyramids its two sides are now replaced with the 1 side where it was connected to the tetrahedron thus 5 sidesshare cite improve this answeranswered dec 11 15 at 1722nick31 1nice except that even the solid in step 4 has only 5 faces i think but yes this is a very intuitive way of thinking about it – ian f1 dec 12 15 at 1028add a commentup vote0down vote i tried to do this with vectors and angles at first but it got a bit handwavy and i couldnt nail down the details any alternative answer which does this more elegantly would be very welcome lets work out the cartesian coordinates of all the vertices for the sake of convenience and symmetry lets double the edge length to 2 and place the base of the pyramid at verticesthen the apex of the pyramid will be at for some value of which we can find with 3d pythagorus now place the tetrahedron against face cde and call its fourth vertex f located at x y z by symmetry equidistant from c and d we can see that y must be 0 lets calculate x and z3d pythagorus again gives 1 2rearranging 1 substituting in 2 and rearranging a messy exercise left to the reader  it turns out the only sensible solution is so ef is parallel to bc and b c e f are coplanar instead of two triangular faces these vertices form a single parallelogram face similarly for a d e f so the resulting solid is a pentahedron comprising one square face two triangular faces one from the pyramid one from the tetrahedron and two parallelogramsshare cite improve this answeredited nov 6 14 at 1902answered nov 6 14 at 1849ian
