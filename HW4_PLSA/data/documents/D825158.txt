home cooking green beans 58how do i cook really tender green beansdannyw jul 31 2011 1211 pmi know this is a very basic question but i love the really soft tender green beans that you get at places like cracker barrel but whenever i cook green beans no matter how long i boil them they are never that soft and tender my wife and i both really like green beans with bacon and onions but the beans must be very tender perhaps i am just buying the wrong kind of bean reply want to stay up to date with this post sign up now ›follow log in or sign up to comment posting guidelines  faqs log in or

canned green beans and no amount of bacon will disguise the flavor to me replye escondido123 jul 31 2011 1226 pmyou might want to braise rather than boil saute bacon and onions then add beans and some water cook on low until they are as tender as you like although lots of people like crisp tender vegetables ive never been a fan and like you want them fully cookedor overcooked in this case 2 replies

picked garden beans didnt overcook them but i know people who do replyre escondido123p puffin3 may 12 2014 0544 amchoose only the youngest beans then slowly steamsauté them in a little clarified butter and a few drops of water with a few drops of fresh squeezed lemon juice and a tiny pinch of sugar and kosher salt until they have the texture you want i dont use the bacon fat in this method bc it will make the beans surface texture greasy using clarified butter is important bc the milk solids in table butter adds a cheesy sour note to cooked foods especially veg imo reply 1p pine time jul

to admit but i and most of the people i know only secretly admit this like the canned ones better than fresh reminds us of our childhoods and diner food i guess im almost certain cracker barrel and most chains like it  use canned youll never get fresh to taste like canned for better or worse because of the kind of beans they use as well as the canning process i like the sw brand that i get at costco in the 8 or 12packs or sometimes the 10 cans but availability will vary depending upon where you live  you could use libbys del monte or green giant all of which should be available nationally heres how i prepare canned at home remember that canned are already fully cooked heat a couple of tablespoons of butter salted or unsalted your choice per 15 oz can of green beans in a nonstick skillet when the bubbles subside toss in the welldrained beans toss for 30seconds or one minute until just heated through fully cooked well done soft but not mushy slightly firm to the bite kids will vacuum them up better make two cans the bacon and onion variation sounds great just saute those first then add the beans with some of the water from the can which is loaded with green bean flavor i also like these cold straight from the can sometimes i add a little italian dressing also great in salads replyre acgold7eclecticsynergy aug 7 2011 0444 pmi also like these cold straight from the can sometimes i add a little italian dressing also great in salads im with you acgold7 often keep a can of french cut beans in the back of the fridge for this also a fan of the quick  easy three or four bean salad have nothing against sweet  tasty fresh ones and i personally dont mind em a little crisp with some good sweet butter and herbamare or browned butter and maggi or a little smoky bacon but the canned green beans make me feel like a kid again reply 1re acgold71 1cosmo1 jul 24 2014 0532 ami dont care for the commercially canned green beans but when my mom canned then well the beans were in a whole different world she always used mature kentucky wonder pole beans but still able to be snapped after stringing she would then blanch them then cook them in a pressure cooker with a piece of salt pork then they went into the canning jars and i think cooked again in the jars she never used those canned beans until the next year i have never had green beans that have even came close to how wonderful those beans were tender meaty and just overflowing with flavor replyh 2re paulji l divo jul 31 2011 0215 pmbingo pauljor try a slow method of cooking them in chicken broth with onions shallots garlic butter olive oil and bacon when done cooking covered on real low take off heat and disgard all but the beans or save the broth for a later use in stews or pasta sauce or chicken pot pie gravy etc  replyl 1re pauljbushwickgirl aug 7 2011 0509 pmoh i m sorry canned really dont do it for me except maybe for 3 or 4 bean salad when pressed to use canned and not fresh its that canned flavor woof buy thinner or young green beans blanch until tender thats it if you want them very tender cook em longer by tender i mean 45 minutes max but i have a feeling thats not the cooking instructions the op is looking for ive never eaten at a cracker barrel wherever the chain is located but do understand that in the south green beans are often boiled to death so to speak sorry i realize that boiled to death is a attitude laden culinary judgement call but i cant help it seeing that mode of cooking that way perhaps simmered until meltingly tender is better i went to mississippi on a road trip years ago to purchase honeybees for our local beekeepers we stayed over for a few days with a genial young couple who fed us pretty well but my traveling companion from ct as i was then got into a rather heated argument with our host when it came to cooking green beans our host had fresh garden beans that she boiled for at least 30 minutes ooh it was damned criminal to my yankee sensibilities the beans were greyishgreen flaccid to mushy and devoid of nutrition imo however please understand that i know regional parts of the us have different concepts about what constitutes a properly cooked green bean or any food product for that matter degree of doneness seasonings all that i have a great deal of interest in whats on the table in other parts of the us and respect and appreciate the regional differences tender yes those beans were so i guess thats how you do it boil em or at least simmer well and long i now have a friend who grew up in virginia she stews her beans until very tender in a little stock with bacon onions and a splash of vinegar at the end i have to say ive accepted the cooking style dont mind the overt tenderness and do admit that they are delicious prepared in that manner i hope i havent offended anyone here that is not my aim to each hisher own i guess i just like my beans less tender replyre bushwickgirlpaulj aug 7 2011 0653 pmdevoid of nutrition is that just an opinion or something that you measured more importantly did that couple show signs of a vitamin deficiency replyre pauljbushwickgirl aug 8 2011 0628 amvitamin deficiency hard to ascertain but they looked pretty well fed otherwise i did mention that my devoid of nutrition comment was my opinion due to the appearance of the long boiled beans which would have rendered any b vitamins null and devoid im sure the fiber was still intact though replyre bushwickgirl mrs cheese aug 8 2011 0722 pmbacon covers the canned flavor replyre mrs cheesei isolda aug 9 2011 1140 amoh my yes i love fresh and canned green beans with different treatments of course but one shining example of the latter is my cousins baconwrapped canned green bean bundles baked with some type of bottled dressing it was orange whats that french or russian or none of the above in any case those beans are delicious i am sorry to say reply recommended from chowhound 0355why state bird provisions
