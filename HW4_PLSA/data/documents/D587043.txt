was initiated by kalle lasn and micah white of adbusters a canadian anticonsumerist publication who conceived of a september 17 occupation in lower manhattan the first such proposal appeared on the adbusters website on february 2 2011 under the title a million man march on wall street 11 lasn registered the occupy wall streetorg web address on june 9 12 that same month adbusters emailed its subscribers saying “america needs its own tahrir ” white said the reception of the idea snowballed from there 12 13 in a blog post on july 13 2011 14 adbusters proposed a peaceful occupation of wall street to protest corporate influence on democracy the lack of legal consequences for those who brought about the global crisis of monetary insolvency and an increasing disparity in wealth 13 the protest was promoted with an image featuring a dancer atop wall streets iconic charging bull statue 15 16 17meanwhile several similar proposals were being explored by independent groups as reported by journalist nathan schneider in his book thank you anarchy notes from the occupy apocalypse 18 thousands of people organized by a group of labor unions marched on wall street 12 the online collective anonymous attempted an occupation on june 14 activists planned an indefinite occupation of freedom plaza in washington d c which eventually became known as occupy washington d c on august 1 2011 almost a month prior to the major media event a group of artists were arrested after a series of days protesting nude as an art performance on wall street 19 this event may have inspired or triggered the major event to follow this was a protest by the 49 participants on american institutions and was titled ocularpation wall street by artist zefrey throwell 20then in an unrelated incident a group called new yorkers against budget cuts nyab was formed which promoted a sleep in in lower manhattan called bloombergville in july 2011 preceding ows and provided a number of activists to begin organizing 21 22 activist anarchist and anthropologist david graeber and several of his associates attended the nyab general assembly but disappointed that the event was intended to be a precursor to marching on wall street with predetermined demands graeber and his small group created their own general assembly which eventually developed into the new york general assembly the group began holding weekly meetings to work out issues and the movements direction such as whether or not to have a set of demands forming working groups and whether or not to have leaders 12 23 24 nb 2 the internet group anonymous created a video encouraging its supporters to take part in the protests 25 the u s day of rage a group that organized to protest corporate influence that corrupts our political parties our elections and the institutions of government also joined the movement 26 27 the protest itself began on september 17 a facebook page for the demonstrations began two days later on september 19 featuring a you tube video of earlier events by midoctober facebook listed 125 occupyrelated pages 28the original location for the protest was one chase manhattan plaza with bowling green park the site of the charging bull and zuccotti park as alternate choices police discovered this before the protest began and fenced off two locations but they left zuccotti park the groups third choice open since the park was private property police could not legally force protesters to leave without being requested to do so by the property owner 29 30 at a press conference held the same day the protests began new york city mayor michael bloomberg explained people have a right to protest and if they want to protest well be happy to make sure they have locations to do it 27because of its connection to the financial system lower manhattan has seen many riots and protests since the 1800s 31 and ows has been compared to other historical protests in the united states 32 commentators have put ows within the political tradition of other movements that made themselves known by occupation of public spaces such as coxeys army in 1894 the bonus marchers in 1932 and the may day protesters in 1971 33 34more recent prototypes for ows include the british student protests of 2010 20092010 iranian election protests the arab spring protests 35 and more closely related protests in chile greece spain and india these antecedents have in common with ows a reliance on social media and electronic messaging 36 37 as well as the belief that financial institutions corporations and the political elite have been malfeasant in their behavior toward youth and the middle class 38 39 occupy wall street in turn gave rise to the occupy movement in the united states 40 41 42 david graeber has argued that the occupy movement in its antihierarchical and antiauthoritarian consensusbased politics its refusal to accept the legitimacy of the existing legal and political order and its embrace of prefigurative politics has roots in an anarchist political tradition 43 sociologist dana williams has likewise argued that the most immediate inspiration for occupy is anarchism and the la times has identified the controversial anarchistinspired organizational style as one of the hallmarks of ows 44 45background  editwe are the 99  editmain article we are the 99we are the 99the occupy protesters slogan we are the 99 refers to the protesters perceptions of and attitudes regarding income disparity in the us and economic inequality in general which have been main issues for ows it derives from a we the 99 flyer calling for owss second general assembly in august 2011 the variation we are the 99 originated from a tumblr page of the same name 46 47 huffington post reporter paul taylor said the slogan is arguably the most successful slogan since hell no we wont go  of the vietnam war era and that the majority of democrats independents and republicans see the income gap as causing social friction 46 the slogan was boosted by statistics which were confirmed by a congressional budget office cbo report released in october 2011 48income inequality  edita chart showing the disparity in income distribution in the united states 49 50 wealth inequality and income inequality have been central concerns among ows protesters 51 52 53income inequality is a focal point of the occupy wall street protests 54 55 56 this focus by the movement was studied by arindajit dube and ethan kaplan of the university of massachusetts amherst who noted that inequality in the u s has risen dramatically over the past 40 years so it is not too surprising to witness the rise of a social movement focused on redistribution greater inequality may reflect as well as exacerbate factors that make it relatively more difficult for lowerincome individuals to mobilize on behalf of their interests yet even the economic crisis of 2007 did not initially produce a left social movement only after it became increasingly clear that the political process was unable to enact serious reforms to address the causes or consequences of the economic crisis did we see the emergence of the ows movement overall a focus on the 1 percent concentrates attention on the aspect of inequality most clearly tied to the distribution of income between labor and capital we think ows has already begun to influence the public policy making process 57  citation needed an article on the same subject published in salon magazine by natasha leonard noted occupy has been central to driving media stories about income inequality in america late last week radio dispatch’s john knefel compiled a report for media watchdog fairness and accuracy in reporting fair which illustrates occupy’s success media focus on the movement in the past half year according to the report has been almost directly proportional to the attention paid to income inequality and corporate greed by mainstream outlets during peak media coverage of the movement last october mentions of the term “income inequality” increased “fourfold”tokens of occupy rhetoric — most notably the idea of a “99 percent” against a “1 percent” — has seeped into everyday cultural parlance 58 as income inequality remained on peoples minds republican presidential candidate mitt romney said such a focus was about envy and class warfare 59goals  editbeginning on september 17 2011 zuccotti park was occupied by protesters 60owss goals include a reduction in the influence of corporations on politics 61 more balanced distribution of income 61more and better jobs 61 bank reform 42 especially to curtail speculative trading by banks  forgiveness of student loan debt 61 62 or other relief for indebted students 63 64 and alleviation of the foreclosure situation 65 some media label the protests anticapitalist 66 while others dispute the relevance of this label 67 nicholas kristof of the new york times noted while alarmists seem to think that the movement is a mob trying to overthrow capitalism one can make a case that on the contrary it highlights the need to restore basic capitalist principles like accountability 68 rolling stone writer matt taibbi asserted these people arent protesting money theyre not protesting banking theyre protesting corruption on wall street 69 in contradiction to such views academic slavoj zizek wrote capitalism is now clearly reemerging as the name of the problem 70 and forbes columnist heather struck wrote in downtown new york where protests fomented capitalism is held accountable for the dire conditions that a majority of americans face amid high unemployment and a credit collapse that has ruined the housing market and tightened lending among banks 71some protestors have favored a fairly concrete set of national policy proposals 72 73 one ows group that favored specific demands created a document entitled the 99 percent declaration 74 but this was regarded as an attempt to coopt the occupy name 75 and the document and group were rejected by the general assemblies of occupy wall street and occupy philadelphia 75 however others such as those who issued the liberty square blueprint are opposed to setting demands saying they would limit the movement by implying conditions and limiting the duration of the movement 76 david graeber an ows participant has also criticized the idea that the movement must have clearly defined demands arguing that it would be a counterproductive legitimization of the very power structures the movement seeks to challenge 77 in a similar vein scholar and activist judith butler has challenged the assertion that ows should make concrete demands so what are the demands that all these people are making either they say there are no demands and that leaves your critics confused or they say that demands for social equality that demands for economic justice are impossible demands and impossible demands are just not practical but we disagree if hope is an impossible demand then we demand the impossible 78 regardless activists favor a new system that fulfills what is perceived as the original promise of democracy to bring power to all the people 79during the occupation in liberty square a declaration was issued with a list of grievances the declaration stated that the grievances are not allinclusive 80protester demographics  editearly on the protesters were mostly young 81 82 as the protest grew older protesters also became involved 83 the average age of the protesters was 33 with people in their 20s balanced by people in their 40s 84 various religious faiths have been represented at the protest including muslims jews and christians 85 rabbi chaim gruber 86 however is reportedly the only clergy member to have actually camped at zuccotti park 87 88 89 the associated press reported in october that there was diversity of age gender and race at the protest 83 a study based on survey responses at occupy wall storg reported that

democratic republican or independentother 273 of the respondents called themselves democrats 24 called themselves republicans while the rest 70 called themselves independents 93 a study released by city university of new york found that over a third of protesters had incomes over 100000 76 percent had bachelors degrees and 39 percent had graduate degrees while a large percent of them were employed they largely reported they were unconstrained by highly demanding family or work commitments the study also found that they disproportionally represented upperclass highly educated white males 94 95 a survey of 301 respondents by a fordham university political science professor identified the protesters political affiliations as 25 democratic 2 republican 11 socialist 11 green party 0 tea party and 12 other meanwhile 39 of the respondents said they did not identify with any political party 96 ideologically the fordham survey found 39 selfidentifying as extremely liberal 33 as

microphone the assembly is the main ows decisionmaking body and uses a modified consensus process where participants attempt to reach consensus and then drop to a 910 vote if consensus is not reached consensus is a process of common sentiment it is not agreement participants are given room for dissent and complex ideas are able to form the process has been used in many indigenous traditions quaker practices the womens liberation movement antinuclear movement and alterglobalization movement in the assembly ows working groups and affinity groups discuss their thoughts and needs and the meetings are open to the public for both attendance and speaking 98 the meetings are without formal leadership meeting participants comment upon committee proposals using a process called a stack which is a queue of speakers that anyone can join new york uses what is called a progressive stack in which people from marginalized groups are sometimes allowed to speak before people from dominant groups facilitators and stackkeepers urge speakers to step forward or step back based on which group they belong to meaning that women and minorities may move to the front of the line while white men must often wait for a turn to speak 99 100 participants take minutes of the meetings so that other participants who are not in attendance can be kept uptodate 101 102 in addition to the over 70 working groups 103 that perform much of the daily work and planning of occupy wall street the organizational structure also includes spokes councils at which every working group can participate 104even with the perception of a movement with no leaders leaders have emerged a facilitator of some of the movements more contentious discussions nicole carty says “usually when we think of leadership we think of authority but nobody has authority here” – “people lead by example stepping up when they need to and stepping back when they need to” 105 according to fordham university communications professor paul levinson occupy wall street and similar movements symbolize another rise of direct democracy that has not actually been seen since ancient times 106 107funding  editduring the initial weeks of the park encampment it was reported that most of ows funding was coming from donors with incomes in the 50000 to 100000 range and the median donation was 22 84 according to finance group member pete dutro

allowable campaign contribution to republican presidential candidate mitt romney 109 during the period that protesters were encamped in the park the funds were being used to purchase food and other necessities and to bail out fellow protesters with the closure of the park to overnight camping on november 15 members of the ows finance committee stated they would initiate a process to streamline the movement and reevaluate their budget and eliminate or merge some of the working groups they no longer needed on a daytoday basis 110 111met with increasing costs and significant overhead expenses

dollars raised still remained available the report warned that if current revenues and expenses were maintained at current levels then funds would run out in three weeks 112 113 some of the movements biggest costs include groundlevel activities such as food kitchens street medics bus tickets subway passes and printing expenses 114 115 in late february 2012 it was reported that a group of business leaders including ben cohen jerry greenfield danny goldberg norman lear and terri gardner 116 created a new working group the movement resource group and with it have pledged 300000 with plans to add

128new york city requires a permit to use amplified sound including electric bullhorns since occupy wall street did not have a permit the protesters created the  human microphone  in which a speaker pauses while the nearby members of the audience repeat the phrase in unison the effect has been called comic or exhilarating—often all at once some feel this provided a further unifying effect for the crowd 129 130during the weeks that overnight use of the park was allowed a separate area was set aside for an information area which contained laptop computers and several wireless routers 131 132 the

movement than the occupy movement 205 in january 2012 a survey was released by rasmussen reports in which 51 of likely voters found protesters to be a public nuisance while 39 saw it as a valid protest movement representing the people 206pulitzer prize–winning journalist chris hedges a supporter of the movement argues that ows had popular support and articulated the concerns of the majority of citizens 207many notable figures joined the occupation including david crosby kanye west russell simmons alec baldwin susan sarandon don king noam chomsky jesse jackson cornel west and michael

at hot and crusty in new york city obtaining higher wages and the right to form a union by working with a worker center 214government surveillance  editan internal document of the united states department of homeland security showed that the u s government was keeping tabs on protesters as the movement spread across the united states the united states department of homeland security  dhs began keeping tabs on protesters a dhs report entitled  special coverage occupy wall street  dated october 2011 observed that mass gatherings associated with public protest movements can have disruptive effects on transportation commercial and government services especially when staged in major metropolitan areas 215crackdown  editon december 29 2012 naomi wolf of the guardian newspaper provided u s government documents which revealed that the fbi and dhs had monitored occupy wall street through its joint terrorism task force despite labelling it a peaceful movement the crackdown on protesters was coordinated with the big banks on wall street 216 the fbi used counterterrorism agents to investigate the movement 217criticism  edita number of criticisms towards occupy wall street have emerged both during the movement’s most active period and subsequently after these criticism include a lack of clear goals false claim as the 99 a lack of measurable change trouble conveying its message a failure to continue its support base pursuing the wrong audience and accusations of antisemitism lack of clear goals  editalthough the movements primary slogan was we are the 99 it was criticized for not encompassing the voice of the entire 99 specifically lower class individuals and minorities the occupy movement has been criticized for not having a set of clear demands that could be used to prompt formal policy change this lack of agenda has been cited as the reason why the occupy movement fizzled before achieving any specific legislative changes although the lack of demands has simultaneously been argued as one of the advantages of the movement 218 the protesters in occupy rejected the idea of having only one demand or a set of demands and instead represented a host of broad demands that did not specifically allude to a desired policy agenda 219 220 thus this criticism was heavily debated lack of minority representation  editalthough the movements primary slogan was  we are the 99  it was criticized for not encompassing the voice of the entire 99 specifically lower class individuals and minorities for example it was characterized as being overwhelmingly white 221 and poorly representative of the needs of the immigrant population the lack of african american presence was especially notable with the movement being criticized in several news outlets and journal articles about its lack of inclusivity and racial diversity 222 223 224 225 lack of measurable change  editsome publications mentioned that the occupy wall street movement failed to spark any true institutional changes in banks and in corporate america this idea is supported by the number of scandals that continued to emerge following the financial crisis such as the london whale incident the liborfixing scandal and the hsbc money laundering discovery furthermore the idea of excess compensation through salaries and bonuses at wall street banks continued to be a contentious topic following the occupy protests especially as bonuses increased during a period of falling bank profits 226 227 228 trouble conveying its message  editanother criticism was the idea that the movement itself was having trouble conveying its actual message the movement was criticized for demonizing the rich and establishing a theme of class warfare 229 230 231 another issue that was raised was that the occupy movement was attempting to indict the entire 1 and argue for wealth redistribution when in fact the focus of the movement was centered around upward mobility and fairness for all through government regulation and taxation 232 233 similarly the movement has often been criticized as elitist and a manipulation of populist and liberal ideologies 234 235 failure to continue its support base  editthe movement was also criticized for not building a sustainable base of support and instead fading quickly after its initial spark in late 2011 through early 2012 236 this may be attributed to occupys lack of legislative victories which left the protestors with a lack of measurable goals it was also argued that the movement was too tied to its base zuccotti park evidence of this lies in the fact that when the police evicted the protestors on november 15 the movement largely dissipated 237 238 while there is evidence that the movement had an enduring impact protests and direct mentions of the occupy movement quickly became uncommon 239 240 241 wrong audience  editmany people felt that occupy had the wrong target in mind and that washington politicians or the federal reserve should have received much of the rebuke 242 243 for ignoring the warning signs leading up to the financial crisis and not taking action more quickly in addition the movement was criticized for demonizing banks and the entire financial industry with the argument being that only a certain portion of wall street workers contributed to the actions that eventually sparked the financial crisis 244 245 antisemitism accusations  editmany occupy wall street protests have included antizionist and antisemitic slogans and signage such as jews control wall street or zionist jews who are running the big banks and the federal reserve as a result the occupy wall street movement has been confronted with accusations of antisemitism by major us media 246 247 248 249 250subsequent activity  editsee also

people actively involved in occupy than at its height however a number of groups that formed during the occupation or resulted from connections made at that time were still active 253 more broadly the 99 meme has persisted in common parlance and thomas pikettys 700page tome on global income inequality had become a bestseller 254ongoing efforts  editstrike debt  editto celebrate the third anniversary of the occupation an occupy wall street campaign called strike debt announced it had wiped out almost 4 million in student loans amounting to the indebtedness of 2761 students the loans were all held by students of everest college a for profit college that operates corinthian colleges inc which in turn owns everest university everest institute heald college and wyo tech we chose everest because it is the most blatant con job on the higher ed landscape it’s time for all student debtors to get relief from their crushing burden the loans became available when the banks holding defaulted loans put the bad loans up for sale once purchased the group chose to forgive the loans the funds to purchase the loans came from donations to the rolling jubilee fund part of the occupy student debt program as of september 2014 the group claimed to have wiped out almost 19 million in debt 255as of september 2014 rolling jubilee claims to have cancelled more than 15 million in medical

second anniversary and elsewhere 261 ft alphaville gave it two thumbs up for discussable policy proposals while the new york times dealbook called it a guide to the financial system and the events surrounding the crisis and it proposes a policy framework that it calls popular regulation 262 263 the group continues to meet weekly at columbia university including a speaker series 264 the group
