femi lift new minimally invasive procedure with no pain or downtime… from dr michael goodman caring for women wellness center laser vaginal tightening for improved sexual pleasure and relief from minimal urinary incontinence laser vaginal therapy for reversing vaginal atrophy good also for breast cancer survivors with vaginal atrophywhat is femi lift a nonsurgical painless 15minute office procedure utilizing reliable thirdgeneration co2 fractional laser pixel technology delivered into the vagina via a vaginalshaped probe the procedure consists of 3 treatments over 12 weeks with a “touchup” one year later the results are a noticeable tightening of the entire vaginal barrel for increased friction and pleasure during sexual intimacy if utilized in a different power mode femi lift is also quite effective in reversing the atrophic effects of aging in the vagina what does femi lift accomplish for vaginal tightening femi lift works via pulses of laser energy into the collagen layer of the vaginal mucosa where concentrated thermal heating leads to collagen and elastin “shrinkage” and secondary regeneration producing a tightening of the vaginal tissues the initial shrinkage and secondary regeneration produce improved pressure on the “gspot” and increase the stretch of the internal bulbs and crurae of the internal portion of the clitoris tightening also occurs along the base of the overlying bladder with evidence shows that it also improves the pesky problem of minor urinary incontinence the outcome of this procedure is the complete remodeling of the vaginal mucosa in addition to the reestablishment of robust “youngerseeming” vaginal tissue embedded with thick and long collagen fibers what does femi lift accomplish for vaginal atrophic changes by altering and rearranging collagen fibers enabling the formation of elastin and better collagen formation femi lift can provide longterm reversal of the atrophic effects of aging on the vaginal walls how does femi lift work a laser generator produces safe pulses of patterned pixelscreen laser energy delivered via a tubeshaped intravaginal device these pulses generate laser beams in a grid less than ½ mm apart and 06 mm deep via a microscopic laserproduced opening at intervals of several millimeters into the collagen under the dermis the layer just underneath the vaginal skin this causes a 360° symmetrical microcontracture of the entire vaginal barrel leading to overall tightening in the case of laxity including tightening of the upper vagina producing added support for the base of the bladder in a different power mode femi lift may be utilized solely to stimulate collagen and elastin formation to enable better “stretchability” of the vaginal tissues who is a good candidate for this procedure who is not candidates women with minimal to moderate vaginal looseness or laxity not severe enough to need a complete surgical repair “vaginoplasty” but bothersome enough less “grip” too much “droop” to diminish sexual pleasure and sometimes lead to modest urinary incontinence perfect candidates are women who have not yet had a child but either feel themselves “wide” inside or have a partner with a smallersized penis women with laxity after childbirth who plan on another childchildren and need “temporary” tightening until their final childbirth after which they may undergo a permanent surgical tightening procedure if the problem persists women who will undergo a vaginoplasty surgical tightening procedure of the outer lower half of the vaginavaginal floor but also have noticeable widening in the far inner upper vagina where a surgical pelvic floor tightening procedure traditionally cannot reach which frequently occurs with a coexisting problem of occasional involuntary loss of urine and who wish to avoid an inhospital general anesthesia which is sometimes risky for uppervaginal repair women with mild urinary incontinence women with only modest vaginal laxity and decent musculature who wish to avoid a surgical procedure postmenopausal women with dry atrophic vaginal tissues not candidates women with a significant pelvic floor vaginal laxity involving significant widening and muscular separation these women need a surgical repair and will be disappointed with a solely laser procedure women with significant urinary incontinence andor prolapse these women need a surgical repair“sling” or “tape” procedure women with very tightened atrophic vaginas these women will first need to undergo reestrogenization and mild mechanical dilation in order to physically accommodate the treatment probe which health care professionals should be doing the procedure which should not laser vaginal tightening should ideally be performed only by a surgeon who also is trained and skilled in the performance of surgical vaginoplasty and hopefully savvy in pelvic floor muscle physical therapy a boardcertified gynecologist who is additionally skilled and certified in cosmetic and plastic vaginal pelvic floor work and savvy in the usage of lasers for vaginal tightening is ideal as heshe is uniquely able to choose the right procedure for the right patient for the right reasons and is less inclined to misuse the laser in women who truly need only pelvic floor pt or in women who truly need surgery laser treatment for vaginal atrophic changes should be performed only by a boardcertified gynecologist who is wellversed in the issues associated with and the alternative treatment modalities for menopause what is the science behind this procedure the femi lift laser utilizes pixel co2 fractional pulsed light wave technology as a cutting tightening or resurfacing tool in this instance nonablative laser waves exiting the tube 360° at closely spaced intervals “drill” microscopic closely spaced micropunctures 06 mm 600 microns into the dermis producing a minidefect in the collagen that contracts producing shrinkage in proper power settings and stimulating the collagen and elastin to grow thus bulking and “rejuvenating” this layer this technology has been utilized in europe and asia for more than 5 years and a wealth of data has accumulated verifying its effects and success how long does femi lift last present data suggest that with 3 treatments over a 12week time period and especially with a “touchup” after one year the tightening and continence effects are experienced for at least 23 years or more while the atrophic elasticity effects are ongoing with no need for further treatments in properly managed patients other nifty uses of this technology co2 pixelated laser technology may also be used to resurface stretch marks and surgical scars“bleach” darkened perivaginal and perianal skin ask dr goodman’s staff about these possibilitieshow much does it cost are there any discounts available the full price is 30003300 for the series of 3 treatments plus 1000 for the touchup as an introductory offer during 2015 dr goodman will discount these fees by almost 30 to 2800 total including the touchup in one year for patients undergoing a surgical vaginal tightening the addition of laser tightening for the upper vagina series of 3  touchup is discounted over 50 to 1800 total disclaimer this is new technology although it has been cleared by the fda fda approval of “medical devices” unlike medications is a short and not necessarily exhaustive process while it appears from a limited number of studies that both laser tightening and relief from vaginal atrophy accomplishes what it promises with little risk of harm there really are no wellcontrolled longterm over 23 years studies like there are for surgical procedures surgery remains the “gold standard” for vaginal tightening but laser treatment may offer benefits in certain situations see above vaginal estrogen therapy remains the “gold standard” for vaginal health rehabilitation but there are situations where laser treatment may offer advantages references“novel
