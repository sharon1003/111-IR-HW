science buzz switching between subjective and objective modes is the essence of the scientific modus operandi not many people seem to appreciate that science is all about riding two horses maybe not in concert but certainly alternately  and knowing when to switch from one to the other tuesday january 12 2010if co2 is so heavy why doesnt it sink and suffocate us a note about the author  added october 6 2016  thanks for visiting this post penned some 6 years ago its still attracting 1520 visits per day maybe its that graphic below of those thermallyagitated gas molecules that attract visitors rather than the wordy science per se  yup im a downtoearth realist before proceeding onto your perilous journey into the intricaies of how molecules  light versus heavy respond or dont to the earths gravitational field please be advised that this investigative bloggerretired scientist has made other contributions to knowledge or as some unkind folk would say  fantasy there are two in particular i wish to flag up1 stonehenge i believe it to have been designed initially for sky burial or as i prefer to call it afs avianfacilitated skeletonization see most recent posting on this site ugh yes i know  hardly the stuff of afterdinner conversation2 the shroud of turin i believe it to be a medieval fake consistent with the radiocarbon dating 12601390 i believe it was intended to reproduce what joseph of arimatheas fine linen  used simply to transport the crucified jesus from cross to tomb  would have looked like 13 centuries later if it had captured a body imprint in sweat and blood i have demonstrated in my own home how the enigmatic body image could have been imprinted onto wet linen using an adult male volunteer the lucky fellow was first smeared with vegetable oil then coated with a dusting of white flour heating in a breadmaking oven or similar the linen not the bloke would have produced the sepia body image later attenuated to its final ghostly appearance by vigorous washing with soap and water see this recent posting on my specialist shroud site naughty i know inserting this commercial thanking you for your forebearance but do please visit those two sites if youre interested in cuttingedge stuff thats still to be picked up by the meejaback now to those bustling molecules thanks to kinetic energy there will be no appreciable unmixing  or even partial stratification at least under normal g values thats the case even if one type of molecule is much heavier than the other the question in the title was inspired by a comment on a site i visit a lot one to which ive posted a lot in nigh on three years more about that later suffice it to say that i shall reply to here rather than there and attempt to place a link on the other site there will be no more posting to that site until such time as its moderation policies are given a thorough overhaul nuff said for now the question was essentially this given that we all know that petrol fumes sink to the ground at a filling station why doesnt co2  which we also know is denser than air  also settle at ground level why are we not suffocated by the stuff  or does it only come up to ankle or knee level imagine one were to trap gases inside balloons  one for hydrogen one for oxygen one for nitrogen one for carbon dioxide  and then release them the four balloons would behave exactly as the questioner supposes the hydrogen balloon would quickly ascend the co2 balloon would rapidly descend and the nitrogen and oxygen balloons would probably hover or sink slowly  due mainly to the weight of the balloon rubber  not the contents the relative densities of hydrogen nitrogen oxygen aircarbon dioxide are approximately 1  7  8  72  22 gases lighter than air rise those heavier than air sink no surprises there when petrol fumes are released they too sink quickly at least to start with a typical molecule in petrol is one of the isomeric octanes general formula c8h18 with a relative vapour density of 57  some 4 times greater than air but the petrol fumes would not stay for very long at ground level convection current carry them upwards and gaseous diffusion would cause mixing with air even without convection thats because gas molecules are in a state of constant motion colliding with other molecules millions of times a second causing them gradually to diffuse spread in all directions the fumes gradually spread into all the space available  which could be a jar a garage a hangar the entire atmosphere once the space is evenly occupied the molecules then show no tendency to unmix why not answer because the 1g force that acts on all molecules in air at sea level is insufficient to overcome the kinetic forces due to collision between molecules put more simply  a molecule that gets a strong bump from below will be knocked upwards against the weaker force of gravity this is true for g1 but is not true for progressively higher g forces heres an example  always a a controversial one enrichment of the fissile uranium isotope u235 needed for atomic power stations or hiroshimatype a bombs requires separation from the more abundant u238 this can be accomplished in gaseous diffusion plants or in centrifuges that generate an intense g force either process requires that solid metallic uranium first be converted to the gaseous uranium hexafluoride uf6 there is a well known experiment that is done in schools at any rate those that still have a fume cupboard to demonstrate that dense gases andor vapours gradually diffuse to fill the space available and then do not subsequently unmix from air one places of few drops of elemental bromine br2 a fuming red liquid in the lower jar which is separated from the upper jar by a glass divider one waits for the lower jar to fill completely with redbrown fumes one then removes the separator the fumes gradually fill both jars evenly despite bromine vapour being 5 times denser than air theres a variant on the experiment that i devised while teaching to demonstrate the petrol vapour effect one places a jar of bromine on top and then removes the divider most of the bromine fumes sink immediately into the lower jar behaving as if they were enclosed in a balloon but the fumes then gradually diffuse back upwards to produce the same endresult as before the short term behaviour of the petrol fumes is called a bulk phase effect its the temporary behaviour of heavy molecules in close proximity which behave briefly as if enclosed in a balloon but once diffusion has caused mixing of heavy molecules with the lighter molecules of nitrogen and oxygen unmixing does not occur at normal values of g think then of a gas before diffusion and mixing as a kind of ghost fluid with its own density and buoyancy characteristics in fact while the term fluid in everyday life is synonymous with liquid in physics it applies to both gases and liquids but a gas loses the distinguishing characteristics of its original fluidity once its had time to spread sufficient for its own kind of molecules to become separated and irreversibly mixed with other kinds of molecules further reading will mixed gases spontaneously unmix httpwwwquoracomchemistrywillmixedgasesspontaneouslyunmix heres another thats quite thoughtprovoking once you get past the unpromising preamble it has some useful qualifying material at the end re altering the composition of atmospheric gases with increasing altitude which ive quoted below finally even if the air were completely andperfectly still the carbon dioxide wouldnot form a pool on the surface there is adynamic equilibrium set up betweengravitation  the tendency for the densermaterial to go to the bottom  and diffusion– the tendency for a material not toconcentrate in one place but to spreaditself out the atmosphere we have containsroughly 78 nitrogen 21 oxygen093 argon and 0036 carbon dioxide its composition does not vary untilyou get above 80 km in height if the airwere perfectly stillits composition would be ground level 75 nitrogen 23 oxygen13 argon 0055 carbon dioxide10 km high 79 nitrogen 20 oxygen 075 argon0026 carbon dioxide20 km high 825 nitrogen 17 oxygen 043 argon0012 carbon dioxide so even in these circumstances theheavier gases like carbon dioxide wouldhave higher concentrationslower down but could not form a lethal poolhttpwwwmadsciorgpostsarchives199810906351568 chrhtml so there is an effect of sorts that relates to molecular mass heaviness even if there is no unmixing as such does that contradict anything that precedes it in this posting discuss  heres my own interpretation for what its worth of the grading by molecular sizemass with increasing altitude added september 17 2014 as one gets higher the air thins this being due to decreasing gravitational pull on everything gases included such that most gas is held relatively close to the earths surface a few tens of kilometres but another effect can then operate that discriminates according to molecular mass its to do with the average spacing between molecules and their average speed best measured were told as the root mean square velocity as the molecules become further apart they can travel further using their own intrinsic motion before colliding with another to be deflected off in a different direction impeding upward progress but a light molecule travels faster at a given temperature than a heavier one its one of the givens of kinetic molecular theory it explains why hydrogen gas diffuses faster than carbon dioxide thus there is a greater probability that a lighter molecule like hydrogen will be able to cross a given transient empty space faster than a heavier one before the gap so to speak closes up ipso facto light molecules have a greater probability of winning the race to the top of the earths atmosphere but having got there they will find they are still held by the earths gravitational field albeit much weaker than at ground level unless exceptionally light like hydrogen andor helium atoms which we are told can and do escape from the earths atmosphere leaking off into interplanetary space summary whats operating is not settling out of heavier molecules in response to gravity its the speedier motion in an otherwise unfavoured direction upwards of molecules that are lighter and thus able to diffuse faster they would diffuse anyway whether or not a gravitational field was present so gravitation becomes a secondary consideration even further reading see the excellent wiki entry on atmospheric escape which also focuses on differential rates of gaseous diffusion note im pushing the limits of my physics in offering the above interpretation if folk find it faulty andor can offer a better explanation for the sortingbysize effect with altitude then please feel free to comment however i do not consider the phenomenon is serious enough to challenge the generalization that gases do not spontaneously and efficiently unmix of their own accord at least in a natural gravitational field around a planetsize object random molecular motion with constant collisions always ensures that molecules will never completely unmix while accepting there can be concentrating effects of the kind described under normal or elevated g forces heres a handy link to physics for dummies with a section entitled using the kinetic energy formula to predict air molecule speeds the takeaway message is the inverse square law that relates molecular mass to average speed at particular temperatures a nitrogen molecule n2 can be calculated to have an average speed of 508 metres per second at 28 degrees c 301k though it would have to be in a perfect vacuum to be able to traverse that distance a molecule that was 4 times as heavy would travel at half that speed a half being the inverse square root of 4 a molecule that was half as heavy would travel at er darn where did i put that pencil off the top of my head i think the answer is root 2 times as fast thats approx 14 times as fast ie 40 faster or thereabouts a hydrogen molecule h2 has 114th the mass of a nitrogen molecule n2 so would travel 1root 114 ie approx 375 times faster addendum 18th september 2014 im not sure ive adequately explained the difference between having a gas confined within a balloon or not especially as regards the thought experiment of taking the balloon away to watch the disappearance of density characteristics sinking etc heres a homemade diagram that will be used to describe my current and still evolving thinking on the subject brace yourselves more to come first look at the righthalf of the balloon and imagine the left were the same ie an intact envelope enclosing gas all the way round in that situation the normal laws of buoyancy would apply which as a revision exercise i shall now show in three diagrams ac filched from the internet of increasing detail and complexity diagram a diagram a above shows an object only partly immersed in a fluid which is subject to two forces gravity pulling it down and buoyancy pushing it up but what is the nature of the buoyancy force the diagram does not explain lets look at another which does diagram b this diagram shows an object fully immersed in the fluid i wish that diagram a had too but beggarsfilchers cant be choosers note that the fluid exerts pressure on the object that the pressure acts in all directions that being the nature of pressure as a result of billions of random molecular collisions per second that have no single directionality note the upwards pointing arrow in the middle why is the nett force upwards buoyancy again the diagram does not explain for that we need to go to the next diagram diagram c what this diagram shows is the imbalance of forces acting on the immersed object the pressure at the bottom pressure being force per unit area is greater than at the top and indeed greater than at all points between top and bottom in other words the nett force is upwards the nett upwards force is called the upthrust for the object to float the upthrust needs to be greater than the weight of the object in air for the object to sink the upthrust must be less than the weight of the object upthrust can be measured as the weight of fluid displaced handy for calculation while not giving insights into the mechanism of upthrust which as explained is due to increasing pressure with depth producing an imbalance of forces between highest and lowest points now lets return to our sealedsoon to become leaky balloon and compare with the three diagrams above hopefully dear reader you can guess what is coming while that balloon is intact with the same kind of molecules all packed together exerting their particular density characteristics whether smaller or greater than the surrounding air then the balloon goes up or down following the laws of buoyancy the gas behaving just the same as any other fluid however imagine that balloon envelope suddenly becoming permeable with gas escaping and mixing then one no longer has a homogeneous fluid of characteristic density and buoyancy as the escaping molecules begin to mix with the surrounding molecules of air then the bulk effects disappear the molecules then behaving more or less independently from their neighbours now increasingly different what matters now are not the original bulk properties that respond to gravity andor the contingent pressure differences that depend on gravity but the behaviourof the individual particles comprising the originallyenclosed gas which is now determined by their intrinsic molecular speed which is in turn a function of temperature kinetic energy mass and velocity summed up in the term diffusibility interestingly theres a transition period between release from a confining receptacle and complete mixing whether by slow diffusion or aided by air currents etc when the body of gas is still sufficiently discrete to continue behaving as a fluid some of us recall the demo experiment in school chemistry labs where teacher takes a jar full of co2 gas and pours it over a candle or lit bunsen burner the flame being instantly extinguished in both cases come to think of it might the idea that co2 sinks and suffocates be based on reports where the gas has been released from underground say or under water as in the 1986 lake nyos disaster in cameroon  in both instances in regions of volcanic activity where the gas has vented from subterranean magma and then flowed as a fluid for a considerable time before there was time for mixing to occur lake nyos disaster 1986but that is not co2 settling out from a mixture needless to say which by now i hope is an idea that no one will entertain the lethal invisible blanket of gas issuing from the earths bowels has been able to retain its density characteristics in the period between initial venting and subsequent mixing with other gases in the atmosphere notably oxygen and nitrogen update september 22 2014 i discovered today why this posting attracts far more visitors each day than any of my other postings despite having been written some 5 years ago assuming that most visitors were finding it via their search engines i tried entering strings of search terms that correspond with the title and then whittling them down to a core set to my surprise i find that one has simply to enter co2 heavy and this posting tops the list of returns its clearly achieved that virtuous circle aka critical mass where its present prominence helps ensure continuing prominence never one to rest on laurels ive been making some additions by way of afterthoughts and picking up on points that others have raised elsewhere notably on science discussion forums where the content comes chiefly in serial additions from the participants themselves starting with someones primer question in fact theres just such a forum that arrived three years after this one posing essentially the same question and is now third in my list of google returns from spoogington some 9 months ago currently with 109 comments if co2 is heavier than o2 why is our atmosphere not stratified with a layer of co2 closer to earth looking at the points made im more than ever convinced that i was right to raise the question since clearly there is some confusion in peoples minds as there was initially in my own as to the importance or otherwise of bulk density v molecular weight where the behaviour of heavy gases is concerned before and after mixing in a gravitational field at the risk of giving this post an intimidating length i might try supplying my own answers to some of the points raised or there again it might be wise to create a separate followup post so as not to overload this one oh and heres a link to a climate change sceptic maybe denialist even who seems to think that co2 is too heavy to get into the upper atmosphere in factthe faux science gets worse as one reads on much worse sample my italics how mad with power does a group of people become that they now want to control co2 a naturally occurring colorless odorless incombustible gas formed during respiration decomposition of organic substances volcanic emissions decay of plant and soil organic matter a gas that was intelligently designed to be heavier than air for a purpose how crazy is that i invite him to read this posting and reconsider october 5 2014 have just come across this blog with a brief mention at the end of a delightful reductio ad absurdum argument look for the term layer cake atmosphere october 6 2014 and heres a mustsee paper from a kindred spirit an italian caver at turin university who unlike myself has the maths to support the theory the title says it all click to enlarge if you wish to read the abstract its available as a pdf note the date of first publication april 2009 ie some 9 months before i penned this posting but im not a plagiarizer honest no really honest not having spotted this paper until just a few days ago new addition november 8th 2014heres an additional thought experiment using co2 and helium filled balloons to demonstrate that once mixed gases do not unmix i composed it yesterday as a new blog posting and intended to add a brief summary here being somewhat busy right now heres a cutandpaste of the entire posting which i shall endeavour to prune when ive some fee time  still they keep coming to a posting i did nearly 5 years ago posted on this site jan 12 2010it wasnt as if co2 and its behaviour in a gravitational field was a burning issue at the time in fact that posting was a sideissue from my then preoccupation with the climate changeglobal warming debate which i was glad to withdraw from given the browbeating denialist tendency on msm forums it was provoked as i recall by a barmy comment to the effect that co2 had been made heavy by a benign presence gaia g uardian a ngel i n a ttendance so as to stay at lower altitudes feeding our plants not reaching higher altitudes where it might cause mischief heres a snapshot from my sitemeter showing that 11 of the last 20 visits have been to that posting 13 is a more typical average the red tags are mine pointing to the co2 posting quite why it still gets all the attention i havent a clue maybe its because im a londoner its currently the second listing one sees if entering co2 heavy into google sometimes its the first he says in a rare moment of modestybypass to be honest ive been somewhat embarrassed that a instant tutorial should now be seen as the first or second stop on a simple nontechnical web search so much so that i gave it a spring clean this last september adding bits here and there to strengthen the case as im only 999 certain about my conviction that normal g forces  from the earths own pull  are insufficient to cause unmixing of co2 and stratification once the gas has diffused and mixed with the nitrogen and oxygen of air with that as preamble folk should perhaps understand why im back again still finetuning still whittling down that stubborn 01 of doubt what i wish to describe now is a thought experiment yes i know it should or could have been a real one but if thought experiments were good enough for albert einstein then they are good enough for me  thats my story and im sticking to it its a development of the teaching aid in the original posting which began with a brief look at the behaviour of gases trapped inside balloons where they do indeed show their heavier or lighterthanair characteristics thats before the gases have escaped from their balloons then diffused and mixed with air and lost their ability to sink settle out stratify call it what you wish last night i had a brainwave why not keep the gases trapped inside their balloons and allow them to mix by diffusion which may take a few minutes possibly a lot of minutes for totally even and homogeneous mixing but mix they will such is the nature of gaseous diffusion how might the behaviour of the balloons compare before and after mixing lets do that thought experiment before opening the valve the two attached balloons may ascend descend or stay put depending on the relative size of the two balloons and the average density of the two gases compared to that of the surrounding air if the average density is less the system ascends etc and it wont matter a jot whether the gases are separate or premixed or postmixed for that to be true  important for what follows but one things for certain the two balloons will remain oriented with respect to each other as in the diagram with the blue helium balloon on top thats because it always experiences more upthrust than the red balloon displacing a greater volume of air for a given weight of enclosed gas if one attempts to alter the stacking geometry the system will selfcorrect when released now lets picture what happens if the valve is opened or the fusible wax plug is melted allowing the two gases to mix one could allow mixing by diffusion only which means a lot of waiting alternatively one can speed up mixing by inverting the balloons as shown belowxx the lighter gas helium now underneath will ascend the heavier co2 will descend and being a twoway countercurrent system there will be faster mixing than if it were by diffusion alone a series of inversion rerighting reinversion etc should result in a homogeneous distribution of gases between the two balloons what happens when one releases the two still attached after mixing answer if the original system ascended so will the new one if the original system descended so will the new one if the original system was perfectly balanced neither ascending nor descending so will the new one but there will be a difference both balloons are now equally buoyant or nonbuoyant depending on the proportions of the two gases so there will be no tendency for one balloon to be above the other in other words the two balloons can adopt any configuration through 360 degrees with a slight tendency maybe for the smaller balloon to lead the way if rising or sinking due to aerodynamic differences so the two attached balloons might go up go down or stay put looking like this or like this or any angles of rotation in between one things for certain restoring the original configuration to blue on top red underneath will not cause reversion to the original selfcorrecting orientation since that would require that the gases unmix with co2 going back into the red balloon helium going back on top that as weve seen simply does not happen at normal values of g which is where we came in posted by sciencebod at 621 amlabels gaseous diffusion  gases do not unmix38 comments anastasia fb said hey colin it all looks good  i tried to add myself to your followers

fraction my age was mrs bn your head of languages january 26 2010 at 108 amanonymous said not sure that this is entirely correct there will always be some fractionation of the different components or in other words the concentration of co2 would always be slightly higher at lower elevations the solution of gases can increase its overall entropy by mixing but the number densities of each molecular component will still be distributed exponentially at equilibrium with height according to its mass density httpwwwshefacukphysicspeoplerjonespdfsphy101phy101raljlecture6pdf it is not precisely true to say “1g force that acts on all molecules in air at sea level is insufficient to overcome the kinetic forces” rather 1g of acceleration is not sufficient to fractionate the mixtures to as noticeable a degree as you would see when placed in a centrifuge there isn’t a “threshold acceleration“ where the solution all of a sudden separates it’s a continuous process february 17 2010 at 112 pmmarry said

molecules acting upward and downward statistically cancel each other leaving a net small force of gravity acting downward causing the co2 to sink i mean i understand it doesnt sink but doesnt this contradict your explanation june 25 2013 at 1159 amsciencebod said arent you forgetting something doug  entropy you start with a somewhat ordered arrangement at least for a gas namely a lot of the same molecules all confined in the same volume of space once those molecular collisions begin to knock molecules into the surrounding space the mixing effect is irreversible because you know on probability and statistical grounds that once gases are mixed they do not spontaneously ummix thats because new collisions do not and cannot restore the initial arrangement that existed initially the example i used to give my students was that of their bedrooms if they were perfectly neat and tidy highly improbable scenario admittedly then a gust of wind through an open window would create disorder but if the initial state were disordered then the probability of the same gust of wind creating order is essentially zero there being an almost infinite number of other disordered arrangements compared with tidy conventional ones with books in rows on shelves not in rows on the bed the effects of gravity are minute when compared with the spontaneous mixing due to molecular motion june 26 2013 at 116 amjae kwon said but what if the air column were long high would the effect of gravity have more of an impact on high columns i bet it would the time and column height might be inversely proportional to g if so we can capture carbon dioxide by just blowing air into a long column and let gravity do the work august 9 2013 at 458 pmdan b said all being said on this matter where should i place my carbon monoxide detector on the first or second floor of my house november 22 2014 at 715 pmsciencebod said hi dan b i dont know if theres any official advice on that have you tried goggling carbon monoxide detector best location house commonsense would say you put the detector as close as possible to the most likely source of co which in most peoples homes would be the gas central heating boiler or gas cooker dont worry about not being able to hear itnovember 22 2014 at 1036 pmmike fantau saidsciencebod can you help clarify this in the upper atmosphere for us if gases do not unmix till over80km how is there an ozone layer how do cfcs accumulate at this layer 1050 kms shouldnt this just be distributed through the whole atmosphere december 3 2014 at 457 amsciencebod said interesting question mike ill need a day or two to think about it december 5 2014 at 114 pmsciencebod said i still need more time to research your comment mike for now id just say this the reason for upperatmosphere ozone being way up there but below the unmixing layer may have something to do with the way its formed incoming solar radiation has first to split o2 into its separate atoms those o atoms then have to find another intact o2 molecule to form o3 and to do so before they simply collide with the lighter o atoms to reform o2 futile cycle maybe theres an optimal height for ozone formation and the subsequent uvbabsorbing oxygenozone cycle to operate as for cfcs i wasnt aware they concentrated at a certain height i thought they just got there from our old fridges etc by diffusion a process taking months maybe years once there they cause destruction of ozone by free radical processes initiationpropagationtermination i seem to recall reading that one cfc molecule can destroy 19000  molecules before a free chlorine atom or other cfcderived free radical meets another of its own kind to finally terminate the chain reaction december 6 2014 at 1020 pmsciencebod said nicely put mike119december 10 2014 at 803 amsciencebod said nicely put mike december 10 2014 at 804 amalvin stroyny said my comment concerns the relative concentration of co2 in the air that we breathe while sleeping in a closed room assuming a co2 exhalation rate of 200mlmin over 8 hours 2 adults would produce a total of approximately 675 cf of co2 in a 12x15x8 bedroom 1440cf this would result in increasing co2 from 350ppm fresh air level to just over 5000ppm by morning assuming no air leakage from the room breathing however is an oscillating air flow inhalation exhalation at a point our nose thus the air that we breathe in every 5 seconds is in part the same air we exhaled besides gaseous diffusion air currents due to breathing will cause some degree of mixing and dilution of co2 levels the assumption of perfect diffusion throughout the room however must be questioned this issue begs the study of co2 concentration near our nose while sleeping versus the rest of the room space to get a better understanding of what is the percentage of co2 in the air that we breathe while sleeping over the course of the night a lowspeed ceiling fan would seem to offer a good solution to meeting the assumption of perfect diffusion april 11 2015 at 524 amsamuel reeve saidactually i thought your dual balloon experiment would result in whichever balloon is below the other becoming marginally denser as co2 conc would be higher further down as per your stats earlier regarding atmospheric concentrations in a static system the gas filters down until it reaches equilibrium between gravitational forces and kinetic forces that you mentioned earlier so that if the conc lower down is reduced say by plants more co2 will replace it from higher up may 16 2015 at 349 pmpmc kay said fantastic blog ive asked many chemists over the years about this and all talk about the buoyancy of the gas causing lighter gases to rise ive always thought the velocities would cause complete mixing over time in my line of work i use many different mixtures of gases in cylinders for calibrating industrial gas analysers  these cylinders have laboratory certified concentration none say shake before use despite containing mixtures of hydrocarbons ranging from methane through to nonane regards phil yarra valley  australiajune 14 2015 at 538 pmlily fong said agen judi online agen judi agen judi

2015 at 852 amandrew chanler said i found this post searching is co2 heavier than air i was thinking about home brew beer what happens in the air between the brewing beer and the airlock it starts out as a stand mux of air my original thought was that the co2 generated as a byproduct of fermentation would be heavier than the rest of the air and push that air out through the air lock so after enough fermentation only co2 would be left but now after reading your post i suspect there is still some other gases in the head room even after a large volume of co2 is generated another topic would be carbonation i have heard that co2 dissolves into a cooled liquid faster im not sure if that is true or not for making home made ginger beer i let it ferment for a day or two in a sealed plastic bottle then put it in the fridge when it becomes under pressure if i open it right away most of the co2 escapes and it is flat if i wait a few days in the fridge the ginger beer becomes carbonated the other benefit obviously is the fridge stops the fermentation january 7 2016 at 633 pmandrew chanler said this comment has been removed by the author january 8 2016 at 333 amkeith saidi got here by way of searching carbon dioxide in balloons thank you for intelligent discourse march 10 2016 at 845 ammark a flores said greetings i’m a 60 yo layperson who now enjoys reading science blogs cstudent in high school and i have a question while reading about arguments foragainst a young earth i came across the position that the levels of helium4 in earth’s atmosphere should be much higher if the earth was 4 billion years old the writer states that the reason for the lower levels of he4 found in our atmosphere is because of the ejection of he4 at the poles caused by the earth’s magnetic field sort of a ‘polar wind’ here’s my question are other molecules also subject to the same forces at earth’s poles does the earth ‘cleans’ it self keeping a ‘natural’ balance of nitrogen oxygen argon and carbon dioxide and btw thanks for writing and presenting your ideas the way to do so that the rest of us mortals can understand the principles being presented december 25 2016 at 847 amsciencebod said fascinating mark sorry  i plead ignorance this blogger has some reading and catching up to do re he4  and then those other gases too enjoy whats left of christmas day colin berry uk december 25 2016 at 1202 pmwhitefarmer saidi think you are incorrect in saying that it is because of gravity decreasing the more one goes out into space that there is decreased atmospheric pressure there that would not explain why venus has 92 bar at its surface but is slightly less massive than earth the actual reason is because of the weight of atmosphere resting on top of the lower layers also in your example of a balloon with helium and one with co2 being connected and let mix you say that the balloons have a different upthrust as if they were different sizes but upthrust is the same since the atmosphere is the same for both the difference however is the amount of downthrust that the co2 balloon gives compared to the helium one january 8 2017 at 1038 amwhitefarmer said btw i found your page when searching the density of nitrogen in comparison to co2 with reference to the havoc mission to venus january 8 2017 at 1157 amgraham w said i agree with whitefarmer after a quote discussing gas proportions up to 20km you write as one gets higher the air thins this being due to decreasing gravitational pull on everything gases included your argument depends on gravity being significantly less at a radius of 6390km than it is at 6370km i believe that comes out to about 06 reduction in gravity thats surely trivial compared to the effect of pressure attributable to weight of air above which is reduced from 1 atm at sea level to less than 01 atm above 12km apparently june 12 2017 at 229 amunknown saidthank the good topic gclubgclub onlinegoldenslot june 18 2017 at 750 pmmike mc keaney said i have a related question if co2 does not sink in open space due to mixing caused by air currents then why is the ocean considered a massive co2 sink it seems that between the nearconstant wind and the sloshing of waves at the surface this would be impossible also how can 400 ppm of co2 the equivalent of 4 people spread out through a 10000 seat arena trap heat this has always intrigued me and ive never seen the topic discussed january 18 2018 at 721 amjohn w plymouth mi said thank you i was wondering why the radon doest stay in the basement february 23 2018 at 632 pmpost a comment

added october 6 2016  thanks for visiting this post penned some 6 years ago its still attracting 152 one final post from this science bod on why he thinks the shroud of turin is a medieval fake update added 10th april 2012  my continuing research and ideas on the turin shroud are now to be found on two specialist sites the more  my new sandpit theory for how the turin shroud was produced  as a medieval hoax the basic principle  thermal imprinting from a 3d object ed things have moved on a bit since writing this post for a more uptoda the origins of life nucleic acids purines pyrimidines and extraterrestrial cyanide newsflash monday 10th october 2016 have just come across this item in the mail httpwwwdailymailcouksciencetecharticle3830773 how was the turin shroud faked first experimental test of my sandpit theory they say one picture is worth a thousand words well here are just two pictures for starters showing an extreme scorch image produced by m time to tell wiki about my latest idea  the turin shoud image while still a scorch from a heated metal template was intended to be seen as a sweat imprint left on linen by the real recentlydeceased jesus yes ive taken a leaf from charles freemans book and submitted a brief synopsis of my simulated sweat imprint idea to w the turin shroud  could it have been produced by thermostencilling original note reversed lightdark

grassroots to david cameron diary of a day spent with a peace corps worker in ghana xmas 1967guest blog from groce get rid of cow emissionsdo you have a theory of nearly everything i do based on what ive picked up here and there from the writings of davis hawking gribbin etc heres a summary posted recently to the telegraph in response to the question dark matter how would you explain it had there been a beginning there wasnt as it happens there would initially have been complete nothingness but just as nature abhors a vacuum its totally gutted at the thought of nothingness i mean to say  how far does nothingness extend assuming it has one of more dimensions it cant extend for an infinite distance since that would be a physical impossibility nothingness to avoid having infinite reach coils up on itself to acquire finite dimensions in so doing it becomes somethingness which has a springlike potential energy  the total energy in fact of the universe from that potential energy present in what we now call space or spacetime which is anything but empty is spawned all subatomic particles  both matter and antimatter when those particles collide they mutually annihilate to create photons the reverse can also happen under extreme conditions  two photons can collide to create matter and antimatter it is potential energy in the springcoiled universe that is our dark energy it may or may not have mass depending on conditions a moment when it has no mass is the instant of the big bang let me briefly explain an oscillating universe switches between big bang and big crunch with the latter gravitation pulls everything into a super blackhole which then becomes a singularity  a massively dense point in spacetime what prevents it becoming infinitely small  a physical impossibility answer friction as the subatomic plasma contracts and grinds heat is generated which cannot escape  being a black hole the temperature rises ie particles in the plasma move faster and faster when they reach their maximum velocity  the speed of light all particles are suddenly transformed into photons which as we know have no true mass at least no rest mass any mass they have is purely relativistic due to their speed once the entire universe is a superconcentration of photons all the gravitational forces in the singularity collapse to zero or nearly so and the entire thing blows apart  a new big bang to create yet another cycle inflation big crunch implosion etc the big bang creates not just subatomic particles  from photonphoton collisions but spacetime itself to reiterate that spacetime is always suffused with the stored potential energy of our curledup dimensions dark energy
