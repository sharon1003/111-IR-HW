content abstract while data exist on the prevalence and causes of anemia in defined groups of the elderly information on palliative care patients is limited compared to actively treated oncology patients for whom anemia treatment has demonstrated improved quality of life and symptom alleviation studies of treatment outcomes in palliative care patients are limited knowledge of the extent and causes of anemia in palliative care patients is needed as correction of anemia in these patients could potentially improve their physical emotional and cognitive functioning in the present study clinical data and blood test results of 105 patients meeting specific eligibility criteria were examined to estimate the prevalence of anemia and investigate its causes ninetyfive 905 patients had advanced cancer based on world health organization criteria anemia was found in 77 of men hb 130 gl and 682 of women hb 120 gl the diagnosis was anemia of chronic disease in 767 of women and 468 of men patients with prostate cancer had a significantly lower mean hb level p  0007 and more evidence of bone metastases p  00007 than those with other cancers neutrophil hypersegmentation suggesting occult folate deficiency was present in 286 of patients being more common in those with major weight loss 583 than those with moderate 37 or mildno weight loss 26 p  0019 the findings suggest that anemia is highly prevalent in the palliative care setting although anemia of chronic disease is most common occult folate deficiency may be more prevalent than previously suspected the findings suggest that a low serum folate level is an insensitive marker of occult folate deficiency a randomized controlled trial of folic acid treatment is proposed previous article next article keywords anemia palliative care prevalence causes treatment introduction in contrast to the elderly population 1–4 the prevalence of anemia in the palliative care population has not been previously described although the clinical significance of anemia in palliative care patients has been receiving increasing recognition 5 there has been less attention given to identifying and correcting its causes possible reasons for this are the expense and invasiveness of treatments and the perception that palliative patients are too ill for active treatment the world health organization who defines anemia as a hemoglobin hb level of 120 gl in women and 130 gl in men 6 as in other patient groups potential causes of anemia in palliative care patients include blood loss impaired red cell formation by the marrow and excess red cell destruction 7 factors impairing red cell formation may include deficiencies of iron folic acid and vitamin b 12 the poorly understood processes leading to anemia of chronic disease and marrow infiltration disseminated malignancy the prevalence of anemia in groups of elderly in hospitals rest homes or the community has been found to range from 8 to 26 1–4 general populationbased studies of anemia have reported prevalence rates of 9 to 44 with the highest prevalence in men 85 years or more 89 recently prevalence rates of 41 preradiation and 54 postradiation have been found in cancer patients undergoing radiation 10 the prevalence of anemia in palliative care populations is unknown anemia of chronic disease has been identified as the most common cause of anemia in the elderly followed by iron deficiency then folic acid or vitamin b 12 deficiency 11 evidence exists that occult folic acid deficiency where there is no evidence of overt erythrocyte macrocytosis is frequent in the elderly and can contribute to cognitive impairment 1213 presumably folic acid deficiency is also common in palliative care patients because of their poor dietary intake increased demands for folic acid due to malignancy and treatment with folic acid antagonist drugs 5 but this has not been previously demonstrated noncontrolled studies 1415 on the response of cancer patients to erythropoietin epo treatment for chronic anemia have found reasonable responses increase in hb≥20 gl for solid tumors and multiple myeloma but poor responses for myelodysplasia randomized controlled studies 16–18 have investigated the effects of epo treatment on hb levels and transfusion requirements in patients undergoing chemotherapy these studies found that up to twothirds of patients achieved an hb increase of at least 20 gl there was a reduction in the numbers of patients requiring transfusion and patients ratings of their quality of life improved a recent study 19 showed incremental improvements in quality of life with every gram rise in hb concentration confirming that the ideal hb target level between 110 and 130 gl for enhancing quality of life is higher than previously thought published studies on the treatment of anemia in the terminally ill are limited however noncontrolled studies on the effectiveness of transfusing anemic palliative care patients found that transfusion alleviated some symptoms and improved patients wellbeing 2021fatigue is recognized as a common symptom of cancerrelated anemia 2223 with other symptoms also being attributed to anemia 2425 fatigue has also been shown to have a negative effect on patients quality of life 26–28despite the emphasis on symptom alleviation and improvement in quality of life in palliative care the extent causes effects and treatment of anemia have received limited attention this review aimed to determine the prevalence and causes of anemia in patients admitted to a hospice facility and to identify patient groups that could be involved in future trials of treatment for anemia methods sample a prospective audit of clinicaldemographic information and routine blood test results was undertaken for all patients admitted to mary potter hospices inpatient unit from june 1 to november 30 2001 those excluded from the review included 1 children aged16 years 2 those who had been transfused less than four weeks prior to admission or who were currently receiving a transfusion 3 patients who had completed chemotherapy less than four weeks prior to admission and 4 very ill patients who would not normally have had routine blood tests done wellington ethics committee approval was obtained for the procedures which involved access to patients medical file information and laboratory test results and close examination of blood films review of blood test results the following tests were included in the review 1 full blood count fbc and complete automated parameters 2 serum iron studies iron total iron binding capacity ferritin 3 serum vitamin b 12 level 4 red blood cell folate level and serum folate and 5 serum creatinine and albumin standard mgg stained blood films routinely prepared by the laboratory at the time of a request for a fbc were collected and stored by the hematology laboratory at wellington public hospital the films were examined in batches using a ‘blinded’ methodology by one of the investigators jc evidence of marrow infiltration leucoerythroblastic features tumorassociated microangiopathic hemolytic anemia schistocytes and folatevitamin b 12 deficiency hypersegmented neutrophils were specifically recorded as were other nonspecific abnormalities neutrophil hypersegmentation was objectively determined by observing 100 consecutive neutrophils and calculating the segmentation index 29clinical and demographic data an audit form was prepared for the purposes of recording demographic and clinical information extracted from the patients medical files the following data were documented patients age and sex stage of illness receipt of chemotherapy less than four weeks prior to admission alcohol dependency and drugs causing folate deficiency including antibiotics and antiepileptics symptoms commonly associated with anemia were routinely recorded as absent or present by hospice doctors at the time of the patients admission using a standard medical assessment form doctors judged whether these symptoms were present on the basis of clinical examination as well as discussions with patients they also recorded degree of symptoms as absent mild moderate and severe data analysis the data were entered into a computer database and analyzed using the epi 6 and sas statistical programs chisquare tests were used for group comparisons which involved categorical variables and fishers exact tests were used where cell numbers were less than 5 pearson correlations were performed on hb versus blood test values as serum folate iron and vitamin b 12 appeared to be lognormally distributed analysis was performed on the log of the values in contrast serum albumin and patients age appeared to be normally distributed unpaired t tests were used to compare mean hb levels between 1 patients with and without the presence of particular anemiarelated symptoms and 2 patients with and without anorexia an unpaired t test was performed to compare mean serum folate levels between patients with neutrophil hypersegmentation and those without results patients the review included 105 patients exclusions comprised two

folate levels in those without neutrophil hypersegmentation were 107 95 ci  084 138 times the level of those with neutrophil hypersegmentation discussion nearly 80 of men and 70 of women were anemic on the basis of the who criteria indicating that it is a common entity in this hospice group as the study excluded patients who were very ill the prevalence of anemia in the total inpatient group was likely to have been even higher this prevalence was high compared to the rates found in defined groups of the elderly 1–4 and large general population studies 89 and comparable to the rates found in cancer patients following chemotherapy or radiotherapy 1030 for example a recent study of patients with advanced cancer showed a rate of anemia of 41 prior to radiotherapy rising to 54 post radiotherapy 10 tas et al 30 found that the prevalence of anemia in cancer patients prechemotherapy varied by cancer type breast cancer patients had a rate of anemia of 44 prechemotherapy increasing to 60 postchemotherapy the highest rate of anemia was found in lymphoma patients 82 were anemic prechemotherapy with little change occurring after chemotherapy a significant difference between hospice cancer patients and advanced cancer patients undergoing therapy is that in the latter group anemia may recover over a period of weeks following chemotherapy or radiotherapy if the disease responds to treatment while in hospice cancer patients anemia is likely to worsen as the disease progresses anemia was found to be significantly more prevalent in male patients with cancer than men with a noncancer diagnosis an explanation for this was that three of the seven men with a noncancer diagnosis had chronic respiratory disease with a corresponding normalhigh hb the lack of difference found between women with cancer and those without cancer was probably attributable to the small study numbers in the noncancer group anemia of chronic disease was found to be a common cause of anemia in this palliative care group being present in almost 50 of men and over 70 of women with anemia a probable cause of anemia of chronic disease is a complex interaction of inflammatory cytokines released as part of the inflammatory process causing a blunting of the usual erythropoietin response to anemia and the impaired release of iron from the reticuloendothelial system 31 the rates of anemia of chronic disease in this study were higher than the rates up to 45 reported in anemic elderly patients in hospitals 11 and rates in cancer patients which have been found to vary from 10 to 60 depending on the type of cancer and whether or not patients are receiving chemotherapy 24 similar mechanisms to those producing the anemia of chronic disease are presumably responsible for the high prevalence of hypoalbuminemia and rouleaux found in this study it should be noted that in palliative care patients the causes of anemia may be difficult to determine as anemia is often a mixed picture including anemia of chronic disease bone marrow infiltration with neoplasia and blood loss 5 although there was no evidence of uncomplicated iron deficiency anemia in this group iron deficiency anemia was likely to have been common the detection of iron deficiency anemia based on blood parameters is complicated because of the mixed etiology of anemia serum ferritin which is traditionally low in iron deficiency can be raised by coexistent inflammation malignancy and hepatic disease and can mask iron deficiency 31 a more definitive test for iron deficiency anemia is examination of the bone marrow aspirate for iron content although this test may now be superseded by the transferrin receptor assay 32nearly 7 of patients had a low vitamin b 12 level which is similar to the percent found in some elderly populations 11 although just over 20 of patients had a low serum folic acid level blood film examinations suggested that occult folic acid deficiency occurred in nearly 30 of patients in contrast to vitamin b 12 stores which last up to two years body stores of folic acid can be depleted in four to five months 32 the theoretical likelihood that folic acid deficiency is common in palliative care patients where dietary deficiency increased tissue demands resulting from neoplasia and the effects of folatedepleting drugs are often present was confirmed by this study examination of blood films for neutrophil hypersegmentation has been recommended as a reliable method for identifying deficiencies in folate and vitamin b 12 as well as the presence of uremia 33 furthermore hypersegmentation is reportedly the first hematogical abnormality to appear in folate deficiency 33 in this study examination of the peripheral blood film for neutrophil hypersegmentation provided a convenient method for investigating folic acid tissue deficiency as blood films are routinely prepared by the laboratory on the request of a full blood count in line with previous studies 34 these study findings suggested that a low serum folic acid level is not a sensitive indicator of tissue folic acid deficiency this study also confirmed previous observations 33 that neutrophil hypersegmentation often occurs in the absence of erythrocyte macrocytosis although serum homocysteine and methylmalonic acid levels are reportedly better indicators of folic acid and vitamin b 12 deficiency 3435 these assays are not routinely performed by the laboratory the proportion of palliative care patients in this study with suggestive folic acid deficiency nearly 30 was high compared to rates of 5–10 which have been found in elderly european populations 11 the findings also suggested that the presence of folic acid deficiency becomes progressively higher as weight loss increases these findings are significant as folic acid deficiency is reportedly associated with neuropsychiatric disorders 1213 and improvements in cognition and depression in elderly patients have been found after folic acid supplementation 13fatigue and weakness were found to be common symptoms in this palliative care group occurring in 85 and 79 of patients respectively in contrast to other studies 2223 this study did not find a significant association between anemia and presence of fatigue this may have been because physicians did not use an instrument that was sensitive to measuring anemiarelated fatigue given the multifactorial cause of fatigue in terminally ill patients the use of an instrument specifically designed to measure anemiarelated fatigue is recommended for future studies the functional assessment of cancer therapy anemia factan which has been validated in cancer patients has been found to successfully discriminate patients on the basis of hb levels and performance status 22the study found that patients with advanced prostate cancer were significantly more likely to have a lower mean hb level and presence of bone metastases than other cancer patients as prostate cancer patients are commonly represented in palliative care populations further research is recommended to investigate the effectiveness of treatments for anemia in this group in conclusion the findings confirmed the relatively high prevalence of anemia in this inpatient palliative care group they also suggested a high prevalence of occult folic acid deficiency which progressively increased as weight loss increased clinicians working in palliative care have long emphasized the need to treat the patient and not just the blood test perhaps the time has come for closer attention to be paid to the blood test as a means of improving the quality of life of palliative care patients this recommendation is supported by the growing evidence that raising hb levels to within normal parameters eg women ≥120 gl men ≥130 gl in cancer patients significantly improves their quality of life scores 36 however when treating anemia in palliative care patients factors such as the cost effectiveness and degree of invasiveness of the treatments must be considered on the basis of the findings a randomized controlled trial is proposed to determine whether or not folic acid treatment is effective in improving the quality of life and cognitive functioning of folic acid deficient patients receiving palliative care in undertaking this trial there is a need to carefully monitor the effects of folic acid treatment on the subgroups of patients with moderate and major weight loss in whom there is suggestive evidence of high rates of folic acid deficiency acknowledgements our thanks to the wellington
