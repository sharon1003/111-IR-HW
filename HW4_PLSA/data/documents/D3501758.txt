capitalizations of at least 1 billion as well as familyowned stakes of at least 20 percent the 920 companies are found in 35 countries with more than 64 percent coming from emerging asia in more developed markets we see more fragmented ownership and many families selling out over time as a general theme credit suisse analysts noted frequently quoted statistics from the family business institute show that only one third of familyowned businesses last into a second generation of ownership 12 to a third and just 3 to a fourth but some of these companies have been controlled by families for generations and no family business comes without family troubles many of these companies have experienced very public feuds between relatives and with transgressions ranging from bribery
