session on 10 december 1948 as resolution 217 at the palais de chaillot in paris france of the then 58 members of the united nations 48 voted in favor none against eight abstained and two did not vote the declaration consists of 30 articles affirming an individuals rights which although not legally binding in themselves have been elaborated in subsequent international treaties economic transfers regional human rights instruments national constitutions and other laws the declaration was the first step in the process of formulating the international bill of human rights which was completed in 1966 and came into force in 1976 after a sufficient number of countries had ratified them some legal scholars have argued that because countries have constantly invoked the declaration for more than 50 years it has become binding as a part of customary international law 1 2 however in the united states the supreme court in sosa v alvarezmachain 2004 concluded that the declaration does not of its own force impose obligations as a matter of international law 3 courts of other countries have also concluded that the declaration is not in and of itself part of domestic law contents  hide 1

playing this file see media help main article history of human rights during world war ii the allies adopted the four freedoms — freedom of speech freedom of religion freedom from fear and freedom from want —as their basic war aims  citation needed the united nations charter reaffirmed faith in fundamental human rights and dignity and worth of the human person and committed all member states to promote universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race sex language or religion 7when the atrocities committed by nazi germany became fully apparent after world war ii the consensus within the world community was that the united nations charter did not sufficiently define the rights to which it referred 8 9 a universal declaration that specified the rights of individuals was necessary to give effect to the charters provisions on human rights 10creation and drafting main article drafting of the universal declaration of human rights in june 1946 the un economic and social council established the commission on human rights comprising 18 members from various nationalities and political backgrounds the commission a standing body of the united nations was constituted to undertake the work of preparing what was initially conceived as an international bill of rights 11the commission established a special universal declaration of human rights drafting committee chaired by eleanor roosevelt to write the articles of the declaration the committee met in two sessions over the course of two years canadian john peters humphrey director of the division of human rights within the united nations secretariat was called upon by the united nations secretarygeneral to work on the project and became the declarations principal drafter 12 at the time humphrey was newly appointed as director of the division of human rights within the united nations secretariat 13other wellknown members of the drafting committee included rené cassin of france charles malik of lebanon and p c chang of the republic of china taiwan 14 humphrey provided the initial draft which became the working text of the commission according to allan carlson the declarations profamily phrases were the result of the christian democratic movements influence on cassin and malik 15once the committee finished its work in may 1948 the draft was further discussed by the commission on human rights the economic and social council the third committee of the general assembly before being put to vote in december 1948 during these discussions many amendments and propositions were made by un member states 16british representatives were extremely frustrated that the proposal had moral but no legal obligation 17 it was not until 1976 that the international covenant on civil and political rights came into force giving a legal status to most of the declaration adoption the universal declaration was adopted by the general assembly as resolution 217 on 10 december 1948 of the then 58 members 18 of the united nations 48 voted in favor none against eight abstained 19 20 and honduras and yemen failed to vote or abstain 21in miniature book the meeting record 22 provides firsthand insight into the debate south africas position can be seen as an attempt to protect its system of apartheid which clearly violated several articles in the declaration 19 the saudi arabian delegations abstention was prompted primarily by two of the declarations articles article 18 which states that everyone has the right to change his religion or belief and article 16 on equal marriage rights 19 the six communist countries abstentions centred around the view that the declaration did not go far enough in condemning fascism and nazism 23 eleanor roosevelt attributed the abstention of soviet bloc countries to article 13 which provided the right of citizens to leave their countries 24the 48 countries which voted in favour of the declaration are 25voters and abstainers in the plenary session in green countries that voted in favour in orange those who abstained in black countries which failed to abstain or vote in grey countries which were not

declarations draft but later voted in favor of the final draft in the general assembly 268 countries abstained 25byelorussian ssr byelorussiaczechoslovakia poland saudi arabia soviet union ukrainian ssr ukraineunion of south africa yugoslavia other countries only gained sovereignty and joined the united nations later 27 which explains the relatively small number of states entitled to the historical vote and in no way reflects opposition to the universal principles international human rights day main article human rights day the declaration of human rights day is commemorated every year on december 10 the anniversary of the adoption of the universal declaration and is known as human rights day or international human rights day the commemoration is observed by individuals community and religious groups human rights organizations parliaments governments and the united nations decadal commemorations are often accompanied by campaigns to promote awareness of the declaration and human rights 2008 marked the 60th anniversary of the declaration and was accompanied by yearlong activities around the theme dignity and justice for all of us 28significance and legal effect significance in 1948 the un resolution ares217 iii a adopted the declaration on a bilingual document in english and french and official translations in chinese russian and spanish 29 in 2009 the guinness book of records described the declaration as the worlds most translated document 370 different languages and dialects 30 31 the unicode consortium stores 431 32 of the 503 33 official translations available at the ohchr as of june 2017  in its preamble governments commit themselves and their people to progressive measures which secure the universal and effective recognition and observance of the human rights set out in the declaration eleanor roosevelt supported the adoption of the declaration as a declaration rather than as a treaty because she believed that it would have the same kind of influence on global society as the united states declaration of independence had within the united states  citation needed in this she proved to be correct even though it is not legally binding the declaration has been adopted in or has influenced most national constitutions since 1948 it has also served as the foundation for a growing number of national laws international laws and treaties as well as for a growing number of regional sub national and national institutions protecting and promoting human rights for the first time in international law the term “the rule of law” was used in the preamble of the declaration the third paragraph of the preamble of the declaration reads as follows whereas it is essential if man is not to be compelled to have recourse as a last resort to rebellion against tyranny and oppression that human rights should be protected by the rule of law 34legal effect while not a treaty itself the declaration was explicitly adopted for the purpose of defining the meaning of the words  fundamental freedoms  and human rights appearing in the united nations charter which is binding on all member states for this reason the universal declaration of human rights is a fundamental constitutive document of the united nations in addition many international lawyers 35 36 37 38 believe that the declaration forms part of customary international law 39 and is a powerful tool in applying diplomatic and moral pressure to governments that violate any of its articles the 1968 united nations international conference on human rights advised that the declaration constitutes an obligation for the members of the international community to all persons the declaration has served as the foundation for two binding un human rights covenants the international covenant on civil and political rights and the international covenant on economic social and cultural rights the principles of the declaration are elaborated in international treaties such as the international convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination the international convention on the elimination of discrimination against women the united nations convention on the rights of the child the united nations convention against torture and many more the declaration continues to be widely cited by governments academics advocates and constitutional courts and by individuals who appeal to its principles for the protection of their recognised human rights reaction praise the universal declaration has received praise from a number of notable people the lebanese philosopher and diplomat charles malik called it an international document of the first order of importance 40 while eleanor roosevelt —first chairwoman of the commission on human rights chr that drafted the declaration—stated that it may well become the international magna carta of all men everywhere 41 in a speech on 5 october 1995 pope john paul ii called the declaration one of the highest expressions of the human conscience of our time but the vatican never adopted the declaration 42 in a statement on 10 december 2003 on behalf of the european union marcello spatafora said that the declaration placed human rights at the centre of the framework of principles and obligations shaping relations within the international community 43criticism islamic countries turkey — which was a secular state with an overwhelmingly muslim population—signed the declaration in 1948 44 however the same year saudi arabia abstained from the ratification vote on the declaration claiming that it violated sharia law 45pakistan —which had signed the declaration—disagreed and critiqued the saudi position 46 pakistani minister muhammad zafarullah khan strongly argued in favor of including freedom of religion 47 in 1982 the iranian representative to the united nations said rajaiekhorassani said that the declaration was a secular understanding of the judeochristian tradition which could not be implemented by muslims without conflict with sharia 48 on 30 june 2000 members of the organisation of the islamic conference now the organisation of islamic cooperation officially resolved to support the cairo declaration on human rights in islam 49 an alternative document that says people have freedom and right to a dignified life in accordance with the islamic shariah without any discrimination on grounds of race colour language sex religious belief political affiliation social status or other considerations some muslim diplomats would go on later to help draft other un human rights treaties for example iraqi diplomat bedia afnan s insistence on wording that recognized gender equality resulted in article 3 within the iccpr and icescr pakistani diplomat shaista suhrawardy ikramullah also spoke in favor of recognizing womens rights 47a number of scholars in different fields have expressed concerns with the declarations alleged western bias these include irene oh abdulaziz sachedina riffat hassan and faisal kutty hassan has argued what needs to be pointed out to those who uphold the universal declaration of human rights to be the highest or sole model of a charter of equality and liberty for all human beings is that given the western origin and orientation of this declaration the universality of the assumptions on which it is based is – at the very least – problematic and subject to questioning furthermore the alleged incompatibility between the concept of human rights and religion in general or particular religions such as islam needs to be examined in an unbiased way 50irene oh argues that one solution is to approach the issue from the perspective of comparative descriptive ethics 51kutty writes a strong argument can be made that the current formulation of international human rights constitutes a cultural structure in which western society finds itself easily at home  it is important to acknowledge and appreciate that other societies may have equally valid alternative conceptions of human rights 52ironically a number of islamic countries that as of 2014 are among the most resistant to un intervention in domestic affairs played an invaluable role in the creation of the declaration with countries such as syria and egypt having been strong proponents of the universality of human rights and the right of countries to selfdetermination 53the right to refuse to killgroups such as amnesty international 54 and war resisters international 55 have advocated for the right to refuse to kill to be added to the universal declaration war resisters international has stated that the right to conscientious objection to military service is primarily derived from—but not yet explicit in—article 18 of the udhr the right to freedom of thought conscience and religion 55steps have been taken within the united nations to make this right more explicit but—to date 2017— those steps have been limited to less significant united nations documents sean mac bride —assistant secretarygeneral of the united nations and nobel peace prize laureate—has said to the rights enshrined in the universal declaration of human rights one more might with relevance be added it is the right to refuse to kill 56american anthropological association the american anthropological association criticized the udhr while it was in its drafting process the aaa warned that the document would be defining universal rights from a western paradigm which would be unfair to countries outside of that scope they further argued that the wests history of colonialism and evangelism made them a problematic moral representative for the rest of the world they proposed three notes for consideration with underlying themes of cultural relativism 1 the individual realizes his personality through his culture hence respect for individual differences entails a respect for cultural differences 2 respect for differences between cultures is validated by the scientific fact that no technique of qualitatively evaluating cultures has been discovered and 3 standards and values are relative to the culture from which they derive so that any attempt to formulate postulates that grow out of the beliefs or moral codes of one culture must to that extent detract from the applicability of any declaration of human rights to mankind as a whole 57bangkok declaration during the lead up to the world conference on human rights held in 1993 ministers from asian states adopted the bangkok declaration reaffirming their governments commitment to the principles of the united nations charter and the universal declaration of human rights they stated their view of the interdependence and indivisibility of human rights and stressed the need for universality objectivity and nonselectivity of human rights however at the same time they emphasized the principles of sovereignty and noninterference calling for greater emphasis on economic social and cultural rights—in particular the right to economic development over civil and political rights the bangkok declaration is considered to be a landmark expression of the asian values perspective which offers an extended critique of human rights universalism 58organizations promoting the udhrthis section may contain an excessive amount of intricate detail that may only interest a specific

18 and 20 are also fundamentally tied to the ala universal right to free expression and the library bill of rights 66 censorship the invasion of privacy and interference of opinions are human rights violations according to the ala in response to violations of human rights the ala asserts the following principles“ the american library association opposes any use of governmental prerogative that leads to intimidation of individuals that prevents them from exercising their rights to hold opinions without interference and to seek receive and impart information and ideas we urge libraries and librarians everywhere to resist such abuse of governmental power and to support those against whom such governmental power has been employed the american library association condemns any governmental effort to involve libraries and librarians in restrictions on the right of any individual to hold opinions without interference and to seek receive and impart information and ideas such restrictions whether enforced by statutes or regulations contractual stipulations or voluntary agreements pervert the function of the library and violate the professional responsibilities of librarians the american library association rejects censorship in any form any action that denies the inalienable human rights of individuals only damages the will to resist oppression strengthens the hand of the oppressor and undermines the cause of justice the american library association will not abrogate these principles we believe that censorship corrupts the cause of justice and contributes to the demise
