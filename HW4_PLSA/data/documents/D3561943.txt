the evolution of bicycles a patent history by steve brachmann august 23 20141print article karl drais circa 1820 inventor of an early precursor to the modern bicycle for more than 100 years the tour de france has been the top competition in the bicycling world and in recent years recognizable athletes such as lance armstrong have brought much more focus to the sport albeit not always for positive reasons the multiplestage bicycle race that is a month long trek around france has lasted through multiple swells and declines in biking popularity currently the bicycling world is seeing an uptick in interest thanks to rising interests in personal transportation in urban environments as well as a growth in environmental responsibility in consumers from across the world many cities around the world have been embracing bicycle lanes on public roads as a means of supporting lowcarbon emitting forms of transportation periodically we turn to our evolution of technology series whenever we want to profile the chronology of development for an intriguing invention which has revolutionized our world with the storied tour de france once more taking place across the picturesque regions of france we thought that this week would be a good time to investigate the history of innovation which led to today’s bicycle there are many who consider the bicycle to be one of the greatest inventions related to social mobility allowing many people with a personal means for moving beyond the boundaries of their towns and communities much more easily what we found in our latest research showed us that the 19th century was an incredibly interesting time for the history of bicycles fortunately we were able to find some patents issued by the u s patent and trademark office which show evidence of early inventions in this field we also scan current technologies in this field to show what some companies are attempting to improve upon in today’s bicycles patent filing made easy the invent  patent system™ – an innovative approach to filing a patent click here for informationthe draisienne or the “hobby horse”the earliest verifiable records of an early predecessor to the modern bicycle comes from the german inventor karl drais his walking machine which has come to be known as the draisienne actually more closely resembles the appearance of contemporary bicycles of today than many other twowheeled vehicles which followed in later decades drais a german baron at the time invented the walking assistant in large part because of transportation issues caused by horse starvation also known as the “hobby horse” this machine had two inline wheels with frontwheel steering riders straddled the frame while walking forward and were able to coast forward with ease down a hill there are conflicting reports whether baron von drais applied for a patent for his draisienne which became popular when it was introduced to france in 1818 where it became known as the velocipede there are reports that an american inventor w k clarkson jr of new york filed a patent for a similar invention however much of these records if they existed were destroyed in the u s patent office fire of 1836 the first major disaster to befall the patent office over the course of its history pedal velocipede the next major development in bicycling technologies comes in the 1860s when the first attempts are made at adding a driving mechanism this would be the start of the pedal bicycles that we see traveling along streets and sidewalks all over the world these models began utilizing rotary cranks which were attached to front wheel pedals to power the bicycle forward from u s patent no 59915 simply titled “velocipede”these velocipedes were often commonly known as “boneshakers” due to their rigid metal frames and wheels rubber wheels weren’t introduced until later in the late 1870s the frame constructed of iron could easily reach up to 100 pounds in weight although these look like contemporary bikes these models had a much lower gear ratio resulting in a bike that traveled much slower than today’s versions multiple timelines place the date of the first velocipede with pedals at various points throughout the 1860s perhaps the earliest u s patent issued to protect one of these vehicles was u s patent no 59915 which is simply titled velocipede the patent protects an invention consisting of two wheels and a mechanism for driving the wheels the assembly also includes an arrangement for guiding the velocipede assembly and a portion that enables a rider to balance while driving the vehicle as the velocity of the vehicle increases it becomes easier for a rider to balance while driving the velocipede this patent was issued in november 1866 and was assigned to pierre lallement of paris france although the 1860s can be seen as the decade when the modern development of the bicycle began in earnest there are some reports that place the invention of a pedalpowered velocipede in scotland during the late 1830s kirkpatrick macmillan a blacksmith from dumfriesshire is purported to have built a rearwheel drive velocipede close to 1839 the vehicle was powered by a foot treadle no patent was filed for the invention and there’s not a lot of evidence to support this claim which originally comes from a nephew of macmillan’s from u s patent no 89341 titled “improved velocipede”a number of other advancements were seen during the velocipede period of bicycle development rubber tires began to be instituted during this time and the earliest versions were nailed to the metal wheels of this model although france embraced the velocipede in its earliest days american riders also took to the personal form of transportation by the later parts of the 19th century u s patent no 89341 which is titled improved velocipede was issued to james rankin of detroit mi in april 1869 this invention benefits from the introduction of ball bearings into the assembly of velocipedes to aid in motion of the treadles or the foot pedals which impart motion to the vehicle this design utilizes a clutch device and pulley design which helps to create continuous rotary motion to the axles providing smoother motion according to diagrams attached to this patent this design used three wheels three and fourwheeled velocipedes were popular for a time before the development of the “penny farthing”patent filing made easy the invent  patent system™ – an innovative approach to filing a patent click here for informationhighwheelers and penny farthings from u s patent no 415072 entitled “tandem bicycle”highwheeler bicycle penny farthing or ordinary are all terms used to describe an unusual development in the field of bicycles during the latter parts of the 19th century the size of the front wheel continued to grow as this allowed riders to travel further with each pedal rotation advancements in metallurgy at this time also allowed bike makers to manufacture products which were composed entirely of lightweight metals drastically improving the portability of these vehicles they achieved their maximum popularity between 1873 and 1885 and some models reached speeds of up to 20 miles per hour the construction of these penny farthings however created a major safety concern that spurred later improvements towards the contemporary bicycle the highwheeler was frontwheel driven and with the pedals attached to the front wheel the center of gravity for a rider was very high and forward on the vehicle this caused many riders to lose their balance when trying to avoid obstacles and tumble forward over the front wheel of the bike some bicycle history timelines claim that this is how the term “taking a header” first came into being from u s patent no 351001 titled “anti friction bearing for velocipedes”we were unable to find any u s patents from the time period related to highwheelers or penny farthings but there was still a good deal of innovation in the field of bicycles during the late 1800s u s patent no 415072 entitled tandem bicycle was issued to inventors william starley of coventry england and herbert s owen of washington dc in november 1889 patent diagrams show a tandem bicycle assembly similar to the tandem bikes still sometimes seen today u s patent no 351001 which is titled anti friction bearing for velocipedes protects a rollerbearing assembly for bicycles that is arranged to create much less wear through friction than previous models it was issued to john kemp starley of warwick england in october 1886 the starleys involved with both of these inventions are related to james starley considered by many to be an early leader in the development of the bicycle industry safety bicycles from u s patent no 2289996 entitled “velocipede”the starleys were also a major name involved with the next generation of bicycle development which became known as the safety bicycle by 1885 the starleys unveiled the rover safety bicycle which incorporated the tubular metal diamondshaped frame as well as the chainandgear assembly powering the back wheel instead of the front wheel that we see standard on almost every bike made today one of the earliest patents we noticed that was directed at safety improvements to bicycles through rearwheel driving mechanisms was u s patent no 2289996 entitled velocipede interestingly this invention retains the large front wheel shape which was endemic to bicycles in 1880 when this patent was issued to lewis m hosea of cincinnati oh however this velocipede instruction was created to allow the rear wheel to provide more stability and prevent a rider from “oversetting”from u s patent no 453550 titled “tire for vehiclewheels”another major bicycle development around this time period was the creation of pneumatic tires which were inflatable and elastic which provided a much more comfortable experience for bicycle riders than metal or wooden wheels u s patent no 453550 which is titled tire for vehiclewheels was issued to john boyd dunlop of belfast ireland in june 1891 it protected a method of manufacturing and applying inflated tires which consisted of an airproof tube and a nonexpansive tubular covering the nonexpansive tubular covering is comprised of vulcanized rubber along with layers of canvas cloth or other materials bicycle development and popularity during this period paved the way for the establishment of the tour de france in 1903 in its first incarnation the bicycling competition only included six stages but each 400kilometer was about twice as long as the average stage length today the popularity of bicycling as a means of transportation even led to the creation of good roads societies around the united states activist groups like the league of american wheelmen now the league of american bicyclists advocated for infrastructure improvements to roads that also enabled the automobile to become much more practical patent filing made easy the invent  patent system™ – an innovative approach to filing a patent click here for informationcurrent developments the design and construction of bicycles has remained largely unchanged over the course of the past century there is however a great deal of innovation still being created by bike makers across the world many of these inventions are related to improvements in comfort and safety for bicycle riders and we’ve even noticed some introduction of computer processing technologies in a couple of patents recently issued by the uspto from u s patent no 8770808 titled “bicycle tail light”tire safety and lights for improved rider visibility during the night are featured by a couple of recently issued patents which we enjoyed reading about today u s patent no 8770808 which is titled bicycle tail light protects an adjustable bicycle light using a lightemitting diode led light source and a versatile mount that can attach to a luggage rack chain stay or seatpost assigned to light  motion industries of marina ca the patent’s description discusses how the invention is designed to create greater light output and increase the ease of replacing batteries a method of making bicycle tires from materials other than vulcanized rubber is discussed within u s patent no 8770243 entitled bicycle tire this patent was assigned to fine chemical company of korea and it protects the manufacture of a bicycle tire composed of foaming synthetic resin materials these construction method is designed to use ecofriendly materials while preventing the tire from unexpectedly separating from the rim during use we wanted to wrap up our discussion of contemporary bicycling innovations that look to bring the traditional bicycle into the 21st century by applying some computing technologies to the experience of riding u s patent no 8781690 issued under the title bicycle seat position indicator and assigned to shimano inc of osaka japan protects a seat position indicator connected to a controlling device this indicator sends a signal to the controller regarding the height of the seat relative to the height of the rider and can indicate to the rider that a height adjustment should be made finally we were intrigued by the microcomputer and drive assistance electric motor disclosed within u s patent no 8781663 titled bicycle drive apparatus this patent is also assigned to shimano inc and it protects a bicycle with a drive apparatus which has no need for a shift position sensor simplifying the construction of this vehicle compared to prior models the bicycle is still powered by pedaling but the microcomputer issues a shift command to the transmission for shifting gears automatically for more information please see the development of the bicycle published
