the early 1880s through the 1890s myers osborn  co of cleveland ohio as well as many regional foundries made some very useful little cast iron stoves these stoves were made in one wick two wick and three wick models all had a large mica window in the front so they provided light as well as heat all of the models had a sturdy cast iron handle in the back so they could be easily carried the utility of sad iron stoves was limited only by the imagination of the user they could boil water heat a sad iron or be used as a carriage heater  while providing some light one unique feature of sad iron stoves was the unusual wick  wide and long usually 3 58 to 4 wide and 8 long these wicks have not been available in north america in over 60 years but that dearth is now over hattersley in

something fierce if kerosene is used as a fuel they were designed to burn the more volatile kerosene available prior to 1918 which was similar to what is now low odor mineral spirits the same as b  h and p  a center draft lamps european mini kerosene heaterstoves beatrice  haller in england the beatrice foundry greatly improved on the sad iron concept with extremely useful boiling stoves on the left is a beautiful 1901 beatrice 33 boiling stove with an enameled cast iron base and extremely rare top extensions for larger pots and pans refinishing is not yet complete the more modern post war harper beatrice boiling stove has a steel fuel tank and is considerably small and lighter both use a 4 flat wick available on my flat wick page mica for window replacement is available here at l eft is a haller origineel stove made by georg haller co of ottensen hamburg germany haller stoves date from circa 1900 but some variations clones were made in the former east germany and are marked drg it is of enameled steel construction the white area visible at the bottom of the stove is the wick holder and the venting visible allows a considerable amount of fresh oxygen to feed into the 2 916 flat wick this stove burns very clean and odorfree the fuel reservoir is primitive however being nothing more than a basin for the wick and care must be taken to prevent spilling haller stoves were designed to use a thin 2 34 kosmos flat wick larger haller stoves from my collection haller 2wick stove haller 4 wick stove haller 4wick with 1wick on top for size comparison replacing a haller wick a thin wick extension is made from duct tape then the duct tape fed down through the wick slots through the gearing the wick is then pulled down this method avoids any undue force on the gearing used to raise and lower the wick replacing a sad iron wickmost sad irons use a wick assembly similar to the one at right this simply lifts out of the cast iron base it is not known if pa made most of the burners used by individual manufacturers but they are all similar this patent was granted to lewis j atwood and assigned to the plume  atwood manufacturing company credit for this photo goes to the lamp works tip the chimney over to expose the wick some sad iron heaters have two or three wicks but the principle is the same in the spring latch which holds the chimney shut there is usually a screw first remove the debris screen very carefully with a slim flat bladed knife then remove the screw in the spring latch click on the photos to enlarge them the debris screen spring latch and screw removed many hardware stores sell stiff brass mesh material which can be cut with sturdy scissors to replace a missing debris screen the sad iron stove with the debris screen and spring latch removed exposing the wick raising assembly very carefully lift up the chimney and cast iron base for the chimney holder and expose the wick raising assembly the wick and wick raising assembly can be pulled straight up and removed from the sad iron base once completely disassembled the sad iron stove can be refinished and repairs as necessary  without painting any of the parts together which makes future disassembly very difficult now a new wick can be properly installed from the bottom side cut off all fuzzies on the new wick and trim the top corners with a slight bevel to ease installation be sure to carefully polish the brass wick holder to prevent corrosion as it may not need to be disassembled for another halfcenturyreassemble the sad iron stove in the reverse order as listed above how do i trim the wicks on the sad iron question from mark you dont trim the wick in the normal sense of the word because it is flat out impossible to trim an almost 4 wide wick perfectly level so you install the wick as evenly as you can then raise it 18 above the top of the wick tube trim off obvious high spots then lower the wick 18 into the wick slot saturate the top of the wick with an eyedropper or two of kerosene or mineral spirits raise the wick so the lowest portion of the wick is 116 or so above the wick tube light the wick put on the chimney and let the wick burn down level at that point you can raise the wick 14 trim down the ends at a 30 degree angle for perhaps 14 maximum then lower to 116 or so exposed fill the fount with fuel wait a half hour then light you should have a nice even burn across the entire top of the wick sad iron wicks3 58 wide 8 long perfect for sad irons requiring 3 58 to 3 78 wide wicks new wicks made especially for me by hattersley in england875sad iron
