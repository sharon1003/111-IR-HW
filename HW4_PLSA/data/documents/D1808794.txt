hills rx like sd  cd but nothing is guaranteed some cats will get crystals no matter what best thing to do is try and see what their urine looks like i know when homer had crystals his pee was a little bloody even though he didnt have any other symptoms  everything i needed to know about love i learned from my cats alleys mama apr 10 2007 0101 pm post 3group pet lovers posts 625 joined 13december 06 from virginia member no  2356i know that there are some foods that are supposed to help with this feeding wet food instead of dry can help also because they get more moisture i think water intake does make a big difference with this so you might look into a pet fountain because it encourages them to drink more i think foods containing fish also contribute to this but dont quote me on that just yet ill try to find the info i read about this and let you know i had studied it some because i am planning to get a male cat also and was worried about this  read alleys story may 1 1997

some cats are genetically predisposed other develop them as a result of a virus either way not your fault be comforted dayna  you in heavenbe aware when my day comes i will be there then open your

posts 30 joined 3february 07 from northeast iowa member no  2519nyzki hi im so sorry to hear about your cat osi i have had several cats in my life time with this condition my last cat tom lived to be eighteen with proper diet dry cd female cats also get this codition but it is not life threatening because its the male that gets the blockage it doesnt really help to feed just dry food because weather its wet or dry in a cat who has the condition it is the ingrediants that cause the crystals to form i belive it has to do with ash and phosfurous but as other have suggested ask your vet or technician again i am sorry for your loss also if your cats urinary habits change and you notice frequency or urgency in either a male or female cat have them checked asap in females it is also

to pee on the floor in front of me imagine my guilt when i found out he was very ill and not just being well a spaz its horrible to hear that osi didnt survive i understand its all too common for cats spaz spent three days in the icu and had to have surgery to fix him up i give him hills cd but every day i wonder how a person would know when the crystals or sand would start to build up again my emergency vet told me that there is no sure way to prevent this yet and even the prescription foods arent a guarentee the strange thing is that i have never heard a connection between sand in the bladder and neutering before below is part of an article i got from httpwwwmarvistavetcomhtmlbodyurinaryblockagehtml urinary blockage is almost exclusively a problem reserved for males this is because the female urethra is shorter and broader in short far more difficult to obstruct when urinary blockage becomes recurrent in a male cat it becomes time to consider surgical reconstruction of the genitalia to create a more femalelike opening this surgery is called the perineal urethrostomy or �pu� for short basically the penis is removed and a new urinary opening is made i hope this helps with your decisions about a new cat and whether to neuter or not not neutering can have other problems down the road including some cancers due to too much testosterone again im very sorry about osi i know how hard this is dlittle girls apr 17 2007 1013 pm post 10group moderators posts 845 joined 24march 04 from maine member no  274please dont feel guilty about anything you did osi would not want that  even if there was information that might have helped no one knows for sure and we dont always have the information when were going through the situation wed have to be superhuman to always know the right thing to do what matters is the love we have for our babies osi had no shortage of that youll be together again and hes experiencing only bliss and no emotional or physical discomfort he just wants his sweet mom to be okay keep us posted on the upcoming adoption love kathy ps i have often found that when i learn something new that i feel could have made a difference if id known it in the past i dwell less on what i maybe could have tried in the past when i use my new knowledge in the futureas youre doing as you plan the adoption of another lucky male kitty osi is proud  compassion for

twice in his lifetime and flushing him out by the vet took care of it he was neutered as a kitten and it is true as others have pointed out that a lot of males have a very small bladder which he did i found my foolproof way was to put him on 100 wet food it was the dry food that gave him a problem and while it was only twice in his lifetime he could have died either time i just noticed he was trying to pee and could not this is a male emergency my small female had it one time so i just fed my 2 males and 1 female only wet food she lived to 15 my male who had that problem lived to be 16 and my other male who was a twin to the male was taken by cancer at age 10 and that one never had a crystal problem on xray i was told my male did have a small bladder i really think no one should hesitate to get a sweet male neutered cat just stick with soft food no one passed away due to crystals hope this information helps  little guy  may 28 1991  sept 10 2007  always in my heart his story
