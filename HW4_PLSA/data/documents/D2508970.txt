science  mathematics chemistry if eating slows down alcohol absorption does that mean that not eating will make you sober quicker basically i want to know if i drink 1 beer with food vs drinking 1 beer without food will my bac level drop quicker in the 2nd scenario there is so much info out there saying your bac will rise quicker without food but there is nothing that i can find that says what a faster rise means common sense tells me show more follow 4 answers answers relevance rating newest oldest best answer it is always better to eat because you have to understand the way that food calorie value enters your bloodstream alcohol is actually a fuel to your body just like alcohol is a fuel to a car when you eat food along with alcohol your stomach acids break down the food into ions that your blood can absorb and transport to the rest of your cells for energy food slows down alcohol absorption because your blood has a smorgasbord of ions to select from and does not selectively choose alcohol over other fuel so your blood is nourished by food and alcohol both this makes your bac lower because not as much alcohol can enter your bloodstream as quick because the alcohol has to compete with the food to enter your bloodstream so if you eat enough it will slow down the alcohol absorption but like you noted the alcohol will stretch out over a longer period before you process it but also since you can lower the absorption rate your bac will stay lower overall but maybe for a longer time just as you might get 03 if you drink a beer with no food but 12 hour later it is down to 01 you could drink a beer with lots of food and your bac might only be 01 or lower and might last 3 or 4 hours it might also be so low it wont even register so eat the food your chances of getting a reading  especially with low alcohol consumption are much better sleep will slow down your metabolism just because your body doesnt need as much energy while sleeping so it is better to stay active and burn it off quickerbiire2u 路 7 years ago0 0 comment foods that slow alcohol absorption source shttpsowlyima8h gumarrugo 路 1 year ago0 0 comment faster peak means faster drop because it peaks as it is absorbed and metabolized it also means a higher peak if you dont eat if you take in the same amount of alcohol eating just spreads it across a longer period of time because it takes longer to get from your stomach to your small intestine type of food and other factors matter though sleeping will probably slow down absorption but i cant say for sure i do know that exercise speeds up your metabolism of alcohol so it gets it out of your system fastertrappe 路 7 years ago0 0 comment the reply is like asking do i drink much less alcohol if i positioned 2 oz of vodka in 20 oz of orange juice versus 10 oz of oj two ouncesof alcohol is 2 oz eating will support gradual the absorption however int he longer term its going to be absorbed within the procedure not consuming will best get you inebriated quicker nonetheless takes the identical period of time to get rid of the historic adage of consuming plenty of espresso best offers you a large wide awake inebriatedwillsey 路 2 years ago0 0 comment maybe you would like to learn more about one of these look for franchises for sale need home equity loan options vpn options for your computer want to build your own website
