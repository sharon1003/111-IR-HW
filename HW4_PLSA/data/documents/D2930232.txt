front part of the eyesclera and cornea meet at the limbuscornea covers front part of the eye allows light into the eye and bends the light rays to help the lens focus them upon the retinacilliary body

sterile field procedure performed under a microscope and when portable microscope is used it should be brought over the patient from the side opposite the operative eye od right eye os left eye ou both eyesprocedural considerations avoid pooling prep solution in or near the eye periodically irrigate the eye with bulb syringe filled with bss to prevent corneal damage trim eyelashes prior to prepping if necessaryprocedures on the globe of the eye should be draped with adhesivebacked apeture eye drape which will extend completely over the bodyprocedures on the eyelid or conjunctiva require the use of the head drapesglaucoma causes inner occuler pressure to increaseclosed angle glaucoma 30 are of this pathology is a sudden increase of pressure to cause blockage medical emergency bt cornea and irisopen angle glaucoma cronic condition outflow of aqeous humor is blocked this occurs in most glaucoma paitentssecondary glaucoma injury infection tumors drugs scaring of blockage tissuecongenital glaucoma oxeye sensitivity to light requires surgery to prevent blindnessmeibomian glands are a type of sebaceous gland that secrete sebum from their ducts into the tears they are located on the posterior margin and embedded in the tarsal plate fibrous plates of cartilage that form the eyelid of each eyelidchalazion is caused by an inflammatory reaction to material trapped inside a meibomian gland a red swollen area of the eyelid often characterizes thisincisional approach of a chalazion depends on the location of the major portion transcutaneous or transconjunctivaleyelids consist of several layers skin subcutaneous orbicularis oris muscle tarsal plates and palpebral conjunctivatwo subunits of the eyelids medial and lateral canthusmedial canthus contains the lacrimal drainage ducts and the medical canthal tendon which is a fibrous extension of the tarsus and surrounds the lacrimal saclateral canthus is located just superior to the medical canthus fibrous extensions of the upper and lower tarsal plates join to form the lateral canthal tendonentropion is usually caused due to the aging process but it can also be caused by traumainvolutional entropion most common type and occurs when the cathal tendons retain their normal rigidity but the apposition of the lid to the globe has changed due to atrophy of the orbital fat resulting in the inversion of the lower eyelidcongenital entropion this is due to hypertrophy of the oculi muscle which causes the eyelid margin to be pushed superiorly and against the globeiris divides the space between the lens and the cornea into the anterior and posterior chambersthe involuntary circualr smooth muscle of the iris contracts and relaxes to regulate the amount of light entering the eye through the pupilaqueous flluid flows through the anterior chamber to provide nourishment to the tissue of the eye and maintain shape of the eyefluid exits the anterior chamber at the angle where the cornea and iris meet through the canal of schlemm and the trabecular meshworkrecession or resection of the muscles of the eye may be used to correct strabismusrecession is generally more effective when performed on the vertically acting musclesresection has a greater effect on the lateral rectusalternative addition to strabismus correction is adjustable suture surgeryadjustable suture surgery in adult strabismus especially with diplopia allows more accurate alignment and placement of the field of vision is more exactscleral buckle used to fix retina detachmentretinal
