during her lifetime the increasing incidence of breast neoplasia reported over the last few decades has led to widespread screening of women resulting in early diagnosis one common but challenging question for most doctors after the surgical excision of the lesion is determination of the ideal adjuvant therapy for their patients for the achievement of maximum life expectancy with the best quality of life since the beginning of the last century the knowledge that breast cancer arises from hormoneresponsive tissues has long made use of hormoneblocking agents in the beneficial treatment of breast neoplasia the discovery of new molecules with endocrine actions has rendered the use of adjuvant therapy in a tailormade pattern too complicated as these agents have a different mode of action different adverse effects and probably different indications the aim of the present review is to clarify these issues analyzing the mechanism of action of available drugs and their actions on specific areas of uncertainty cognitive function cardiovascular system urogenital tract bone metabolism weight gain hot flushes and premature menopause regarding the efficacy of adjuvant therapy there has been particular focus on the multiple hormonalinduced consequences of each regimen in order to provide the clinician with the available data for choosing the ideal therapy for the patient previous section next section introduction adjuvant therapy in breast cancer consists of hormonal therapy with or without chemotherapy given after surgical excision of the tumor the goal of hormonal adjuvant treatment in early breast cancer is the inhibition of estrogen trophic function in malignant cells  doisneausixou et al 2003  initially hormonal therapy was based on surgical ablation ovariectomy adrenalectomy hypophysectomy and the use of androgens progestagens or combined estrogen–progestagens limited to postmenopausal women  paterson  russel 1959  highdose estrogen was generally considered the endocrine therapy of choice for postmenopausal women with breast cancer and diethylstilbestrol des the first orally active artificial estrogen was commonly administered for the therapy of advanced breast cancer before the introduction of contemporary endocrine therapy a major advance was made with the introduction of tamoxifen a selective estrogen receptor modulator serm which was the first commercially available antiestrogen agent considered as the standard treatment for patients with breast cancer positive in estrogen receptors ers because it causes fewer sideeffects than des  smith  good 2003  megestrol acetate in north america and aminoglutethimide in europe had previously been the traditional secondline therapies after tamoxifen in advanced breast cancer other hormonal approaches such as the use of aromatase inhibitors fulvestrant a selective downregulator of ers gonadotropinreleasing hormone gn rh analogues raloxifene serm oophorectomy and chemical and radiological ovarian ablation have been applied as alternative methods in erpositive patients previous section next section background efficacy of adjuvant hormonal treatment adjuvant endocrine therapy is recommended for nearly all women with a breast tumor that expresses ers or progesterone receptors the first critical overview of data unequivocally demonstrated that tamoxifen was associated with a highly significant improvement in relapsefree and overall survival  early breast cancer trialists’ collaborative group 1990  its efficacy in the treatment and prevention of erpositive breast cancer was indisputably established 8 years later  early breast cancer trialists’ collaborative group 1998 a in all age groups that were studied 47 reduction in recurrence after 5 years and 26 reduction in mortality after 10 years accordingly 5 years of tamoxifen is the standard adjuvant treatment for patients with hormone receptorpositive early breast cancer irrespective of age menopausal status or tumor stage  early breast cancer trialists’ collaborative group 1998 a  to date results in the adjuvant setting regarding aromatase inhibitors are available only for anastrozole which was tested in the world’s largest individual cancer trial the anastrozole tamoxifen alone or in combination atac trial anastrozole achieved significantly longer diseasefree survival than tamoxifen as a firstline adjuvant therapy at a median followup of 33 months  baum et al 2002  the efficacy reanalysis at a median followup of 47 months  buzdar et al 2003 confirmed the continued diseasefree survival benefit in the anastrozoletreated group letrozole is being investigated in several large adjuvant trials the northamerican intergroup trial and the breast cancer international group trial comparing tamoxifen for 2 years followed by letrozole for 3 years versus letrozole for 2 years followed by tamoxifen for 3 years  goss 2001  no results have yet been presented from these two studies the first results from an exemestane adjuvant trial reported that after 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen therapy switching to exemestane was more effective than continuing tamoxifen therapy for the remainder of the 5 years of treatment  coombes et al 2004  significantly an important recent study designed to investigate the potential effects of continuing estrogen deprivation with letrozole after 5 years of tamoxifen treatment indicated that the rate of diseasefree survival was significantly higher in the letrozoletreated group than in the placebotreated group  goss et al 2003  the above unexpected outcomes led to the early termination of the study after a median duration of followup of 24 years however in this limited period no significant difference in overall survival was demonstrated there is only fractional documentation on the effects of aromatase inhibitors in premenopausal patients thus such therapy is currently restricted to postmenopausal women the early breast cancer trialists’ collaborative group 1996 has confirmed that in women 50 years of age overall survival and recurrencefree survival significantly improved after ovarian ablation combination chemotherapy has also been found to substantially improve the longterm relapsefree and overall survival of both premenopausal and postmenopausal women up to the age of 70 years  early breast cancer trialists’ collaborative group 1998 b  the availability of a treatment producing a reversible castration acceptable to many patients in the adjuvant setting and the evidence supporting an endocrine mechanism of cytotoxic chemotherapy in premenopausal patients led to the hypothesis that gn rh analogues could be of benefit in the treatment of hormonalsensitive breast cancer it has been indicated that a reversible castration over 2–3 years with a gn rh analogue is comparable in terms of diseasefree and overall survival to treatment with six courses of cyclophosphamide methotrexate and fluorouracil cmf chemotherapy  boccardo et al 2000 castiglionegertsch et al 2000 among premenopausal patients with hormone receptorpositive disease radiotherapy at the ovaries seems to produce a twothird reduction in local recurrence of breast cancer however the absolute benefit is diminished because of the disadvantage of permanent amenorrhea  early breast cancer trialists’ collaborative group 2002 del moral et al 2002  the hypothesis of combined endocrine treatment has been addressed in the atac trial the combination arm with anastrozole plus tamoxifen did not show a better outcome than the tamoxifenalone arm in fact as mentioned the outcome was inferior to that in the anastrozolealone arm furthermore according to the findings of the austrian breast and colorectal cancer study group trial there were no significant differences between the use of tamoxifenalone versus tamoxifen plus aminoglutethimide for 5 years of treatment in postmenopausal women with earlystage breast cancer in terms of either diseasefree or overall survival  schmid et al 2003  efficacy of hormonal treatment in advanced disease as secondline therapy after tamoxifen for erpositive metastatic breast cancer all three aromatase inhibitors have been shown to be superior to progestin therapy because of their better safety profile and favorable impact on survival  buzdar et al 1998 dombernowsky et al 1998  in recent years it has been found that aromatase inhibitors are superior to tamoxifen in the firstline treatment of advanced disease  bonneterre et al 2000  in an overview of trials comparing treatment with a gn rh analogue with or without tamoxifen among premenopausal patients with advanced disease the patients treated with concurrent tamoxifen showed a significantly higher objective response rate and a longer progressionfree and overall survival compared with those treated with the gn rh analogue alone  klijn et al 2001  in women with metastatic disease and positive ers chemotherapy seems to act more efficaciously against rapidly progressing tumors  wilcken et al 2003  fulvestrant has been approved in the usa for the treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptorpositive metastatic breast cancer following progression on antiestrogen therapy patients with hormonesensitive breast cancer who have responded to tamoxifen may receive additional benefit from a second endocrine agent fulvestrant megestrol acetate aromatase inhibitors following progression or relapse after tamoxifen therapy  morris  wakeling 2002  similar response rates and time to progression have been reported  bross et al 2002 in postmenopausal women with a previous response to endocrine therapy when an aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant were administered previous section next section mechanisms of action tamoxifen appears to have both agonist and antagonist estrogenic actions in various organs and inhibits the growth of breast tumors by competitively antagonizing estrogen binding to its receptor tamoxifen decelerates the proliferation of breast cancer cells by inhibiting their progression from the g1 phase of the cell cycle and induces apoptosis the cellular effect of the linkage of a serm with the receptor is a complex procedure and depends on the specific isoform α or β of the receptor thus serms act as an antagonist when combined with erβ but can also function as an agonist through erα  hall  mc donnell 1999  moreover a number of coregulator peptides which seem to interfere with the receptor’s function acting as either a positive or a negative regulator have been discovered the potential role of these proteins both coactivators and corepressors is still under investigation but they seem to modulate the biological responsiveness of the target cell of a serm in various ways  riggs  hartman 2003  among postmenopausal women the agonistic action of the serm raloxifene in bone has attracted much interest especially after the early termination of the women’s health initiative whi because of the reported elevated risk in breast cancer and the increased occurrence of cardiovascular events with the use of hormone replacement therapy hrt  chlebowski et al 2003 wassertheilsmoller et al 2003  although many questions posed by the above study remain unanswered raloxifene appears to be a reasonable alternative in postmenopausal women for the prevention of osteoporosis raloxifene beneficial to hrt because of its tissue selectivity seems to act as an estrogen antagonist in breast cancer cummings et al 1999 preliminary results of the study of raloxifene and tamoxifen star trial will add much to our awareness of the potential use of raloxifene in the prevention of breast cancer  vogel et al 2002  however to date raloxifene is approved for postmenopausal osteoporosis in patients without a history of breast cancer or in breast cancer patients only after their treatment including adjuvant therapy has been completed raloxifene prescribing information package insert 1999 eli lilly and co indianapolis in usa aromatase inhibitors markedly suppress plasma estrogen levels in postmenopausal women by inhibiting or inactivating the enzyme aromatase this enzyme is responsible for the conversion of androgenic substrates to estrogens specifically the synthesis of estrone from the preferred substrate androstendione and estradiol from testosterone  smith  dowsett 2003  the thirdgeneration aromatase inhibitors can be classified with respect to their chemical structure as steroidal or nonsteroidal agents the two main members of nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors are letrozole and anastrozole exemestane is an irreversible steroidal specific thirdgeneration aromatase inactivator maximal estrogen suppression occurs after the first 2–3 days of therapy and estrogen levels return to baseline in 10–14 days highly selective blockade of aromatase does not interfere with the production of other steroids eg adrenal corticosteroids aldosterone and androgens evidence suggests that tumor progression is not due to a loss of estrogen suppression but to newly developed tumor resistance including acquired hypersensitivity of some tumor cells to estrogens differences in the mechanism of action in this class of agents may contribute to the apparent lack of crossresistance between steroidal eg exemestane and nonsteroidal eg letrozole and anastrozole aromatase inhibitors  kvinnsland et al 2000  so far exemestane has been approved only for the treatment of postmenopausal women with recurrent breast cancer in deterioration after tamoxifen  lonning 2000  findings from ongoing studies will determine the role of exemestane in early breast cancer and its potential role in breast cancer prevention  jones  jones 2000  excessive or inappropriate aromatase expression was demonstrated in adipose fibroblasts surrounding breast carcinoma intratumoral activity of aromatase in the majority of breast tumors is well established and such activity contributes substantially to intratumoral estrogen levels it has been proved that anastrozole letrozole and exemestane noticeably inhibit this action  miller  dixon 2001  in conclusion the relative clinical significance of the potential direct role of all the pharmacological agents used for adjuvant therapy in breast cancer on the intratumoral hormonal milieu remains unknown gn rh analogues suppress secretion of pituitary gonadotropins and this results in the reduction of estrogen production these molecules bind to specific receptors consisting of seven transmembrane domains on pituitary gonadotropic cells stimulating a rapid ca 2 mobilization from internal stores gn rh analogues differ from native gn rh in their 100 to 200fold higher binding affinity to the receptors and in their pharmacokinetic parameters gn rh agonists lead to an intense release of stored luteinizing hormone and folliclestimulating hormone the ‘flareup effect’ which results in a temporary increase of ovarianproduced estradiol followed by a more prolonged decrease of pituitary hormone secretion desensitization on the other hand recently introduced gn rh antagonists induce immediate reduction of gonadotropin levels presenting a promising option in the goal of diminishing circulated estrogen  kiesel et al 2002  it is of interest that gn rh analogues in addition to their essential action of suppressing the secretion of pituitary gonadotropins might play other roles expression of gn rh receptors in both healthy  kottler et al 1997 grundker et al 2002 and cancer breast cells  harris et al 1991 grundker et al 2002 presume a possible autocrineparacrine mechanism of the action of gn rh analogues in these tissues by modifying cell function s stimulation of these receptors by gn rh analogues leads to activation of various intracellular mechanisms which are different in normal and cancer cells however these potential anticancer properties of gn rh analogues are still hypothetical the development of fulvestrant as a selective antagonist of estrogen was based on the understanding that tamoxifenlike drugs are not devoid of estrogenlike actions and that their intrinsic partial agonist effects may have undesired consequences in various tissues in contrast to the partial agonists studies have demonstrated that multiple changes in er function after fulvestrant treatment ie impaired dimerization increased turnover and disrupted nuclear localization contribute to the blockade of estrogen action  howell et al 2000  moreover it is reported  pink  jordan 1996 that fulvestrant markedly reduces cellular levels of ers in pointed contrast to the stable or increased er levels associated with tamoxifen finally alternative therapeutic approaches consist of the supplementary use of various chemotherapeutic regimens and occasionally radiotherapy which act directly on ovaries suppressing the production of estrogens combination of the above strategies tends to be the current state of the art in the issue of treating patients with erpositive cancers even at early stages of the disease table 1 ⇓  view this table in this window in a new window table 1common hormonal treatment in erpositive breast cancer previous section next section skeletal effects two isoforms of estrogenic receptors have been identified in bones αreceptors erα which are expressed mostly in the developing cortical bone and βreceptors erβ which are expressed in the developing cancellous bone  bord et al 2001  tamoxifen reduces bone demineralization due to its confirmed agonist estrogenic action  love et al 1994 powles et al 1996 and this is a disadvantage in premenopausal patients bone density was slightly improved in postmenopausal women who received tamoxifen for 2 years however almost half of this benefit was lost after 5 years of continuous administration which is the usual duration of tamoxifen therapy regarding the fracture risk the results of the available reports are conflicting  riggs  hartman 2003  anastrozole by lowering the circulating estrogen levels appears to be associated with a higher incidence of total and vertebral fractures 59 and 07 respectively than tamoxifen 37 and 03 respectively according to the results derived from the atac trial  baum et al 2002  it is of great interest that in the same study the reported risk for hip fractures was 04 irrespective of the agent administered this could possibly be explained by the different concentrations of ers in the various types of bones which result in a different total effect of each regimen in vertebral bones and a similar effect in the hip region in addition aromatase inhibitors have been considered responsible for the clinical syndrome of polyarthralgia which appears to be unrelated to increased bone resorption atac trial arthralgia with similar features has been mentioned in cases of women during the postpartum period and in early menopause when circulating estrogens are rapidly decreased based on this observation it has been suggested that estrogen has a possible suppressive role in the progression of rheumatoid diseases  wluka et al 2000 baum et al 2002  in a shortterm 3month postmenopausal human volunteer experiment exemestane or letrozole was administered daily at the usual anticancer doses of 25 and 25 mg respectively to each of 20 women and a placebo was given to 20 women representing a control group  goss et al 2002  over this short timeperiod bone biomarkers of formation and resorption were similar in the women given exemestane or placebo  goss et al 2002  in contrast there was a sharp increase in bone turnover in those given letrozole over the same timeperiod it has been assumed from studies in ovariectomized rats that bone metabolism is protected by the androgenicity of exemestane and its metabolite 17hydroexemestane  goss et al 2004  it is possible that earlystage breast cancer patients could benefit from bisphosphonates by ameliorating the cancer treatmentrelated bone loss even more importantly most women with newly diagnosed breast cancer are at risk of osteoporosis because of their age and trends in adjuvant hormonal therapy indicate that osteoporosis will become a greater clinical problem in the future although raloxifene is approved for osteoporosis prevention and therapy its use following 5 years of tamoxifen adjuvant therapy is not recommended this is based on the fact that raloxifene and tamoxifen are similar agents and 10 years of tamoxifen use has been associated with more recurrences and deaths than 5 years of tamoxifen  fisher et al 2001  adequate information is currently available about the skeletal consequences of adjuvant chemotherapy chemotherapytreated women who maintained ovarian function had normal bone mineral density  headley et al 1998  whilst a decrease in bone density was as expected reported in women with functional suppression of the ovaries  shapiro et al 2001  these women could be at risk for early development of osteoporosis and the use of bisphosphonates may be beneficial  saarto et al 1997 partridge et al 2001 shapiro  recht 2001  however the maintenance of bone density depends only in part on estrogen the implementation of exercise and a multifaceted protocol of drug therapy for bone remodeling immediately following chemotherapyinduced treatment bisphosphonates calcium and vitamin d supplementation are producing encouraging results  twiss et al 2001  the need for early bone mineral density assessments and close monitoring has therefore been suggested in this highrisk population of women the american society of clinical oncology asco guidelines published in november 2003 outline the appropriate measures for each riskgroup category  hilner et al 2003  because bisphosphonates have effectively reduced the development and progression of bone metastases in advanced breast cancer  kanis et al 1996 theriault et al 1999 current research has focused on bisphosphonates as an adjuvant therapy  diel et al 1998 saarto et al 2001 powles et al 2002  the trials conducted provide conflicting data on this potential role of bisphosphonates among patients with no evidence of distant metastases after definitive local surgery thus starting bisphosphonates in women with only an abnormal bone scan but without evidence of bone destruction is not recommended and the presence or absence of bone pain should not be a factor in initiating bisphosphonates asco hilner et al 2003  consequently it remains uncertain as to whether bisphosphonates are beneficial and further investigation is needed to clarify whether bisphosphonates can influence the development of bone metastases and improve survival in earlystage breast cancer previous section next section primary menopause and hrt in women with breast cancer menopausal symptoms are an important source of morbidity in patients with breast cancer the potential use of hrt in such patients is controversial although recent reports have failed to confirm any increased risk of recurrence in women using hrt for breast cancer treatment whereas the benefits in the quality of life reported were significant  vassilopoulousellin et al 1999 o’meara et al 2001  however existing clinical data do not yet suffice to evaluate the efficacy of this strategy  cobleigh et al 1994 shapiro  recht 2001 and further randomized studies are needed to reassess the issue of hrt in women with breast cancer a systematic review of 11 controlled and uncontrolled trials concluded that hrt has no significant effect on breast cancer recurrence however the reported findings were based on observational data subject to a variety of biases  col et al 2001  until the whi study was published mortality due to breast cancer in hrt users was thought to be the same or even lower than in nonusers and this has been attributed to earlier diagnosis and better prognosis however whi reports revealed more advanced disease in hrt users  chlebowski 2003 wassertheil 2003  which is in contradiction to most published observational studies  antoine et al 2004  reasonably hrt could be given in combination with tamoxifen in premenopausal women with increased levels of estrogens in order to eliminate the antiestrogenic effect of tamoxifen eg hot flushes in addition women with primary menopause due to chemotherapy could gain advantages from the supplementation of estrogens about 5–10 of breast cancers are caused by an inherited mutation of either the brca1 or brca2 gene  loman et al 2001 and the great majority of these patients do not express ers prophylactic mastectomy and oophorectomy are the most effective treatments in carriers of these mutations  armes et al 1999  this specific group of women could benefit from receiving hrt  armstrong et al 2004  however available data are as yet insufficient  riggs  hartman 2003  the older age of patients and the duration of chemotherapy are positively correlated with increased risk of primary menopause the timecourse of menopause varies from 2 to 16 months from the beginning of chemotherapy permanent menopause as a sideeffect of cmf is more frequently reported compared with the combination of cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin whether the use of taxanes is associated with such an adverse effect on the patient’s ovaries remains uncertain  partridge et al 2001 shapiro  recht 2001  reduction of libido has been mentioned in women undergoing adjuvant treatment which seems to be related more often to the use of chemotherapy regimens rather than tamoxifen decreased libido in a patient with breast cancer seems to be a complex process which depends on an integration of potential mechanisms including neurotoxicity estrogen reduction impaired quality of life and possibly depression consequently it is incorrect to assume that the observation mentioned above is solely an endocrine disorder  ganz et al 1998 shapiro  recht 2001  previous section next section the urogenital tract it is well known that lack of estrogens results in atrophy of the urogenital system and dispareunia there is supporting evidence that estrogen replacement therapy in postmenopausal women is associated with increased risks of uterine cancer due to its local agonist role tamoxifen is correlated with an approximately 2 to 25fold rise in the relative risk of endometrium cancer in the first 1 or 2 years of treatment and this risk is approximately quadrupled in trials of 5 years of tamoxifen administration  early breast cancer trialists’ collaborative group 1998a fisher et al 1998 bergman et al 2000  however the agonist effect of tamoxifen in the uterus with regard to the risk of endometrium cancer is time dose and age dependent  fisher et al 1998 bergman et al 2000 baum et al 2002 chen et al 2003  in this regard vaginal bleeding which is commonly observed in these women requires further investigation  fisher et al 1998 riggs  hartman 2003  in most cases the detected tumor is not aggressive ie low grade stage 1 and is rarely a sarcoma with a poor prognosis  bergman et al 2000 baum et al 2002  it has recently been suggested that tamoxifen differentially regulates human telomerase reverse transcriptase h tert gene expression in breast and endometrial cancer cells and this activity has been associated with the presence of an estrogensensitive element in the h tert gene the hypothesis of direct involvement of tamoxifen in the regulation of cancer cell growth may be associated with its opposite effects in the breast and uterus  grundker et al 2002  a reasonable approach for these patients is a routine pelvic examination and prompt evaluation of abnormal vaginal bleeding by endometrial biopsy previous section next section cardiovascular effects serms mimicking estrogen actions reduce the level of low density lipoprotein cholesterol and increase high density lipoprotein levels without increasing the concentration of triglycerides  bruning et al 1988 saarto et al 1996  in contrast the estrogenlowering effects of aromatase inhibitors have an adverse effect on blood lipids according to a small shortterm study  elisaf et al 2001  the available data are insufficient to evaluate the longterm effects discussed the cumulative cardiovascular effect of tamoxifen seems to be related to inflammatory thrombotic and antiatherogenic activities tamoxifen has been associated with increased relative risk of venus thromboembolism 15 to 3fold rise but the total risk remains small  cutuli et al 1995 meier  jick 1998 baum et al 2002  on the other hand analyses of individual trials have suggested that longterm adjuvant treatment with tamoxifen may result in substantial reduction of cardiac morbidity  rutqvist  mattsson 1993  the concurrent combination of chemotherapy and tamoxifen has been associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism when compared with tamoxifen administration alone  saphner et al 1991 among postmenopausal patients patients receiving anastrozole had a significantly lower incidence of venous thromboembolism compared with the patients receiving tamoxifen 21 and 35 respectively  baum et al 2002  previous section next section cognitive effects erα receptors are mainly located in the hypothalamus while erβ receptors are distributed in almost the entire brain hippocampus–amygdala and thus are strongly associated with superior cerebral functions and memory several potential mechanisms have been proposed including a accumulation of the production and secretion of neurotransmitters b direct action on the nervous cells and stabilization of the structure of cell membrane c prevention of cerebrovascular ischemia and d alteration of the serum lipoproteinic profile experimental studies on animals have shown that estrogen promotes both the enlargement and the maturation of the dendritic spines of nervous cells located in the hypothalamus and hippocampus additionally an increase in the number of synapses has been observed in sections of the brain which are topographically associated with learning it has been suggested that estrogen affects memorylinked processes in postmenopausal women by altering brain activation patterns in specific brain regions  shaywitz et al 1999  another study has indicated that the use of estrogen in postmenopausal women may delay the onset and decrease the risk of alzheimer’s disease  tang et al 1996  despite the above findings in postmenopausal women it remains unknown as to whether the status of diminished estrogen levels after the use of adjuvant treatment translates to clinical impairment to date studies focused on the longterm outcomes of tamoxifen have not furnished sufficient information to enhance our knowledge about its impact in the cognition and behavior of the treated patients  winer et al 2002  a doubleblind randomized trial multiple outcomes of raloxifene evaluation more study which is currently investigating the multiple outcomes of another serm raloxifene is expected to clarify several issues local estrogen biosynthesis modified by aromatase activity in the brain may be important in the regulation of various cognitive and hypothalamic functions but little is known about the clinical expression of this hypothesis however improvement in cognitive function based on the european organisation for research and treatment of cancer quality of life questionnaire eortc qlqc30 qualityoflife test of patients treated with retrozole has been reported  phillips  bernhard 2003  regarding adjuvant chemotherapy several authors have attempted to estimate its potential sideeffects on memory concentration and attention by using questionnaires and psychological tests  schagen et al 1999 partridge et al 2001  however some of the examined patients were cotreated with tamoxifen thus making it difficult to reach a conclusion it is of interest that these studies failed to determine further cognitive impairment in the subgroup of patients who received additional tamoxifen  schagen et al 1999  moreover approximately onethird of the examined women complained of cognitive disorders a factor which failed to be recorded in the tests performed nevertheless it is clear that the severity of symptoms positively correlates with the use of increased drug doses  van dam et al 1998 schagen et al 1999 partridge et al 2001  the role of taxanes in the neurotoxicity of peripheral nerves has been well established but their role in the central nervous system has yet to be investigated  shapiro  recht 2001  in conclusion the observed discrepancy between subjective symptoms and objective findings in several studies may have resulted not only from the insufficient objectiveness of the methods used but also from individual variations in the way the patients were mentally and psychologically influenced during the painful procedure of chemotherapy  kattlove  winn 2003  previous section next section hot flushes it has been confirmed that the use of tamoxifen increases hot flushes in women with breast cancer 17 vs 75 of the placebotreated group but this adverse effect seems to be eliminated in the late postmenopausal period  riggs  hartman 2003  initial results of the atac trial have shown a comparative risk for the appearance of hot flushes with anastrozole and tamoxifen 343 and 39 respectively  baum et al 2002  in women unable or unwilling to take hormonal therapies such as in breast cancer  biglia et al 2003  several nonhormonal alternatives have been proposed namely clonidine an α2presynaptic adrenergic agonist venlafaxine paroxetine and gabapentin selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  pandya et al 2000  many of the women studied were taking concurrent tamoxifen and all of these agents have demonstrated efficacy in reducing hot flushes  sicat  brokaw 2004  tamoxifen is converted to 4hydroxytamoxifen and other active metabolites by cytochrome p450 enzymes and this conversion is reduced by the coadministration of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor  stearns et al 2003  thus hot flushes in breast cancer survivors should no longer be considered untreatable as there are pharmacologic treatments available that can help alleviate this problem previous section next section weight gain aromatase expression in adipose tissue primarily accounts for the extraglandular peripheral formation of estrogen and increase in body weight in obese postmenopausal women from this viewpoint obesity has been associated with an increase in the recurrence of breast cancer and thus it is considered as a potential risk factor in the progression of the disease  camoriano et al 1990 partridge et al 2001 shapiro  recht 2001  premenopausal women undergoing a prolonged therapeutic regime and those receiving prednisone are the most likely to gain weight appearance of symptoms of depression and a parallel mild increase in body weight has been associated with tamoxifen but the reported cases are few regarding chemotherapy the usual weight increase is 2–6 kg and is milder with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide use than with cmf treatment possible causes are suggested as being the reduction of physical exercise increased food intake primary ovarian failure and possible alterations in the basic metabolism  demarkwahnefried et al 1993 1997  previous section next section new breast cancer events early findings on the use of serms tamoxifen and raloxifene as a prophylaxis against erpositive breast cancer have demonstrated hopeful though preliminary results  cuzick et al 2003 early breast cancer trialists’ collaborative group 1998 a  evidence based on the national surgical adjuvant breast and bowel project nsabp has been developed for the use of tamoxifen as a riskreducing agent in women at highrisk for breast cancer 49 decrease among highrisk women  fisher et al 1998  this use of tamoxifen was supported by european tamoxifen trials which however included both high and lowrisk women  cuzick et al 2003  however it is crucial to identify the subgroup of highrisk healthy women for whom the riskbenefit ratio is sufficiently positive it is suggested that maximal clinical benefit and minimal sideeffects could be derived from the preventive use of tamoxifen in younger premenopausal women who are less likely to have thromboembolic sequelae and uterine cancer  chlebowski et al 2002  the more trial which evaluated the use of raloxifene to prevent osteoporosis found after 40 months of followup that the risk of invasive breast cancer decreased by 76 cummings et al 1999 among postmenopausal women some investigators reported that measurements of estradiol level could help to identify women belonging to the potential ‘highrisk’ group who may benefit most from the use of raloxifene  cummings et al 2002  in 1999 the nsabp initiated a second study which is currently under way the star trial in order to evaluate the use of raloxifene by comparison with tamoxifen as a potential preventive agent in breast cancer this study was designed to recruit approximately 19 000 women and will investigate the efficacy of both regimens in reducing the incidence of primary breast cancer in highrisk healthy women  vogel et al 2002  another major issue in the topic of erpositive breast cancer is the optimal management of postmenopausal patients who have completed the classical 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen therapy an important recent study designed to investigate the potential effects of continuing estrogen deprivation with an aromatase inhibitor letrozole indicated that the rate of diseasefree survival was significantly higher in the letrozoletreated group than in the placebotreated group  goss et al 2003  distant metastasis ipsilateral recurrences and new contralateral breast cancers were implicated as breast cancer events the above unexpected outcomes led to the early termination of the study after a median duration of followup of 24 years however in this limited period no significant difference in overall survival was demonstrated  goss et al 2003  previous section next section conclusions sideeffects of adjuvant therapy for breast cancer must be taken into account when planning therapy table 2 ⇓  but the clinical experience of many decades has shown that the benefits far outweigh the risks in conclusion patients receiving anastrozole have a significantly lower incidence of hot flushes vaginal bleeding vaginal discharge and venous thromboembolism and a significantly higher incidence of musculoskeletal symptoms and fractures than those receiving tamoxifen however tamoxifen remains the ‘golden standard’ in adjuvant early erpositive breast cancer treatment preliminary findings from the use of aromatase inhibitors are promising but longer followup investigations are required before a final ‘benefit vs risk’ assessment can be made for this endocrine option use of anastrozole has not yet been recommended as a firstline therapy in premenopausal women american society of clinical oncology technology assessment  winer et al 2002  but anastrozole treatment is currently a useful alternative especially in patients who do not tolerate tamoxifen view this table in this window in a new window table 2sideeffects of available agents in adjuvant
