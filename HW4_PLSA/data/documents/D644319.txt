el electronic person asked on april 21 2014q ernie site list and ernie user list microsoft security  privacy concerns i found two unknown directories on my pc in my user profile i have so far been unable to identify what put them there which process owns them and when i delete them using admin escalated privileges they come back after a few minutes or immediately after rebootcusersusernameappdatalocalernie sitelistcontainerdatcusersusernameappdatalocalernie userlistcontainerdat cusersusernameapp datalocal lowemie site listcontainerdat cusersusernameapp datalocal lowemie userlistcontainerdat it was time anyway so i wiped the drive using factory lowlevel overwriting and performed a clean install of windows 81 pro using a freshly downloaded iso from microsoft one with an esd distribution written to a new just outofthebedamnedhardshellplastic flashdrive i just completed the clean install in this sequence boot to flashdrive and let windows create partitions then install reboot check app data no folders found activate check app data no folders found run first update install everything except bing bar and desktop check app data no folders found reboot check app data no folders found add feature windows media center check app data no folders found reboot check app data no folders found run updates a second time check app data no folders found reboot check app data no folders found remove ms c v12 x86 and x64 installed during update check app data no folders found reboot check app data no folders found download from msdn  httpmsdnmicrosoftcomenusvstudiodefault redistributables ms c x86 and x64 2005 2008 2010 and 20124 versions and install in sequence check app data after each install no folders found reboot after each install and check app data no folders found run updates a third time response was no updates available check app data no folders found reboot check app data all four subdirectories are now present these subdirectories and datfiles are not so far present in the app dataroaming directory there is nothing except microsoft windows 81 pro wmc and the 10 ms c packages installed and ms silverlight and amd videocard catalyst control center on the machine windows defender is present but is installed as part of windows 8 and 81 and its updates are provided via the ms update process all  repeat all of these items are provided by microsoft my questions are what are the ernie directories for what program created them and what does the various containerdat files contain and    if not absolutely necessary how do i get rid of them and keep them from coming back first attempt at solution permissions are full for system user name and group administrators the user name is the owner and effective permissions for each of the 3 is full open command prompt admincwindowssystem32cdcattrib r h s cuserscarlapp datalocalemie site listcontainerdat cattrib r h s cuserscarlapp datalocalemie site list

explorer after less than 3 minutes reading pages on the internet at microsofts ask windows community i opened windows explorer to check and found that the subdirectories had recreated themselves in both the local and local low directories the containerdat files were back in the local subdir and after another few minutes also back in the local low subdir both the subdirectories and the containerdat files are once again superhidden analysis using windows utilities and sys internals and nir soft tools have not identified which object or process or service owns these objects reply i have the same question 41sougata das replied on march 3 2015microsoft a in reply to 1ncos post on february 19 2015hithere are many different malware detection and cleaning applications including microsoft’s own malicious software removal tool msrt which is a free download here the problem with most antimalware tools is that they rely on malware signatures also known as malware definition updates to detect the malicious code whenever a new piece of malware is discovered the vendor of any antivirus software has to update the database that is the algorithm to recognize the new malware malware authors are prolific though and new malware is discovered on a daily basis so the antimalware vendors are always one step behind that means users are left unprotected against the new threats for some amount of time depending on how rapidly the vendors can create test and deploy updates this is the reason why often one tool will find malware that another misses and when a threat is brand new none of the tools may find it that’s the basis of the “zero day” concept – a threat that’s so new there are no protections against it yet in place thus the need for manual malware cleaning methods although it’s much more convenient to just run an antimalware application and hope for the best if you notice suspicious behavior occurring on your system and those programs can’t find anything wrong you can delve deeper to find it yourself instead of waiting for the vendors to get the tools updated you can do that with sysinternals utilities such as process monitormanually identifying and cleaning malware the steps involved in the manual malware detection and cleaning process as follows disconnect the machine from the network identify the malicious processes and drivers suspend and terminate the identified processes identify and delete any malware autostarts delete the malware files reboot and repeat this can be a multistep process because malware writers often create very robust software it’s designed to withstand your efforts to kill it or even morph itself in to something entire different like a polymorphic virus that changes its virus signature ie its binary pattern every time it replicates and infects a new file in order to keep from being detected by an antivirus program step one is a precautionary one disconnecting from the network prevents your infected machine from infecting others on the network being disconnected from the network will also enable you to fully observing the malware’s normal actions and completely understanding how it works and all that it does how do you identify processes that are suspicious look for those processes that have no icon have no descriptive or company name or that are unsigned microsoft images also focus on those processes that live in the windows directory that include strange urls in their strings that have open tcpip endpoints or that host suspicious dlls or services hiding as a dll instead of a process many are packed – compressed or encrypted – and many malware authors write their own packers so you don’t find the common packer signatures most malicious software will have some or all of these characteristics so how do you go about examining the processes in the first place many it pros would start with the obvious task manager’s processes tab task manager has been improved in vista and windows 7 in comparison to windows xp the description column which gives you information about what application is using each process is a welcome feature that’s shown in figure 1 figure 1you can get additional information in task manager by going to the view menu and clicking select columns then checking the boxes you want as shown in figure 2 figure 2for example you can display the image path name to show the full path to the file that’s connected to the process or you can check the command line box to show the command with any parameters or switches that was used to launch the process malware often has strange looking command lines you can see this additional information in figure 3 figure 3another way to get more info about a process in task manager is to right click it and select properties which will open its properties dialog box here you can see information regarding its file type location and size digital signature copyright information versioning most malware doesn’t have version information permissions etc all of this is a good start but task manager still doesn’t give you quite the indepth look at a process that you can get with a tool such as the sysinternals process explorer using process explorer to identify malware process explorer is a free 147 mb download from the windows sysinternals web page on the tech net site it runs on windows xp and above current version is 141 and you can get it here  you can also run it from this link as you can see in figure 4 it gives you a different view of your processes than what you get with task manager figure 4you’ll notice that in process explorer the process tree in the left column shows parentchild relationships if one process looks suspicious related processes may also be an extremely handy feature is the ability to right click a process and select “search online” to do a web search for information about the process as shown in figure 5 figure 5one thing to keep in mind though is that some malware will use pseudo random generated process names in order to prevent you from finding any information in a search to know more about process monitor and how to use it sniff out malwares i suggest you follow this linkhttpblogstechnetcombaskperfarchive20070601troubleshootingwithprocessmonitoraspx remember though that malware authors can also get digital certificates for their software so the existence of a valid certificate does not guarantee that the process isn’t malicious lastly i would request you to take a look in to this link regarding emiesitelist and emieuserlist hidden directories and dat files httpssocialtechnetmicrosoftcomforumsexchangeenus9b080135dd7c458a93bbe62b3fdbdd07emiesitelistandemieuserlisthiddendirectoriesanddatfilesforumieitprocurrentver hope this
