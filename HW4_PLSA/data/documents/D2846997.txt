one of the most common things people ask when they start to consider going solar or start to plan their lifechanging solar expedition is which are the most efficient solar panels however first of all that’s not even the right question for most people and second of all the literal answer to that question really isn’t relevant for the average consumer let me explain… first of all the important matter is not which solar panels are most efficient but which solar panels are the best value for the money if you’ve got space for 10 solar panels on your roof and you have an option between solar panels “abefficient” that are a bit more efficient but twice the price of solar panels “cdcheap” chances are you are going to make a much bigger savings by going with cdcheap of course the important thing would be to see what’s available in your situation and simply run the numbers or if you are allergic to math have a friend who can do math run the numbers for you but anyway if you really want to know which are the most efficient solar panels or solar cells out there i actually happened to be putting together a list of solar records recently and can give you the rundown but as i do so i’ll drop in a few key notes making the point above a bit clearer before looking at solar panels as a whole let’s have a quick look at the producers of some of the most efficient solar cells the key component of solar panels and their efficiency records444 efficient solar cells by sharp notably these worldleading solar cells by sharp are in the concentrator triplejunction solar cell category such solar cells are complicated and are not used in residential or commercial applications… because they are bloody expensive they are used in space applications by the likes of nasa where a bit of extra space or as it may be less space via extra efficiency can make a huge difference379 efficient solar cells by sharp just a step down these are in the triplejunction nonconcentrator solar cell category if this is all new to you it might take you awhile to see the difference in the categories the difference is that these solar cells don’t use anything to concentrate the light hitting the solar cells while the 444 efficiency cells above do use something to concentrate the light of course adding to their costs326 solar cells by a spanish solar research institute ies and university upm these are another step down as they are in the twojunction concentrator solar cell category for an intro on “junctions” by the way check out this multijunction photovoltaic cell article on wikipedia again these are still far different solar cells from what are used in commercial or residential installations there are about a dozen or so extra categories that i could run down some categories have very high efficiencies but the solar cells are quite expensive while others are actually on the other end of the spectrum no pun intended and are very cheap but have very low efficiency of course some are both inefficient and expensive but apparently worth researching nonetheless the key as i noted earlier is finding the best balance between cost and efficiency now there’s less research on solar panels than on solar cells because the core of the technology is the solar cell so that’s what researchers at many institutes and universities spend their time on no one is even going to try to manufacture a solar panel that won’t sell because it isn’t made of marketable solar cells still there are many different types of solar panels more accurately known as solar modules on the market and many many manufacturers of some of the most common types so let’s look at the leaders in this category why didn’t i start with the solar modules because then it would be easier to miss the point which is that solar panel efficiency is not the metric you use to choose solar panels for you home getting on to the solar modules here are the most efficient solar modules in a few key categories36 efficient amonix solar modules hold the overall solar pv module efficiency record however these are made with concentrator solar cells and are not used in residential applications215 sun power solar modules hold the commercial solar module efficiency record sun power’s spr327newhtd modules are also the leading solar modules in solar module yield field tests and other sun power solar modules come in 2 and 3 in those tests for those of you to who this matters or is interesting sun power is a usbased solar panel company 174 qcells thinfilm solar modules hold the record in this specific solar panel category thinfilm solar panels are widely used but not in residential applications qcells was a german company but it filed for insolvency in 2012 and was then acquired by the korean company hanwha 161 first solar thinfilm solar modules claim the cadmiumtelluride cd te photovoltaic pv module conversion efficiency record again these are generally not used for residential applications but i think including them helps to reinforce my key point yet again first solar a usbased company was actually the 1 solar developer and the 2 solar module manufacturer in the world last year despite a relatively low 161 record efficiency in this category of solar panels first solar does very well with these relatively cheap solar modules in certain applications just as one final example in order to show that the variation doesn’t stop there 155 solar modules from mia solé hold the flexible pv solar module efficiency record naturally in some applications one doesn’t just need solar panels one needs flexible solar panels but that probably isn’t you… the takeaway point is skip the focus on hypotheticals and irrelevant superlatives forget about what the “most efficient solar panels” are check on the solar installers in your area you can get connected to them via our home page  see what they quote you ask them what solar panels they would use if you want to know and compare your options to your heart’s content don’t go trying to find solar panels that were designed for nasa satellites by the way the following chart from nrel isn’t fully up to date solar efficiency records are broken quite frequently but it gives you a good sense of the large variety of solar technologies join the us solar power rooftop revolutionsolar panels july 1 2013 no comments
