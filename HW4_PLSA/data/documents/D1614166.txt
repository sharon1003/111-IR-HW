some minor adjustments to this policy for example some schools do not recalculate the act composite score a true superscore act but do consider the highest score in each individual section of the act test which amounts to just about the same thing also if you have a different test policy for a college listed above or you know a college not on the list that does superscore please contact me colleges can change testing policies so any help is very appreciated what about the act essay score beginning september 2015 the act test changed its score reporting policy for the essay portion now the essay will be graded on a similar scale as the multiple choice portion 136 the essay portion however is never included in the act composite score and very few colleges if any use the essay in the superscore act so far most colleges are not including the essay portion in the superscore because the essay is still not included in the composite score my feeling from talking to other college counselors admission representatives and my students is that most schools will not use the combined englishwriting score but the schools may consider the actual essay score if you are concerned about your act essay score please read my tips on how to achieve the best score possible in the act essay portion for the essay i really like the college pandas act essay the battletested guide because the
