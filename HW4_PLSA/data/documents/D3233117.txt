hometown of america’s favorite tv family adjacent to the awardwinning “the simpsons ride tm ” and the “nighttime studio tour” offering evening tours of the iconic movie backlot my original post on the announcement of the ride follows from april 8th 2014 i always thought it was very strange that universal studios theme parks don’t feature a fast and the furious ride the films have earned almost 24 billion worldwide — fast and the furious is the biggest franchise in universal studios’ history yet they can’t even build a ride in the domestic theme parks yes they’ve had that lame stop on the studio tram tour that features a bunch of cars spinning on turntables a cross promotion for their earlier film the fast and the furious tokyo drift but the tram stop is one of the stupidest parts of the tram tour and by the way tokyo drift is the lowest earning movie of the franchise — seems like an odd choice finally universal studios hollywood has announced a new fast and the furious ride which will be called fast  furious supercharged we mentioned the trademark in an earlier theme park bits  more details on the fast  furious supercharged ride revealed after the jump fast  furious supercharged ride details unfortunately with universal hollywood building hogwarts there is not much room for another full ride so they are adding the new fast  furious supercharged “ride” to the studio tram tour here is what was revealed in the new york times also coming next year the company said on tuesday will be “fast  furious – supercharged” a moviethrill ride hybrid in which occupants of universal’s famed backlot trams will be encircled by 400footlong movie screens “we’re going to make it feel like those trams are being pulled through the streets at speeds of over 100 miles per hour” said chick russell an executive producer for universal creative hey at least it will be better than a bunch of cars spinning on turntables they also revealed that the universal studios’ studio tram tours which currently end at sunset will be expanded into the night time hours with a different nighttime story line “accompanied by lighting effects at more than 20 stops”the fast  furious supercharged ride will open some time in 2015 cool posts from around the web zerg net comment now
