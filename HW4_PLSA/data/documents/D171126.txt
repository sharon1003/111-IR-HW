nuun energy – review may 21 2014 · by aerogeeks · in by mike fuel review  ·let’s start out with a basic fact – the aero geeks team is already a huge fan of nuun two of our three editors use nothing but nuun for hydration during their workouts it has all the electrolytes you need and the taste you want without the calories you can get elsewhere so when we heard that nuun was launching a nuun energy line we were obviously stoked to try it oftentimes we looked for that little kick midworkout—without resorting to a gel—and were left wanting here we could get it in our hydration we reached out to nuun to get some samples of their energy line up to see how they compared to the originals as part of this nuun asked us what our current favorites are we are huge fans of the lemon tea and kona kola varieties so we were happy to share that with them well it turns out we were in for a bit of a surprise you see there are not many “rules” when it comes to being an endurance athlete just make sure you properly fuel always stretch and take care of your equipment but there is one rule any athlete who competes should always follow  always know exactly what you put in your body usada does not take kindly to pleading ignorance when it turns out that your delicious dinner winds up containing a few banned substances well it turns out the aero geeks may be a bit guilty of not following that last rule to the letter because as it turns out both lemon tea and kona cola have 40 mg of caffeine which we had been completely unaware of whoopswe dived our time with nuun three ways—nuun active nuun active with caffeine and nuun energy luckily nuun helped us out by providing us a nuun 4 pack tri berry lemonlime citrus fruit and orange – none of which contain caffeine we also received all three flavors of energy – wild berry lemon lime and cherry limeade for those unfamiliar nuun are dropin tabs for hydration each nuun tube contains 12 tabs which are each good for 16oz of water though we routinely drop them into 20oz and 24oz bottles nuun active contains 360 mg sodium 100 mg potassium 25 mg magnesium and 13 mg calcium both lemon tea and kona cola also throw in 40mg of caffeine with nuun energy you also get b vitamins b2 – 5mg b6 – 2mg and b12 – 6 mcg from a taste perspective we really enjoyed the new nuun energy line the lemon lime was a team favorite we’d describe the flavor very similar to sprite one of our editors did find that the cherry limeade did give her a bit of reflux but others came away just fine from a performance perspective it was easy to tell the difference between the standard hydration versus the caffeinated varieties andor the energy line—especially during those endofthe day workouts when your energy levels are lagging however we did find that the effects of energy vs caffeinated hydration were not significant enough to notice whatever flavor you choose if you are looking to pumpup your hydration while not impacting your calorie strategy we suspect you are going to be a fan of nuun and if you want that extra pickmeup be sure to take a look at their energy lineupshare this like this loading related9282014 wi rseptember 29 2014in by mike4132014 wi rapril 13 2014in by mike5112014 wi rmay 11 2014in by miketags hydration nuun nuun energy nuun hydration
