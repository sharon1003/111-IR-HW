biological factors contributing to rising obesity ratesby sheela philomena on february 8 2012 at 1237 pm obesity news font  a aa recent study sheds light on the list of biological factors that contribute to rising rates of obesity and the results reveal that brain mechanisms link highfat foods to weight gain according to the u s centers for disease control about onethird of u s adults are obese a number that continues to climb while we dont usually think of it this way body weight is regulated how much we weigh is influenced by a number of biological systems and this is part of what makes it so hard for people to lose weight and keep it off randy seeley from donald c harrison endowed chair said to understand the obesity epidemic we must figure out how our environment alters these biological systems to encourage weight gain seeley said according to seeley a big part of the environment that encourages weight gain is the availability and consumption of calorically dense highfat foods in particular what we eat can alter the brain regions that regulate body weight leptin is a key hormone that is secreted from fat tissue or adipose tissue and its main function is to inhibit appetite via a number of molecular mechanisms eating a highfat diet reduces the actions of leptin in the brain this miscommunication can lead to increased food intake and weight gain evolutionary speaking we are designed to want to eat foods that are high in fat and gain weight because it made it easier to survive times when food was not available however that is no longer a real concern since food is almost always available but we still have a biological desire to eat these calorically dense foods so how do we intervene and change this drive he said he also said that says there are several key points in successful therapeutic interventions for the population facing social financial and health consequences of obesity the key issue is to find ways to take these biological systems that usually make it hard to lose weight and make them work for us to so that it is easier for obese individuals to lose weight as we understand the molecular interaction between what we eat and these brain circuits that regulate our body weight we can design interventions that reduce the body weight that our bodies defend this will mean that people trying to lose weight would be able to work with their biology rather than trying to use will power to overcome their biology that pushes them back to their obese state such an endeavour will ultimately require a wide range of scientists from different fields to reduce both the human and monetary costs of the obesity epidemic he added the study has been published in the journal cell metabolism source ani diabetes diagnosis triggers
