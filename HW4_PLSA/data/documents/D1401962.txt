temperatures in montreal can get down to freezing so yes snow is always a possibility but it is a rarity and if it occurs it is most likely flakes in the air that melt on contact with the warm ground or sometimes a bit that falls overnight and melts within a couple of hours but these are not the norm they are more common in november on average montreal gets its first snow that actually sticks around the first week of december freezing rain is more of a winter event typically in december or january as it requires very percise weather conditions so generally speaking you should be able to count on typical fall weather conditions as far as clothing bring a jacket perferably one that is waterproof and that you can easily layer up under if the weatherman calls for rain or it is a coolish day or evening as rescue team has pointed out daytime temps can be all over the map the average is somewhere between 10 and 20 10  50 f 20  70 f hope this is helpfulwine42report inappropriate
