relationship between force and torque how do we calculate the amount of torque produced by a given force since it depends on leverage we should expect it to depend on the distance between the axis and the point of application of the force well derive an equation relating torque to force for a particular very simple situation and state without proof that the equation actually applies to all situations the simple physical situation we use to derive an equation for torque a force that points directly in at or out away from the axis produces neither clockwise nor counterclockwise angular momentum a force in the perpendicular direction does transfer angular momentum consider a pointlike object which is initially at rest at a distance r from the axis we have chosen for defining angular momentum we first observe that a force directly inward or outward along the line connecting the axis to the object does not impart any angular momentum to the object a force perpendicular to the line connecting the axis and the object does however make the object pick up angular momentum newtons second law givesand assuming for simplicity that the force is constant the constant acceleration equation a  δvδt allows us to find the velocity the object acquires after a time δt δv  fδt we are trying to relate force to a change in angular momentum so we multiply both sides of the equation by mr to give dividing by δt gives the torque if a force acts at an angle other than 0 or 90 °with respect to the line joining the object and the axis it would be only the component of the force perpendicular to the line that would produce a torquealthough this result was proved under a simplified set of circumstances it is more generally validrelationship between force and torque the rate at which a force transfers angular momentum to an object ie the torque produced by the force is given byτ   rf  where r is the distance from the axis to the point of application of the force and f is the component of the force that is perpendicular to the line joining the axis to the point of application the geometric relationships refered to in the relationship between force and torque the equation is stated with absolute value signs because the positive and negative signs of force and torque indicate different things so there is no useful relationship between them the sign of the torque must be found by physical inspection of the case at hand from the equation we see that the units of torque can be written as newtons multiplied by meters metric torque wrenches are calibrated in n·m but american ones use footpounds which is also a unit of distance multiplied by a unit of force we know from our study of mechanical work that newtons multiplied by meters equal joules but torque is a completely different quantity from work and nobody writes torques with units of joules even though it would be technically correct selfcheck compare the magnitudes and signs of the four torques shown in the figure answer p 158how torque depends on the direction of the force sometimes torque can be more neatly visualized in terms of the quantity r shown in figure q which gives us a third way of expressing the relationship between torque and forceτ  r  f   of course you would not want to go and memorize all three equations for torque starting from any one of them you could easily derive the other two using trigonometry familiarizing yourself with them can however clue you in to easier avenues of attack on certain problems
