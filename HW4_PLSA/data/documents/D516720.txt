ï¿½cryptosporidium  a waterborne pathogen 1b k avery a lemley and a g hornsby 2what is cryptosporidium cryptosporidium criptoesporideeum is a protozoan a singlecelled parasite that lives in the intestines of animals and people this microscopic pathogen causes a disease called cryptosporidiosis criptoesporidee0sis the dormant inactive form of cryptosporidium called an oocyst 0osist is excreted in the feces stool of infected humans and animals the toughwalled oocysts survive under a wide range of environmental conditions what are the symptoms of cryptosporidiosis the most common symptom of the disease is watery diarrhea there may also be abdominal cramps nausea lowgrade fever dehydration and weight loss symptoms usually develop 4 to 6 days after infection but may appear any time from 2 to 10 davs after infection people with healthy immune systems are usually ill with cryptosporidiosis for several days but rarely more than two weeks some infected individuals may not even get sick some people with cryptosporidiosis seem to recover then get worse again those who are infected may shed oocysts in their stools for months even after they no longer appear to be ill cryptosporidiosis may cause complications for those with illnesses or conditions such as diabetes alcoholism or pregnancy the effects of prolonged diarrhea and dehydration can be dangerous especially for the very young the elderly and the frail cryptosporidiosis is most severe and longlasting in immunocompromised individuals those whose immune systems are weak such as people infected with hiv the virus that causes aids cancer patients on chemotherapy transplant patients or others taking medications that suppress the immune system this disease can be lifethreatening for the immunocompromised how is this disease diagnosed and treated cryptosporidiosis cannot be diagnosed by symptoms alone watery diarrhea is a symptom of many intestinal diseases caused by bacteria viruses or parasites if cryptosporidium is the suspected cause of an intestinal illness the doctor should request a specific diagnostic test there is currently no drug that can cure cryptosporidiosis people with competent immune systems will recover on their own and appear to develop some immunity to subsequent infections antidiarrheal medicines may ease some of the symptoms anyone with diarrhea should drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration how is the pathogen spread you can get infected with cryptosporidium when you put anything in your mouth that has been in contact with feces from an infected animal or person when large numbers of people get cryptosporidiosis the source of infection can sometimes be tracked down but it is impossible to determine the origin of many individual cases of this disease your hands may be contaminated with cryptosporidium through persontoperson contact perhaps while changing a childs diaper caring for someone with diarrhea or engaging in any activity that involves touching areas of the body contaminated with feces cryptosporidiosis can be easily spread among people in close social groups such as families day care centers and nursing homes people who work with animals especially young animals or animals with diarrhea have a greater chance of exposure to the parasite you may pick up oocysts while handling a litter box soil or any object contaminated with even a small amount of feces you can also get cryptosporidiosis by drinking water or eating food that has been contaminated with oocysts drinking untreated surface water such as streams rivers and lakes or swallowing a small amount of water when swimming even in a chlorinated pool can cause cryptosporidiosis see figure 1 the parasite may also be spread in uncooked foods beverages or ice prepared with contaminated water unwashed fresh fruits or vegetables may carry oocysts if manure was used or animals grazed where the crop was grown figure 1 people who are infected or whose hands become contaminated with cryptosporidium can spread the disease to other people or pets if they are not careful about their hygiene frequent hand washing is the single most important thing people can do to avoid spreading cryptosporidiosis and other illnesses it is especially important to wash thoroughly before preparing food as well as after using the toilet oocysts are not killed by typical household disinfectants including bleach but are killed at temperatures over 160 degrees fahrenheit hotter than most domestic hot tap water thorough drying in a clothes dryer will kill oocytes by desiccating them is cryptosporidiosis a new disease cryptosporidiosis has long been a veterinary problem predominantly in young farm animals such as calves cryptosporidium was first recognized as a cause of human disease in 1976 but was rarely reported in humans until 1982 the number of detected cases began to rise rapidly along with the aids epidemic and the development of methods to identify the parasite in stool samples the earliest cases of human cryptosporidiosis were diagnosed in animal handlers an outbreak at a day care center was first documented in 1983 in 1987 13000 people in carrollton georgia became ill with cryptosporidiosis this was the first report of its spread through a municipal water system that met all state and federal drinking water standards in the spring of 1993 in milwaukee wisconsin municipal drinking water again within standards was found to be contaminated with cryptosporidium an estimated 400000 people became ill and the disease contributed to the deaths of some aids patients these outbreaks focused attention on the risk of waterborne cryptosporidiosis and the possible need for stricter drinking water standards how many people get cryptosporidiosis we do not know exactly how many cases of cryptosporidiosis actually occur many people do not seek medical attention or are not tested for this parasite and so cryptosporidium often goes undetected as the cause of an intestinal illness health professionals in some states are on the lookout for cases of cryptosporidiosis through surveillance programs at hospitals clinics and labs the centers for disease control and prevention cdc in atlanta georgia keep track of many diseasecausing organisms and send out warnings and advice on controlling outbreaks to every health department in the united states how prevalent is cryptosporidium in surface water oocysts are present in most surface bodies of water eg lakes rivers across the united states many of which supply public drinking water oocysts are more prevalent in surface waters when heavy rains increase runoff of wild and domestic animal wastes from the land or when sewage treatment plants are overloaded or break down only laboratories with specialized capabilities can detect the presence of cryptosporidium oocysts in water unfortunately current sampling and detection methods are unreliable it is difficult to recover oocysts trapped on the material used to filter water samples looking at a sample under a microscope it is not easy to determine whether an oocyst is alive or whether it is the species cryptosporidium parvum that can infect humans the number of oocysts detected in raw untreated water varies with location sampling time and laboratory methods water treatment plants remove most but not always all oocysts from municipal drinking water it is not known exactly how many oocysts are sufficient to cause cryptosporidiosis but the low numbers of oocysts sometimes present in drinking water are not considered cause for alarm for the general public how can we protect our water supplies from cryptosporidium multiple barriers are needed to protect our water supplies from cryptosporidium treatment methods alone cannot solve the problem watershed protection and monitoring of water quality are critical water treatment cryptosporidium oocysts have tough walls that can withstand many environmental stresses and are resistant to the chemical disinfectants such as chlorine that are traditionally used in municipal drinking water systems and swimming pools physical removal of particles including oocysts from water by filtration is an important step in the municipal water treatment process typically water pumped from rivers or lakes into a treatment plant is mixed with coagulants that help settle out particles suspended in the water if sand filtration is used even more particles are removed finally the clarified water is disinfected and piped to customers filtration is the only conventional method now used in the united states for controlling cryptosporidium ozone is a strong disinfectant that kills protozoa if sufficient doses and contact times are used but ozone leaves no residual for killing microorganisms in the distribution system as does chlorine the high costs of new filtration or ozone treatment plants must be weighed against the benefits of additional treatment even welloperated water treatment plants cannot ensure that drinking water will be completely free of cryptosporidium oocysts watershed protection watershed protection is another barrier to cryptosporidium in drinking water land use controls such as septic system regulations and best management practices to control runoff can help keep human and animal wastes out of the water water treatment and monitoring regulations under the surface water treatment rule of 1989 public water systems are required to filter surface water sources unless water quality and disinfection requirements are met and a watershed control program is maintained this rule however did not address cryptosporidium the u s environmental protection agency epa has set standards for turbidity cloudiness and coliform bacteria which indicate that pathogens are probably present in drinking water frequent monitoring is required so officials will have an early warning of potential problems and can take steps to protect public health unfortunately there are no water quality indicators that can reliably predict the occurrence of cryptosporidium more accurate and rapid assays for oocysts will make it possible to notify residents promptly if their water supply is contaminated with cryptosporidium and thus avert outbreaks efforts are under way to answer questions about the occurrence detection and treatment of cryptosporidium in water so that the epa and individual states can set specific standards for this parasite in the future the collaborative efforts of water utilities government agencies health care providers and individuals are needed to prevent outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis how can you tell if tap water is safe properly drilled and maintained wells that tap into ground water are unlikely to contain pathogens because of the natural filtration that takes place as water percolates down through the soil but contaminants may get into groundwater aquifers that lie beneath coarse soils or fractured bedrock very shallow or poorly constructed wells and springs can be contaminated with surface water runoff that carries diseasecausing microbes it is important that the well be protected from surface contamination by an intact well casing proper seals and a cap above ground the risk of waterborne cryptosporidiosis from public drinking water varies depending on the quality of the source water and type of water treatment hivinfected persons should follow guidelines issued by the cdc and talk with their health care providers about safe drinking water when routine testing of public drinking water indicates potential danger the health department or water utility will issue a boil water notice how can you make sure your own drinking water is safe there are three measures you may wish to take to ensure that your drinking water is safe boil your water to kill the pathogen remove oocysts from your water with certain types of filters or drink certain types of bottled water boiling water is the best method of killing cryptosporidium and other waterborne pathogens water should be brought to a rolling boil for at least one minute it should be stored in the refrigerator in a clean bottle or pitcher with a lid to prevent recontamination be careful not to touch the inside of the water bottle or lid water can be filtered to remove cryptosporidium oocysts and the cysts of another protozoan parasite giardia lamblia pointofuse filters may be used to treat the water for drinking or preparing foods they may be either attached to a faucet or have a pourthrough design only filters with an absolute not nominal pore size of one micron or smaller will remove all the oocysts viruses however can pass through a one micron filter the pores of reverse osmosis ro are too small for oocysts to pass through nsf international an independent nonprofit testing agency publishes lists of filters and ro units certified for cyst reduction follow the manufacturers instructions that are supplied with water treatment equipment to prevent clogging and ensure proper filtration the filter cartridge s and membranes will need to be replaced periodically improper maintenance can actually increase health risks isnt all bottled water safe to drink under current standards bottled water is not necessarily any safer than tap water bottled water from deep wells groundwater sources has a very low likelihood of containing oocysts but bottled water from a surface water source has the same risk of containing oocysts as tap water from that source unless it is treated before bottling read the label on bottled water for information about the water source and treatment water can be distilled or pasteurized to kill all pathogens before bottling procedures for using ozone to inactivate oocysts in bottled water have not yet been established oocysts can be removed by reverse osmosis or a filter with an absolute one micron rating other microfiltration or ionexchange methods or treatment with chlorine carbon dioxide or ultraviolet light cannot promise cryptosporidiumfree water the heat of pasteurization will kill all pathogens in dairy products bottled and canned carbonated drinks such as sodas and beer are usually heated or filtered enough to kill or remove cryptosporidium how can you avoid getting cryptosporidiosis you can minimize the chances of getting infected with cryptosporidium and numerous other pathogens by always practicing good hygiene especially after possible exposure to sources of infection people with compromised immune systems must consistently take precautions to avoid exposure to cryptosporidium wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water and supervise childrens handwashingafter using the toilet or changing diapersafter handling animals or cleaning up fecesafter working in soil or touching any objects such as shoes that may have been contaminated with fecal matter andbefore preparing serving or eating food avoid drinking untreated water from lakes streams and other surface water bodies because of possible contamination with manure peel or rinse fruits or vegetables to be eaten raw take extra care in selecting food and drink when traveling to places with poor sanitation follow any water advisory issued by local health departments state authorities or the national centers for disease control and prevention to treat contaminated water before drinking it bring it to it a rolling boil for at least one minute to kill oocysts or remove them with a filter with an absolute pore size of one micron or smaller for more information contact your state or local health department call the water utility serving your area contact the cooperative extension office in your county call the u s environmental
