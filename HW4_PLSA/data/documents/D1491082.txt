require clarification a subpoena commanding you to testify at a trial that begins at a certain time on a particular date may not actually require your attendance at that specific time trials can last several days or weeks so it is a good idea to ask the attorney party or other person issuing the subpoena when you actually should come to court once you have a full understanding of what the subpoena

resolve the objections including use of a court hearing if necessary there are requirements for how you must respond to a subpoena when providing requested testimony documents or materials for instance when producing documents or other records you must produce them as they are kept in the usual course of business or must organize and label them to correspond to the categories of the request
