was way too simplistic so he negotiated with the studio for an additional half a million dollar budget and a week of filming to add a fourth act to the movie showing how the alien stowed away aboard the shuttle and ripley trying to flush it out scott originally wanted a much darker ending where the alien climbs back into the shuttle and ripley harpoons it but it makes no difference the alien runs towards her slams through her masks and rips her head off it would then sit in her chair and start mimicking captain dallas voice saying im signing off hopefully the network will pick me up apparently 20th century fox wasnt too pleased with such a dark ending according to scott while pitching this idea over the phone there was a long and uncomfortable silence within fourteen hours a studio

kane into the ship despite ripleys objections although the company had programmed mother to reroute the nostromo and investigate the origin of the species the computer functioned under its own special protocol as mother states in the final scenes she was not keen on betraying the crew but she took a neutral place by allowing the creature to enter the ship gestate and evolve when ripley scolds mother the cpu retorts that her allegiance lies only to science the data for this keyproduct would be fascinating for the scientific world the producers and writers finally realized that this revelation would be too reminiscent of hal 9000 in 2001 a space odyssey 1968 they kept mother as the cpu but incorporated ash as the seventh and final character who was always intended to be the spy he was written as an android and much of his attitude echoes the scrapped mother storyline he opens the hatch to allow the parasite to enter the ship despite the quarantine rules in the directors cut he monitors the stain inside kane but lets it incubate he wants to keep the dead facehugger for further studies and he repeatedly expresses his wonder for the new fascinating species ash even had

ridley scott and the producers they didnt understand why there would be water pouring or chains dangling in a ship such as this scott feeling he needed the extra movement stuck to his guns43 of 44 found this interesting  share this although dan obannon and ronald shusett had included a clause in the script stating that all of the characters could be either male or female they hoped to avoid what was already becoming a clich√© in horror films the female in danger being the only one left alive to face the killer at the climax later referred to as the final girl phenomena ironically thats exactly how the character of ripley ended up although it must be noted that from the outset she is much stronger and more resourceful than the typical horror film final girl75 of 79 found this interesting  share this lamberts offscreen death according to the novel was supposed to be the alien forcing her body into a vent too small for it40 of 43 found this interesting  share this walter hill and david giler s most significant contribution to the script was to make ash an android although dan obannon has been reluctant to acknowledge any positive changes by hill and giler ronald shusett has described the addition as a significant improvement to the plot41 of 45 found this interesting  share this the shot where the xenomorphs tail goes through lamberts legs and up her back was actually taken from the scene in which brett was killed the pants and boots dont fit what lambert is wearing in the scene where she encounters the alien originally her character was to crawl away from the alien and essentially die from fright hiding in a locker but this was never shot28 of 30 found this interesting  share this several planned but unfilmed scenes were dallas and parker using a craft called the flying bedstead to enact repairs on the exterior of the ship while in space a sex scene between ripley and dallas the crew using internal cameras to look for the alien where they find it halfway matured looking something like a cross between the chestburster and an egg with feet dallas death was to take place in a huge upside down wind tunnel in the air duct system dallas looks up to see the alien on the ceiling of this massive cylinder where it leaps from one side to the other in a superfast descent toward him the alien was to pull ripley out of the shuttle with the grapple wire where she shoots it with a pistol and makes her way back inside before destroying it with the engines28 of 30 found this interesting  share this the scene with the alien exploding from the stomach was a reference that came to dan obannon because he struggled with stomach problems45 of 50 found this interesting  share this the xenomorph in this film is slightly different from others of his kind featured in the sequels in terms of behavior unlike the other aliens in the franchise which kill only for food host gathering or selfdefense the alien in this film is implied multiple times in the film novelization and several scripts to be very sadistic and enjoys killing for fun this is shown when the alien kills parker he waits thirty seconds or so while squeezing parker so hard he bleeds before finally killing him with a headshot26 of 28 found this interesting  share this ridley scott has recently said that blade runner 1982 shares a universe with the alien franchise which of course shares a universe with prometheus even beyond that the alien and predator franchises share a universe as well as shown in the alien vs predator movies in total this means that five different movie franchises blade runner one film alien four films prometheus two films predator three films and alien vs predator two films share a universe this also means that there are a total of thirteen films in this franchise fifteen if you include the upcoming movies53 of 61 found this interesting  share this the character of ash and subsequently an android character being introduced into the film is what dan obannon calls a russian spy someone on a mission who it is discovered intends to sabotage said mission if it wasnt in there what difference does it make the screenwriter asks i mean who gives a rats ass so somebody is a robot obannon was annoyed by the character being added and called it an inferior idea from inferior minds well acted and well directed 27 of 30 found this interesting  share this the scene where ash is decapitated caused an usher in london to faint31 of 35 found this interesting  share this bretts death was storyboarded by ridley scott originally for the alien to use its inner mouth to take his heart out of his chest harkening back to the image of the space jockey the alien would then leave brett where he would be found by parker and ripley whod cradle his body scott abandoned this idea due to it being too similar a death to the chestburster scene and the scene that now plays was made up on the day it was shot25 of 28 found this interesting  share this a scene scripted but only partially filmed was referred to as the air lock scene it was supposed to take place after the scene where ripley finds out about ashs special order parker contacts ripley and lambert over the intercom saying that he is watching the alien moving in a corridor near an inner airlock door he asks lambert to open the inner door from the bridge in the hope that the alien will enter the air lock so they can close the door and blow it out into space ripley makes her way to parkers position and the plan seems to work until an alarm suddenly goes off it startles the alien and as it escapes the air lock its tail gets crushed under the inner door its blood causes a small hull breach which temporarily decompresses the section knocking ripley and parker unconscious after being revived ripley is convinced that ash set off the alarm in order to protect the alien this leads to the scene where ash traps and assaults ripley her nosebleed was meant to be an aftereffect of the decompression only the shots from the nostromos bridge were filmed but the remainder of the scene had to be scrapped due to time limitations20 of 22 found this interesting  share this a different version of ash explaining to the remaining crew what his mission was had much different dialogue according to veronica cartwright ash originally asked them if they had tried to communicate with the

the amount of screentime of the xenomorph to make its limited appearance all the more scary6 of 6 found this interesting  share this it was rumored that when the film premiered on the itv network in the uk in 1982 a scene was shown which happened towards the end of the film in which the aliens shadow could be seen as it sneaks aboard the escape shuttle just before ripleys terrifying final

interesting  share this the scene where the alien enters the room and approaches lambert was trimmed down and reshot originally it was filmed in wide shots showing the full alien as it approached lambert while walking on all fours bellyup ridley scott felt it made the xenomorph appear too human in configuration so it was reshot mainly with closeups and far less focus on the alien2 of 2 found
