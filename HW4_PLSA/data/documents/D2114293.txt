every year in the u s more than one million people visit the emergency room with ankle injuries of these the majority are sprains and fractures and in many cases it can be hard to tell the two apart at first while a fracture refers to a break in one or more of the ankle bones tibia fibula talus or calcaneus a sprained ankle refers to damage to the ligaments of the ankle due to overstretching beyond their normal range of motion however both of these conditions can be very painful and occur as a result of similar injuries some of the most common causes of ankle pain include sports injuries walking on uneven surfaces and car accidents ankle sprains ankle sprains can range from mild to severe in nature and are commonly observed in athletes the most common symptoms are sudden pain swelling bruising and an inability to walk if the sprain is mild you may only experience some tenderness when touching and may not have any or only very little swelling on the other hand in severe cases the swelling may be substantial and the pain intolerable with weightbearing on the foot being next to impossible if you suspect that you have sprained your ankle adhere to the socalled rice protocol – rest icing the ankle using compression bandages to wrap the ankle and elevating the foot to reduce the swelling and pain for severe cases you may need to wear a boot or splint to stabilize the ankle and take overthecounter pain medications if you are an athlete you may even require physiotherapy before going back to your normal sports activities ankle fractures similarly to ankle sprains ankle fractures are a common type of sports injury however unlike ankle sprains a broken ankle always requires medical attention if the swelling and pain do not resolve within a day or two of following the rice protocol and if you are unable to walk on the foot you should see a doctor if the ankle appears deformed or if you experience numbness weakness or reduced circulation of the affected leg you should see a sports medicine physician immediately how to tell the difference so with the symptoms being so similar how can you tell a broken or sprained ankle apart well there are a few distinguishing signs to keep in mind first try to recall if there was a sound when you were injured a “cracking” noise may be a sign that the ankle is broken while sprains may be associated with a “popping” sound second check if the ankle appears deformed or crooked in addition to being swollen as this may be a sign of a fracture third the presence of numbness is indicative of a fracture moreover if you cannot move the ankle joint at all are in extreme pain and cannot put any weight at all on the ankle it is likely that it is broken to be sure it is important that you are examined by your gp or by a sports injury doctor which may include having an xray how to reduce the risk of ankle injuries while there is no way to fully avoid contracting a sports injury there are certain things you can do to reduce the risk these include avoiding playing sports when you are in pain or are very tired eating a wellbalanced diet in order to maintain a healthy weight and to nourish your muscles always warming up before exercising and cooling down afterward building muscle strength wearing good shoes and other protective equipment as needed and trying to always run on flat surfaces
