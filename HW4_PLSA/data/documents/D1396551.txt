sort lan on customer premise wan off customer premise connects sites across a region country the world man off customer premise version of a wan but connects a single metropolitan area such as a city and its suburbs implementation of a man and wan carrier man and wans ability to choose technology limited who manages lan and man network carrier price of man and wan based on strategy not cost highly unpredictable lan cost low cost per bit transmitted man cost medium cost per bit transmitted wan cost high cost per bit transmitted lan speed range 100 mbps to 1 gpbs man speed range 10 mbps to 100 mbps wan speed range 1 to 50 mbps what drives many related decisions regarding lan man and wan cost per bit can a lan use switched and routed technology yes can a man use switched and routed technology yes can a wan use switched and routed technology yes with  and  customers dont often see the underlying transport details man and wancan a lan be a single switched network or an internet yes can a wan be a single switched network an internet yes what are the 3 components of a wan network core access point customer premise equipment cpehow are the 3 components of a wan connected access links connect the customer premise equipment to the network the network core connects access links to other access links pstn local loop link between customer premises and end office switch local loop

multiplexer which side uses dslam telephone company endoffice switch can your dsl provider be different than your isp yes cable modem service coaxial cable service created to bring television to homes with pour over the air reception twoway data service cable modem service cable modem service popularity popular in the us but not other places coaxial cable has two conductors inner wire conductor in insulation outer conductor mesh within jacket cable in neighborhood uses this coaxial cable shared throughputcable television head end central distribution point where thick coaxial cable travels to neighborhoods thin coaxial drop cable access line to individual homes thick coaxial cable travels through neighborhood splitter and two way amplifier twoway amplifier allows data transmission in both directions adsl versus cable modem service cable modem faster but higher individual cost adsl slower transmission at lower costs depends on your local market and things are evolving leased line data networks have a  at each site routerdedicated leased lines expensive and becoming rarer psdn public switched data networks has psdn cloud core only one leased line per site leased line connects to access points called pops where are local boise pops airport dt business parks psdn standards x25 frame relay atm metropolitan ethernet x25 slow and expensive inexistant frame relay 256 kbps to 40 mbps the range of the greatest corporate demand carriers raised prices to improve profit margins which has reduced growth atm    a grand vision atm created to replace the core of pstn has been adopted for psdnatm underlies other service offerings such as dsl and cable modem man ethernet speed of 1 mbps to 100 mbps flexible because carrier can provision or reprovision speed rapidly only psdn service growing rapdly psnds are arranged in meshes so they use virtual circuit operations virtual circuit  best path true when is best path or virtual circuit chosen before transmission begins frames have virtual circuit numbers instead of destination addresses are there alternative routes in virtual circuit no the internet is a wan corporations are beginning to use it for wan traffic attractions for using the internet for wan  price per bit is low because of large economies of scale  all corporate sites employees vendors business partners are connected to the internet issues of using the internet for wan security of traffic flowing over the internet  variable quality of service with no guarantees how can users secure the internet for wan firewall antivirus filtering vpns if all sites connect to a single isp the isp can provide qo s guarantees what does the cellsite contain carriers transmission equipment which goes to the mtsocells allow reuse so they can serve more customers channel

does handoff mean one cell site to another within the same carrier within the same carriers system in cellular telephony what does roaming mean from a system in one city to another carrier system1g

factors that effect throughput time of day smart phone limited technology location sharing cellular and 80211 convergence faster speeds for cell phone transmission since it connects to 80211 helps customers stay under transmissio quota limits helps carriers offload traffic from flatfee users can smartphones act as aps yes however carriers charge for this because it adds to traffic and their cost do most companies use multiple wan technology components yes virtual wan provides overall management and integration for of the individual wan components virtual wan advantages desirable redundancy and flexibility efficiency of overall management individual components can be added and dropped easily simulate effects before implementation
