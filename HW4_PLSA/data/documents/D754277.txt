particularly in africa south east asia the western pacific latin america and the mediterranean hookworm is one of three members of a family of parasites known as the soiltransmitted helminths sths and affects more than 700 million people across the globe left untreated hookworm causes internal blood loss leading to irondeficiency anemia and protein malnutrition particularly in pregnant women and children chronic hookworm infection in children contributes to physical and intellectual impairment learning difficulties and poor school performance hookworm is a serious global concern contributing to an estimated 43 percent reduction in future wage earnings in affected areas hookworm transmission is a complex repetitive cycle hookworm larvae are found in human feces and transmitted to humans from contaminated soil through the skin usually due to walking barefoot or by accidentally ingesting contaminated soil once inside the body larvae are carried through the bloodstream to the lungs and mouth where they are swallowed digested and passed to the small intestine the larvae mature into halfinchlong worms which attach themselves to the intestinal wall and feed on human blood adult worms mate and hatch thousands of eggs which are passed into the feces of the human host if the feces come into contact with soil under the right conditions the eggs hatch into larvae and are retransmitted to humans beginning the cycle again there are two common species of hookworm necator americanus and ancylostoma duodenale hookworm transmission requires the development of eggs into larvae in soil and the infection cannot be spread through personal contact disease overview risks warm tropical or subtropical environments areas with poor or improper sanitation management pregnant women and women of childbearing age preschool and schoolage children farmers and others in contact with contaminated soil symptoms itching or rash where contaminated soil has touched the skin abdominal pain diarrhea weight loss andor loss of appetite extreme fatigue and weakness intestinal blood loss resulting in anemia andor malnutrition transmission hookworm larvae enter the body through the skin and find their way to the small intestine there they mature into adult worms by attaching themselves to the intestinal wall and feeding on human blood as the worms feed they cause severe internal bleeding leading to abdominal pain and diarrhea anemia and eventual malnutrition treatments education on sanitation and hygiene specifically regarding the proper use of latrines and shoewearing anthelminthic drugs albendazole albenza or mebendazole vermox on an annual basis200 million tablets of mebendazole donated per year by johnson  johnson until 20201 billion tablets of albendazole donated per year from glaxo smith kline additional need available for us 002 per pill the sabin vaccine institute product development partnership sabin pdp is working to develop a vaccine to prevent hookworm infection and eliminate reliance on current drug therapies development is currently in a phase i clinical trial disease burden prevalence700 million people worldwide including 44 million pregnant women tropical or subtropical environments in povertystricken areas of africa latin america southeast asia and china world’s leading cause of anemia and protein malnutrition particularly in pregnant women and children disease impact major cause of stunting in children causes intellectual and cognitive deficits children with hookworm have shown a 23 percent drop in school attendance“deworming” treating hookworm has been shown to be the most costeffective mechanism to improve school attendance pregnant women with hookworm are at high risk for low birthweight babies and poor milk production and their infants have higher rates of malnutrition and mortality pregnant women who develop anemia are three and a half times more likely to die in childbirth efforts at control the most effective prevention method for controlling chronic hookworm infection includes both proper sanitation management efforts and educational campaigns aimed at the use of latrines in addition two drugs are available to treat active hookworm infection albendazole and mebendazole in 2001 the world health organization adopted a resolution aimed at the deworming of 75 percent of all atrisk schoolage children by 2010 the largest public health program ever attempted to date the sabin vaccine institute is developing a hookworm vaccine which is currently in a phase i clinical trial the 2012 who road map added 75 coverage of
