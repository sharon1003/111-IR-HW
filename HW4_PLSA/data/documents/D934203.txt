when preparing for surgery we will provide you with information on nutritional supplements to discontinue and provide you with supplements that will aid in your recovery good nutrition supports faster healing after a surgical procedure wound healing sets off a complex chain of events that involves an increased demand for nutrients this activity requires a number of vitamins minerals and other chemical cofactors to complete its job without these building blocks wound healing takes longer and may be compromised for a wound to heal successfully you’ll need adequate amounts of several nutrients including carbohydrates protein fat vitamins and minerals if you don’t meet your body’s nutritional needs you may be at risk for increased bruising and swelling delayed wound healing and other woundrelated complications recovery guidelines – everything you need to know your regular multivitamin doesn’t cut it if you’re lacking in essential nutrients you can’t cover the gaps in your diet by taking a daily multivitamins a regular multivitamin will not support your body’s needs following surgery a regular multivitamin is usually formulated with vitamin e while this fatsoluble nutrient is an excellent antioxidant and confers a number of health benefits it is not recommended during the preoperative period because it can promote bleeding a regular multivitamin will also not have sufficient amounts of the micronutrients to help repair and build new tissue eliminate the freeradicals that are generated by surgery and boost the immune system which is typically compromised following surgery in addition a multivitamin won’t help with the bruising swelling and inflammation that often accompanies a surgical or nonsurgical procedure recovery is as simple as the abcs as it turns out three nutrient groups will help you get back on your feet faster including arnica montana bromelain and clinical support  read below to learn how each of these abcs helps with bruising swelling inflammation and wound healing a – arnica montana what is it arnica montana is daisylike plant native to europe asia and north america that is sometimes referred to as the “mountain daisy” or “leopard’s bane” while there are a variety of different products and uses for arnica homeopathic arnica montana is the most common preparation designed for use as a natural treatment for bruising arnica is believed to increase the flow of blood around bruised tissue causing escaped fluids to be absorbed by the body the absorption of the fluids makes black and blue marks go away faster and reduces the swelling by relieving the pressure on nerve endings due to their delicate nature homeopathic preparations are always delivered sublingually ie under the tongue when taking homeopathic tablets drop the tablets into the lid of the bottle not in your hand and place the tablets under your tongue this prevents the medication from rubbing off into your hand how much do i take dosing frequency for arnica increases in relation to the severity of bruising for a product like vita medica’s arnica montana blister pack which is designed specifically for injectables and fillers you will take 4 tablets twice daily for larger or more invasive procedures for which vita medica’s arnica montana 30x bottle or arnica antibruise kit may be better suited you will take 3 tablets three times per day until bruising subsides what types of procedures will benefit injectables and fillers nonsurgical or minimally invasive procedures like facial laser treatments or blepharoplasty eg fraxel® or eyelid surgery all facial surgeries b – bromelain with quercetin what is it historically bromelain has been used in both folk and modern medicine as a digestive aid and as a natural antiinflammatory bromelain can be used for many different conditions but it has documented therapeutic effects in the treatment of inflammation studies have shown that bromelain can help reduce inflammation and swelling after surgery quercetin is a type of flavonoid – a plant pigment that gives plants and fruits their color – that has antiinflammatory and antioxidant properties quercetin found concentrated in foods such as onions and apples reduces the manufacture and release of histamine and other allergic and inflammatory mediators this flavonoid is also a potent antioxidant and may help protect against diseases like heart disease and cancer studies have shown that systemic enzymes for inflammation like bromelain combined with quercetin produce greater antiinflammatory benefits than either one used alone how much do i take vita medica’s bromelain with quercetin combines both antiinflammatory supplements into one convenient formulation to be effective at least 3000 mcus of bromelain must be consumed in divided amounts during the course of a day to ensure that the bromelain works on the site of injury and not in aiding digestion it is best to take it on an empty stomach for quercetin dosing is measured in milligrams mg the recommended dosage varies based on the type and extent of the issue to be treated dosages can range from 500 – 2500 mg per day in divided doses bromelain should be taken 72 hours or 3 days prior to surgery bromelain should be continued for 7 days following surgery what types of procedures will benefit facial procedures ranging from facelifts to eyelid surgery blepharoplasty breast surgeries such as fat grafting to breasts breast lifts and reductions and breast augmentation all body contouring procedures such as tummy tucks liposuction or cellulaze ™ c – clinical support program what is it clinical support program is a specialty multinutrient formula developed by david h rahm m d vita medica’s founder and medical director for his surgical patients clinical support is designed to promote wound healing enhance immune system function and reduce oxidation generated by surgery and anesthetic agents this nutraceutical features key vitamins minerals and antioxidants at much higher yet safe levels than a typical multi to restore damaged tissue importantly the specialty formula excludes vitamin e and other herbals which can be problematic and should be avoided around the time of surgery the twopart program is formulated with extra vitamin a vitamin c  bioflavonoids copper selenium and zinc to support healing the formula also uses chronotherapy to provide the right nutrients at the right time of day this approach takes into consideration that our bodies’ requirements for certain nutrients differ based on the time of day for this reason the morning formulation contains the bulk of vitamins especially the bcomplex to support daytime activity levels conversely the evening formulation contains the bulk of minerals to promote rest and relaxation how much do i take the recommended dosing is 3 tablets taken with breakfast or lunch and 3 tablets taken with dinner or before bedtime patients should begin taking clinical support program 14 days prior to surgery and continue taking the product 14 days following surgery what types of procedures will benefit individuals with impaired wound healing particularly diabetics smokers comprehensive surgeries such as a tummy tuck abdominoplasty breast lift breast reduction or breast reconstruction facelift putting it all together based on the above arnica is used primarily for bruising bromelain for inflammation and swelling and clinical support for wound healing remember the demands on the body are much higher during the healing process and it is important to a eat healthy diet during this period of surgery preparation and recovery you can take a proactive approach by remembering your abcs augmenting your diet with vita medica’s arnica montana bromelain with quercetin and clinical support program will help simplify and speed the healing process
