in latin because he was latin and if petrarch who was tuscan was not afraid to write in tuscan why should i who am sicilian be shunned for writing in sicilian must i make myself a parrot for the language of others  antoniu venezianu antonio veneziano monreale 7 january 1543 palermo 19 august 1593many souls even sicilians and those of sicilian descent have the same misconception held by italians and nonitalians everywhere that sicilian is simply a different cruder form of the italian language nothing could be further from the truth while todays italians and sadly todays sicilians are told by those that know that sicilian is the language of the poor or ignorant the sicilian language was the first romance language to develop from latin the early language of state as such it includes not only words derived from latin roots as did the italian dialect tuscan which became the official italian language but it has rich inclusions from the tongues of the many occupiers of sicily including carthaginian greek arabic french and spanish sicilian was the language of poets taught in the sicilian school of roger the great a thousand years ago but it is no longer taught in sicilian schools if youre an italian american the odds are good that your immigrant ancestors like the majority of italian émigrés during the great migration were from sicily a nation which once extended from naples and abruzzo to messina and palermo and that they spoke not italian but sicilian this page is inspired by the facebook group speak sicilian  httpbitlylearn to speak sicilian  where you can read or write in the sicilian language ask how to say an english word or phrase in sicilian ask what a sicilian word means in english or learn or teach sicilian vowels in the sicilian language have the following sounds phonetics are in english a is “ah” e is “eh” “long a” i is “ee” o is “oh” “long o and u is “oo” “ a e i o  u ” in italian is “ah eh ee oh oo”  the english sound of i “long i” as in “eye” is given by the combination “ai” in sicilian sicilian has no letter k y or w it has a letter written like j but this j is a form of the letter i and is pronounced as we would pronounce y in english in sicilian spellings c if it is followed by a o or u is pronounced like the english k but if it is followed by an i or e then c is pronounced like the english ch as in church double cc is also pronounced as the english k ch in sicilian is not pronounced as in english but sounds like the english k so my cousins the miccich è family pronounce their surname meecheekay similarly g is pronounced as in the english good if followed by a o or u but g is pronounced like the english j as in george if it is followed by an i or e in sicilian pronunciation the g sound at the start of words is often swallowed and sometimes also the middle of words the g is silent when followed by the consonant l the consonant z at the start of a word is generally pronounced as in english while zz is pronounced tz as in pizza there is no j as such in the sicilian language when the letter i has the sound a y has in english it is written with a tail and looks like a j but it is not pronounced like the english j for example jiri english phonetics yihrih jiurnu yournoo saju sighyou etc is sicilian a dialect some generally northern italians try to imply that sicilian is simply a dialect of the italian language the italian language itself was once a dialect toscano or tuscan which was one of many apennine peninsula dialects that developed from latin many modern day languages trace their origins to the latin spoken in ancient rome these are the romance languages which include tuscan italian spanish portugese french and rumanian but there is strong evidence that the first romance language to develop from latin was the sicilian language im not a trained linguist and my knowledge of tuscan is booklearned while i learned sicilian at my mothers knee however im a selftaught student of languages and my education as an engineer has taught me to have a curiosity for how all things have developed when words are considered in their latin origin and then compared in sicilian and italian the words seem to me to have clearly progressed from latin to sicilian to italian in some cases italian words bear no likeness to latin and sicilian words that are clearly related in latin brother is frater frahtehr in sicilian its frati frahtih in tuscanitalian its fratello fruhtelloh i seriously doubt that the word went from frater to fratello to frati it seems clear that the progression was from latin to sicilian to tuscan the same can be said for the words for sister latin soror sicilian soru tuscan sorella  the latin verb to go is ire  in sicilian its jiri in tuscan its andare  the latin verb i come is venio sicilian veniu tuscan vengo  which language came first in latin as in sicilian and tuscan many nouns have masculine or feminine endings latins endings are us oos for the masculine and a ah for the feminine again to me it seems much more likely that the many sicilian masculine nouns that end in u oo derive directly from latin and that the tuscan masculine ending of o came later examples are rabbit latin cuniculus sicilian cunigliu and tuscan coniglio and son latin filius sicilian figliu and tuscan figlio in my youth i mistakenly thought that ny parents pronounced the italian sound of o as u  after serious reconsideration i believe that in fact the tuscan and italian pronunciation changed devolving the original latin and sicilian u to sound like o other words presented in the order latin sicilian tuscan show similar evolution wife mulieri muglieri moglie and how quomodus comu come and then there are words for which the sicilian is clearly derived from the latin while the tuscan appears to have come from a completely different source in latin the verb to go is ire ihreh in sicilian its jiri yihrih but in tuscanitalian its andare  in latin the pronoun he is illus sicilian iddu but in tuscan its lui and she is illa in latin idda in sicilian but lei in tuscan the sicilian words given below are as i learned them from parents who left sicily a hundred years ago as such they reflect the language as it was spoken in sicily around the beginning of the 1900s which was not much modified by incursions of the tuscan dialect that the risorgimento imposed on sicily i believe its purity was also enhanced by the fact that serradifalco is and was a small interior town having limited contact with speakers of tuscan or the modified sicilian dialects of other regions language scholar alissandru caldiero author of grammar of the sicilian language has informed me that my sicilian that is my parents sicilian resembles the language

of language report that dante alighieri the medieval poet was greatly influenced by the language that had been spoken at the court of sicilys frederick ii namely the sicilian tongue that was studied and written at the famous sicilian school  dante is credited with polishing the tuscan dialect doing so with words and ideas adapted from the sicilian school and its language for example the sonnet a form of poetry unknown before fredericks reign evolved in sicily only to become a major form of poetry throughout not only italy but the world sicilian is a language that is true however like many other languages it has different dialects within it that have developed in various regions of sicily and in the south of the apennine peninsula below is a vocabulary of english words and their meanings in sicilian with variations for the dialects of several towns or regions it appears that in central sicily in caltanissetta province northern agrigento province and eastern palermo province the classic sicilian language still prevails as it was spoken in the court of frederick ii this is characterized by words like figliu son and cunigliu rabbit which in dialects elsewhere have become figghiu and cunigghiu and especially lu masculine the la feminine the and li plural the which in dialects have devolved into u a and i i invite all sicilians and all those of sicilian descent to email
