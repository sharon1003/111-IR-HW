travis hoium  tmfflush drawdec 15 2017 at 238pmdespite nearly two years of hype around the oculus rift and htc vive there are still short of 2 million of those highend virtual reality headsets in consumers hands today even adding in the 2 million headsets for sonys  nyse sne ps4 thats still only around 4 million devices out there offering a fully immersive experience to take the vr industry to the next level companies need to make their technology both more accessible and less expensive most homes and businesses dont have computers with the highend graphics cards required to run vr headsets and most consumers dont want to spend over 1000 nor take up a rooms worth of space to install a vr system at home facebook  nasdaq fb and htc have been trying to tackle that problem and with the planned 2018 debuts of the oculus go and vive focus in china only for now they may succeed the new oculus device in particular may finally achieve the sales numbers required to take vr mainstream in the u s image source facebooks oculus what is oculus go the oculus rift is one of the top virtual reality headsets on the market today offering an immersive vr experience and industryleading content but the headset has to be tethered to a computer and its use is confined to the space that can be seen by oculus sensors image source facebooks oculus the oculus go headset will create a similar feel of immersion but it stands alone requiring no support from a computer in this its somewhat like a samsung gear vr or google  nasdaq goog  nasdaq googl daydream headsets but those devices require the processing power and screen of a separate smartphone the go does not this reduces the cost from as much as 1000 for a headset plus a smartphone to 200 for a purposebuilt headset with its screen and processors built in the go headset comes with a separate controller that will provide a way for users to control videos games and other experiences itll be a full vr experience all in one contained device oculus go isnt a cureall for vrs woes the downside of oculus go is that it provides only 3 degrees of freedom dof head tracking rather than the 6 dof head tracking offered by the rift and vive in other words using a go likely wont give quite the same experience as those highend tethered headsets  but it should be a better experience than samsung gear google daydream or google cardboard the challenge is that these midtier experiences lack the wow factor that will likely be needed to drive wider vr adoption and to incentivize the creation of better content thatll require a nextlevel device like the oculus santa cruz a 6 dof highend standalone headset thats currently in the prototype stage and on track to be in developers hands next year virtual reality could take a step toward the mainstream oculus go doesnt have to be the best vr headset to be a success it just has to bring a level of quality and content to the market that will impress consumers and intrigue them about the next generation of devices given the relatively low number highend headsets that have been sold so far i would consider 30 million sales an impressive number for the oculus go to hit in its first year that may sound like a lot but remember its only a 200 device and facebook ceo mark zuckerberg has said he wants to get vr in the hands of 1 billion people around the world if oculus go can get near that 30 million mark it will prove the mainstream vr market drive more interest from hardware and content companies and build awareness among consumers thats the real hope for facebooks most important vr product yet suzanne frey an executive at alphabet is a member of the motley fools board of directors travis hoium has no position in any of the stocks mentioned and owns a locationbased virtual reality startup the motley fool owns shares of and recommends alphabet a shares alphabet c shares and facebook the motley fool has a disclosure policy
