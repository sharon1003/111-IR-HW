include tiers sometimes up to three or four a bento is traditionally wrapped in a patterned furoshiki cloth the bento is an example of a revived japanese tradition as it had all but died out after

jackofalltrades may be master of none but because izakaya serve a bit of everything they are a good way to get acquainted with japanese food and satisfy conflicting palates  as well as drink copious amounts of alcohol of course in many ways they fill the same gap that the pub does in england or the bar in the us family run establishments can be like a home away from home for the local neighbourhood brashly lit chain izakaya in business districts and near railway stations are where salaried workers pile into to leave the days stresses behind higherend izakaya are your gastropub where the food takes centre stage what links them all is an eclectic menu of foods that go well with sake or beer japanese favourites will always feature such as sashimi tempura noodles and all sorts of deep fried and grilled dishes none however will be enough to fill you up the idea is not so much a sitdown dinner as a sitdown drink with nibbles on the side if youre very hungry making a night of it at an izakaya can really add up best to stave off your hunger with beers and snacks and then stagger around looking for something filling and cheap later top of page kaiseki often in japan the way things are done are just as important as the results kaiseki sums up that ethic in a meal you are there to admire the elegance of the pottery and the attentive heights of formal japanese hospitality as much as the food itself every dish served in what is often a tencourse meal is a celebration of the artistry and subtleties of nature not only every season but every month has a particular spirit to be expressed in the food all senses are stimulated by kaiseki and if its part of your stay in a ryokan allow the combined experience to nourish both your body and soul largely vegetarian though sometimes with fish and occasionally with meat kaiseki is japanese cuisine of the utmost freshness and delicacy everything will be prepared and presented with a grace that can only be described as art in order to give the guest a feeling of complete tranquility consequently it can set you back a few yen it is though an essential experience you will find nothing to approach it anywhere else in the world japanese full course kaiseki dinner top of page kaiten sushi fast becoming an institution all over the world kaiten lit revolving sushi has brought the conveyor belt out of the factory and into our hearts in reality most items never make it round more than once being thrown away when they lose their freshness the busiest places always serve the freshest fish and watching the chefs working at the speed they do is a wonder to behold in general kaiten sushi is the lower end of the market but consequently its often very cheap dishes are either all one price or colour coded with a guide on the wall stack up the plates as you eat or in larger places drop them into a letterbox in the counter and the bill is calculated automatically great for finding your favourites and getting better quality elsewhere its worth remembering that even things you dont like at a kaiten sushi restaurant might blow you away at a classier establishment top of page conveyor belt sushi 回転寿司your browser does not

uncharacteristically for japanese food there is little thats subtle about kushikatsu dining the formula is unashamedly simple if you can skewer it you can deepfry it and if you can deepfry it it will taste better than if you had grilled it or baked it you should be able to see whats on offer at the counter pork chicken fishcakes and various vegetables are the norm but if youre lucky you might find oysters goose liver and matsutake mushrooms at some places youll be able to order stick by stick at others the chef will give you what he feels is best remember to tell him to stop at some point either way it will be served bit by bit and hot to your table leaving plenty of gaps for beer to cleanse the palate top of page nabemono sukiyaki  shabushabu chankonabemono is the class of onepot stews cooked and served at the table its often an interactive experience that everyone gets involved in with raw ingredients served alongside a bubbling pot of stock once all the ingredients have flavoured the stock rice or noodles are dropped into the pot and anyone left hungry can fill up on that meat chicken seafood tofu mushrooms fishcakes and any ingredients that happen to be the local speciality are all served in nabe form but its most famous incarnation has to be sukiyaki outside japan its almost as well known as sushi but only here will you get the chance to try it with kobe or even matsuzaka prime beef the thinly sliced meat cooks in seconds dip it in raw egg to give it a silky cloak on the way to your mouth all nabe are presented beautifully to emphasise their plentiful and bounteous nature thats all except chanko the nabe that makes sumo wrestlers as big as they are the importance of the visual feast comes a distant second to who can get the best bits first at chanko restaurants often run by former wrestlers there is always plenty to go around japanese nabe with meat and vegetables top of page okonomiyaki its certainly not pizza and its not quite an omelette but something akin to a thick pancake with trimmings it usually comes partcooked to a teppan hotplate at your table where you finish the job yourself but dont ask for the manager if the ingredients come raw just beat the egg stir in the fillings and flatten the mixture on the teppan with the metal spatula provided turning after five minutes aim for crisp and browned on the outside while still soft on the inside you can get okonomiyaki with gyu beef buta pork ebi shrimp ika squid tako octopus or yasai vegetables and even hotate scallops or kaki oysters though this is by no means a comprehensive list okonomiyaki literally means cook what you like and just about anything goes with these dashi seasoned patties get a mikkusu mixed okonomiyaki for a bit of everything a tasty quick and inexpensive meal thats osaka down to a tee top of page ramen its not just noodle soup its an institution ramen is the cornerstone of japanese fast food and millions of bowls are consumed every day the ramenya is usually at streetlevel and easy to spot often little more than a kitchen and a counter with heads bent low over large steaming bowls many are outdoors in busy shopping areas and some dispense with seats and have standing space only theres no ceremony to ramen so abandon convention and slurp to your hearts content noisy slurping also serves a practical function a sharp intake of air can cool down the noodles that are best eaten as fresh as possible some even say that like with wine the air on the tongue brings out the flavour of the soup what is certain is that everyone has their favourite place for it and a locals recommendation is certainly worth getting you might get the choice between miso bean paste shoyu soy or shio salt flavoured soup though the stock base is always made from meat bones many places however serve only one kind that may well be the result of years of experimentation popular toppings follow its chinese origins and include fatty slices of chashu roast pork crunchy fresh bean sprouts and menma seasoned bamboo shoots japanese spicy ramen top of page soba  udon in contrast to the chinesestyle egg noodles used in ramen these are traditionally japanese udon made from wheat are thick white and doughy in texture soba made from buckwheat are quite different they are thinner greyish in colour and require little chewing explaining how the japanese manage to eat them so quickly both are served in similar ways in the same restaurants though some specialise in one or the other places that knead their own noodles are highly regarded because a coarser texture makes for a more interesting mouthful one favourite summer meal is zarusoba here the noodles are served cold and piled on a bamboo rack youll get a cup of soyflavoured broth with some grated radish wasabi and sliced spring onions for you to mix into it dip the noodles in the cup and slurp them down you can also get zaruudon but its far more popular with soba equally popular are soba and udon served kake which is in hot clear soup a popular topping for which is tempura or simply the fried batter scraps from the tempura pan that add a little substance to the thin broth remember though these noodles are notorious for providing only temporary relief from hunger so order the days teishoku or setto set menu and get a rice dish on the side udon noodles in broth top of page sushi  sashimi so most of it is raw fish  dont let it put you off sushi and sashimi are real japanese treasures and after a few times eating them youll wonder why fish is ever cooked at all nowhere is the freshness of fish more important than in japan and if you can find a place near a fish market or fishing port so much the better some cooked fish is used most often eel and tamagoyaki a light and slightly sweet omelette is also served as sushi but after maguro raw tuna sake raw salmon and ebi raw shrimp there will be no turning back eat it as presented by putting the whole thing in your mouth and dealing with it attempt to nibble and youre certain to make a mess the green stuff is wasabi a kind of horseradish mix a little with your soy and dip  its not something youd want to spread on toast nigiri sushi sometimes called edomae sushi is raw fish balanced on bitesized rice balls and sashimi is raw fish only with the rice it can be surprisingly filling but its hard to make a meal of sashimi alone fill up with any rice dishes that may be on offer or chawanmushi a bowl of savoury egg custard steamed with all sorts of goodies inside mixed sashimi raw fish starter in a japanese restaurant top of page tempura typical of such successful cultural magpies the japanese took their inspiration for tempura from the portuguese and made it into something that they love as their own it is said that the ailing shogun ieyasu tokugawa liked this new culinary acquisition so much that he gorged himself on it and died as a result but thats not to say that tempura is unhealthy though it is deepfried if done correctly it is not at all greasy the idea is to achieve a batter so light as to be barely there and use the freshest ingredients cut so they can be cooked quickly tempura is something to be eaten at the counter so you can watch the chef at work and eat your food when its at its freshest the standard selection consists of prawn mushroom eggplant carrot a whole small fish sea eel and a perilla leaf teishoku set meals usually come with rice and miso soup prawn and vegetable tempura top of page unagi with the hot summer months comes unagi season this is when eels all over the country are mercilessly sliced lengthways while merely unconscious and then grilled steamed and seasoned into one of the bestloved dishes of japanese cuisine as is always the case with foods that the japanese have taken to heart the intricacies of preparation have been explored with a thoroughness that approaches obsession some chefs say that it takes a full 30 years just to master how to sharpen the eelfilleting knife unagi is a highenergy food eaten for its stamina building properties it is said to give you what you need to get through taxing summer days a handy excuse to eat more of what you can get all year round anyway unagi fills the mouth with a creamy pasty texture and the sweetish sauce thats brushed on as it cooks adds to the richness it can be quite overwhelming on its own so its usually served on a bed of rice as unadon or unaju the only difference between the two being the shape of the bowl round or square and the proportion of eel to rice the more you pay the more well eeled you are unagi eel on a bed of rice top of page yakiniku  korean food theres more to beef than steaks its true but after you have had a yakiniku barbecue youll never look at a cow in the same way again it might be hard to stomach some of the more farout cuts such as the range of offal on offer but the efficiency with which these animals are being put to use has to be appreciated favourite cuts for the diy barbecue are karubi beef rib tan tongue and rosu slices of meat often marinated but chargrilled meat is only the tip of the iceberg the more adventurous can try senmai tripe tan sashimi raw tongue or the absolute pick of the bunch nama lebaa raw calves liver its served with sesame oil and chopped spring onions and at its best its heavenly but korean food has spread much further than just yakiniku restaurants kimchi korean spicy pickled cabbage is now about as popular as any japanese pickle reimen the spicy cold noodle dish can now be found in ramen joints many variations on bibinba the popular postyakiniku filler of rice and vegetables have appeared including versions with cheese purists would say that yakiniku in japan is a far cry from its korean origins but the japanese dont seem to mind typically theyve taken a foreign idea and made it entirely their own  via the west of course their hunger for korean food extends to chijimi korean pancake flavoured potato chips and karubi pizzas top of page yakitori chargrilled chicken on skewers with a cold beer on the side an appealing idea im sure youll agree street stalls and downtotheearth establishments will have their own specialities either preparing it tare sweetish or shio salted often little more than a few counter seats in front of a busy chef if ever your head turns to follow an enticing smoky smell thats yakitori lots of these places also serve other chicken dishes and delicacies on offer that might sound unappetising at first one example is nankotsu  chicken cartilage its often the knobbly bits on the ends of the legs but much better when its the bit from the breast bone some places even serve chicken sashimi leave any fears of raw meat at the door and try it especially kimo raw liver its a dreamy meltinthemouth experience but watch out  yakitori pricing can sometimes be confusing its quite common for the menu to give the price for only one skewer when they actually serve and charge for two japanese yakitori grilled chicken on a skewer japanese curry curry カレー pronounced kare supposedly came to japan with the british navy at the beginning of the meiji period in the late 19th century this caught on with the japanese navy which was modeled on that of britain and spread from the port cities of yokohama and kobe to the rest of japan curry is
