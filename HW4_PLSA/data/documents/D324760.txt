inpatientby shelley c safian ph d ccsp cpch cpciwhen a patient is diagnosed with an alcohol or drugrelated disorder the diagnosis is often more complex as these conditions are susceptible to both psychological and physiological signs symptoms manifestations and comorbidities icd10cm provides many more combination codes for these diagnoses which could actually result in less work for coders below is a comparison of current icd9cm codes with the equivalent icd10cm codes icd9cm icd10cm3050x alcohol abuse f101 alcohol abuse3030x acute alcoholic intoxication f102 alcohol dependence f109 alcohol use unspecified3055x opioid abuse f111 opioid abuse3040x opioid type dependence f112 opioid dependence f119 opioid use unspecified3052x cannabis abuse f121 cannabis abuse3043x cannabis dependence f122 cannabis dependence f129 cannabis use unspecified3054x sedative hypnotic or anxiolytic abuse f131 sedative hypnotic or anxiolyticrelated abuse3041x sedative hypnotic or anxiolytic dependence f132 sedative hypnotic or anxiolyticrelated dependence f139 sedative hypnotic or anxiolyticrelated use unspecified3056x cocaine abuse f141 cocaine abuse3042x cocaine dependence f142 cocaine dependence f149 cocaine use unspecified the first thing you might notice is that icd10cm couples the abuse and dependence codes rather than locating them in separate code categories icd10cm includes codes to specifically report the “use” of alcohol and drugs that will allow providers to track patient behavior that often will ultimately have a negative impact on the patient’s health these details can provide researchers with useful information as they look for better ways to care for patients with addiction all of the above codes in both icd9cm and icd10cm require additional characters to identify details from the documentation about manifestations and comorbidities let’s take alcohol abuse as an example of what details may need to be abstracted from the clinical documentation alcohol use abuse and dependence the icd9cm code category 3050x alcohol abuse corresponds with icd10cm category f101 but the subcategory specifications are different in icd9cm you have three choices in addition to an unspecified option30501 alcohol abuse continuous30502 alcohol abuse episodic30503 alcohol abuse in remission in icd10cm you will have these specific options as well as unspecified choices in each category f1010 alcohol abuse uncomplicated f10120 alcohol abuse with intoxication uncomplicated f10121 alcohol abuse with intoxication delirium f1014 alcohol abuse with alcoholinduced mood disorder f10150 alcohol abuse with alcoholinduced psychotic disorder with delusions f10151 alcohol abuse with alcoholinduced psychotic disorder with hallucinations f10180 alcohol abuse with alcoholinduced anxiety disorder f10181 alcohol abuse with alcoholinduced sexual dysfunction f10182 alcohol abuse with alcoholinduced sleep disorder f10188 alcohol abuse with other alcoholinduced disorder you can see the required details change significantly in icd9cm the details focused more on a timeline of the patient’s use of the alcohol or drug involved whereas icd10cm requires a deeper understanding of the psychological and behavioral impact of the abuse or dependence you will report signs symptoms manifestations and comorbidities such as delirium mood disorder and hallucinations with one combination code from this subsection instead of needing to look for a second code in the subcategories for alcohol use and dependence you will also find codes for states such as withdrawal again providing one combination code rather than needing a second code to report this condition for example icd9cm icd10cm30301 acute alcoholic intoxication continuous f10231 alcohol dependence with withdrawal delirium2910 alcohol withdrawal delirium other nontherapeutic substances the extended descriptions and combination code choices include codes used to report the use of other nontherapeutic substances such as hallucinogens caffeine and inhalants icd9cm icd10cm3053x hallucinogen abuse f161 hallucinogen abuse3045x hallucinogen dependence f162 hallucinogen dependence f169 hallucinogen use unspecified3059x other mixed or unspecified drug abuse inhalant abuse caffeine intoxicationf181 inhalant abuse3057x amphetamine or related acting sympathomimetic abuse f15120 other stimulant abuse with intoxication uncomplicated caffeine amphetaminerelated disorders3046x other specified drug dependence inhalant dependencef182 inhalant dependence3054x amphetamine and other psychostimulant dependence f15220 other stimulant dependence with intoxication uncomplicated caffeine amphetaminerelated disordersf189 inhalant use unspecified f15920 other stimulant use with intoxication uncomplicated caffeine amphetaminerelated disordersicd10cm code descriptions separate inhalant abuse and dependence into their own specific code category f18 caffeine remains included in the “other” code category now combined with amphetaminerelated disorders though it varies by code additional characters required for these icd10cm codes will include searching documentation for details on accompanying conditions such as intoxication delirium perceptual disturbance mood disorder psychotic disorder with delusions or hallucinations anxiety disorder flashbacks nicotine dependence one more addition to this subsection of the mental and behavioral disorders chapter of icd10cm is code category f17 nicotine dependence which again goes into much further detail than icd9cm codes 3051030513 the excludes1 note reminds you that this is not the same diagnosis as tobacco use z720 nor history of tobacco dependence z87891 therefore the documentation will need to specifically discern between tobacco use and nicotine dependence icd10cm classifies nicotine dependence by substance f1720 nicotine dependence unspecified f1721 nicotine dependence cigarettes f1722 nicotine dependence chewing tobacco f1729 nicotine dependence other tobacco product each category further breaks down the dependence using a sixth character to denote uncomplicated 0in remission 1with withdrawal 3with other nicotineinduced disorders 8use abuse and dependence guidelines in some cases physicians may document a combination of use abuse and dependence of the same substance icd10cm includes the following hierarchy to follow in those situations if both use and abuse are documented assign only the code for abuse if both abuse and dependence are documented assign only the code for dependence if both use and dependence are documented assign only the code for dependence if use abuse and dependence are all documented assign the code for dependence the bottom line is that icd10cm has reorganized these codes in a more logical and efficient order and provided you with many more combination codes thereby reducing your work editor’s note shelley c safian ph d maomhsm ccsp cpch cpci ahimaapproved
