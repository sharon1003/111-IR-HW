anorexia causes and effects there are no simple answers to the causes of anorexia anorexia is a complex condition that arises from a combination of many social emotional and biological factors although our culture’s idealization of thinness plays a powerful role there are many other contributing factors including your family environment emotional difficulties low selfesteem and traumatic experiences you may have gone through in the past major risk factors body dissatisfaction strict dieting low selfesteem difficulty expressing feelings perfectionism troubled family relationships history of physical or sexual abuse family history of eating disorders effects of anorexia while the causes of anorexia are uncertain the physical effects are clear when your body doesn’t get the fuel it needs to function normally it goes into starvation mode and slows down to conserve energy essentially your body begins to consume itself if selfstarvation continues and more body fat is lost medical complications pile up and your body and mind pay the price source national womens health information center getting help deciding to get help for anorexia is not an easy choice to make it’s not uncommon to feel like anorexia is part of your identity—or even your “friend”you may think that anorexia has such a powerful hold over you that you’ll never be able to overcome it but while change is hard it is possible steps to anorexia recovery admit you have a problem up until now you’ve been invested in the idea that life will be better—that you’ll finally feel good—if you lose more weight the first step in anorexia recovery is admitting that your relentless pursuit of thinness is out of your control and acknowledging the physical and emotional damage that you’ve suffered because of it talk to someone it can be hard to talk about what you’re going through especially if you’ve kept your anorexia a secret for a long time you may be ashamed ambivalent or afraid but it’s important to understand that you’re not alone find a good listener—someone who will support you as you try to get better stay away from people places and activities that trigger your obsession with being thin you may need to avoid looking at fashion or fitness magazines spend less time with friends who constantly diet and talk about losing weight and stay away from weight loss web sites and “proana” sites that promote anorexia seek professional help the advice and support of trained eating disorder professionals can help you regain your health learn to eat normally again and develop healthier attitudes about food and your body medical treatment for anorexia the first priority in anorexia treatment is addressing and stabilizing any serious health issues hospitalization may be necessary if you are dangerously malnourished or so distressed that you no longer want to live you may also need to be hospitalized until you reach a less critical weight anorexia recovery tip 1 understand this is not really about weight or food the food and weightrelated issues are in fact symptoms of something deeper things like depression loneliness insecurity pressure to be perfect or feeling out of control things that no amount of dieting or weight loss can cure the difference between dieting and anorexia healthy dieting anorexia healthy dieting is an attempt to control weight anorexia is an attempt to control your life and emotions your selfesteem is based on more than just weight and body image your selfesteem is based entirely on how much you weigh and how thin you are you view weight loss as a way to improve your health and appearance you view weight loss as a way to achieve happiness your goal is to lose weight in a healthy way becoming thin is all that matters health is not a concern in order to overcome anorexia you first need to understand that it meets a need in your life for example maybe you feel powerless in many parts of your life but you can control what you eat saying “no” to food getting the best of hunger and controlling the number on the scale may make you feel strong and successful—at least for a short while you may even come to enjoy your hunger pangs as reminders of a “special talent” that most people dont possess anorexia may also be a way of distracting yourself from difficult emotions when you spend most of your time thinking about food dieting and weight loss you don’t have to face other problems in your life or deal with complicated emotions unfortunately any boost you get from starving yourself or shedding pounds is extremely shortlived dieting and weight loss can’t repair the negative selfimage at the heart of anorexia the only way to do that is to identify the emotional need that selfstarvation fulfills and find other ways to meet it tip 2 learn to tolerate your feelings identifying the underlying issues that drive your eating disorder is the first step toward recovery but insight alone is not enough let’s say for example that following restrictive food rules makes you feel safe and powerful when you take that coping mechanism away you will be confronted with the feelings of fear and helplessness your anorexia helped you avoid reconnecting with your feelings can be extremely uncomfortable it’s why you may feel worse at the beginning of your recovery but the answer isn’t to return to the destructive eating habits you previously used to distract yourself it’s to learn how to accept and tolerate all of your feelings—even the negative ones using mindfulness to cope with difficult emotions when you start to feel overwhelmed by negativity discomfort or the urge to restrict food take a moment to stop whatever you’re doing and investigate what’s going on inside identify the emotion you’re feeling is it guilt shame helplessness loneliness anxiety disappointment fear insecurity accept the experience you’re having avoidance and resistance only make negative emotions stronger instead try to accept what you’re feeling without judging yourself dig deeper where do you feel the emotion in your body what kinds of thoughts are going through your head distance yourself realize that you are not your feelings emotions are passing events like clouds moving across the sky they don’t define who you are once you learn how to accept and tolerate your feelings they’ll no longer seem so scary you’ll realize that you’re still in control and that negative emotions are only temporary once you stop fighting them they’ll quickly pass for a stepbystep guide to learning how to manage stress and uncomfortable emotions check out help guide’s free emotional intelligence toolkit tip 3 challenge damaging mindsets people with anorexia are often perfectionists and overachievers they’re the “good” daughters and sons who do what they’re told try to excel in everything they do and focus on pleasing others but while they may appear to have it all together inside they feel helpless inadequate and worthless if that sounds familiar to you here’s the good news these feelings don’t reflect reality they’re fueled by irrational selfsabotaging ways of thinking that you can learn to overcome damaging mindsets that fuel anorexia allornothing thinking through this harshly critical lens if you’re not perfect you’re a total failure you have a hard time seeing shades of gray at least when it comes to yourself emotional reasoning you believe if you feel a certain way it must be true “i feel fat” means “i am fat” “i feel hopeless” means you’ll never get better musts mustnots and havetos you hold yourself to a rigid set of rules  “i must not eat more than x number of calories ” “i have to get straight a’s” “ i must always be in control” etc and beat yourself up if you break them labeling you call yourself names based on mistakes and perceived shortcomings “i’m unhappy with how i look” becomes “i’m disgusting” slipping up becomes “i’m a “failure”catastrophizing you jump to the worstcase scenario if you backslide in recovery for example you assume that there’s no hope you’ll ever get better put your thoughts on the witness stand once you identify the destructive thoughts patterns that you default to you can start to challenge them with questions such as“what’s the evidence that this thought is true not true”“what would i tell a friend who had this thought”“is there another way of looking at the situation or an alternate explanation”“how might i look at this situation if i didn’t have anorexia”how to stop worrying selfhelp strategies as you crossexamine your negative thoughts you may be surprised at how quickly they crumble in the process you’ll develop a more balanced perspective tip 4 develop a healthier relationship with food even though anorexia isn’t fundamentally about food over time you’ve developed harmful food habits that can be tough to break developing a healthier relationship with food entails getting back to a healthy weight starting to eat more food changing how you think about yourself and food letting go of rigid food rules while following rigid rules may help you feel in control it’s a temporary illusion the truth is that these rules are controlling you not the other way around in order to get better you’ll need to let go this is a big change that will feel scary at first but day by day it will get easier get back in touch with your body if you have anorexia you’ve learned to ignore your body’s hunger and fullness signals you may not even recognize them anymore the goal is to get back in touch with these internal cues so you can eat based on your physiological needs allow yourself to eat all foods instead of putting certain food off limits eat whatever you want but pay attention to how you feel physically after eating different foods ideally what you eat should leave you feeling satisfied and energized get rid of your scale instead of focusing on weight as a measurement of selfworth focus on how you feel make health and vitality your goal not a number on the scale the role of meal plans healthy eating plan enjoy and stick to a healthy diet if you need to gain weight a nutritionist or dietician can help you develop a healthy meal plan that includes enough calories to get you back to a normal weight while you can do this on your own you’re probably out of touch with what a normal meal or serving size looks like getting past your fear of gaining weight getting back to a normal weight is no easy task the thought of gaining weight is probably extremely frightening and you may be tempted to resist but this fear is a symptom of your anorexia reading about anorexia or talking to other people who have lived with it can help it also helps to be honest about your feelings and fears the better your family and treatment team understand what you’re going through the better support you’ll receive helping someone with anorexia while there are things you can do to help someone with an eating disorder you can’t force the person to get better and because of the defensiveness and denial involved in anorexia you’ll need to tread lightly waving around articles about the dire effects of anorexia or declaring “you’ll die if you don’t eat” probably won’t work a better approach is to gently express your concerns and let the person know that you’re available to listen if your loved one is willing to talk listen without judgment no matter how out of touch the person sounds tips for helping a loved one think of yourself as an “outsider” as someone not suffering from anorexia there isn’t a lot you can do to “solve” your loved one’s anorexia it is ultimately their choice to decide when they are ready be a role model for healthy eating exercising and body image don’t make negative comments about your own body or anyone else’s take care of yourself seek advice from a health professional even if your friend or family member won’t and you can bring others—from peers to parents—into the circle of support don’t act like the food police a person with anorexia needs compassion and support not an authority figure standing over the table with a calorie counter helping someone with an eating disorder advice for family and friends avoid threats scare tactics angry outbursts and putdowns bear in mind that anorexia is often a symptom of extreme emotional distress and develops out of an attempt to manage
