11historical boundaries the judean hills hurvat itri in judea the classical romanjewish historian josephus wrote in the limits of samaria and judea lies the village anuath which is also named borceos this is the northern boundary of judea the southern parts of judea if they be measured lengthways are bounded by a village adjoining to the confines of arabia the jews that dwell there call it jordan however its breadth is extended from the river jordan to joppa the city jerusalem is situated in the very middle on which account some have with sagacity enough called that city the navel of the country nor indeed is judea destitute of such delights as come from the sea since its maritime places extend as far as ptolemais it was parted into eleven portions of which the royal city jerusalem was the supreme and presided over all the neighboring country as the head does over the body as to the other cities that were inferior to it they presided over their several toparchies gophna was the second of those cities and next to that acrabatta after them thamna and lydda and emmaus and pella and idumea and engaddi and herodium and jericho and after them came jamnia and joppa as presiding over the neighboring people and besides these there was the region of gamala and gaulonitis and batanea and trachonitis which are also parts of the kingdom of agrippa this last country begins at mount libanus and the fountains of jordan and reaches breadthways to the lake of tiberias and in length is extended from a village called arpha as far as julias its inhabitants are a mixture of jews and syrians and thus have i with all possible brevity described the country of judea and those that lie round about it 12geography mediterranean oak and terebinthwoodland in the valley of elah

hills rising to 600 millimetres 24 in around western jerusalem in central judea falling back to 400 millimetres 16 in in eastern jerusalem and dropping to around 100 millimetres 39 in in the eastern

major urban areas in the region include jerusalem bethlehem gush etzion jericho and hebron 13geographers divide judea into several regions the hebron hills the jerusalem saddle the bethel hills and the judean desert east of jerusalem which descends in a series of steps to the dead sea the hills are distinct for their anticline structure in ancient times the hills were forested and the bible records agriculture and sheep farming being practiced in the area animals are still grazed today with shepherds moving them between the low ground to the hilltops as summer approaches while the slopes are still layered with centuriesold stone terracing the jewish revolt against the romans ended in the devastation of vast areas of the judaean countryside 14mount hazor marks the geographical boundary
