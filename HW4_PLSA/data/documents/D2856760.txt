mob city premiered this week with a sumptuous noir aesthetic but not much in the way of rich characters for some though the most notable part of the series is that it costars milo ventimiglia — aka jess from gilmore girls what better occasion then to revisit the residents of stars hollow where are these actors now and more important what shows should they be on lauren graham one thing you notice upon repeat and repeat and repeat viewings of gilmore girls is that lorelai is almost psychotically selfish and selfabsorbed but you like her anyway and that is because lauren graham is great where is she now shes lorelai 20 on parenthood where she plays the single mom sarah braverman and where should she be that seems right alexis bledel oh rory gilmore so uptight and kissassy and constantly stressed out for a girl so smart she sure had lousy taste in dudes where is she now shes engaged to pete from mad men and shes the star of the upcoming fox comedy us  them an american version of gavin and stacy the show has only filmed seven episodes so the future is not looking bright and where should she be her three episodes of mad men indicated that she looks right in period garb and plays a good midcentury sad person get this woman on masters of sex alreadyscott patterson let no chin go unstubbled no shirt be notplaid luke danes is on the case where is he now after the wonderful and underrated aliens in america was canceled in 2008 he was on the event which was also canceled hes also in a bunch of smallish movies and where should he be on the mindy project since he is the spiritual forefather of chris messinas eternal grouch danny castelano edward herrmann nobody messes with insurance genius and bowtie aficionado richard gilmore except his daughter and granddaughter who mess with his heart where is he now herrmanns been on a dozen shows here and there playing authoritative lawyerdoctorjudgeminister types mostly and where should he be playing some kind of disgraced senator on scandal kelly bishop lorelai and her mother never hug and barely touch in seven whole seasons thats how withholding emily gilmore is with affection where is she now she was until recently costarring on bunheads r i p and where should she be she could also be a disgraced senator on scandal given how much casting overlap the shows already have but shed also fit right in on american horror story melissa mc carthy did it sometimes feel like lorelai was taking advantage of her bff sookie st james s talent and good nature yeah once in a while where is she now trapped on the terrible mike and molly though she has earned an emmy for the role she became a household name after bridesmaids which earned her an oscar nomination and she anchored two of this years three highestgrossing comedies — the heat and identity thief and where should she be her stars still rising as it should beliza weil she started out as the nasty antagonist constantly getting in rorys way but eventually paris geller became the shows best oneliner factory where is she now weil was a major part of the first season of scandal as amanda tanner and is another bunheads alum and where should she be on the newsroom that show could use a few of her withering stares keiko agena rorys hometown bestie lane kim deserved a better story line in later seasons married at what 20 and pregnant with twins after one unpleasant act of intercourse short end of the stick where is she now another gg  scandal crossover agena played one of the people who was killed when fitz got shot shes hit the shondaland trifecta actually appearing on one episode each of private practice and greys anatomy too shes also appeared on a few episodes of shameless and where should she be veep her brief gig on scandal made it clear she can seem very politically savvy jared padalecki why do so many 19yearolds get married in stars hollow for some reason rorys first love dean got married as a teenager though he did manage to squeeze in enough adultery to be rorys first sexual partner where is he now supernatural and where should he be on supernatural which will be on tv forever milo ventimiglia at some point rorys romance with the doofy but devoted dean had to run its course and jess mariano was just the guy to make it happen all broody and moody and literate where is he now he did heroes for four years and now hes in the frank darabont miniseries mob city plus hes in a bunch of movies and where should he be on the good wife butting heads with cary agos matt czuchry ah yes chapter three in the great rory romance chronicles logan huntzberger  his parents were jerks and he himself was …mostly a jerk which is why it was weird that rory dated him for so damn long where is he now on the good wife as the slightly less jerky cary agos and where should he be tgw is the correct place for him yanic truesdale confession i have no idea why so many fans loved michel i found him insufferable hes a terrible employee and he hates everyone bleh where is he now he did some frenchlanguage television in canada and where should he be on a sitcom somewhere trophy wife maybe suburgatory sean gunn every town needs a mailman and a d j and a grocery store cashier and in stars hollow kirk is all of those things and more where is he now he was on the web series h for a while and of course popped up on bunheads and where should he be on agents of s h i e l d that show could use someone as entreatingly weird as kirk  this post has been corrected to spell logans last name correctly
