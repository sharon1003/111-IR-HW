told that there is somekind of transfer system to get fuel from one side to other what is going here share this conversation answered in 26 minutes by 9162011cadillac mechanic dave nova hello and thank you for using just answer my name is xxxxx xxxxx i will do my best to help you with your cadillac problem the problem you are experiencing is a bad fuel level sensor within the tank this should have been part of the fuel pump assembly you replaced my suggestion is to go back and replace the fuel level sensor there is also a bulletin out about reprogramming the pcm for false readings from the fuel gauge i have included this bulletin below but it does not match your symptoms exactly bulletin no  080849001date february 05 2008technicalsubject inaccurate fuel gage readings fuel gage reads

reveal dtc p2066 set in the ecm cause an issue with the ecm software has been identified that will cause the ecm to increment the fuel used incorrectly if the vehicle is driven for a number of short trips with frequent key cycles between refueling events correction if routine diagnosis using si does not reveal any obvious cause then reprogram the ecm with updated calibration files using the tis2web service programming system sps application ask your own cadillac question the fuel tank in this car is horseshoe shaped and is molded arounded the drive shaft there is some kind of system to get fuel from one side to the other the fule pump we replaced is on one side of the tank i have read something about a transfer system and fuel gage for the side of the tank that does not have the pump in it i understand that the tank empty at 25 is because the transfer system from one side to the other is not working did some more research and there are some common problems with the fuel transfer system they are outlined in the bulletin below bulletin no  040604077adate november 01 2005technicalsubject no start inaccurate fuel gauge replace sender fuel feed transfer pipe and inspect

section 06  enginepropulsion system built prior to the vin breakpoints shown condition some customers may comment on an inaccurate fuel level gauge reading in a small number of cases the vehicle ran out of fuel when the gauge still indicated 18 tank cause the cause of this condition may be insufficient fuel transfer from the left fuel reservoir to the right fuel reservoir the poor fuel transfer may be the result of one or a combination of both of the following the sender fuel feed transfer pipe has two antisiphon holes in the middle of the pipe which are too large a cloggedrestricted transfer jet pump  part of the rh primary fuel tank module diagnosis important do not replace the instrument panel cluster ipc or the engine control module ecm unless diagnosis has determined them to be at fault follow published diagnostics for any stored diagnostic trouble codes dtc or use the diagnosis information for fuel gauge inaccuracy si document if the diagnosis leads you inside the fuel tank determine if the vehicle came in an asfailed condition pay particular attention to the quantity of fuel in the left and right reservoirs as the tank is lowered from the vehicle fuel remaining in the left reservoir and no fuel in the right reservoir is a good indication of poor fuel transfer if the vehicle is not in a failed condition it may be necessary to run the vehicle out of fuel to duplicate the concern correction replace the sender fuel feed transfer pipe with pn 10388380 this new pipe has one antisiphon hole also inspect the rh primary fuel tank module for a cloggedrestricted transfer jet pump use the procedure listed below1 remove the rh primary fuel tank module from the fuel tank refer to the primary fuel tank module replacement procedure in the engine controls

the fuel tank5 carefully lift the lh secondary fuel tank module from the fuel tank only enough to access the transfer pipe6 disconnect the transfer pipe from the lh secondary fuel tank module by pulling the locking mechanism down and away from the module7 remove the transfer pipe from the fuel tank8 install the new transfer pipe into the fuel tank9 connect the transfer pipe to the lh secondary fuel tank module10 install the cam lock to the fuel tank and rotate clockwise using the j 45747 until fully seated11 connect the electrical connector to the lh secondary fuel module12 on the rh primary fuel tank module inspect the jet pump by releasing the tab 1 securing the pump to the module position the jet pump with light at the rear and look through the tube the hole should be clear from debris and not black in color if the jet pump shows signs of being plugged replace the rh primary fuel tank module13 install the rh primary fuel tank module into the fuel tank refer to the
