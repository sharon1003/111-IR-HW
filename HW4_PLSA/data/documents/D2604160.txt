notes9 references10 external links history  edita game of lhombre in brøndums hotel by swedish artist anna palm de rosa circa 1885the historical importance of ombre in the field of playing cards is the fact that it was the first card game in which a trump suit was established by bidding rather than by the random process of turning the first card of the stock this game developed from triunfo though it was from lhombre that the idea of bidding was adopted into other card games such as skat and tarot which owes hombre a good portion of its betting system as well the game continued to be in vogue almost in every corner of europe from the late 17th through the 18th centuries as with most games ombre acquired many variations of increasing complexity over the years until its popularity was eclipsed by the second quarter of the 18th century by a new four player french variant called quadrille later displaced by the english whist other lines of descent and hybridization produced games like preference mediator and twentyfive under the name tresillo it survived in parts of spain during the nineteenth century as voltarete in portugal and brazil as rocambor in countries such as bolivia peru and colombia in the twentieth century and it is still played as l’hombre in denmark mostly in jutland and on the island of funen where it is organized by the lhombre union daines barrington english antiquary and naturalist says that ombre was probably introduced in england by catherine of braganza the queen of charles ii as edmund waller the court poet had a poem entitled on a card torn at ombre by the queen 5 she was such a keen player as were so many members of english high society by the end of 1674 that the lower house of parliament proposed to pass an act against the playing of ombre or at least to limit the stakes at 5 pounds a proposition received as ridiculous at that time 6 but a political pamphlet called “the royal game of ombre” published in london in 1660 supports the inference that the game was known in england before the restoration it is not likely that it would be selected as a mask for political allusions unless that the game had been in general use or at least pretty generally familiar to the people across the country etymology  editle jeu de lhombre 1695 ombre takes its name from the spanish phrase originally used by the player who declared trumps yo soy el hombre ie i am the man it appears to be merely an alteration of the game primero and it is to be presumed that it was invented prior to the publication of the dictionary of sebastián de covarrubias in 1611 although it makes no mention of it 7cotton s compleat gamester says that “there were several sorts of this game but that which the chief was called renegado at which three only could play and to whom were dealt nine cards apiece so that by discarding the eights nines and tens there would remain thirteen cards in the stock in seymour s complete gamester in 1722 where there is a frontispiece to the book in which a party of rank are represented playing at it it is described as a game so much in fashion that at its peak by the turn of the eighteenth century it inspired a unique form of furniture  a threesided card table according to jeanbaptiste bullet writer and professor of divinity at the university of besançon 8 the spaniards occasionally also called this game manilla from the name of the second matador a word in spanish signifying a slayer poetry  editthe game of ombre is belindas game in alexander pope ’s poem the rape of the lock written in 1714 n 1 the progress of the game is described in such detail that lord aldenham was able to recontruct the exact deal and play of the cards 9summary  editombre is a threehanded game in which a single player originally known as ombre or lhombre the man plays against his two opponents the game is traditionally played with a fortycard spanishsuited deck with suits of coins and cups round and swords and clubs long 10 but when it spread to northern europe frenchsuited cards with suits of diamonds and hearts red and spades and clubs black were usually substituted once the cards are dealt players bid for the right to choose what suit will be trumps the trump maker ombre undertakes to win more tricks than either of the other players and wins the pool if successful if an opponent of the ombre wins most trick the ombre pays that opponent if there is a tie for most tricks the ombre pays into the pool there are additional payments for various feats such as winning all the tricks vole ombre renegado  editby the 17th century when it caught on outside spain most people were playing a threeplayer variation called renegado first described in 1663 in madrid 11 the terms used were those in english which were anglicized versions of french versions of the original spanish words deck  edittraditionally a spanish 40card deck is used but a frenchsuited deck may be substituted in which case spades correspond to swords clubs to clubs hearts to cups and diamonds to coins the eights nines and tens can be stripped out of a standard 52card deck to make a suitable 40card deck rank of cards  editthe rank of the cards in the game depends on whether a black long or a red round suit is chosen as trumps the basic ranking of numerals is reversed in red suits being 7 low and a red suit is always one card longer than a black one of the same status whether trump or plain the black aces are permanent trumps and the top three trumps are called matadors or estuches a ♠ spadilleblack 2 or red 7 manillea ♣ bastowhen a red suit is trumps the fourth highest trump is the a ♥ or a ♦ called  punto  but it does not have the status of a matador if the trump suit is black spadille 2 basto k q j

wins and four wins if the others split threetwo the possible bids are from low to high entrada ombre announces trumps discards and draws replacements from the stock vuelta ombre turns the top card of the stock to determine trumps discards and draws solo ombre announces trumps but plays without discarding and drawing in turn each player may pass or bid and having passed cannot bid again each bid must be higher than the last however a player who has made a lower bid and not yet passed may raise his bid to equal that of the previous player unless overcalled again unless playing solo ombre may make as many discards as he likes before drawing the same number from the stock solo or not both opponents may then discard and draw for themselves as it is advantageous for one of the defenders to have the stronger hand they may agree as to which is to exchange first whoever does so may draw any number of cards up to eight rules vary considerably as to whether any untaken cards are left down or turned face up and the point should be agreed before play play  editeldest leads first and the winner of each trick leads to the next the trick is taken by the highest card of the suit led or by the highest trump if any are played normally suit must be followed if possible otherwise any card may be played matadors however can only be forced by higher matadors not by lower ones or trumps that is if the player only trumps are matadors he need not follow to a trump but may discard renege instead however if a higher matador is led and his only trump is a lower one he is obliged to play it if ombre takes the first five tricks straight off he can claim the game won without need for further play if instead he leads to the sixth he thereby obligates himself to win all nine vole thus increasing his potential winnings or penalties if ombre thinks he cannot win he may surrender at any time before playing to the fourth trick but he may not do this if playing a solo in a vuelta his surrender must be accepted by both opponents however if the game played was “entrada” either opponent may himself take over the role of ombre and play the rest of the hand as if he had made the bid himself scoring  editthere are three possible outcomes which are sacada ombre wins more tricks than any other player ombre takes the pool puesta there is a tie for most tricks ombre pays the pool as described under penalties codille one opponent wins more tricks than any other player ombre pays the winning opponent as described under penalties if the ombre wins in addition to collecting the pool

ombre loses “puesta” he doubles the pool and pays five chips for each player in the game if ombre loses “codille” he pays the same as for a “puesta” but to the player who won instead of to the pot these penalties are further increased as described above for “primeras” and if he loses the first five tricks and “estuches” he pays one per each consecutive trump if ombre fails to win all nine tricks after leading to the sixth he pays 30 to each opponent less 2 if he played “vuelta” and 10 if he played solo less also the number of “estuches” applicable rule variations  editgascarola  editif

intended to make five tricks to win the stake if the tricks are divided by four the game is then considered remise if the other player makes five he wins by codille fourhanded ombre  editin this variation first described in 1669 in zaragossa 11 usually only three players are active at a time the player opposite the dealer sits out but takes part in the payment after the play as though he were a defender if three players pass the fourth player picks up all 13 cards from the stock and discards four he chooses trump then and plays as declarer against the other three who cannot exchange any cards since the stock is already used up the contract counts as “entrada” fivehanded ombre  editin this fivehanded variation called cinquillo first described around 1683 11 the players are dealt eight cards each after staking down a fifth to the pool therefore no discard is possible bidding may be for ask leave when ombre calls a king seeking for a partner if the first four players pass the fifth may play solo ombre is obliged to win five tricks otherwise he loses he names trump and if between them five tricks can be won ombre wins sharing between them two third of the pool for ombre and one third for his partner if they both make only three tricks the game is remise and ombre is to lay down two thirds of the pool and his partner one see also  editspoil five quadrille preferans whist
