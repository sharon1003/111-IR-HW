instruments such as organs and oboes in which air is forced over a thin reed to produce sound the vocal cords tworeedlike bands are attached at one end to the wall of the larynx behind the laryngeal prominence or “adams apple” the other ends are attached to movable cartilages when the voice is not being used muscles move these cartilages outward and hold the vocal cords against thesides of the larynx so that breathing is not obstructed when a person starts to speak singgrunt or shout the ends of the vocal cords connected to the cartilages are brought across thelarynx so that they partly obstruct it as air is forced through the cords vibrate producing soundwaves which are what is known as the voice in speaking the size and shape of the mouth and pharynx are varied as the sound goes through by means of muscles of the mouth throat and tongue vowel sounds are initiated in the throatand are given their distinctive “shapes” by movements of the mouth and tongue consonants areformed by controlled interruptions of exhaled air volume pitch and timbre the voice itself has three characteristics volume pitch and timbre orquality volume depends on the effort made in forcing air through the vocal cords the pitch of the voice depends on the amount of tension placed on the vocal cords and on the length andthickness of the cords childrens and womens vocal cords are short giving them

put these sounds together to form intelligiblespeech in imitation of parents and other speakers in the environment this complicated process is sometimes disturbed if the child has congenital physical defects illness or psychologicdifficulties as a result speech disorders may occur congenital causes prominent among the congenital defects that may cause speechproblems are cleft lip and cleft palate these abnormalities are evident at birth and should be corrected by surgery at an early age another congenital defect is ankyloglossia  tonguetie abnormal shortness of the frenulum of the tongue this condition which if uncorrectedmay cause lisping and other awkwardness is easily corrected by surgical cutting of thefrenulum as soon as the difficulty becomes evident congenital deafness will prevent a childfrom learning to speak in the usual way and may result in mutism however if the speechmechanisms are normal the child can be taught to speak by a speech therapist malformations of the nasal passages larynx or other parts of the voiceproducing tract maycause oddities in the sound of the voice such defects also can be corrected in many cases by minor surgery other causes by the age of 5 or 6 years most children have mastered the basic art of talking serious difficulties that persist or appear for the first time after this age and that arenot due to congenital defects are likely to arise
