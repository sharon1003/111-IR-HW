edit 8202005 54426 pm edt by leisureshootsome companies do care alamo is no longer 100 unlimited since they were bought by national hertz is often unlimited only on corporate agreements most unlimited mileage contracts allow for travel only in certain states or regions sometimes east or west of the mississippi get the local rental office number and call the local office to be sure also check terms and conditions sometimes you will see something to that effect how do i know i manage a city for a rental agency i am pretty familiar with our competition why do you sometimes get hassled over miles and sometimes you dont most of the time it depends on the person at the counter the sales agents dont want the hassle of getting yelled at over mileage policies the managers understand the the cars are essentially leased from the big 3 automakers and dont want to rack up a lot of miles on the cars ok really its a floorplan not a lease and allowed 2200030000 miles vbefore paying mileage fees at turnin why does that matter because usually we have a minimum tiem we must keep them 6 months is typical if you put 2000 miles per week on a car we can only keep it 15 weeks or 3 months and 3 weeks or 2 months and 1 week short of the 6 month minimum also some cities are franchises as is mine and we would really prefer that our cars not travel 1000 miles away to get into an accient or breakdown and
