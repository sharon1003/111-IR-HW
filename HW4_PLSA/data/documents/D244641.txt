5 findings on spinal cord stimulator effectiveness for failed back surgery syndrome written by laura dyrda  may 29 2014  print  email physicians and researchers recently published an article in spine about the use of spinal cord stimulation in patients with failed back surgery syndrome the researchers examined market scan data to analyze patients with fbss who underwent spinal cord stimulation or spinal reoperation from 2000 to 2009 there were 16455 patients included in the study with only 395 undergoing scs implantation the researchers found1 complication rate was significantly lower at 90 days among the patients who received scs than spinal reoperation however this is hardly the first study to show such results although previous studies have demonstrated superior efficacy for the treatment of fbss scs remains underused the study authors wrote in the conclusion despite no significant decreases in overall healthcare cost with scs implantation because it is associated with decreased complications and improved outcomes this technology warrants closer consideration for the management of chronic pain in patients with fbss2 hospital stay was shorter among patients with scs implantation the neurostimulation market is one of the fastest growing in medical technology according to the qi g group the market was at less than 10 percent penetration in 2012 — reaching 2575 billion as an entire segment with 14 billion attributed to scs — but qi g group projected the total segment would reach 451 billion by 2016 scs would reach 23 billion3 associated hospital costs as well as overall cost were lower among the scs group than the reoperation group the overall cost for the lumbar reoperation group was 82586 compared with the scs group that reported a total cost of 80669 according to a cost helper health report the typical outofpocket costs for the spinal cord stimulator among uninsured patients range from 15000 to 50000 the journal of neurosurgery spine published an article estimating the cost per patient of spinal cord stimulator implantation at 32882 for medicare patients and 57896 for blue cross blue shield with annual maintenance reaching 5071 to 213904 outpatient emergency room visits and medication changes were similar among both groups of patients fbss has major consequences for patients and can be a source of chronic neuropathic pain it impacts up to 40 percent of patients who undergo lumbosacral spine surgery for back pain according to the study5 a 2011 study published in spine examined the costeffectiveness for spinal cord stimulation for failed back surgery syndrome among workers compensation patients the researchers found that among their patient population scs was not costeffective the average medical cost for scs patients during a 24 month period was 52091 compared to the patients treated at a pain clinic for 28128 on average the average total medical and productivity loss costs per patient in the scs group were around 20000 higher than those who visited the pain clinic the scs group medical and productivity loss costs per patient were around 29000 higher than patients who received usual care more

on meds to take care of it did not work incision never healed up drs had to take it out i spent 5days in the houspital now i have no pian control and the scars i had blood tested for 5weeks the type of infection is called pseudomonas and its deadly drs said i would have died left in to much longer thank about it befor you get one it did work but the risk you take of and deadly infection colleen utley • 1 year ago my pain doctor has been wanting me to do the spine simulator for quite awhile now i do not like tens unit therapy even my electric toothbrush annoys me and makes my nose itch does the sensation from the implant feel like a tens unit i would need mine placed high as i have cervical to low back problems as well i already have lots of hardware from previous surgery disasters from what i have read they are best for radiating pain which i have but it is not as much a problem as the back pain is the trial expensive does anyone know if you have to pay for the unit even if you dont want the implant after the trial i have researched the pain pumps and think it would be a better option since i take as little pain medication as possible 60 mg morphine sulfate and two percocet a day my doctor says my dose is not high enough yet to warrant a pain pump i have had all the back injections and rhizotomies for fourteen years now that do not help more then a couple of weeks im just looking for some insight from people that have actually had one has anyone gone from the scs to a pain pump if so what do you think about them in comparison i have insurance that should cover the procedure but i dont want to waste their money either thanks for any help you can givepa07950 • 1 year ago i inquired with my insurance but scs is not covered by my plan i guess its cheaper to give me a monthly opioid prescription than go ahead with the surgery
