definition image sensor i mage sensors are the nitty gritty end of the digital camera basically the digital version of film film camera’s took 35mm film in digital camera’s the ‘digital film’ is called an image sensor but there are lots of different types or sizes of image sensors and this can be important when choosing a digital camera what is an image sensor an image sensor is a device that converts an optical image to an electric signal it is used mostly in digital cameras and other imaging devices it is a set of chargecoupled devices ccd or cmos sensors such as activepixel sensors  from wikiso in other words a camera’s image sensor receives the light coming through the lens into the camera and turns that light into an image that’s a very simplified version of what actually happens and this is achieved in conjunction with the camera’s processor but it helps in understanding the part the image sensor plays in image creation why is the image sensor important image sensors come in different sizes and which size you have will affect the image quality of the photographs taken with it full frame sensors are the same size as 35mm film but they are part of very expensive professional dslr camera’sas always lets look at the simple description compact digital cameras point and shoot generally have a 125″ sensor 3 of full frame sensorentry levelmid range dslr cameras generally have an apsc sensor around 40 of full frame sensorboth of these are called cropped sensors because they are smaller than a full frame 35mm sensor so if you used the same lens on a cropped sensor camera as a full frame camera taking the same image the cropped sensor would make the image seem enlarged this doesn’t really give you a sense of the difference between the two but see if the image below helpsimage sensor sizes what’s the difference in the image above i’ve compared the sensor sizes of a full frame dslr entrymid range dslr a normal point and shoot camera and an i phone camera i’ve also given examples of cameras that use these sensors so dslr’s have much larger sensors than those in compact digital camera’s therefore they have greater image quality some point and shoots can be 12 megapixel’s the same as some dslr’s or more so how come they aren’t as good when it come to image quality this is where the size of the image sensor comes in take two 12 megapixel camera’s – one compact and one dslr the manufacturer is trying to fit the same amount of pixels on the smaller compact sensor as they are on the much larger dslr sensor and this is the important part the compact’s pixels have to be smaller to fit the 12 million pixels on the sensor pixels are lightsensitive elements on the image sensor which record the light that hits them say for instance you have a thimble and a mug if it was raining and you put them outside which one would be able to hold the most rain do you see what i mean the smaller 12 megapixel sensor in the point and shoot reduces the amount of sensitivity and light that the pixels can capture as opposed to the larger pixels in the larger 12 megapixel dslr sensor and that works out as a loss in image quality conclusion to be honest digital camera’s are moving on all the time whichever type they may be and it’s getting increasingly harder to notice the difference in image quality between images taken on different camera’s like a point and shoot and a dslr for me i have a canon 450d dslr and i love the colour and depth i get in my images and the creativity it lets me have but i hope you see now that it’s not all about who’s got the most megapixels in their camera image quality is about a lot more than that – i’ve only scrapped the surface heremandycompact digital cameras dslr image quality image sensorimage sensor sizes
