alzheimer’s disease is the most common form of dementia the frequency of alzheimers disease is increasing as the new zealand population ages it has been estimated that the number of new zealanders living with alzheimers disease will reach 70000 by 2031 from 28000 in 2006 there is no cure for alzheimers disease nor any proven ways to prevent its onset treatment focuses on support and managing symptoms to maximize a persons ability to function and maintain independence for as long as possible the condition is ultimately fatal causes in alzheimer’s disease brain cells start to deteriorate the body attempts to stop this process by producing a protein called amyloid however amyloid deposits build up in the brain leading to further deterioration these deposits of amyloid are referred to as plaques and cause the brain cells to shrivel up and form tangles which in turn lead to changes in the brain structure and cause the brain cells to die the formation of plaques and tangles also prevents the production of some important brain chemicals called neurotransmitters eg acetylcholine which is important in memory function over time the loss of brain cells causes the brain to shrink while there is no known cause for alzheimers disease some research studies have indicated that the following factors may play an important role in the development of the condition genetic factors such as the presence of or changes to certain genes environmental factors such as longterm exposure to some environmental solvents eg pesticides glues and paints or infection with certain viruses or bacteria lifestyle factors such as a lack of exercise poorquality sleep and a diet lacking fruit and vegetables researchers now believe that a combination of these lifestyle environmental and genetic risk factors trigger an abnormal biological process in the brain that over decades results in alzheimertype dementia identified risk factors for developing the condition include increasing age down syndrome history of a head injury risk factors for blood vessel disease such as smoking family history of alzheimers disease obesity high blood pressure high cholesterol insulin resistance there is some evidence of a slightly higher prevalence of alzheimers disease in females than males but this may reflect their longer life expectancy signs and symptoms the degenerative changes that occur with alzheimers disease affect the areas of the brain that control thought memory and language resulting in gradual signs and symptoms related to a person’s behaviour and mental function often physical functions such as bowel and bladder control are also affected with alzheimer’s disease there is great individual variability as to the nature of symptoms experienced and the speed at which deterioration occurs the types of behaviour change and the length of time symptoms are present are different for each person the symptoms of alzheimers disease typically develop quite slowly the time between the onset of the disease and death can range from five to 20 years symptoms commonly experienced during the early stages of alzheimers disease include mild forgetfulness – especially shortterm memory loss mood changes including irritability and anxiety difficulty processing new information and learning new things loss of spontaneity and initiative confusion about time and place communication difficulties decline in ability to perform routine tasks as alzheimer’s disease progresses the following symptoms may develop increasing shortterm memory loss and confusion difficulty recognising family and friends shorter attention span and feelings of restlessness difficulty with reading writing and numbers possibly neglectful of hygiene loss of appetite personality changes eg aggression significant mood swingsrequires increasing assistance with daily tasks towards the later stages of the disease the following symptoms may be experienced inability to understand or use speech incontinence of urine  faeces inability to recognise self or family severe disorientation increasing immobility and sleep time the changes brought about by alzheimers disease can be increasingly difficult for family members and friends as the person’s condition deteriorates and they become unable to recognise loved ones although a person loses many abilities as the disease progresses it is often helpful to focus on the abilities that do remain such as the senses of touch and hearing and the ability to respond to emotion diagnosis there is a no single test to diagnose alzheimer’s disease diagnosis involves a full assessment of medical and psychiatric history to rule out other possible causes therefore a variety of tests are required to obtain a conclusive diagnosis which may include a neurological and physical examination blood and urine tests brain scans mental status assessment to determine the level of mental deterioration caregiver interview to determine the level of dependency scans to check brain structure and function may be recommended the different types of scans used may include ct scanning computerised tomography mri magnetic resonance imaging and pet positron emission tomography treatment as there is no known cure for alzheimer’s disease treatment focuses on managing symptoms and supporting the person and their family this may include treating medical conditions that may contribute to confusion or physical decline eg lung disease or anaemia encouraging stimulating activities in order to encourage the person to continue their normal activities as much as possible providing memory aids and memory triggers such as calendars and written reminders encouraging social interaction to help prevent feelings of loneliness and depression contacting support groups that may be able to offer familycaregivers assistance encouraging regular routine to reduce confusion not smoking medications medications such as sleeping tablets and tranquillisers may help to control symptoms such as sleeplessness and agitation however they often cause increased confusion so their use should be limited a group of medications called cholinesterase inhibitors have shown some effectiveness in slowing the progression of the condition in some people these medications help prevent the breakdown of acetylcholine a neurotransmitter responsible for memory cholinesterase inhibitor medications that are available in new zealand include donepezil rivastigmine and galantamine more recently another drug  memantine  has become available in new zealand memantine works in a different way to the cholinesterase inhibitors aiming to prevent the entry of an excess amount of calcium into brain cells higher than normal levels of calcium in the brain cells causes damage to them and also prevents them from receiving signals from other brain cells research continues into the development of other medications for the treatment of alzheimers disease medications being investigated include those that prevent the buildup of amyloid deposits in the brain as well as looking at the use of some antiinflammatory and hormone medications research also continues into the use of alternative therapies such as antioxidants like vitamin e curcumin selenium and some herbal extracts ginko balboas in particular prevention  risk reduction there are no proven ways to prevent the development of alzheimers disease however there is epidemiological evidence to suggest that leading a healthy lifestyle can reduce the risk of alzheimers disease regular physical activity and exercise may have a general protective effect on brain health and may slow progression of alzheimers disease although there are no specific dietary specifications for alzheimers a mediterraneanstyle diet ie plant foods such as vegetables fruits beans whole grains nuts olives and olive oil along with some cheeses yoghurt fish poultry and eggs may reduce the risk of alzheimers disease and has the added benefit of lowering cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes risk for more diet information refer to our healthy heart diet further support alzheimers new zealand national
