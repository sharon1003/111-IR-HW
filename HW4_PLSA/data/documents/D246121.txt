different organizations require different structures this lesson describes the differences between mechanistic and organic organizational structures by looking at the specifics of organizations organizational structure the organizational structure refers to the type of framework a company uses to distinguish power and authority roles and responsibilities and the manner in which information flows through the organization an organization must choose a structure that is appropriate for its individual needs and allows for the company to react and adapt to uncertainties and changes in the internal and external environments having a suitable organizational structure will allow a company to implement proper operating procedures and decisionmaking processes that will aid the organization in accomplishing its goals tom burns and g m stalker identified two basic forms of organizational structure mechanistic and organic structures this lesson describes the differences between the two types of organizational structures mechanistic structure a mechanistic structure also known as a bureaucratic structure describes an organizational structure that is based on a formal centralized network the mechanistic structure is best suited for companies that operate in a stable and certain environment in general a mechanistic structure is easy to maintain and rarely needs to be changed when an organization operates in a stable environment in mechanistic organizations authority reflects a welldefined hierarchy where toplevel managers make the majority of the decisions because the environment is relatively stable complex decisionmaking processes that involve multiple parties are not required subordinates are expected to follow the directions of management and not question their rationale communication much like decisions also flows through hierarchical routes or from the top down individualized job specialization is used to place employees into designated tasks in mechanistic organizations it is typical for each person to be assigned one task that is relatively stable and easy to control as a result of the stability of tasks there tends to be low integration between functional areas or departments in organizations that use a mechanistic structure likewise this creates a situation where for the most part functional areas are not dependent on each other think of a mechanistic structure as a welloiled machine that once functioning properly continues to work efficiently with little need for maintenance simply envision an organization where management makes most of the decisions information is communicated based on chain of command tasks are highly specialized departments stand alone and operate as their own entity and change is for the most part uncommon examples of mechanistic structures include healthcare universities and governmental organizations organic structure organic structures are used in organizations that face unstable and dynamic environments and need to quickly adapt to change when an environment changes an organization must be able to gather process and disseminate information very quickly failure to do so can directly affect an organizations ability to maintain its competitive advantage communication is lateral and rapid in these complex environments to achieve this organizations that use an organic structure will integrate functional areas and departments together so that information can flow seamlessly between them this fast distribution of knowledge results in an increased ability to respond to changes in the internal and external environments needs can change quickly in an organic organization making it necessary to continually redefine tasks that allow each person to be responsible for multiple tasks at a time organic organizations also practice joint specialization whereby employees work together and coordinate tasks of a larger project often in the form of teams having a broad understanding of how multiple tasks work together allows each individual to respond quickly to change to unlock this lesson you must be a studycom member create your account register for a free trial are you a student or a teacher i am a student i am a teacher
