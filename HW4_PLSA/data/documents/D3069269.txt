drinking drugs  smoking what parents need to know parents need to know that although most of the content in this bythebook romantic comedy is ageappropriate for older tweens and young teens theres little swearing and drinking and no nudity or violence its swimming in consumerism and highend product placement and reinforces some broad stereotypes about women despite being chastened in the end the main character seems downright na√Øve  and a tad unapologetic  about her shoptilyourebankrupt ways kids may enjoy the fantasy but parents may find that the frothy escapism feels out of place in these unsettled economic times continue reading user reviews parents say kids say parent of a 9 and 10 year old written by marilyn mansons mom august 1 2009age 10why is sex just an accepted thing

all sex and the city style aspiration but the guilt is soon heaped on in piles what then is the point of dwelling on the buying binges had the movie amped up the fantasy part and toned down the fingerwagging it wouldve been firstclass escapism as it stands its a lot like having your credit card denied at the checkout  oh what a buzz killfisher tries hard to make a go of the enterprise but
