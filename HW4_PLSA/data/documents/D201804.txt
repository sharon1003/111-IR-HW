automakers would just love it if we went out and bought a new car every few years but not all of us are hitting the showrooms with that frequency mike in maine for example wants to know how long his car will keep going i’m driving a 1993 toyota camry with over 235000 miles i have spent about 2000 in maintenance on the car since 1996 when i bought it with 64k on the odometer the car runs fine and drives fine what’s the useful life of a car these days no one can tell me the average life i should expect from this engine or transmission mike t portland maine you should be driving down the road with a big smile on your face because you certainly got your money’s worth from that camry consumer reports  wwwconsumerreportsorg says the average life expectancy of a new vehicle these days is around 8 years or 150000 miles of course some wellbuilt vehicles can go 15 years and 300000 if properly maintained there’s no way to tell how much longer your car will stay troublefree but somewhere down the road even with the best maintenance a major part is going to fail “when a vehicle exceeds 200000 miles you are riding on borrowed time and the car is paying you back” says john ibbotson at the consumer reports auto test center in its april issue consumer reports released the results of its annual car reliability survey “asian vehicles are by far the most reliable” the editors say japanese and korean vehicles had on average 12 problems per 100 vehicles u s makers “have been edging closer to the asians in reliability” the magazines reports with an average of 18 problems per 100 vehicles european manufacturers are still “the most unreliable overall” with 21 problems per 100 vehicles by the way even if you don’t have any mechanical problems any time soon you might consider getting a new car if you can afford it for another reason a new or even slightlyused vehicle would have a number of important safety features that are not on your 1993 camry i have several accounts with washington mutual the bank tells me that i must limit the number of online transfers in a statement cycle if i go over the limit they will charge me 5 and i could have my account shut down the bank tells me i can make unlimited transfers if i go to any branch or use any of their atms i don’t understand the difference gregory s renton wai checked with washington mutual and the bank does have monthly limits – as required by federal regulation – for certain types of transfers or withdrawals for savings and money market deposit accounts the federal reserve board’s regulation d states that a bank cannot allow more than six of what it calls “convenient transfers” per month from a savings or money market account the regulation defines convenient transfers as “preauthorized automatic or telephone transfers including transfers initiated by home computer or over the internet” to another person or to another account you have at the same institution transactions that are less convenient – made in person at the bank by mail or by using an atm – do not count toward the sixpermonth limit if a bank permits more than six convenient transfers per month a “savings account” which is not subject to reserve requirements must be called a “transaction account” which is subject to reserve requirements so the bank must treat it differently under regulation d banks have two ways to enforce the transfer limits they can set up the account so that it is impossible to make more than those six transfers or they can monitor the account and contact customers who go over the limit on more than an occasional basis banks are allowed – but not required  to charge customers a fee if they go over the sixpermonth limit to encourage them to reduce their transactions regulation d also states that if a customer continues to violate the transfer limits after being contacted by the bank “the depository institution must either close the account and place the funds in another account that the depositor is eligible to maintain or take away the transfer and draft capacities of the account isnt it true that even after you “disconnect” your landline that 911 service will still operate in my mind it is possible to disconnect the landline and keep your landline phone in case of a 911 emergency greg d a number of people asked me that question after reading last week’s article “should i ditch my landbased phone” in some parts of the country if you disconnect your phone service you will still get a dial tone according to bob oenning vice president of the national association of state 911 administrators this “soft dial tone” will let you dial 911“but because your phone service has been disconnected” oenning explains “the dispatch center won’t automatically get your address” in some cases such as when your old phone number is reassigned the emergency operator may even get an incorrect address in a situation where you can’t speak or pass out oenning says “that could mean the difference between life and death” he also points out that if you make a 911 call using a “soft dial tone” then get disconnected the dispatch center won’t be able to call you back i bought some items online for a bit over 300 i paid with a cashier’s check the check was cashed right away but i haven’t gotten my order yet it’s been about 30 days my repeated emails to the merchant have gone unanswered do i have any recourse dave j germantown mdthank goodness you didn’t order something more expensive a cashier’s check is not a safe way to buy things online overthephone or through the mail it’s like sending an envelope filled with money let’s hope your merchandise is on its way remember federal rules say a merchant has at least 30 days to ship the order longer if that is stated upfront so there’s no need to panic quite yet read the federal mail order rule wwwftcgovbcpconlinepubsbuyingmailhtm here’s what you should do write the company a letter ask what’s up with your order and state that if you don’t have the goods or hear back within two weeks you are going to file complaints with the better business bureau  wwwbbborg  the federal trade commission which enforces the mail order rule  wwwftcgov and your state attorney general send your letter certified be sure to keep a copy if you don’t hear back or nothing arrives make those complaints i hope this story has a happy ending but it might not if you’re dealing with a con artist or disreputable company you may never see your goods or get your money back that’s why i always use a credit card for making online purchases a credit card has builtin fraud protection if you had charged this purchase you could contact your bank and challenge the charge some people are leery about using a credit card to buy things online they worry what might happen if their card number gets into the wrong hands the fact is using your credit card is probably the safest way to shop on the web if you charge it you’re protected by the fair credit billing act which limits your responsibility for unauthorized charges to 50 if you report the loss quickly you normally would not be responsible for anything you can read more about the fair
