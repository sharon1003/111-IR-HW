new york ny  flag if inappropriate there is a lot of confusion surrounding antipasto or antipasti plural traditional antipasto does not contain pasta since antipasto translates to before the meal not to be confused with appetizers it literally means that the serving of antipasto is officially the beginning of the meal and you do not leave the table until after the main course since the main course was pasta based it was never added to the beginning or antipasto this is an important fact to a non sicilian woman who may want to make a great impression on her very sicilian in laws this recipe is very authentic of the traditional sicilian table i especially appreciated the addition of pickling the onions which removes some of their rawness and heat giardinariera is another traditional element of antipasto since its a common staple in sicilian pantriescharg2005 from elmira ny  flag if inappropriate there are as many variations on this salad as there are italian families my newly wed italian

rich smokey barbecued ribs and sweetspicy baked beans there were no leftovers jwalker5 from so cal  flag if inappropriate it seems to me that a cook from california should have just made her own version of antipasto and given herhimself 4 forks rather than almost completely rewriting this recipe it was very good and my family enjoyed it tremendously a cook from pittsburgh pa  flag if inappropriate very tasty for a potluckpicnic if youre not careful it might turn out to be too sour for you here are some suggestions use rice vinegar add a bit less salt and a bit more sugar add a bit more garlic taste before adding olive oil use a light olive oil too many flavors already the dressing isnt very special add some lemon peel and fresh herbs eg basil and let the flavors blend before mixing into the salad for the salad add thin strips of pepperoni and provolone kalamata olives work well dont try drycured dont toss at the last minute  let the salad marinate in the dressing toss again before serving a cook from california  flag if inappropriate i love this antipasto salad and so does everyone i serve it to be sure to use the fresh garlic and dont skip on the red onions you can add different types cheese and meats i put marinated mushrooms and everyone loves that i would highly recommend this salad everyone will want the recipe a cook from methuen ma  flag if
