build an analog tv station44 commentsby zach banks september 2 2009with the transition to digital tv the fcc has abandoned the old analog format luckily you can take advantage of this and set up your own analog tv station the fcc has a tool on their site to see what channels are open in your area to broadcast in to broadcast you need a tv transmitter but cheap shortrange models can be found on e bay or made at hom e pdf once you have a transmitter you can pump in a video source either your own content or videos from youtube one group omgimontv is showcasing popular youtube clips on channel 14 in new york on their site users can vote for what clips they want to see although this isn’t as simple as making a radio station it still has a lot of potential via boing boingposted in video hacks

pmisn’t this illegal report comment reply bgjmv says january 13 2013 at 241 amlegal report comment replyjohn says april 15 2015 at 917 amno refujee is right its illegal without a licence report comment reply st jimmy says september 2 2009 at 628 pm omg furstanyway cool as this is as soon as the fcc auctions off the frequencies this probably will become very illegal still i believe that this counts as “wicked dope” report comment reply st jimmy says september 2 2009 at 628 pm drat beatenreport comment reply pilotgeek says september 2 2009 at 631 pmrefujee i don’t believe it’s illegal as long as it’s within the fcc’s allocated “free” channels similar to cbradio type frequencies of course i could be completely wrong that’s just a guess report comment replynapalm says september 2 2009 at 636 pmst jimmy lol failanyway i wondered what would happen to the analog tv range probably similar to what happened with the first hamradio broadcasters no matter ho illegal or not this is its made of epic win all the way report comment reply chris says september 2 2009 at 650 pm unfortunately the part 15 regulations of the fcc don’t allow for any transmissions on broadcast television frequencies it is illegal so don’t do itthere is a legal option though go get your technician class amateur radio license and then experiment with fastscan television in the amateur radio frequencies most people use a television hooked up to a regular antenna tuned to “cable” channel 59 or 60 to receive these amateur “television” signalsreport comment replymatt says september 2 2009 at 709 pm since they’re abandoned i’d assume they aren’t “broadcast frequencies”report comment reply spadefinger says september 2 2009 at 749 pmwell thank you captain fucking obviousthis post has a big duh factor…who cares if it’s illegal or notit’s pretty obvious you could do this with some minor effortthe pdf sucks btwgive me a writeup on the technical details of building a transmitter from the ground up and i might be slightly impressed probably not but maybethere are far more interesting things going on with this spectrum let’s see a hack utilizing it for cheap broadband or something else slightly more useful or even entertaining preferably without twitter report comment replyxrazorwirex says september 2 2009 at 935 pm yeah the fcc loves it when people compete with the major companies that dominate the media now so all you have to do isapply for the spectrum and pay 1000000 minimum nonrefundable application if you get approved then you have to operate the station for one year on a probation phase without generating any revenue from the station to ‘prove yourself’comply with the 587000 pages of regulations which a violation of a single one will result in several millions of dollars in fines and a ‘demotion’ back to the probation phase it’s easy and funreport comment replygoogfan says september 2 2009 at 941 pmi heard google was going to buy some channels something about broadcast internet report comment replyerror404 says september 2 2009 at 1009 pmhttpenwikipediaorgwikiwhitespaces28radio29this is apparently legal as long as they’re not interfering with licensed users report comment reply leigh says september 2 2009 at 1042 pm no white spaces devices will be required to monitor for interference and have other stringent requirements this is not “apparently legal”report comment replyxrazorwirex says september 2 2009 at 1048 pm pirate radio evolves to pirate tv – i would love to see someone with the cajones that goes ahead and does this anyways report comment replydano says september 2 2009 at 1116 pm so according to the wikipedia article from above httpenwikipediaorgwikiwhitespaces28radio29 the fcc is allowing whitespace utilization locally but you have to actively monitor to make sure there are no legacy transmissions on the same frequency every minute so with some interesting coding and whitespace frequency monitors you might be able to get away with a low powered signal you’d want to research to make sure that wikipedia was right on this but still it’s doable the easy way is to get a ham radio license and just do it legally without the monitors required if you are interested in developing things like live monitoring of the band you can test and learn with that easily on the ham bands too report comment replyjd says september 3 2009 at 1236 am why bother going analog how about hooking up an amp to something like this httpwwwzeeveecomconnectedhomezvbox150report comment replya says september 3 2009 at 204 amtwo words gnu radio report comment reply mc noob says september 3 2009 at 332 amthese broadcast bands have not been “abandoned ” they just switched the modulation format tv is still uhf and vhf 780something 26 is to be repurposed as some other kind of portable something or other but certainly not abandoned it will be used report comment replysss says september 3 2009 at 403 am i’m pretty sure this is illegal unless it’s a whitespace approved electronic wireless microphones have used tv bands for years sorta licensed sorta not licensed new whitespace electronics need to be able to detect wireless microphones in the area and disable themselves if they find them there are regulations for how often they have to rescan for new systems being powered up 30 seconds or a minute i think and before the white space device broadcasts it has to make sure it won’t interfere with any wireless microphones also white space electronic devices must limit themselves to select frequencies which wireless mics still have the right of way to other newly “freed” frequencies are being preserved for wireless mic usage only report comment reply brad says september 3 2009 at 626 am is it just me or did anyone else spot the hilarious link to this post  httpgadgetsboingboingnet20090902howtosetupananalhtml report comment replykabukicho2001 says september 3 2009 at 841 am it’s legal if your power is less than 1m w erp by the way i’m buying a analog uhf tv channel license for  1000000 if every dude can pay 1 dollar we can get to 1000000 of people report comment reply haku says september 3 2009 at 205 pm i’ve got a couple of small black metal boxes from the 80s called “video senders” which can transmit a normal uhv tv signal over a short distance up to 300 feet line of sight if you look on e bay you may be able to pick one up – if you can find one in amongst all the current generation 24ghz tv extenders these small uhv tv transmitters will be useful when the tv stations go digital only because you can use them to send a signal to the “useless” pocket tvs which only have an antenna and no av input report comment reply hirudinea says september 3 2009 at 657 pm yea hauku i use video senders to watch tv when i have to take a dump video spliter from the box and to the sender hook up an atsc converter and you’ve got hdtv sort of on your old analogue sets so don’t toss out your old tubes yet report comment reply electrician says september 7 2009 at 1110 am pirate tv is easy you don’t have to build a tvtransmitter just use your vcr hook an antenna to the rfout and voilà your very own pirate tvstation we did this n school works great the broadcast range is of course not great but you could always hook up an signal amplifier to reach more people report comment replykurye says september 13 2009 at 722 pmemege saygi tesekkürler report comment replyconundrum says september 15 2009 at 1010 am now here would be an application for a wifi to uhf converter to save all those otherwise useless tvs from the landfill shouldn’t be too hard you can get wifi usb dongles and usb pics aren’t expensive just fake the appropriate responses to get the dongle to initialise and fit it inside the existing tv’s casing last time i checked wifi is more than capable of handling a single analogue channel’s worth of data and causes far less interference than those 24g “senders” report comment reply who ever says october 21 2009 at 1028 am i will like to make a test one to learn how broadcasting works i was looking for a instruction on how to do and and this one helped me i will get a 25 uhf sender and a tv attena to do it i use cable tv in my home and will not discard it because there is hardly any tv channels in air in my area i will just unplug the cable from the tv for cable tv in the basement try the station and then turn it off and put back the cable tv cable report comment replyhank says november 22 2009 at 320 pmhello what is the fcc site to check on free open analog channels the link was not mentioned in article report comment replyhank says november 22 2009 at 321 pmhello also has any one looked in to using the cable system fore low power broadcasting not sure how this could be done but am curious if any one has considdered this metnod as well report comment reply mike dice says march 18 2010 at 130 pmactually your blog is one of those i will bother to revisit most i saw today are full of useless informations and advertising thank you for providing some real content to the world report comment reply farhan gondal says june 10 2010 at 824 am i want to know how to build a tvfm transmiter at home and what are the expences on it report comment reply acikogretimci says july 13 2010 at 642 amits very enteresting report comment reply maximus says january 19 2011 at 1059 am wonder how much is it gonna cost to get an entire area covered i work at a church and is looking into covering a very large area would be cheaper then to rent a channel than building you own one am aware that if i were to cover a large area you will have to pay a licence for the frequincy report comment reply farhan gondal says may 27 2011 at 240 am“wonder how much is it gonna cost to get an entire area covered i work at a church and is looking into covering a very large area would be cheaper then to rent a channel than building you own one am aware that if i were to cover a large area you will have to pay a licence for the frequincy”well i need the design no matter itx legal or illegal report comment reply djmatt says june 17 2011 at 445 amits illeal weather you like it or not when analogue tv if its not already shut down in your area runs on the same frequency bands as the digital stations the only difference is for each frequency multiple channels can be broadcast on each channel frequency thus alowing a lot more channels to be broadcast on the same frequency allocations say here in southern tasmaniaaustralia analoge channel 6 is trasmitted with 3 other channels in digital on the same frequency band as analoge channel 8 if you use a scanner on this frequeny you dont hear anything but a digital tuner will so if you transmit on these frequencies it can interfere with the digital tv service anyway even if that wasn’t the case over a certain wattage you require a licence on non public frequencies say if you wanted to transmit on 11483375mhz at say 10w you require a permit for that frequeny and have to pay and resubmit the application every so many years like australia its usually 2 years a a time but personally i dont care if i could find a decent transmitter i would run my own tv station and play all the latest movies and even porn at night i have no respect for the law when it comes to this sort of thing  would love a 5w transmitter schematic to build and have a community tv station and once analoge is turned uff here no one would know other than someone with a spectrom analizer unless you told them to scan there tv on analoge chances of them finding it is slim if you keep it to a small subburb and dont transmit into the main sity area you could get away with it for a long time report comment reply poed says september 25 2011 at 234 pm if the government assholes have anything to do with it they will find a way to screw you copyright fcc license my ass report comment reply stephen says january 30 2012 at 1112 am since 1994 the fcc has been auctioning licenses for the electromagnetic spectrum airwaves this could and does includes parts of the spectrum allocated for amateur radio ham frequencies previously used by amateur radio have been sold for commercial purposes tele cos cellular phones are big users of the radio spectrum formerly designated for amateur radio sadly unlicensed use of airwaves won’t send a message to the feds that citizens believe that preserving sections of the airways “free from commercial use” is important for the people however licensed users have a voice – the amateur radio relay league arrl httpwwwarrlorgregulatoryadvocacy small potato pirates – not so much report comment reply wudrn soul says march 9 2012 at 1035 pm to stephen while the old dogs still have it they are not the future the small potato pirates are i agree flooding comercial streams with interference before doing your research is not a good idea do not howeverfool yourself into thinking your “licensed user” is the big fish in the pond to everyone else be safe be free and dont let fuddy duddy ole farts silence you  experimentreport comment reply slim shady says april 12 2013 at 544 pm i don’t think anyone’s gonna care if you transmit for a few hours then go silent i do this on my pirate radio station never got caught yet going on three yearsreport comment replyjqgeneralpublic says may 1 2013 at 214 am i heard just recently that one of the main reasons that tv converted to digital from analog was because our government has technology that allows digital tv receivers to be used as…for lack of a better analogy…spy cameras what that means is that analog didn’t give the proper signal ability to turn your screen into something that they could use to look “in” at you from your viewing tv device digital allows such a reversal without your knowledge of such things are going to change very drastically in the next 5 years–if not sooner–and those of us that have the ability to transmit independently in amfmshortwavetv are going to be the ones that convey information to those that need the help keep hacking keep transmitting secretly and in covert ways keep doing what you do to keep freedom a realityj report comment reply bothersaid fcc says february 21 2016 at 727 pm apparently the latest idea someone namely me came up with is transmitting tv signals using nir light the restrictions are a lot simpler and because it is line of sight a single 1m w vcsel can reach hundreds of people with a custom designed passive beam splitter also as long as this is done carefully the receiver can be integrated into existing replacement lnbs and also be used for seti astronomical observations etc all that is needed is a simple apdpmt setup which can now be had for under £20 and lasts about 10 years its also possible to “transmit” from the lunar surface using an 11 ghz setup and someone also suggested this as a way to encourage “moonshot” thinking as recycling the old apollo era nuclear rtgs would provide a regenerative power source report comment reply vash says april 25 2017 at 851 pm the rules used to sate that it must be 100mw now its 200 ft distance you may read the low power unlicensed rules on the fccs website httpswwwfccgovmediaradiolowpowerradiogeneralinformation report comment reply vash says april 25 2017 at 852 pm building a transmitter is not required all you need is a channel modulator you can get them surplus from cable tv head ends that are converting to digital report comment reply leave a reply enter your comment here fill in your details below or click an
