training for the deep muscles of the core connecting to the deep muscles of your core without having had a proper assessment can be very difficult and frustrating so for those of you visiting this site that havent had a session with one of our staff we suggest you do so first transversus abdominis multifidus pelvic floor transversus abdominis location function  dysfunction transversus abdominis is the deepest of the abdominal muscles and wraps around the abdomen between the lower ribs and top of the pelvis functioning like a corset this picture shows the anatomy of this muscle with the outer two abdominal layers internal and external oblique removed when transversus abdominis contracts the waist narrows slightly and the lower abdomen flattens the function of the transversus abdominis is to stabilize the low back and pelvis before movement of the arms andor legs occurs this function is critical if wear and tear of the joints in your low backpelvis degeneration is to be prevented when healthy this muscle anticipates motion and therefore we can use intention or imagery to retrain its function this is a vital part of core training since you cannot strengthen a muscle that your nervous systembrain isnt using training comes before strengthening mid or low back pain abdominal injurysurgery andor excessive lengthening due to pregnancy can cause a delay or absence in the anticipatory contraction of transversus abdominis if this muscle contraction delayabsence is not corrected this dysfunction will remain even after your pain has subsided rehabilitation principles  train before you strengthen restoring the recruitment patterns order in which different muscles contract of the core is different than most exercise you will have been used to in the past the first step is to learn to isolate the muscle to train it to contract research has clearly shown that the better you are at isolating this muscle the faster it will integrate into functional tasks the second step is to strengthen or teach it to cocontract with the other muscles of the core the deep multifidus and the pelvic floor as you breathe the final step is to cocontract the entire core connect to the entire core and use this connection in functional activities recruitment training for transversus abdominis tr ayou cannot strengthen a muscle your brain cannot activate these exercises help you ‘find the muscle’ and activate it properly lie on your back or side with your spine in a neutral posture gentle curve in your low back try the following connect cues to produce a deep isolated contraction of tr a imagine a line that connects the inside of your two pelvic bones front of hips think about connecting or drawing the muscle along this line as if closing two book covers contract your pelvic floor by drawing the muscles from behind your pubic bone to your tail bone and the left and right sides of your pelvic floor together and then like a draw string bag gently draw the entire pelvic floor up in sidelying  gently lift your lower belly up away from your pubic bone breathe in and on the breath out contract the transversus abdominis with the best connect cue have your therapist help you determine which is your best connect cue no movement of your hips pelvis or spine should occur as you gently connect to tr a if you palpate your belly just inside the left and right hip bones this deep contraction should feel like a light deep tension under your fingertips not a contraction that pushes your fingers out hold the contraction for 3  5 seconds and then release and breathe throughout this exercise repeat the contraction and hold for 3 sets of 10 repetitions 3  4 times per day for 4 weeks it is not uncommon for other muscles to cocontract in an attempt to compensate for a dysfunctional core it is critical that you take the time to focus on your technique and achieve a correct contraction before moving on to any loading through the arms or legs watch for the following substitution strategies posterior tilting of the pelvis bulging of the abdomen depression of the rib cage breath holding fingertips being pressed out by a strong muscular contraction internal obliquestrength training for transversus abdominis once you can activate tr a practice recruiting it in many different positions such as sitting standing squatting lifting etc once you can easily recruit tr a you can progress to the following exercises each progression begins with a proper coactivation of all muscles of the deep system tr a multifidus and your pelvic floor and this cocontraction should be held throughout the movement remember to move with your breath  exert with exhalation breathe in to rest or hold lying on your back with your knees and hips flexed slowly let your right knee move to the right keep your low back and pelvis level return to the center and repeat with the left lift the right foot off the floor keeping the knee bent don’t hold your breath and don’t bulge your lower abdomen return the foot to the floor and repeat with the left foot lift the right foot off the floor and then straighten the leg only as far as you can control your core with a proper strategy slowly bend the knee and return the foot to the floor repeat with the left leg lift the right foot off the floor and then the left foot off the floor alternate leg extensions exert with exhalation breathe in to rest or hold in side lying maintaining your connection to tr a keep your ankles together and lift your top knee only as high as you can control without breath holding focus on turning your inner thigh outwards return your knee maintaining your connection to tr a keep your ankles together lift your top knee and then lift your ankle return your ankle and then your knee with all these exercises maintain the leg lift for 10 seconds build to 3 sets of 10 repetitions before moving on incorporate tr a activation into other activities the final step is to remember to use this muscle tr a during regular activities each time you get out of the chair lift bend or reach the deep muscle system should be working with and for you the goal is to help the brain remember to use the deep system d mf tr a and your pelvic floor and the more you use it the less you will be likely to lose it download in pdf format topmultifidus location function  dysfunction multifidus is a deep muscle located along the back of the spine very close to the midline the deep fibers are short and span single vertebral segments this muscle functions together with transversus abdominis  pelvic floor muscles to stabilize the low back and pelvis before movement of the arms andor legs occurs intention or imagery is also used to retrain its function low back pain causes a delay or absence in the anticipatory contraction of multifidus if this muscle contraction delayabsence is not corrected this dysfunction will remain even after an individuals pain has subsided increasing the incidence of reinjury this is a vital part of core training since you cannot strengthen muscle that your nervous system isnt using like transversus abdominis training comes before strengthening recruitment training for the deep fibers of lumbosacral multifidus d mfyou cannot strengthen a muscle your brain cannot activate these exercises help you ‘find the muscle’ and activate it properly lie on your back or side with your spine in a neutral posture gentle curve in your low back try the following connect cues to produce a deep contraction of multifidus isolated from the long back extensors for the part of multifidus that supports the sij  imagine a line that connects your left and right sij and think about connecting or drawing together along this line imagine a line connecting your groin or back of your pubic bone to the part of multifidus in your low back you are trying to train wake up connect along this line and then gently think about suspending lifting the lumbar vertebra 1 mm above the one below breathe in and on the breath out contract the deep multifidus with the best connect cue have your therapist help you determine which is your best connect cue no movement of your hips pelvis or spine should occur as you gently activate the d mf if you compare how heavy your leg is to lift with and without this d mf contraction you should find that it is lighter with the proper contraction hold the contraction for 3 5 seconds and then release and breathe throughout this exercise repeat the contraction and hold for 3 sets of 10 repetitions 3 – 4 times per day for 4 weeks it is not uncommon for other muscles to cocontract in an attempt to compensate for a dysfunctional core it is critical that you take the time to focus on your technique and achieve a correct multifidus contraction before moving on to any loading through the arms or legs watch for the following substitution strategies anterior tilting or rotation of the pelvis flexion of the hip joint gripping with the big buttock muscles strength training for lumbosacral multifidus once you can activate the d mf practice recruiting it in many different positions such as sitting standing squatting lifting etc once you can easily recruit d mf you can progress to the following exercises each progression begins with a proper co activation of all muscles of the deep system deep abdominals multifidus and your

format toppelvic floor muscles pelvic floor location function  dysfunction the pelvic floor pfm is a hammock of muscles that connect the pubis bone at the front to the tailbone coccyx and sitz bones ischial tuberosities at the back the pelvic floor supports the bladder as well as the reproductive organs and connects the inferior aspect of the innominates hip bones and the sacrum the urethra vagina and rectum pass through these muscles and are affected by their function the tension in these muscles must be balanced in the front beneath the pubis and the back at the sacrum they must also work in cooperation with the multifidus a deep back muscle and transversus abdominis for your lumbar spine sacroiliac joints bladder and uterus to be stabilized properly changes in recruitment of the pfms can occur as a result of pain poor movement patterns trauma surgery or childbirth this altered recruitment often results in over activation of some muscles and under activation of others  the patterns are highly variable your pelvic floor therapist will assess and determine which muscles need more activation and which ones need less this imbalance will not spontaneously recover as pain in the region subsides and can lead to low back pelvis andor hip pain or urinary incontinence recruitment training for the pelvic floor pfmunfortunately 65 of people that think that they know how to contract their pfm’s are doing it incorrectly the first step is to learn to produce a proper contraction of these muscles lie on your back or side or sit with the spine in a neutral posture firmly palpate your abdomen 12 inches inside of your hip bones try the following cues to connect to contract your pelvic floor females  think of your vagina as a clock pubis is 12 tailbone is 6 left lateral wall is 3 right lateral wall is 9 visualize drawing the 12 to the 6 the 6 to the 12 and finally gather the 3 and 9 toward the middle of the clock and gently lift females  nod your clitoris down toward the vaginal opening curl your tailbone toward your clitoris now gently imagine sucking a jellybean up off of the floor toward your head females  visualize ‘squeezing’close off the urethra as if to stop urine flow hold this while you ‘squeeze’close the anus as if to stop flatulence and gently lift males  visualize gently drawing your testicles up and forward into your abdomen aka ‘bring the boys home’ males or females  think about a guy wire or line from the anus up to the back of your pubic bone and connect along this line maintain your lateral costal breath throughout this exercise when contracting your pfm you should feel a deep tension in your abdomen under your fingers you should not feel your buttocks tighten legs rotate out or movement of your spine or pelvis if you feel bulging of the abdomen butt gripping or spinal movement then you are not properly contracting just your pelvic floor muscles a correct contraction should result in a very gentle tension deep in the abdomen often very hard to feel initially when you isolate your pelvic floor muscles you should feel a deep tension in your abdomen under your fingers you should not feel your buttocks tighten legs rotate out or movement of your spine or pelvis if you feel a muscle pushing your fingers out of your abdomen butt gripping or spinal movement then you are not being successful in connecting to your pelvic floor muscles or you are overcontracting for this part of the program a correct contraction should result in a very gentle tension deep in the abdomen often very hard to feel initially ultrasound imaging if you are having trouble connecting to your pelvic floor muscles consider the following options ultrasound imaging will allow you to watch the impact the pelvic floor muscles have on the bladder as you attempt to produce an isolated contraction the absolute best view is a perineal view translabial but not intravaginal this will allow you and your therapist to explore various strategies and find one that works for you using the ultrasound to show you what you are doing when you contract biofeedback will solidify your understanding of a proper contraction it may help you shortcut any frustration you are feeling to get that connection happening your bladder needs to be moderately full 1 cup  500 ml during the assessment so dont pee before your appointment the educator in addition to rehabilitative ultrasound imaging the educator can be used at home retraining the core muscles takes mental focus and practice if you are interested in having greater knowledge of performance ie did i do it right or did i do it wrong when you are practicing at home then you should ask your therapist about the educator which is a useful tool to use to assist the retraining the anterior pelvic floor coordinating a pf contraction with transversus abdominis and the deep fibers of multifidus the next step is to learn to cocontract the pfm’s in conjunction with transversus abdominis and the deep lumbosacral multifidus these will be added as progressions once you can successfully maintain an isolated pfm contraction as you practice connecting to your pelvic floor muscles combine your cues to ensure that tr a and d mf are cocontracting your physiotherapist will confirm both your cues and your performance of this task endurancestrength training with a focus on the pelvic floor hold em’s breathe in widen your lower rib cage then breathe out using your pf cue engage and hold the contraction for 35 seconds while breathing normally repeat 10x perform these in supine hands and knees sitting and standing speed em’s breathe in widen your lower rib cage then breathe out using your pf cue perform a quick contractionlift then immediately let go and relax repeat 10x work towards 152030 reps perform these in supine hands and knees sitting and standing hold em’s with functional movement heel slides – lie on your back with your hips and knees bent perform a ‘hold em’ then slowly slide one leg straight while maintaining your pf contraction and breath slide the leg back to its original position repeat with the opposite leg repeat 5xside wipers  in the same position as above perform a ‘hold em’ keep your low back and pelvis level and slowly move one bent knee out to the side maintain your pf contraction and exhale to bring your leg back to neutral repeat this with the opposite leg repeat 5xside leg lifts – in the same position as above perform a ‘hold em’ slowly bring one knee toward your chest maintain your pf contraction and on the exhale return the leg to the floor and repeat this with your opposite leg repeat 5xside the final step is to be able to cocontract all of the deep muscles during functional activities which include nose blowing coughing sneezing walking jumping and lifting retraining the deep muscle system requires repetitive use and the more you use it the less you will be likely to lose it download in pdf format return to list
