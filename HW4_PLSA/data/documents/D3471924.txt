server is running my processor use tends to go to around 5565 and my cpu temperature hovers around 70 c im using a dell inspiron 17r se it has 8 gb of ram an intel 3630 qm processor 24 ghz intel turbo boost goes up to 34 ghz and an nvidia geforce 650m graphics card is that a safe temperature for it to be running at for long periods of time or even 247 or will that start to damage the computer

but answers to this question will tend to be almost entirely based on opinions rather than facts references or specific expertise if this question can be reworded to fit the rules in the help center please edit the question the safe long term temperature is any temperature within the specifications of the product – ramhound may 3 14 at 050so no damage can occur as long as its below the maximum temperature listed the specs listed for it say thats 105 c im just concerned because ive seen wildly conflicting answers online some people have said anything above 60 c is going to start taking time off the machines lifespan but ive also seen people saying laptops are better at handling heat and anything below 90 c is okay – user320090 may 3 14 at 115theoretically the lower the temperature the longer it lives but processors almost never die and should not be of primary concern as long as it is in spec as ramhound alluded to chances are the psu and hard drives will die long before the cpu suffers any real damage even at the upper threshold of stable temperature – austin t french may 3 14 at 2032i can not agree with athom sfere conclusion about processors almost never die i have seen cpus dying and i have considered overheating as the most probable cause due to symptons several months record of high temperature readings – sopalajo de arrierez may 4 14 at 027athomsfere is correct about lower temp also those  that intel gives out are a risk management calculation intel expects the cpu to last say 5 years so they rate it for maximum temp with a  for saftey that they expect to allow it to live past 5 years just turning something on shortens its life measurable  or not it will ware out the question is will that affect be soon enough for you to care or notice – kendrick may 4

lifetime estimations as a function of its running temperature i know of two reasons for this when we could know data about lifetime estimation of a microchip technology this is after years from manufacturing that technology is obsolete only microchips corporations could be interested in researching to obtain such precise info about their products or the competitors ones and they are not willing to share it even if they do i wouldnt believe them very much so i believe that endusers only have the often intuitiveonly knowledge of experienced it specialists this is the mine microcircuitry engineering is something like cooking it involves a lot of probabilistcs and will often have a rather random results so you dont know how good a microchip is until you have fabricated it even then deterioration will have too a bit of probabilistic behavior40ºc 104ºf or below is heaven for every microchip50ºc 122ºf is a not bad temperature for any microchip microchips starts getting damaged on its lifetime at 60ºc 140ºf a chip running at 70ºc 158ºf during 24 hours and 7 days a week will probably last 26 years a chip running at 80ºc 176ºf during 24 hours and 7 days a week will probably last 13 years a chip running at 90ºc 194ºf during 24 hours and 7 days a week will probably last 620 months in this matter there is no difference between main computer chips like gpu cpu northbridge southbridge etc given a temperature it is harder for the chip to maintain it at high processor usage than at low processor usage for example a cpu that achieves 70ºc 158ºf during 10 hours on nearlyinactive windows desktop suffers less than a nother cpu that achieves 70ºc 158ºf during 10 hours of intensive cpu processing ie super pi  some hardware engineers report this could be due to that in the second case the cpu uses most of the microcircuitry and in the first case only a small part of it the general rule microcircuitry is like an ellectrical printed circuit board that has the tracks very close between them there are often only 45 molecules between two tracks so heating is slowly melting the tracks as time goes by keep things as cold as possible the general rule when reading the manufacturers data they want for you not to care about refrigerating anything because then it will get broken just after the warranty period sometimes only a few weeks after it it is incredible i know it is just bussiness alcapone dixit preventing is important better than waiting for failures to repair when things start to fail it could be due to tracks melting in the microcircuitry or due to minor tracks dilatations the second case is a temporal problem the first one is probably a definitive one history changes in this document read only if this is not the first

detailed response thats good to know this laptop is starting to get a bit dated for my uses so i was planning on upgrading to a desktop fairly soon so it still having a lifespan of 26 years is fine for me ive seen some people online saying that laptops typically handle high temperatures better than desktops though can you comment on the veracity of that and if that would change your estimate of 26 years – user320090 may 3 14 at 257you have to look at the cpu specs and verify what the maximum temp is for your chip my 12core is 58c i believe i can get it to 55c with about 10 threads of prime or another cpu burnin test in my case currently i cant use over 75 of max cpu if i want to keep my processor alive i would never run max temp either another thing sapalajo didnt mention is that any flaws in the chip will likely be the first to be affected so you may have stability or other quarky issues because that 1 part of the chip couldent handle the heat – kendrick may 3 14 at 412i have not found based only in my experience as an it specialist a better behavior in laptops or embedded devices for the case of high temperatures i would rather say that dont worry laptops can handle heating is some kind of a marketing trick underlaying microcircuitry technology keeps practically the same and cooling a laptop is not as easy as a desktop even dust cleaning an important care if you worry about overheating is harder to do if i would have to make my bet i would even say that an overheating desktop can endure a bit more than an overheating laptop – sopalajo de arrierez may 3 14 at 1029i agree with kendrick sometimes the problem with overheating is not in computerdevice not booting but in awkward unstabilities that give you headaches to discover where does the problem comes from furthermore if you have say a graphics card with thermal sensors on gpu vram and vrm 3 sensors you must worry about refrigerating all of them because the overheating in just one of them will probably affect the entire behavior of the card same could be told if you have a cpu with say 5 thermal sensors – sopalajo de arrierez may 3 14 at 2129i would say that current cpus can be intelligent enough to throttle down assuming the os and every thing works correctly had a dell tech forget the heat sync on a d620 systemboard swap the pc ran for about 6 months before the user complained to us pc was running wicked hot scalding on bare skin and the os had throttled to 200mhz it is possible for them to save them selves from cricical failures but i cant immagine how much service life that removed on the flip side surviving is very different than preforming well – kendrick may 4 14 at 013add a commentup vote1down vote im going to cover hardware first and then towards the end what you can do if youre stuck with that hardware as your only viable option right now my last cpu was an x3 720 that unlocked to an x4 20 it idled at 150 °f 66 °c and i purchased it the very first day amd 45 nm cpus were released im now running an am 8350 eightcore running at 4 ghz and it always runs at room temperature to understand how cpus and heat correlate you need to understand two things architectural design and manufacturing design amd and intel are both architectural cpu designers though amd is an underdog and split off their manufacturing into an independent company called global foundries in order to stay competitive with intel who is ahead with manufacturing technology by a full node what is a full node and what is a half node a full node is a mainstream technology where the sizes of the silicon walls are shrunk the smaller the cpugpu die the shorter the distance and the more is done by electrons flowing through the silicon corridors inside the cpu which also increases efficiency65 nm circa 200745 nm intel late 2007  everyone else late 200832 nm intel january 2010  everyone else 201122 nm intel 2012everyone else 201414 nm intel late 2014early 2015  everyone else about 2015 if were luckynow you also have to think about cpus being made a lot like gramma baking cookies theyre not all made the same some just dont get built as well as others my socket am3 quad core couldnt clock from 28 ghz to anything beyond 31 ghz and change while my already blazing fast 4 ghz eightcore beast easily goes to 4444 ghz before needing voltage to continue overclocking havent messed with that yet keep in mind that my 32 nm 4 ghz octcore cpu was on a maturerefined 32 nm process not when it first came out cpu cores  watts my friend has the same cpu and his house was 48 °f 9 °c one winter day in floridahis cpu was also 48 °f 9 °c now that wont matter when you have a highfull load on your cpu our 8350s have a 125 watt tdp total power draw the more they work the hotter theyll get and that depends on how you configure your os and applications you also cant forget that with intel unless you drop 600 youre stuck at four cores tops while 200 got me eight cores if youre talking load balance for example firefox will occasionally freeze and use 25 of a quad cores cpu cycles on my eightcore cpu it uses only 125 load so take a cpus tdp and divide by its core count 125 watts  8  156 watts per cpu core keep in mind its not all cpu cores though it should give you an understanding an intel 3630 qm s tdp is 45 watts 45 watts  4  11 watts but keep in mind its a mobile cpu most desktop intel cpus run at 77 watts now 77 watts  4  19 watts per core if you want to reduce the heat my hardware suggestions are as follows the more cores you have and the lower the tdp per core the better software configuration kill the superfetch program and kill off anything that sucks cpu cycles is your best bet youre likely stuck with this as your only option unless you can buy some new hardware run msconfig go to services hide all microsoft services and disable things except your antivirus go to the startup tab and do the same there is no checkbox there for microsoft items though also keep in mind things like windows updates eg the ms  net language compiler is a huge cpu hog will spend an hour or two at near 100 cpu usage make sure you have more ram than you need kill off the pagefile keep the hard drive from grinding to death and increases system performance simultaneously and youll get the most out of your systemshare improve this answeredited mar 12 at 720k48103 3answered may 3 14 at

get installed in just a few minutes – sopalajo de arrierez may 3 14 at 1607john the page file is incorrect ms states it may be possible with lots of ram but i dont know of many apps to this date that behave properly firefox was running  15gb the other day and i only had 2040 tabs open i have 8gb of ram and even when running linux i have been stuck having to have a swap file due to bad apps adobe flash and pdf are the first that come to mind also some apps are written in such a way that they dont run right if theres no swap – kendrick may 4 14 at 052kendrick not incorrect if you want performance then you should be aware of how much ram youre using and thus how much ram you should have installed windows does have erroneous behavior where it actively leaves items in the ram you can
