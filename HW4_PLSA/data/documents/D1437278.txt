in the ways of this world they deserve the greatest respect for they came to us at the time of creation and established time and space without the four directions our world would not have a framework within which to function the sun would not rise and set at predictable times our planet would not be hospitable nor would there be order to our universe these four spirits anchor the universe that we know they rule the seasons and our days the rising and setting of the sun gives us time defines our days the poles define our space the seasons set the calendar the year we plant in the spring in the summer our crops mature we harvest in autumn and in the winter the fields lay dormant resting for the new life in the spring each direction offers a lesson for each phase of our lives master these lessons and become the master of your life any problem we might encounter relates to one of the directions everything in this world comes from these four directions they also represent the four sons of tate the wind the other directions are above father sky below mother earth and the center the creator worthy of all the respect of the four cardinal directions we will address them in a future article when doing any sacred work it is advisable to begin by calling in the support of the directions and focusing your intent by repeating your plea for assistance to each of the directions at the beginning of this article you will find an example of how to call in the directions you are welcome to use this form it is our gift to you but as you get to know the directions yourself we advise that you find your own ways to call and honor them ritual is not a static medium of expression to maintain its power it must regularly be changed renewed and updated to fully reflect your current relationship with spirit to be relevant ritual should also be created by the individual practicing it how many sad souls monotonously repeat catechisms that for them have no meaning your communications with spirit must be as fresh and original as spirit made you to be do not surrender your powerful relationship with spirit by mindlessly adopting someone elses form following are four meditations or journeys that will help you begin to form relationships with four of the different aspects of spirit this is only an outline a suggestion as always we recommend you remain open to changing things as spirit guides you the directions may also present themselves to you differently than we describe here we offer only guidance you must find your own truth we do provide however a description of the directions as most people will come to know them the directions can mean different things to different people most tribes indigenous to the americas honor the directions and many tribes have different colors and animals to represent each direction there is beauty and strength in diversity in nature diversity is the key to survival honor the directions by respecting the unique
