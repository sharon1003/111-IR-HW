dielectric coatings a dielectric coating is a nonconductive ie an insulating coating at jaro corp we manufacture and apply our own dielectric coatings jaro 650 and jaro 650t polyimide these coatings are proprietary polyimide thermo set materials offering outstanding characteristics which include remarkable resistance to high temperatures they also performs well at cryogenic levels high resistance to oxidative degradation weathering and radiation excellent resistance to abrasive and frictional wear unaffected by solvents or oils provides insulation against electricity 3100 volts per mil for the 650 and a minimum of 1500 volts per mil for the 650tthe jaro 650 has a glossy red surface finish the jaro 650t has a matte red surface finish they are applied in a thin film which is important where space is of prime consideration the jaro 650 builds up at approximately 00025” per coat while the jaro 650t builds up at approximately 0015″ – 002″ per coat customized solutions for your dielectric needs are also available contact us today to discuss your optionsready to get started request a quote request quote
