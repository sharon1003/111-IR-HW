beloved landmark the eiffel tower the eiffel tower la tour eiffel in french was the main exhibit of the paris exposition — or worlds fair — of 1889 it was constructed to commemorate the centennial of the french revolution and to demonstrate frances industrial prowess to the world although at the beginning it was seen as the ugliest building in paris soon it became the symbol of the city said tea gudek snajdar an amsterdambased art historian museum docent and a blogger at culture tourist  worlds fair centerpiece gustave eiffel a french civil engineer is usually credited with designing the tower that bears his name however it was actually two lesserknown men maurice koechlin and emile nouguier who came up with the original drawings for the monument kochlin and nouguier were the chief engineers for the compagnie des etablissements eiffel — gustave eiffels engineering firm together with eiffel and a french architect stephen sauvestre the engineers submitted their plans to a contest that would determine the centerpiece for the 1889 worlds fair in paris the eiffel companys design won and construction of the wroughtiron tower began in july 1887 but not everyone in paris was thrilled with the idea of a giant metal monument looming over the city even to contemporary eyes the eiffel tower is unique but in the late 19th century nothing had been seen like it modern architecture was emerging slightly in paris before the eiffel tower but it was doing it in a very shy way said gudek snajdar iron which was newly popular as a building material because of the industrial revolution became a cornerstone of modern architecture but in 1887 it had only appeared internally as support structures or in unimportant buildings like hothouses factories and bridges the biggest problem was that they still didnt know how to make something aesthetically appealing with the new material when they were using it they would try to repeat historic stone structures its very visible on — for example pillars in the bibliotheque stegenevieve in paris explained gudek snajdar however with the eiffel tower they changed completely the way they were using the new material the structure its appearance is completely new and modern when construction of the tower began on the champs de mars a group of 300 artists sculptors writers and architects sent a petition to the commissioner of the paris exposition pleading him to halt construction of the ridiculous tower that would dominate paris like a gigantic black smokestack but the protests of paris artistic community fell on deaf ears construction of the tower was completed in just over two years on march 31 1889 a 2011 light show at the eiffel tower used 20000 bulbs overall the tower is lined with 5 billion lights credit nick k  shutterstockcom construction of the eiffel tower each of the 18000 pieces used to build the tower was calculated specifically for the project and prepared in eiffels factory on the outskirts of paris the wroughtiron structure is composed of four immense arched legs set on masonry piers that curve inward until joining in a single tapered tower building the tower required 25 million thermally assembled rivets and 7300 tons of iron to protect the tower from the elements workers painted every inch of the structure a feat that required 60 tons of paint the tower has since been repainted 18 times eiffel tower fun facts gustave eiffel used latticed wrought iron to construct the tower to demonstrate that the metal could be as strong as stone while being lighter eiffel also created the internal frame for the statue of liberty construction of the eiffel tower cost 779940131 french gold francs in 1889 or about 15 million the eiffel tower is 1063 feet 324 meters tall including the antenna at the top without the antenna it is 984 feet 300 m it was the worlds tallest structure until the chrysler building was built in new york in 1930 the tower was built to sway slightly in the wind but the sun affects the tower more as the sunfacing side of the tower heats up the top moves as much as 7 inches 18 centimeters away from the sun the sun also causes the tower to grow about 6 inches the eiffel tower weighs 10000 tons there are 5 billion lights on the eiffel tower the french have a nickname for the tower la dame de fer the iron lady the first platform is 190 feet above the ground the second platform is 376 feet and the third platform is almost 900 feet up the eiffel tower has 108 stories with 1710 steps however visitors can only climb stairs to the first platform there are two elevators one elevator travels a total distance of 64001 miles 103000 kilometers a year a hallmark of modern architecture the eiffel tower is unquestionably modern in its shape which is distinct from the neogothic neorenaissance and neobaroque styles that were popular in the 18th and 19th centuries according to gudek snajdar but its material truly made it stand out the eiffel tower was one of the first examples of the modern architecture because of the iron said gudek snajdar and the fact that the building didnt have any purpose in particular it existed purely to demonstrate french architectural creativity and skill with materials to the world it was imbued with meaning but not utility the eiffel tower is also a more democratic and therefore modern structure than other monuments of the time according to gudek snajdar gustave eiffel insisted that elevators be included in the tower but they had to be imported from an american company because no french company could meet the quality standards gudek snajdar said because of the escalators the building could be used as a tower from which parisians and their visitors could enjoy a view on their city that was something that was before only accessible to a few wealthy people that could afford flying in a hot air balloon but now it was rather cheap and anyone could enjoy the view on a city from it she explained thats why its a great example of a modern architecture its democratic and not only available to a few of a wealthy people but people of a different social background could use it and enjoy it uses of the tower the tower was intended as a temporary structure that was to be removed after 20 years but as time passed people no longer wanted to see the tower go after seeing the success of the tower during and after the world exhibition many of the former enemies of the project publicly apologized by the time the exhibition was over most parisians were proud of the structure said iva polansky a calgarybased novelist and historian at victorian paris although there remained a few diehards like the novelist guy de maupassant who continued to loathe the sight of it gustave eiffel was also not keen on seeing his favorite project dismantled and so he set about making the tower an indispensable tool for the scientific community just days after its opening eiffel installed a meteorology laboratory on the third floor of the tower he invited scientists to use the lab for their studies on everything from gravity to electricity ultimately however it was the towers looming height not its laboratory that saved it from extinction in 1910 the city of paris renewed eiffels concession for the tower because of the structures usefulness as a wireless telegraph transmitter the french military used the tower to communicate wirelessly with ships in the atlantic ocean and intercept enemy messages during world war i  the tower is still home to more than 120 antennas
