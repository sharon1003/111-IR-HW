answers are voted up and rise to the top does the type of ore used for building the beacon pyramid matterup vote5down votefavorite with the newest minecraft dev version 12w32a a new block was introduced the beacon block apparently it gives off certain powers in a certain radius when built upon a 3x3 pyramid etc and ive seen videos of the block in work however it seems that there are different ores used in making pyramid the question is does the type of ore used iron gold diamond emerald etc change anythingminecraftshare improve this questionedited jun 27 14 at 2301asked aug 13 12 at 2108senpai393k 121 348 547its too early for such questions i bet this will change in the future work in progress didnt you see – bla xpirit aug 13 12 at 21141not too early youtube commentators have talked about the features of the block already its just the ores i dont understand yet – senpai aug 13 12 at 2118i agree on keeping this question open the functionality specific to the question has been sufficiently explained and although its possible its unlikely to change before release – mbraedley aug 14 12 at 203add a comment3 answers active oldest votesup vote8down voteaccepted no all blocks used to build the pyramid have the same effect the way you activate different powers is through the beacon blocks gui placing a single iron ingot gold ingot diamond or emerald will allow you to set which power is being produced by the pyramid the size of the pyramid determines the radius of the effect and the number of powers which can be active at the same time to change to another power another of those four items must be used sourceshare improve this answeredited aug 14 12 at 304answered aug 13 12 at 2133saint wacko226k 12 83 144the wiki isnt yet complete but it answers the question

affects how good the beacon is tested on a 2 block jump test iron igot could not clear it but an emerald in the beacon let me jump 2 blocksshare improve this answeranswered aug 9 13 at 1415gavman1add
