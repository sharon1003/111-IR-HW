general religious movement see latter day saint movement for other uses see mormon disambiguation1841 british edition of the book of mormon mormonism is the predominant religious tradition of the latter day saint movement of restorationist christianity joseph smith founded the movement in western new york in the 1820s during the 1830s and 1840s it distinguished itself from traditional protestantism mormonism represents the faith taught by smith in the 1840s after he was killed in 1844 most mormons followed brigham young on his westward journey to the area that became the utah territory calling themselves the church of jesus christ of latterday saints lds church other sects include mormon fundamentalism which seeks to maintain practices and doctrines such as polygamy 1 and various other small independent denominations the secondlargest latter day saint denomination the reorganized church of jesus christ of latterday saints since 2001 called the community of christ does not describe itself as mormon but instead follows a trinitarian christian restorationist theology and also considers itself restorationist in terms of latter day saint doctrine the word mormon originally derived from the book of mormon a religious text published by smith which he said he translated from golden plates with divine assistance the book describes itself as a chronicle of early indigenous peoples of the americas and their dealings with god based on the name of that book early followers of smith were more widely known as mormons and their faith was called mormonism the term was initially considered pejorative 2 but mormons no longer consider it so although generally preferring other terms such as latterday saint or lds 3mormonism shares a common set of beliefs with the rest of the latter day saint movement including use of and belief in the bible as well as in other religious texts including the book of mormon and doctrine and covenants it also accepts the pearl of great price as part of its scriptural canon and has a history of teaching eternal marriage eternal progression and polygamy plural marriage although the lds church formally abandoned the practice of plural marriage in 1890 cultural mormonism a lifestyle promoted by mormon institutions includes cultural mormons who identify with the culture but not necessarily with the theology contents  hide 1

window showing joseph smith s first vision mormonism originated in the 1820s in western new york during a period of religious excitement known as the second great awakening 4 after praying about which denomination he should join joseph smith jr said he received a vision in the spring of 1820 5 called the  first vision  smith claimed god the father instructed him to join none of the existing churches because they were all wrong 6 during the 1820s smith reported several angelic visitations and was eventually told that god would use him to reestablish the true christian church and that the book of mormon would be the means of establishing correct doctrine for the restored church smith oliver cowdery and other early followers began baptizing new converts in 1829 formally organized in 1830 as the church of christ 7 smith was seen by his followers as a modernday prophet 8joseph smith claimed the book of mormon was translated from writing on golden plates in a reformed egyptian language translated with the assistance of the urim and thummim and seer stones both the special spectacles and the seer stone were at times referred to as the  urim and thummim  9 10 he said an angel first showed him the location of the plates in 1823 buried in a nearby hill but he was not allowed to take the plates until 1827 smith began dictating the text of the book of mormon around the fall of 1827 until the summer of 1828 when 116 pages were lost translation began again in april 1829 and finished in june 1829 11 saying that he translated it by the gift and power of god  12 after the translation was completed smith said the plates were returned to the angel during smiths supposed possession very few people were allowed to witness the plates the book described itself as a chronicle of an early israelite diaspora integrating with the preexisting indigenous peoples of the americas written by a people called the nephites according to the book of mormon lehis family left jerusalem at the urging of god c 600 bc and later sailed to the americas c 589 bc the nephites are described as descendants of nephi the fourth son of the prophet lehi the nephites are portrayed as having a belief in christ hundreds of years before his birth historical accuracy and veracity of the book of mormon was and continues to be hotly contested no archaeological linguistic or other evidence of the use of egyptian writing in ancient america has been discovered 13to avoid confrontation with new york residents the members moved to kirtland ohio and hoped to establish a permanent new jerusalem or city of zion in jackson county missouri 14 however they were expelled from jackson county in 1833 and fled to other parts of missouri in 1838 violence between the missourians and church members resulted in the governor of missouri issuing an  extermination order  again forcing the church to relocate 15 the displaced mormons fled to illinois to a small town called commerce the church bought the town renamed it nauvoo and lived with a degree of peace and prosperity for a few years 16 however tensions between mormons and nonmormons again escalated and in 1844 smith was killed by a mob precipitating a succession crisis 17the largest group of mormons lds church accepted brigham young as the new prophetleader and emigrated to what became the utah territory 18 there the church began the open practice of plural marriage a form of polygyny which smith had instituted in nauvoo plural marriage became the faiths most sensational characteristic during the 19th century but vigorous opposition by the united states congress threatened the churchs existence as a legal institution further polygamy was also a major cause for the opposition to mormonism in the states of idaho and arizona 19 in the 1890 manifesto church president wilford woodruff announced the official end of plural marriage 20because of the formal abolition of plural marriage in 1890 several smaller groups of mormons broke with the lds church forming several denominations of mormon fundamentalism 21 meanwhile the lds church had become a proponent of monogamy and patriotism has extended its reach internationally by a vigorous missionary program and has grown in size to a reported membership of over 15 million 22 the church is becoming a part of the american and international mainstream 23 however it consciously and intentionally retains its identity as a peculiar people 24 believing their unique relationship with god helps save them from worldliness nonspiritual influences theology  editnature of god  editmain article god in mormonism like most other christian groups mormonism teaches that there is the father the son and the holy spirit but unlike trinitarian faiths the lds church teaches that they are separate and distinct beings with the father and son having perfected physical bodies and the holy ghost having only a body of spirit 25 while the three beings are physically distinct in mormon theology they are one in thoughts actions and purpose and commonly referred to collectively as the godhead 26 27 also mormonism teaches that god the father is the literal father of the spirits of all men and women which existed prior to their mortal existence 28 the lds church also believes that a heavenly mother exists 29 30 further it is believed that all humans as children of god can become exalted inheriting all that god has as jointheirs with christ and becoming like him as a god 31 lorenzo snow is quoted as saying as man now is god once was as god now is man may be 32restoration  edita depiction of joseph smith and oliver cowdery receiving priesthood authority from john the baptist main article restoration latter day saintsmormonism describes itself as falling within world christianity but as a distinct restored dispensation it characterizes itself as the only true form of the christian religion since the time of a great apostasy that began not long after the ascension of jesus christ 33 according to mormons this apostasy involved the corruption of the pure original christian doctrine with greek and other philosophies 34 and followers dividing into different ideological groups 35 additionally mormons claim the martyrdom of the apostles led to the loss of priesthood authority to administer the church and its ordinances 36 37mormons believe that god reestablished the early christian church as found in the new testament through joseph smith 38 in particular mormons believe that angels such as peter james john and john the baptist appeared to joseph smith and others and bestowed various priesthood authorities on them 39 mormons thus believe that their church is the only true and living church because divine authority was restored to it through smith in addition mormons believe that smith and his legitimate successors are modern prophets who receive revelation from god to guide the church they maintain that other religions have a portion of the truth and are guided by the light of christ 40 41cosmology  editmain article mormon cosmology smiths cosmology is laid out mostly in smiths later revelations and sermons but particularly the book of abraham the book of moses and the king follett discourse 42 mormon cosmology presents a unique view of god and the universe and places a high importance on human agency in mormonism life on earth is just a short part of an eternal existence mormons believe that in the beginning all people existed as spirits or intelligences in the presence of god 43 in this state god proposed a plan of salvation whereby they could progress and have a privilege to advance like himself 44 the spirits were free to accept or reject this plan and a third of them led by satan rejected it 45 the rest accepted the plan coming to earth and receiving bodies with an understanding that they would experience sin and suffering in mormonism the central part of gods plan is the atonement of jesus christ 46 mormons believe that one purpose of earthly life is to learn to choose good over evil in this process people inevitably make mistakes becoming unworthy to return to the presence of god mormons believe that jesus paid for the sins of the world and that all people can be saved through his atonement 47 mormons accept christs atonement through faith repentance formal covenants or ordinances such as baptism and consistently trying to live a christlike life according to mormon scripture the earths creation was not ex nihilo but organized from existing matter the earth is just one of many inhabited worlds and there are many governing heavenly bodies including the planet or star kolob which is said to be nearest the throne of god ordinances  editin mormonism an ordinance is a religious ritual of special significance often involving the formation of a covenant with god 48 ordinances are performed by the authority of the priesthood and in the name of jesus christ the term has a meaning roughly similar to that of the term  sacrament  in other christian denominations an eightyearold girl being baptized in cerro punta panama saving ordinances or ordinances viewed as necessary for salvation include baptism by immersion after the age of accountability normally age 8 confirmation and reception of the gift of the holy ghost performed by laying hands on the head of a newly baptized member ordination to the aaronic and melchizedek priesthoods for males an endowment including washing and anointing received in temples and marriage or sealing to a spouse 49mormons also perform other ordinances which include the lords supper commonly called the sacrament  naming and blessing children giving priesthood blessings and patriarchal blessings anointing and blessing the sick participating in prayer circles and setting apart individuals who are called to church positions in mormonism the saving ordinances are seen as necessary for salvation but they are not sufficient in and of themselves for example baptism is required for exaltation but simply having been baptized does not guarantee any eternal reward the baptized person is expected to be obedient to gods commandments to repent of any sinful conduct subsequent to baptism and to receive the other saving ordinances because mormons believe that everyone must receive certain ordinances to be saved mormons perform ordinances on behalf of deceased persons 50 these ordinances are performed vicariously or by proxy on behalf of the dead in accordance with their belief in each individuals free agency living or dead mormons believe that the deceased may accept or reject the offered ordinance in the spirit world just as all spirits decided to accept or reject gods plan originally in addition these conditional ordinances on behalf of the dead are performed only when a deceased persons genealogical information has been submitted to a temple and correctly processed there before the ordinance ritual is performed only ordinances for salvation are performed on behalf of deceased persons see also baptism for the dead scripture  editthe lds church scriptural canon mormons believe in the old and new testaments and the lds church uses the king james bible as its official scriptural text of the bible while mormons believe in the general accuracy of the modern day text of the bible they also believe that it is incomplete and that errors have been introduced 51 52 53 in mormon theology many lost truths are restored in the book of mormon which mormons hold to be divine scripture and equal in authority to the bible 54the mormon scriptural canon also includes a collection of revelations and writings contained in the doctrine and covenants which contains doctrine and prophecy and the pearl of great price which addresses briefly genesis to exodus these books as well as the joseph smith translation of the bible have varying degrees of acceptance as divine scripture among different denominations of the latter day saint movement revelation  editfurther information revelation latter day saintsin mormonism continuous revelation is the principle that god or his divine agents still continue to communicate to mankind this communication can be manifest in many ways influences of the holy ghost the principal form in which this principle is manifest visions visitations of divine beings and others joseph smith used the example of the lords revelations to moses in deuteronomy to explain the importance of continuous revelation god said thou shalt not murder at another time he said thou shalt utterly destroy this is the principle on which the government of heaven is conducted–by revelation adapted to the circumstances in which the children of the kingdom are placed whatever god commands is right no matter what it is although we may not see the reason thereof till long after the events transpire — joseph smith teachings of the prophet joseph smith pp 256–257 mormons believe that smith and subsequent church leaders could speak scripture when moved upon by the holy ghost 55 in addition many mormons believe that ancient prophets in other regions of the world received revelations that resulted in additional scriptures that have been lost and may one day be forthcoming in mormonism revelation is not limited to church members for instance latter day saints believe that the united states constitution is a divinely inspired document 56 57mormons are encouraged to develop a personal relationship with the holy ghost and receive personal revelation for their own direction and that of their family 55 the latter day saint concept of revelation includes the belief that revelation from god is available to all those who earnestly seek it with the intent of doing good it also teaches that everyone is entitled to personal revelation with respect to his or her stewardship leadership responsibility thus parents may receive inspiration from god in raising their families individuals can receive divine inspiration to help them meet personal challenges church officers may receive revelation for those whom they serve the important consequence of this is that each person may receive confirmation that particular doctrines taught by a prophet are true as well as gain divine insight in using those truths for their own benefit and eternal progress in the church personal revelation is expected and encouraged and many converts believe that personal revelation from god was instrumental in their conversion 58relations to other faiths  editrelation to mainstream christianity  editsee also mormonism and christianity mormons see jesus christ as the premier figure of their religion 59mormonism categorizes itself within christianity and nearly all mormons selfidentify as christian 60 61 62 for some who define christianity within the doctrines of catholicism eastern orthodoxy and protestantism mormonisms differences place it outside the umbrella of christianity 63 64 65since its beginnings the faith has proclaimed itself to be christs church restored with its original authority structure and power maintaining that existing denominations believed in incorrect doctrines and were not acknowledged by god as his church and kingdom 66 though the religion quickly gained a large following of christian seekers in the 1830s many american christians came to view the churchs early doctrines and practices 67 as politically and culturally subversive as well as doctrinally heretical abominable and condemnable this discord led to a series of sometimesdeadly conflicts between mormons and others who saw themselves as orthodox christians 68 although such violence declined during the twentieth century the religions unique doctrinal views and practices still generate criticism sometimes vehemently so this gives rise to efforts by mormons and opposing types of christians to proselytize each other mormons believe in jesus christ as the literal firstborn son of god and messiah his crucifixion as a conclusion of a sin offering and subsequent resurrection 69 however latterday saints lds reject the ecumenical creeds and the definition of the trinity 70 71 in contrast the second largest latter day saint denomination the community of christ is trinitarian and monotheistic  mormons hold the view that the new testament prophesied both the apostasy from the teachings of christ and his apostles as well as the restoration of all things prior to the second coming of christ 72some notable differences with mainstream christianity include a belief that jesus began his atonement in the garden of gethsemane and continued it to his crucifixion rather than the orthodox belief that the crucifixion alone was the physical atonement 73 and an afterlife with three degrees of glory with hell often called spirit prison being a temporary repository for the wicked between death and the resurrection 74 additionally mormons do not believe in creation ex nihilo believing that matter is eternal and creation involved god organizing existing matter 75much of the mormon belief system is geographically oriented around the north and south american continents mormons believe that the people of the book of mormon lived in the western hemisphere that christ appeared in the western hemisphere after his death and resurrection that the true faith was restored in upstate new york by joseph smith that the garden of eden was located in north america and that the new jerusalem would be built in missouri for this and other reasons including a belief by many mormons in american exceptionalism molly worthen speculates that this may be why leo tolstoy described mormonism as the quintessential american religion 76relation to judaism  editsee also mormonism and judaism although mormons do not claim to be part of judaism mormon theology claims to situate mormonism within the context of judaism to an extent that goes beyond what most other christian denominations claim the faith incorporates many old testament ideas into its theology and the beliefs of mormons sometimes parallel those of judaism and certain elements of jewish culture in the earliest days of mormonism joseph smith taught that the indigenous peoples of the americas were members of some of the lost tribes of israel later he taught that mormons were israelites and that they may learn of their tribal affiliation within the twelve israelite tribes members of the lds church receive patriarchal blessings which declare the recipients lineage within one of the tribes of israel the lineage is either through true bloodline or adoption the lds church teaches that if one is not a direct descendant of one of the twelve tribes upon baptism he or she is adopted into one of the tribes patriarchal blessings also include personal information which is revealed through a patriarch by the power of the priesthood the mormon affinity for judaism is expressed by the many references to judaism in the mormon liturgy for example smith named the largest mormon settlement he founded nauvoo which means to be beautiful in hebrew brigham young named a tributary of the great salt lake the  jordan river  the lds church created a writing scheme called the deseret alphabet which was based in part on hebrew the lds church has a jerusalem center in israel where students focus their study on near eastern history culture language and the bible 77there has been some controversy involving jewish groups who see the actions of some elements of mormonism as offensive in the 1990s jewish groups vocally opposed the lds practice of baptism for the dead on behalf of jewish victims of the holocaust and jews in general according to lds church general authority monte j brough mormons who baptized 380000 holocaust victims posthumously were motivated by love and compassion and did not understand their gesture might offend jews they did not realize that what they intended as a christian act of service was misguided and insensitive 78 mormons believe that when the dead are baptized through proxy they have the option of accepting or rejecting the ordinance relation to islam  editmain article mormonism and islam since its origins in the 19th century mormonism has been compared to islam often by detractors of one religion or the other 79 for instance joseph smith was referred to as the modern mahomet   sic by the new york herald 80 shortly after his murder in june 1844 this epithet repeated a comparison that had been made from smiths earliest career 79 one that was not intended at the time to be complimentary comparison of the mormon and muslim prophets still occurs today sometimes for derogatory or polemical reasons 81 but also for more scholarly and neutral purposes 79 while mormonism and islam certainly have many similarities there are also significant fundamental differences between the two religions mormon–muslim relations have been historically cordial 82 recent years have seen increasing dialogue between adherents of the two faiths and cooperation in charitable endeavors especially in the middle and far east 83islam and mormonism both originate in the abrahamic traditions each religion sees its founder muhammad for islam and joseph smith for mormonism as being a true prophet of god called to reestablish the truths of these ancient theological belief systems that have been altered corrupted or lost in addition both prophets received visits from an angel leading to additional books of scripture both religions share a high emphasis on family life charitable giving chastity abstention from alcohol and a special reverence for though not worship of their founding prophet before the 1890 manifesto against plural marriage mormonism and islam also shared in the belief in and practice of plural marriage a practice now held in common by islam and various branches of mormon fundamentalism the religions differ significantly in their views on god islam insists upon the complete oneness and uniqueness of god  allah  while mormonism asserts that the godhead is made up of three distinct personages 84 mormonism sees jesus christ as the promised messiah and the literal son of god while islam insists that the title messiah means that jesus or  isa  was a prophet sent to establish the true faith not that he was the son of god or a divine being despite opposition from other christian denominations mormonism identifies itself as a christian religion the restoration of primitive christianity islam does not refer to itself as christian asserting that jesus and all true followers of christs teachings were and are muslims–a term that means submitters to god 85 islam proclaims that its prophet muhammad was the seal of the prophets 86 and that no further prophets would come after him mormons though honoring joseph smith as the first prophet in modern times see him as just one in a long line of prophets with jesus christ being the premier figure of the religion 87theological divisions  editmormon theology includes three main movements by far the largest of these is mainstream mormonism defined by the leadership of the church of jesus christ of latterday saints lds church the two broad movements outside mainstream mormonism are mormon fundamentalism and liberal reformist mormonism mainstream mormon theology  editsee also beliefs and practices of the church of jesus christ of latterday saints mainstream mormonism is defined by the leadership of the lds church which identifies itself as christian 61 members of the lds church consider their top leaders to be prophets and apostles and are encouraged to accept their positions on matters of theology while seeking confirmation of them through personal study of the book of mormon and the bible personal prayer is encouraged as well the lds church is by far the largest branch of mormonism it has continuously existed since the succession crisis of 1844 that split the latter day saint movement after the death of founder joseph smith jr the lds church seeks to distance itself from other branches of mormonism particularly those that practice polygamy 88 the church maintains a degree of orthodoxy by excommunicating or disciplining its members who take positions or engage in practices viewed as apostasy for example the lds church excommunicates members who practice polygamy or who adopt the beliefs and practices of mormon fundamentalism mormon fundamentalism  editmain article mormon fundamentalism one way mormon fundamentalism distinguishes itself from mainstream mormonism is through the practice of plural marriage fundamentalists initially broke from the lds church after that doctrine was discontinued around the beginning of the 20th century mormon fundamentalism teaches that plural marriage is a requirement for exaltation the highest degree of salvation which will allow them to live as gods and goddesses in the afterlife mainstream mormons by contrast believe that a single celestial marriage is necessary for exaltation in distinction with the lds church mormon fundamentalists also often believe in a number of other doctrines taught and practiced by brigham young in the 19th century which the lds church has either abandoned repudiated or put in abeyance these includethe law of consecration also known as the united order put in abeyance by the lds church in the 19th centurythe adam–god teachings taught by brigham young and other early leaders of the lds church repudiated by the lds church in the mid20th centurythe principle of blood atonement repudiated by the lds church in the mid20th century andthe exclusion of black men from the priesthood abandoned by the lds church in 1978 mormon fundamentalists believe that these principles were wrongly abandoned or changed by the lds church in large part due to the desire of its leadership and members to assimilate into mainstream american society and avoid the persecutions and conflict that had characterized the church throughout its early years others believe that it was a necessity at some point for a restoration of all things to be a truly restored church liberal reformist theology  editsee also bickertonite some lds church members have worked towards a more liberal reform of the church others have left the lds church and still consider themselves to be cultural mormons others have formed new religions many of them now defunct for instance the godbeites broke away from the lds church in the late 19th century on the basis of both political and religious liberalism and in 1985 the restoration church of jesus christ broke away from the lds church as an lgbt friendly denomination which was formally dissolved in 2010 see also
