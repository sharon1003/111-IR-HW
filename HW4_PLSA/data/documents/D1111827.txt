access team about owner teams about access teams and team templates maximum settings for systemmanaged access teams owner team or access team choosing the type of the team may depend on the goals nature of the project and even the size of your organization there are a few guidelines that you can use when choosing the team type when to use owner teams your organization’s policies require the ability for records to be owned by entities other than users such as the team entity the number of teams is known at the design time of your microsoft dynamics 365 system daily reporting on progress by owning teams is required when to use access teams the teams are dynamically formed and dissolved this typically happens if the clear criteria for defining the teams such as established territory product or volume are not provided the number of teams is not known at the design time of your microsoft dynamics 365 system the team members require different access rights on the records you can share a record with several access teams each team providing different access rights on the record for example one team is granted the read access right on the account and another team the read write and share access rights on the same account a unique set of users requires access to a single record without having an ownership of the record about owner teams an owner team can own one or more records to make a team an owner of the record you must assign a record to the team while teams provide access to a group of users you must still associate individual users with security roles that grant the privileges they need to create update or delete userowned records these privileges cant be applied by assigning security roles to a team and then adding the user to that team if an owner team doesn’t own records and doesn’t have security roles assigned to the team it can be converted to an access team it is a oneway conversion you can’t convert the access team back to the owner team during conversion all queues and mailboxes associated with the team are deleted when you create a team in the web application you have to choose the team type owner more information help  training create or edit a team help  training assign a record to a user or team about access teams and team templates you can create an access team manually by choosing the team type access or let the system create and manage an access team for you when you create an access team you can share multiple records with the team a systemmanaged access team is created for a specific record other records can’t be shared with this team you have to provide a team template that the system uses to create a team in this template you define the entity type and the access rights on the record that are granted to the team members when the team is created a team template is displayed on all record forms for the specified entity as a list when you add the first user to the list the actual access team for this record is created you can add and remove members in the team by using this list the team template applies to the records of the specified entity type and the related entities according to the cascading rules to give team members different access on the record you can provide several team templates each template specifying different access rights for example you can create a team template for the account entity with the read access right which allows the team members to view the specified account for another team that requires more access to the same account you can create a team template with read write share and other access rights to be added to the team a minimum access level a user must have on the entity specified in the template is basic user read because of the parental relationship between the team template and systemmanaged access teams when you delete a template all teams associated with the template are deleted according to the cascading rules if you change access rights for the team template the changes are applied only to the new autocreated systemmanaged access teams the existing teams are not affected note a user must have sufficient privileges to join an access team for example if the access team has the delete access right on an account the user must have the delete privilege on the account entity to join the team if you’re trying to add a user with insufficient privileges you’ll see this error message “you can’t add the user to the access team because the user doesn’t have sufficient privileges on the entity”for the stepbystep instructions on how to create a team template and add it the entity form see the article in the help  training create a team template and add to an entity form maximum settings for systemmanaged access teams the maximum number of
