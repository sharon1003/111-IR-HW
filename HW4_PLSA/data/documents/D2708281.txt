citation needed and fewer than 3000 cars were built 3the model name sv1 was an acronym for safety vehicle one 3 the original idea for the bricklin sv1 was a safe and economical sports car but due to the added weight of the safety features the car was inefficient and simply a safe sports car  citation needed the bricklin was designed for safety with an integrated roll cage 5 mph 80 kmh bumpers and

later cars used a 351 cu in 5752 cc ford windsor v8 performance figures rated favorably against the contemporary corvette which most auto magazines used as a point of comparison 7 8 the front suspension used aarms and coil springs while the rear used leaf springs on a live axle for the 1974 model year 772 cars were produced 137 of which had fourspeed manual transmissions all 1975 and 1976 cars had automatic transmissions in 1974 potential owners were given a choice of transmission and color whereas in 1975 there was only a choice of color in a bid to reduce production costs bricklin attempted to bond fibreglass to acrylic plastic—something the plastics industry had not perfected at the time—resulting in a high failure rate and high production costs some panels cracked while still in their molds cars also tended to overheat due to using a single radiator opening in the 1974 model doubling the size of the opening failed to solve the problem running examples today generally feature a retrofitted larger radiator it soon became obvious that bricklins claims of a high performance safety car were not realized in the production models it is believed that fewer than 1200
