enriched in ca and p objective this study tested whether extra enteral ca supplementation increases bone mineral content bmc and prevents dolichocephalic head flattening and myopia in elbw infants study design infants 401–1000 birth weight receiving enteral feeds were randomized to receive feeds supplemented with cagluconate powder or pure standard feeds main outcome measures were the excretion of ca and p by weekly spot urine measurements the degree of dolichocephalic deformation frontooccipital to biparietal diameter ratio fodbpd at 36 weeks postmenstrual age and the bmc by dualenergy xray absorptiometry at discharge cycloplegic refraction was measured at 18–22 months corrected age results ninetynine elbw infants with a gestational age of 26 weeks 23–31 median minimummaximum were randomized at a postnatal age of 12 days 5–23 weighing 790g 440–1700 urinary ca excretion increased p excretion decreased in the ca supplemented group total body bmc was 899 ± 24 g mean ± se in the supplemented group and 852 ± 26 g in the control group p 019 the fodbpd was 150 113–169 mean ± sd and 147 118–164 in the supplemented and control groups and the refraction 098 ± 123 and 140 ± 133 dpt p068 respectively in 64 elbw infants 79 of survivors at 2yearfollowup conclusions extra enteral ca supplementation did not change bmc head shape or refraction the decreased p excretion may reflect p deficiency in infants receiving extra ca preventing improved bone mineral accretion keywords bone mineral content bone mineral density preterm infant bioavailability phosphorus go to introduction many elbw infants develop bone mineral deficiency manifest as ‘rickets’ or osteopenia of prematurity 1 – 6 with adequate nutrition elbw infants can achieve growth and mineral accretion rates up to those achieved in utero 7 – 10both ca and p must be simultaneously available in sufficient amounts in order to form bone mineral 9 postnatal bone demineralization develops when the supply of ca or p or both does not match the demand of the rapidly growing skeleton 11 – 14 redistribution of existing bone mineral leads to a diffusely mineral deficient skeleton 15 which is prone to fractures furthermore bone mineral deficiency has been linked to skull deformities 16 presumably forces of gravity act on the demineralized skull bones of an infant’s head which tends to be positioned sideways most of the time thereby the head develops a dolichocephalic deformity which may include deformation of the orbits and hence the eyeballs possibly leading to myopia of prematurity 17 18ca absorption depends on gestational and postnatal age and varies with the type of feedings used 19 20 older studies reported bioavailabilities as low as 15–35 7 19 in formula fed infants while p was found to be absorbed by more than 50 therefore an enteral supply of ca and p in the molar ratio of cap of 14 to 20 21 may still result in relative or absolute ca deficiency 9 10 22 this is in line with a decade of experience using urinalysis guided individualized ca and p supplementation – a p supplement was rarely needed in elbw infants fed fortifiers or formula this randomized trial was conducted to test the hypothesis that extra enteral ca supplementation alone would increase bone mineral content decrease dolichocephalic deformation and increase the proportion of spot urine samples showing simultaneous excretion of ca and p and as primary hypothesis reduce the incidence of myopia of prematurity 17 go to methods eligible patients and randomization the institutional review board of the university of alabama at birmingham approved the study and written informed consent was obtained in all cases elbw infants with a birth weight of 401–1000 g and postnatal age less than 14 days were eligible unless they had major congenital malformations chromosomal aberrations bowel perforation or necrotizing enterocolitis stage 2a or greater diagnosed before randomization the infants were randomized to receive standard feedings fortified human milk or formula or standard feedings supplemented with ca gluconate randomization was stratified for infants with 401–750 g and 751–1000 g birth weight according to balanced block schemes with variable block sizes 2–6 using sealed opaque envelopes infant nutrition and care total parenteral nutrition was started within 48 hours of birth and generally contained 1–2 mmolkgd ca and 1 mmolkgd p enteral feeds were generally started on day of life 1–3 feedings were advanced to at least 150 mlkgd unless there were contraindications supine and prone positioning were not governed by a specific policy and were generally alternated as soon as umbilical lines had been removed there was no nursing protocol to influence head shape study intervention human milk was preferred when available and was fortified with enfamil human milk fortifier 1 pack enfamil per 25 ml breast milk mead johnson west palm beach fl once enteral feedings amounted to 100 mlkgd or more otherwise a 24 caloz preterm formula similac special care 24 ® ross laboratories columbus oh was used theoretically most ca 80 contained in fortified human milk originated from the fortifier and thus variations of human milk ca content were low usp grade cagluconate powder sigma chemical company cat  c8231 st louis mo was added to the standard feedings of elbw infants randomized to extra enteral ca supplementation as soon as they tolerated 100 mlkgd feeds the ca dose was estimated to meet fetal ca accretion when enteral ca bioavailability was 50 even lower values were reported 7 19 and growth approximated fetal weight gain 7 23 elbw infants with a current body weight below 1000 g received 26 mmol 112 g cagluconate equivalent to 104 mg ca added to 100 ml of feeds and infants above 1000 g body weight received 13 mmol 056 g total ca and p contents in the feeds are given in table 1 the ca dose was higher than in a previous randomized trial 24 see onlineonly appendix for further ca dosing information  stocks of ca gluconate powder were tested monthly for bacterial growth on blood agar plates and were always negative extra enteral ca supplementation was continued until discharge but interrupted when feeding intolerance intake less than 100 mlkgd occurred or the infant developed acute abdominal disease symptoms table 1ca and p content in mmol and mg per 100 ml feeds outcome assessment frontooccipital diameter fod and biparietal diameter bpd above the ears on the infant’s skull were measured with a pelvimeter attached above the ears on the infant’s skull at randomization and at 36 weeks postmenstrual age 16 dolichocephalic deformation was assessed by the fodbdp ratio fodbpd spot urine 2 ml samples were collected weekly for analysis of ca and p content the samples were stored frozen and analyzed at the department of clinical chemistry university of ulm germany 9 as additional blood sampling was not part of the protocol serum ca and p concentrations as well as alkaline phosphatase were obtained when ordered by the clinical team measured at uab’s clinical chemistry department using the facility’s standard procedures and quality controls whole body and femur bone mineral content was measured by a randomizationmasked investigator at the time of discharge using dualenergy xray absorptiometry dxagelunarprodigy madison wi scanning was performed without sedation and repeated in case of movement artifacts all subjects were scanned and data analyzed using the small animal module of the en core™ 2002 software version 610029 both whole body and femur bmc were determined using the customized region of interest tool all scans and analyses were conducted by the same technician sds scores were calculated according to cole et al 25 refractive error was measured at 18–22 months corrected age by the same investigator who was masked to the patients’ group assignment refractive error was determined by cycloplegic retinoscopy performed 30 minutes after instillation of 1 cyclopentolate hydrochloride in each eye a speculum was not used but in some cases it was necessary to hold the lids lightly to allow better viewing without deforming the globe retinoscopy bars and a manual streak retinoscope were used to measure the refractive error in the principal meridians the spherical power was measured as the power in the least minus meridian and the cylinder power was measured as the power in the most minus meridian the spherical refraction equivalent reported in this work is derived by adding one half of the difference between these values to the sphere component thus yielding the mean value of the lowest and highest meridian the dioptric equivalent of the investigator’s working distance 15 d 66cm was subtracted from all the measurements eyes with a spherical equivalent ≤ −1 were counted as myopic those with a spherical equivalent ≥ 1 hyperopic cylindrical refraction angles of 90 ± 45 degrees were considered as astigmatism against the rule all others as astigmatism with the rule statistical data analysis refraction measured at followup was the primary outcome demonstrating a 1 dpt refraction difference with sd  144 26 – 28 α  005 and power  08 required 68 patients and 28 additional patients were planned to compensate for deaths or losses of follow up further predefined outcome criteria of the inhospital phase reported here

xray absorptiometry dxa scans were unreadable in 3 patients because of movement artifacts dxa scanning was not possible in 11 patients because they were discharged from another hospital and did not

change substantially from randomization till 36 weeks postmenstrual age  tables 1 and and3 3  sds scores were also not different survival incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis and incidence of retinopathy of prematurity were similar in both study groups the number of days per patient of furosemide treatment was not different between the randomized study groups  table 4  clinically evident fractures were not observed table 3dxa data at discharge table 4outcome data at 36 weeks postmenstrual age refraction measurements at 18–22 months corrected age were performed in 64 patients 79 of 81 infants surviving to 36 weeks postmenstrual age the most common reasons for missing the refraction exam was decline by the parents spherical and cylindrical refraction errors occurred with similar incidence and magnitude in both study groups  table 5  furthermore there was no association between fodbpd and myopia detectable not shown table 5refraction measurements at 18–22 months corrected age approximately 88 of urine samples of the control group contained p whereas ca was present in 67 therefore most infants in the control group had a sufficient p supply for their actual bone mineralization processes and ca was the critical component less than 50 of samples contained both ca and p simultaneously  fig 2  in the casupplemented group more than 90 of urine samples contained ca but less than 50 of samples contained p and 20 contained both ca and p simultaneously the proportions of urine samples containing ca p or both were significantly different between the study groups p  002 fig 2ca and p in spot urine samples median values of each patient’s percentage of urine samples containing more than 1 mmoll ca p or both are shown error bars represent 25 th –75 th percentile asterisks indicate values significantly different  urinary ca concentrations were higher in supplemented infants compared to controls  table 6  and weakly correlated to serum ca concentrations r041 p00001 urinary p concentrations were significantly lower in supplemented infants compared to controls serum ca concentrations were measured in 201 of 1128 total patient weeks and were higher in infants randomized to supplementation compared to control infants  table 6  the highest values were observed during weeks when feeds were tolerated and thus supplements were actually given serum p concentrations were measured in 308 of 1128 total patient weeks and were unrelated to extra enteral ca supplementation weeks of measurements were evenly distributed throughout the hospital stay serum ca concentrations were inversely correlated to serum p concentrations r  02 p  005 furthermore although p supply followed unit standards and feeds were supplemented with p by the manufacturers serum p concentrations were largely below the threshold for tubular reabsorption and thus suboptimal 29 table 6ca and p measurements feeding tolerance was also similar in both groups  table 7  feeds were started 100 mlkg of feeds were achieved and parenteral nutrition was discontinued at similar ages in both groups no difference in the type of feeds or the proportion of breast milk was found between groups extra enteral ca supplementation did not interfere with feeding tolerance as there was a similar cumulative feeding amount in both groups and no ca soap bezoars occurred however feeding tolerance interfered with extra enteral ca supplementation because ca was to be given only when feeding tolerance was good the infants randomized to extra ca achieved feeds  100 mlkg on 2336 of 3719 63 patient days in the control group on 1994 of 3390 59 patient days as a result infants in the ca group actually received the ca supplement on a total of 1924 52 of total patient days therefore the major reason for not giving ca was feeds less than 100 mlkgd in accordance with the protocol table 7feeding summary go to discussion in this randomized trial extra enteral ca supplementation did not increase bone mineral content or affect the head shape given these results the absence of differences in eye refraction errors between study groups is consistent with our hypothesis 17 the urinalyses however were distinctly different highlighting the peculiar balance between ca and p supply control infants excreted ca in 67 but p in 88 of their urine samples indicating that ca deficiency was more abundant than p deficiency and p supply was sufficient in the vast majority of infants in the group receiving extra ca however urinary p levels were decreased and many infants ceased to excrete p indicating that p became the limiting nutrient in the infants supplemented with extra ca despite a high p content in the feeds since a significant increase in bmc was not detected in ca supplemented infants the apparent p deficiency may not be explained by a higher bone mineral formation in supplemented infants consuming all supplied p furthermore weight gain was not affected by the supplement an alternative sequence may have led to increased fecal losses of p in this particular study the p was provided mostly as inorganic phosphate 30 31 whose bioavailability may be impaired by precipitation as calcium phosphate when ca salts are added 32 phosphorus has a poor bioavailability out of ca triphosphate 33 we speculate that p absorption may depend on the chemical nature of the actual p supplement and that organically bound p has a higher bioavailability than inorganic p at high ca supply 8 european formulas usually contain organically bound p such as glycerophosphate which may explain why such a reduced bioavailability of p has not been observed in previous studies of ca supplementation which were conducted in europe 9 10 22 interestingly the natural p in breast milk is also organically bound to casein micelles and would thus be optimized for intestinal absorption in the presence of ca 34 added inorganic phosphate however would not benefit from that mechanism ca absorption of preterm infants is highly variable and may be less than 50 7 19 20this variability may expose infants to ca deficiency and thus prevent optimal bone mineralization even when following current recommendations or using current commercial infant formulas it was expected that absolute ca absorption would increase since a linear relationship between ca supply and absorption has been demonstrated 35 to meet the ca demand for intrauterine growth and ca accretion rates even in patients with low ca absorption the ca dose in the treated group was 2–25fold higher than in the most recent european recommendations 36 thus accepting an oversupply in patients with slower growth or better absorption in the control group the ca dose was 15–175fold higher than in these recommendations 36 calculations using skeletal growth necessary p retention published p bioavailability and the high p content of commercial formulas and fortifiers indicated that additional p supplementation would not be necessary the p dose was already 13–2fold higher than in the european recommendations 36 this was corroborated by extensive clinical experience from a decade of urinalysisguided feed supplementation that an extra p supplement is rarely necessary when formula or human milk fortifiers are used 9 10 therefore individualized supplement adjustments were not planned to simplify study conduct and blinding urinalyses were performed solely to aid in the interpretation of the results further studies are necessary to determine whether an urinalysis guided additional p supplement organic or inorganic might improve bone mineral accretion or if an organically bound p supplement individualized or flat is necessary to ensure sufficient bioavailability of p in the presence of generous ca supplementation 8 33newborn infants have similar fodbpd across all gestational ages 16 37but increasing values indicating dolichocephalic deformation were described for older preterm infants 16 37 38 two factors have been considered to affect head shape bone mineral deficiency 16 and positioning 39 apparently extremely mineral deficient bone is too soft to counter the forces of gravity working on the conventionally sideways positioned heads from preliminary data some authors have suggested a protection against myopia of prematurity when bone mineral deficiency and dolichocephalic deformation can be avoided by supplementing with ca and p 17 18 in this study infants were slightly dolichocephalic at study entry in both groups as the fodbpd values were higher 144 ± 011 and 143 ± 009 table 2 than the previously reported 127 ± 0073 sd 16 the fodbpd ratio did not change during the study in either group which may be interpreted as sufficient bone mineralization to prevent further dolichocephalic deformation in most infants alternatively staff in the neonatal unit might have used alternative head positioning as this was not controlled we anticipated measuring the refractions of 68 infants but only 64 were actually measured because of several parents declining the refraction examination during their followup visit however the data shows no trend towards a refraction difference between the study groups which makes it highly unlikely that a significant difference might have been detected with 4 more measurements the incidence of myopia in preterm born infants varies among the publications 40 – 46in this study the incidence of myopia was rather low in comparison to 30–50 years ago when many very low birth weight infants developed myopia and dolichocephalic modification of their head shape 1 – 6 most infants in this study were normopic or slightly hyperopic at followup which is normal for this age group astigmatism was predominantly with the rule which is also physiologic but different from a preterm population published previously 41 furthermore the study groups did not differ in their refraction results according to our hypothesis refraction errors are increased in the presence of head deformities as ca and p supply appeared to be sufficient in either group to prevent bone demineralization and skull deformities there were no skull deformities which could cause refraction errors the fodbpd values of the 4 myopic infants at followup were between 125 and 138 showing an even less dolichocephalic head shape than the mean of the study group therefore the myopia in these infants cannot be attributed to the head shape and since it was so rare not even to prematurity in general bmc values increased with body weight and therefore with postnatal age 24 47 – 53but varied with the demographics of the studied infants a similar dxa setup as ours has been successfully used in gambian newborns 52 resulting in the expected bmc values for the gambian population in our study total body bmc results were slightly higher than in a recent report on term infants measured with a different equipment while femur bmc values were lower 51 but all within the published range furthermore our values were highly correlated to body weight as expected differences in instrument calibration and image processing may play a part but do not invalidate our conclusion that there was no difference in bmc between our study groups overall the constant head shapes and the absence of any fractures indicate that bone mineralization was at least sufficient to prevent these side effects although this finding has to be interpreted with caution because fractures were not systematically sought infants in both treated and control groups received at least 15fold more ca and p than recommended by the european society of paediatric gastroenterology hepatology and nutrition espghan committee on nutrition 3–35 mmol ca and 19–29 mmol p per kg per day 36 the compositions of modern standard preterm infant formulas and human milk fortifiers appear to exceed these recommendations already whether the lower amounts recommended by the espghan committee also support bone mineralization sufficiently to prevent dolichocephalic head deformation cannot be determined from our data no difference in the incidence of complications between the study groups most notably renal and gastrointestinal complications were seen in this study as well as in previous studies of ca and p supplementation 9 54 intestinal obstruction ca soap bezoars the milk curd syndrome 55 56 or renal function impairment were not observed thus ca supplementation appeared to be safe furthermore feeding tolerance was similar in both study groups and thus not influenced by the supplement feeding intolerance was frequent in our study group which is common in the enrolled patients 9 10 and cannot be excluded experimentally in a clinical trial it is very common to withdraw feeds quickly for any abdominal symptoms in order to prevent nec feeding intolerance affected patients equally independent of the randomization in this randomized trial of extra enteral ca supplementation in elbw infants weight gain was within the reported range for preterm infants 57 58 furthermore sufficient bone mineralization was achieved with both standard feeds and ca supplemented feeds to prevent severe dolichocephalic deformation therefore our hypothesis that dolichocephalic deformation is associated with myopia and against the rule astigmatism cannot be proven or ruled out furthermore the incidences of myopia and against the rule astigmatisms were reassuringly low and not different from the normal population 36 in the infants receiving extra ca supplements urinary excretion of p was reduced indicating that bioavailability of p had deteriorated and p had become the limiting mineral of bone mineral formation we suggest that future recommendations regarding the composition of formulas for preterm infants may account for the chemical nature of p compounds and their bioavailability in the presence of ca if a calcium phosphate precipitation was indeed the reason for the decreased p supply in ca supplemented infants formulas containing inorganic p as used is this study cannot be further improved by adding extra ca go to acknowledgments the authors wish

infants matches fetal growth 7 optimal ca and p accretion were predicted using the largest available study of fetal weight gain including 563480 singletons 23 and fetal whole body analyses 59 – 62 indicating a ca content increasing by 0203 mmolg and a p content increasing by 0152 mmolg fetal body weight fetuses under 1000g gained 20–24 gkgday 23 which translated into a ca retention of 41–48 mmolkgd and a p retention of 31–36 mmolkgd fetuses and infants above 1000 g gained 16–19 gkgd 23 which translated into a ca retention of 32–38 mmolkgd and a p retention of 24–28 mmolkgd under optimal conditions any ca and p supply short of these amounts may lead to mineral deficient bone standard feeding mixtures at the university of alabama at birmingham were breast milk with enfamil human milk fortifier 1pk25 ml containing approximately 35 mmol ca and 25 mmol p partly inorganic per 100 ml and similac special care 24 containing 36 mmol ca and 26 mmol p as potassium phosphate per 100ml therefore fortified human milk contained almost the same amounts of ca and p as similac special care 24 thus eliminating the need for separate ca supplementation schemes below 1000g actual weight considering a daily accretion of 45 mmolkg ca and 32 mmolkg p and bioavailabilities for ca and p of 50 and 80 respectively 7 20 enteral daily intakes of 9 mmolkg ca and 4 mmolkg p were desired to achieve this with 150 mlkg enteral feedings the feeding mixture had to contain 6 mmol ca and 26 mmol p per 100 ml therefore feedings for supplemented infants below 1000 g actual weight were supplemented with additional 26 mmol ca per 100 ml the p demand was already met by the standard feeding mixtures the molar ratio of cap was 23 above 1000g actual weight considering a daily accretion of 36 mmolkg ca and 27 mmolkg p and bioavailabilities for ca and p of 50 and 80 respectively 7 20 enteral daily intakes of 72 mmolkg ca and 34 mmolkg p were desired to achieve this with 150 mlkg enteral feedings the feeding mixture had to contain 48 mmol ca and 23 mmol p per 100 ml therefore feedings for supplemented infants above 1000 g actual weight were supplemented with additional 13 mmol ca per 100 ml the p demand was met by the standard feeding mixtures the molar ratio of cap was 21 go to reference list1 koo ww sherman r succop p et al sequential bone mineral content in small preterm
