share how does botox usually wear off dr irwin february 1 2010i am a first time botox user and i am very pleased with the results i did my forehead october 24 i was wondering if you can tell me what to expect when it wears off in three months do all the wrinkles instantly reappear do i wait for things to go back to normal before getting more i wanted to know what to expect as far as planning my next treatment to maximize the benefits of using botox thank you for your website it has been so insightfulgood question the first time i bring my patients back at 3 months but tell them it will wear off slightly before that then each time it will last a little longer to a point that point depends on your age amount of sun damage genetic facial structure and things like that many patients who are younger come every 56 months in my practice if you are 50 or older you may need treatments 3 or occasionally even 4 times a year the muscles will gradually learn to relax but if you take a long break from botox you have to start again because the muscles will relearn their old habits also the frequency of treatments depends on your goals i like to leave some movement in the face so that it looks natural some patients really donâ€™t want their face to move at all this will require more botox and more frequent visits the wrinkles will reappear fairly suddenly after the first treatment but as time goes on those lines will take longer and longer to return dr ibotox dysport  other relaxers
