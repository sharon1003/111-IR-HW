proanthocyanidins pas have been shown to have potential health benefits however no data exist concerning their dietary intake therefore pas in common and infant foods from the u s were analyzed on the bases of our data and those from the usdas continuing survey of food intakes by individuals csfii of 1994–1996 the mean daily intake of pas in the u s population 2 y old was estimated to be 577 mgperson monomers dimers trimers and those above trimers contribute 71 112 78 and 739 of total pas respectively the major sources of pas in the american diet are apples 320 followed by chocolate 179 and grapes 178 the 2  to 5yold age group 682 mgperson and men 60 y old 708 mgperson consume more pas daily than other groups because they consume more fruit the daily intake of pas for 4 to 6moold and 6 to 10moold infants was estimated to be 13 mg and 269 mg respectively based on the recommendations of the american academy of pediatrics this study supports the concept that pas account for a major fraction of the total flavonoids ingested in western dietscatechin proanthocyanidins tannins foods infant foods topicpulmonary artery stenosis food infant food paminosalicylic acid aminosalicylic sodium ingestion issue section nutrient requirements proanthocyanidins pas 4 better known as condensed tannins are oligomeric and polymeric flavan3ols they are ubiquitous and present as the second most abundant natural phenolic after lignin the flavan3ol units are linked mainly through the c4→c8 bond but the c4→c6 bond also exists both called btype the flavan3ol units can also be doubly linked by an additional ether bond between c2→o7 atype the size of pa molecules can be described by their degree of polymerization dp  1  three common flavan3ols which differ in their hydroxylation patterns are found in pas the pas consisting exclusively of epicatechin are procyanidins pcs pas containing epiafzelechin or epi gallocatechin as subunits are named propelargonidins pps or prodelphinidins pds respectively pps and pds are less common in nature than pcs they are heterogeneous in their constituent units and coexist with the pcs  1  pas are of great interest in nutrition and medicine because of their potent antioxidant capacity and possible protective effects on human health  2  pas have been suggested to account for a significant fraction of polyphenols ingested in a western diet because of their ubiquitous existence  2  there have been many studies concerning the content of flavonoids in foods and their daily intake  3 – 7  however no data exist concerning the daily intake of oligomeric and polymeric flavan3ols because data are lacking on the pa content of foods in particular only recently has an appropriate analytical method been developed for the measurement of pas  8 9  the objective of the present study was to quantitatively analyze pas in both common and infant foods and evaluate their daily intake in the u s population on the basis of food consumption survey data this study will establish a pa food database under the usda national food and nutrition analysis program materials and methodsstandards a composite pc oligomer standard containing monomers through decamers was purified from cocoa a polymer pc fraction with a mean dp of 361 was purified from blueberries and used as a polymer standard  9  food samples foods were sampled from four areas of the united states in two seasons the samples were colleted and processed in the department of biochemistry of virginia technical university blacksburg va sorghum samples were provided by dr lloyd rooney texas am college station tx samples were shipped frozen on dry ice and kept at −70°c before use the fruits and vegetables were received in the form of freezedried powders the final data were converted to a fresh weight basis using the moisture content of the foods nuts cerealsbeans snacks and spices were ground without freezedrying beverages were analyzed in their original liquid form commercial infant foods were purchased from local grocery stores and were freezedried before analysis the concentration data are based on the original wet weight foods were extracted and purified according to a published method  9 10  all samples were analyzed in duplicate hplcmsms analyses analysis and quantification methods were described  9 10  catechin glycoside and epicatechin glycoside which were detected in some foods were quantified as monomers the quantification limits signaltonoise ratio  10 of our method ranged from 0076 to 0191 ng injection on column for the individual oligomers and the polymers the relative sd of the quantification was 42 for total pas and 79 ± 34 for individual oligomers in a control blueberry sample  n  38 estimation of pa intakes the daily intake of pas was estimated using data from the usdas continuing survey of food intakes by individuals csfii of 1994 – 1996 mean quantities of common foods consumed per person per day  11  the mean daily intake of pas by infants was estimated on the basis of the recommendations of the american academy of pediatrics  12  which were detailed as feeding guidelines by pediatricians for convenient use by parents  13  resultsthe concentrations of pas in 41 kinds of foods are listed in table 1 all cultivars of apples and the sauce and juice derived directly from them are considered to be one kind grapes and wine are considered to be different kinds of food there are also 57 foods containing no detectable pas see supplemental data 5 fruits were found to be the major source of pas in the diet in general vegetables are not an important source of pas of the 19 different vegetables tested pas were detected only in indian squash minor cereals such as sorghum and barley contain pas whereas they are not detected in the staple crops such as corn rice and wheat wine beer and some commonly consumed fruit juices are good sources of pas whereas coffee is not table 1concentration of pas in common foods 1 2no food

linkages or gallic acid esters in addition to the pcs pps and pds were detected as minor components in various foods pacontaining ingredients have been used in complementary infant foods pa concentrations in commercial infant foods were also determined see supplemental data 5 because the consumption survey for complementary infant foods is not available the mean intake of pas by infants was estimated on the basis of the recommendations of the american academy of pediatrics  12  the estimations were also based on the results of our survey which indicates that 25 of infant cereals 90 of infant juices and 85 of fruitbased infant foods contain pas according to the feeding guidelines  13  complementary infant feeding starts with infant cereals and juice for infants 4 – 6 mo of age with a recommended median serving amount of 125 gd or 90 m ld infant foods based on fruits are introduced after 6 mo the recommended median serving amounts are 35 g of cereal 125 m l of juice and 100 g of cookedmashed fruits per day assuming that there is no preference in the selection of the foods the daily intake of pas was estimated to be 13 mgd for infants 4–6 mo old and 269 mgd for infants 6

cocoa or blueberry which contain catechin and –epicatechin as constituent units were used as standards to quantify pas in all foods a majority of the foods in table 1 contain pcs as exclusive components such as cocoa and blueberries no biases in pa concentration due to the standards used are expected in these cases however pas other than the homogeneous btype pcs have been found in various foods it was shown that pas containing epicatechin gallic acid ester or epigallocatechin as subunits had a lower fluorescent response compared with the pcs isolated from cocoa  8  nevertheless the biases on total pa contents should not be significant because epicatechin was found to be the predominant constituent unit in most foods containing pas other than pcs  10  pas in foods cover a wide range of dp values we presented the concentrations of monomers dimers and trimers separately because recent studies suggested that these lowmolecularweight pa oligomers dp ≤ 3 could be absorbed intact in the gastrointestinal tract déprez et al  14 demonstrated that catechin and pa dimers and trimers were permeable through the caco2 human intestinal cell line the permeability of a pa polymer with a mean dp of 6 was ∼10 times lower suggesting that pa dimers and trimers could be absorbed in vivo and that polymers could not absorption of the dimers was confirmed by detection of pc b5 in human blood after the subjects consumed pcrich chocolate  15  we presented the concentration of all pas with dp  3 collectively in 3 groups because similarities in their absorption mode have been postulated unlike the lower oligomers pas with dp  3 appear not to be absorbed directly from the gastrointestinal lumen  14 but are thought to depolymerize into mixtures of epicatechin monomer and dimers in the acidic environment of the stomach the resultant monomers and dimers were absorbed in the small intestine  16  our observation in pigs showed that depolymerization of ingested polymers dp  10 was not significant in the stomach 4 h after eating gu and prior unpublished data it was suggested that the majority of pas transit into the small intestine intact  17 and are degraded mainly by colonic microflora in the cecum and large intestine déprez et al  18 reported that incubation of polymeric pcs with human colonic microflora in vitro in anoxic conditions completely degraded the pcs after 48 h the degradation products included phenylacetic phenylpropionic and phenylvaleric acids these phenolic acids have been suggested to be the major metabolites of oligomeric and polymeric pas in healthy humans  19  epidemiologic studies suggested an association between ingestion of polyphenols especially flavonoids and the prevention of diseases many authors have estimated the daily intake of flavonoids based on food composition and consumption survey data estimated data from several countries are largely consistent the overall flavonoid flavonols and flavones intake in a population of women in the united states was estimated recently to be 246 ± 185 mgd with quercetin as the major contributor 702  4  the mean intake of flavonoid including flavonols flavones and flavanones was estimated to be 242 ± 267 286 ± 123 and 259 mgd in the populations of finland denmark and the netherlands respectively  5 – 7  however these authors did not include monomeric oligomeric and polymeric flavan3ols in their estimation apples have been identified as a major dietary source of flavonoids in epidemiologic studies the concentration of flavonoids other than pas in fresh apples was determined to be 53 mg100 g  3  the concentrations of pas in various cultivars of apples were determined in our study to be in a range of 696–1410 mg100 g thus the total flavonoid content in apples used in previous studies was significantly lower than the actual value a similar situation may exist for other foods that contain pas as a result underestimation of the total flavonoid intakes could be enormous flavan3ol monomers are considered to be different from pas by definition their ingestion was studied previously tea is known as a major source of flavan3ol monomers and oxidative derivatives but not an important source of pas because few pas have been detected in green leaves  20 21  arts et al  22 estimated that the mean intake of flavan3ol monomers in the netherlands was 50 mgd with tea as the major contributor 652–873 followed by chocolate and apple he also pointed out that the mean daily intake of flavan3ol monomers in the united states should be lower than that in denmark the daily intakes of flavan3ol monomers from tea were estimated to be in the range of 127–342 mgperson for adults in the united states based on the data of lakenbrink et al  20  the total daily intake of flavan3ol monomers is estimated to be 171–386 mgperson for adults in the united states after flavan3ols from other foods  table 1 are included the mean daily intake of oligomeric and polymeric pas 536 mgperson table 2 is higher than that of monomeric flavan3ols and is twice as high as the combined overall intake of other flavonoids which include flavonols flavones and flavanones based on these discussions we conclude that pas are the major flavonoids ingested in western diets complementary infant foods are necessary to meet increasing nutritional needs and for weaning the mean daily intake of pas for infants 6–10 mo old is estimated to be 31 mgkg body weight which is four times higher than the mean daily intake in adults of 20 y old 077 mgkg body weight information concerning the influence of such high intake of pas or other phytochemicals on the health and growth of infants is scarce increasing evidence suggests that exposure to these nutrients in early infancy may have longterm effects in later life  23  in conclusion this study demonstrates that many foods contain substantial amounts of pas pas in these foods are different in terms of concentration distribution of oligomers and polymers constituent flavan3ol units and interflavan linkages pas account for a major fraction of the total flavonoids ingested in western diets pas should be taken into account when studying the epidemiologic association between flavonoid intake and chronic diseases this study provided the first opportunity to examine this association literature cited1 porter l j
