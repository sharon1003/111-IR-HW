choosing the best fingerprint powder for your scene written by allen miller the goto tool of all crime scene investigators besides their keen sense of awareness is fingerprint powder historically fingerprint powder has been used to assist latent print examiners crime scene technicians and analysts in the detection and collection of latent prints left behind at crime scenes in the beginning powders were often handmade by latent print examiners or police crime scene technicians commercially available powders began to hit the market in the 1900s and are now available in a variety of colors and material configurations specifically manufactured for various investigative needs advertisement commonly known as “dusting” the act of applying fingerprint powder to a surface with a natural hair or fiber brush allows the powder to be lightly spread over a surface to make the print visible with so many different color and material configurations it is important to understand the features and benefits of each type of fingerprint powder color selection black is by far the most commonly used latent print powder color black powder is manufactured from a variety of carbonbased powders with a binder added for stability this carbonbased powder readily adheres to the oily residues generated by contact from fingers and other body parts black powders are easy to apply to many surface types porous and nonporous alike because of its versatility black powder is the workhorse of latent print processing before these powders advanced through further scientific development there were few other colors available black and aluminum were both powders of choice but black was by far the most popular regardless of the surface type or color black powder was spread and prints were developed examiners would then use a very bright light source to visualize the prints especially on darker colors that lacked contrast the developed prints were of exceptional quality the only problem was that they simply could not be readily seen the convention today is to use a powder color that provides a visual contrast to the surface being processed dark surface  light powder and light surface  dark powder rather than using black powder for everything other colors white silvergreyaluminum or bichromatic can be used to process almost any surface that may be encountered white powder works especially well on glass chromed metals plastic bags and darkcolored surfaces aluminum powder performs best on glass plastic and rubber bichromatic powder on the other hand is typically a combination of black and aluminum powder although some manufacturers combine the black with a variety of other colors the idea behind the creation of the bichromatic powder was to assist the examiner with multicolored surfaces when processing with bichromatic powder developed latent prints will be seen as black ridges on the light parts of the surface and light ridges on the dark parts of the surface once these prints are lifted they will always visualize as dark ridges on a white backing card material selection in addition to the color of the powder the physical composition of the powder also varies depending on the examiner’s needs powders can be characterized as conventional colorant and base magnetic colorant and iron shavings and fluorescent lightstimulated colorant and base conventional powders are the most common type of powders used in crime scenes and are typically applied with a fiber or hair brush they are generally inexpensive cover a large area when applied with a brush and readily develop prints on most nonporous surfaces the main concern with conventional powders is that they can create a mess black powders are generally very light and airy so the particulate can become airborne at the slightest flick of the brush conventional powders are not designed to work on porous surfaces like paper but are used in the field nonetheless fingerprint residues left behind on paper are best treated with a specialized chemical process the time it takes to process a print on a porous surface from the time of the print deposition allows some of the moisture to evaporate so dry powder processing may not produce optimal results magnetic powders are designed to work on both porous surfaces and nonporous surfaces including plastics styrofoam and rubber technicians using magnetic powders develop latent prints without the need of a brush a magnet embedded inside a plastic or nonferrous metal wand attracts the magnetic filings and creates a clump or ball of powder wrapped around each of the iron filings is the colorant the iron filings then “rub” over the surface depositing the colorant where it comes into contact with the oily residues this process develops the image with little or no abrasive contact with the residues unlike using fiber or hair brushes magnetic wands can be used in many situations however upsidedown processing does pose a unique problem the magnet does a fine job of managing the powder when the wand is held in a normal magnetdown position but loses its effectiveness when used upside down magnetic powder is easy to clean as a surface is processed small bits of the iron filings will dislodge from the wand and remain on a horizontal surface to clean up these bits simply pass the wand over the filings to collect for reuse or deposit them back into the jar it is important to remember that as the filings are returned to the jar and reused over time the associated colorant will eventually diminish leaving only iron filings in the jar fluorescent powders were developed to use with a variety of alternate light sources ranging from small 1watt ultraviolet lights to multiwatt lasers these powders work especially well on raw surfaces where normal conventional powders may paint or clog the surfaces and render prints that are not distinguishable from the surface household woodwork convenience store counter surfaces and multicolored nonporous items respond particularly well to processing with fluorescent powders the colorants found in fluorescent powders are treated dyes that react to ultraviolet uv and purpleblue bands in the visible light spectrum typical for crime scene work the hues of the powders can be matched to the color of the surfaces being processed and the wavelength of the light source being used this coupling helps flatten or eliminate any background interference that may occur from surface coloration or contaminants fluorescent powders are best applied with a feather duster the minute barbules soft parts of the feather are perfect for holding just the right amount of fluorescent powder to develop the print without overprocessing the background when using fluorescent powders less is better as overprocessing cannot be easily corrected it is not recommended that fiberglass or hair brushes be used as they will deliver too much powder to the surface and the visual overload may result in the loss of any detail or detection fluorescent powders are also not recommended for largearea processing if only for the overprocessing reasons stated earlier a few years ago spray powder hit the market spray powders deliver a very localized and controlled application of powder the idea behind this product evolution was to give the technician a specialized tool to allow for spot processing on certain surfaces it was not intended to replace conventional powders and brushes already available the measured portion of powder delivered by a short blast from the can provides enough powder to allow the prints to develop without overprocessing the background or the prints themselves the spray powder is contained utilizing a containment tent to keep the powder in a constricted space so it will not broadcast over the area being processed this allows for relatively clean processing of crime scenes that minimize both property damage and possible respiratory irritation from exposure to powder introducing nanoengineered particles the latest addition to the latent fingerprint powder market is the introduction of nanoengineered particles to the powder blend nanotechnology derived particles are extremely fine silica balls designed to hold the colorant and to provide a better processing medium technicians can expect to experience up to 30 percent improved latent print definition with the use of the nanoparticle infused powders the manufacturer of these nanoengineered particles calls them supranano particles to distinguish them from true nanoparticle mixtures that can permeate the skin and create health risks supranano particles are larger in size and do not have the ability to permeate the skin these infused powders come in conventional magnetic and fluorescent powder configurations they are also available as suspensions suprananoprocessed prints can be quickly analyzed with laser instrumentation malditof to obtain demographic information from the person depositing the print demographic characteristics identified through this revolutionary process include drug use both overthecounter and illicit types contact residuals including explosives race and ethnicity these characteristics can be used as investigative information to help eliminate or implicate suspects in criminal cases over time manufacturers expect to extract even more detailed information from latent prints to assist investigators in solving ever more complex crimes even with advances in fingerprint technology and analytical tools fingerprint powders remain a critical tool in every crime scene and latent print examiner’s kit black powder is the original and popular powder of choice but many other colors and types of powders are available for technicians to
