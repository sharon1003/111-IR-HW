jake weatherby is carbonate flammable carbonates are generally not flammable jake weatherby is carbon dioxide flammable no carbon dioxide is a product of combustion in it the carbon is fully oxidized deweerd 32 contributions is carbon a flammable element on the periodic table all i know is that carbon graphite is flammable if you get hit hot enough it will catch on fire beaker119 1656 contributions is carbon graphite flammable yes it will burn if you get it hot enough des dichado 212010 contributions chemist for uranium nuclear fuels flammable range of carbon monoxide the explosive range of carbon monoxide is 1275 0c flammability is a materials ability to burn in the presence of carbon dioxide in the presence of oxygen not carbon dioxide3u8rbba98edy2 92787 contributions is carbon monoxide gas flammable yes it is categorised as highly flammable it can even be used to fuel an engine jay98 377 contributions is flammability a materials ability to burn in the presence of carbon dioxide no flammability is a materials ability to burn in the presence of oxygen jake weatherby is carbon flammable or inflammableflammable and inflammable mean the same thing in which case carbon is both demonwolf2 355 contributions is carbon the element flammable carbon graphite is flammable if you get hit hot enough it will catch on fire does the flammability of a hydrocarbon change as its carbon chain length yes it does as the carbon chain length increases its flammability decreases this is because as the carbon chain length increases the state changes from gas to liquid to so â€¦snafu 1960 2632 contributions is carbon flammable without oxygen no oxygen is required for carbon to oxidize
