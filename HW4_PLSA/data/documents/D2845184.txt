featured glenn ford was lynched by america’s racist criminal injustice system michael coard oct 23 2015 1glenn ford’s case is nothing special and at the same time is very special it’s nothing special because it involves the same old story of racism in america’s legal system it’s also very special because it involves racism so egregious that even the white legal system has conceded it in fact prosecutor marty stroud who handled the case 30 years ago recently apologized by saying that he was “sorry and that mr ford should never have been arrested” an appellate court judge recently wrote “glenn ford was neither present at nor a participant in … the murder” shortly thereafter mr ford was exonerated here are the gory details of this reallife horror story in 1983 the 34yearold mr ford from shreveport la was framed by a white detective for the murder of a white man in 1984 he was prosecuted by a white assistant district attorney and found guilty by an allwhite jury in 1988 he was sentenced by a white judge to death in the electric chair oh by the way there was no physical evidence connecting him to the crime no murder weapon was ever found and another man confessed despite that mr ford spent 30 years on death row in a 5 x 7foot cell for 23 of 24 hours every single day in the notorious louisiana state prison better known as angola you might wonder how louisiana state prison became angola the answer is racism the land on which the prison now stands used to be a slave plantation it was owned by isaac franklin a partner in a slave trading company that was the largest in the u s from 18281837 his firm separated more black families than any other slavetrading firm in american history and most of the enslaved human beings on his plantation had been kidnapped from the country of angola in southwest africa — hence the name “angola prison” that land went from being a plantation to becoming a stateowned prison when isaac franklin’s widow sold it to samuel james who began leasing the black men women and children to the county jail to do forced labor the state officially took over in 1901 creating louisiana state prison aka “angola”while exposed to pollutants and inhumane medical attention in the decrepit angola prison for 30 years mr ford contracted lung cancer he died in poverty in a hospice a little over a year after being released from angola in march 2014 the judicial lynching of mr ford in caddo parish was not an aberration in louisiana from 20102014 the caddo parish da’s office put more blacks per capita on death row than any da’s office in the country and despite the fact that africanamericans constitute about half of the parish’s population they are routinely stricken from juries by das which explains why nearly 80 percent of the persons sentenced to death are black despite having been compelled to release mr ford louisiana refused to pay him the statemandated 11000 per year for 30 years of unjust incarceration equaling a total of 330000 in fact the former acting da dale cox said the payment was denied because mr ford “didn’t prove himself innocent” he said that even though the law doesn’t require any defendants to ever prove themselves innocent but requires the state to always prove all defendants guilty it should be mentioned that after denying mr ford the 330000 louisiana gave him a 20 gift card to live on yes a 20 gift card and cox said mr ford should be “thankful” because he “wasn’t executed” he actually said that i better stop right here because i’m about to start cursing uncontrollably mr ford’s nightmare is nothing special if we ignore it and simply go on with our lives as if this innocent black man’s life didn’t matter although i appreciate the more than 11000 “likes” and the more than 5000 “comments” on my facebook post regarding this horrible injustice we gotta be more than social media revolutionaries we gotta be activist soldiers we gotta fight back by being what james baldwin called “angry black men and women” when he said “to be black and conscious in america is to be in a constant state of rage” therefore we gotta yell and scream in righteous indignation and we gotta do this by enlightening organizing calling petitioning and especially boycotting the enlightening began with this article the organizing happens when you spread the word and come together on this issue the calling commences right now when you contact the caddo parish courthouse at 318 2266826 and ask current da charles scott these two questions1 will you support the awarding of the 330000 to the family

been unjustly arrested prosecuted and sentenced if you will not why not after you call the da please contact avenging the ancestors coalition atac at 215 5528751 or at atacavengingtheancestorscom and let us know the response the boycotting will take more time to set up we’ll need to build a national coalition of all types of black groups and individuals regardless of their politics religion or other superficial distinctions our goal is to make sure no blacks spend a dime in louisiana for one specified month or longer if you’re interested in helping to build such a boycott coalition contact
