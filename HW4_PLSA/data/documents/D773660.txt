veiled chameleon cost discussion in  general discussion  started by axotik reptiles aug 5 2012  page 1 of 21 2 next axotik reptiles new member hey guys im currently looking into getting my first veiled chameleon i have done a lot of research and it seems like everyone has a different price i was just wondering what did you guys spend or how much you think im going to have to spend my research has shown anywhere from 200400 including the chameleon and all the accessories i dont want to go over 250300 also veiled chameleon seemed like to best to start off with but if you guys have a different suggestion feel free to tell me not panther chameleons though they are to expensive1axotik reptiles aug 5 2012creaturelover123new member i cannot anwser the cost question never had a veiled but you are correct they are the best to start with panther and veileds are pretty much the same care wise 2creaturelover123 aug 5 2012view our sponsors kate established member i would advise getting

unnessary items either4kokom05lb aug 5 2012axotik reptiles new memberkokom05lb said ↑ buy all your supplies first dont let the pet store people bully you into buying unnessary items either i was hoping to buy everything at once also the local petsmart here is very different from most the people there actually take great care of the reptiles and will only sell there chameleons and other advanced lizards to people who can prove they are good owners they also talk you into getting cheeper things that do the same thing as the bigger branded items but all they have now for chameleons is baby nosy be panthers starting at 249 thats almost my limit for just the chameleon5axotik reptiles aug 5 2012 last edited aug 5 2012angie lavid member weve spent about £800 to date enclosures lights plants and the cham of course plus all the food and supplements and you need to have spare cash in case you need to go to the vet6angie l aug 5 2012lathelia established member axotik reptiles said ↑i

temps and humidity for a few days you can also post a pic of your enclouse here and ask if it looks ok thats my opinion and i think its best for your future cham they are very sensitive creatures7lathelia aug 5 2012swayne8998established member if you want the proper set up it will cost you anywhere from 600900 including the chameleon i bought my guy at one year and he was 150 you can get babies online from anywhere to 4070 pet stores will rip you off and dont care properly for their animalslook for a breeder or a reliable reptile store8swayne8998 aug 5 2012oldskoolmodder new

temperature first i had to buy a smaller wattage bulb because the first one temped in the 90s for my baby panther with the heat gun thats a bit to hot for a baby and as stated above they are sensitive creatures it shouldnt take but a few days to figure out the right setup and temps your new little chameleon will appreciate it as well make sure to mist a lot somewhere on here a member named jannb posted a new keepers blog on veileds well have to find it for ya9oldskoolmodder aug 5 2012swayne8998established member yes i was in preparation with my cage for at least a month calibrate your hygrometers and thermometers wkyd has a great blog on how to calibrate hygrometers setting up your cage with your cham in it will cause constant stressextreme change to the cage can be very stressful so i will agree doing so will greatly reduce both your cham and your stress through the whole process10swayne8998 aug 5 2012mr scowt new memberwell the cham itself is gonna be 100 so if you go online i got my reptibreeze medium at vetdepotcom for like 60 bucks little things for the inside id run about another 3050 also grabbing real stuff from outside saves money just wash it lastly are your lightsthese can hurt a bit but to put a safe over estimate id say around 8090 which leaves you a bit extra at that point you gotta decide if you want to mist your cage everyday yourself or buy an automatic one or build your own like i did what i did is went to petco and bought a water pump that i could fasten some fittings to out of the aqaurium section then home depot and got a couple fittings and some tube cost me all in all costed me about 40 bucks with the outlet timer from walmart also you may wanna get a second timer for your lights for convenience hope i explained enough again like they all said get your setup before you get the chameleon just makes the whole process smooth for you and himher11mr scowt aug 5 2012chamlo member i dont believe that petsmart actually can care for reptiles do they still display them in small tanks are the temps over 100 in the tanks just wanted to know cause their corporation kinda sucks if you answered yes to the questions above dont buy from them you might not be able to see the temp gauge but if their in a small tank its proof enough and petsmart with panther chams that scares me lol i was in my local petsmart the other day and the was a 2 month old veiled cham with mbd and was black in color that place makes me sad be careful with petsmart or petco12chamlo aug 5 2012chscrusader new member axotik reptiles said ↑hey guys im

another reptile from petco ever again they dont know how to keep them healthy and properly care for them i went to petco and they had 3 baby veiled chameleons i purchased one male i went to go get some worms at petco later that same week and i saw whee the chams were at and it was empty the worker said they died so i recommend to avoid problems purchase from a breeder or at httpwwwtheveiledchameleoncompageid118513chscrusader aug 5 2012axotik reptiles new member thanks for all the help guys i think what im going to do is build my own cage it will cost a lot less and i will have fun doing so i will build it around l3 w3 h56 so there is plenty of room maybe add a small border at the bottom while he is young so the cage isnt too big also i live around an hour for any pet store so i cant drop by every day and the petsmart where i live is unlike any others they have the baby chameleon in a mediumsmall sized screen cage with proper heathumidity there is only one petsmart in the province i live in and they are amazing they make sure you are going to take care of your animal before they sell it to you unlike pets unlimited they dont care for anything i wanted to ask as well if meal worms is a good diet for a chameleon with a variety of other insects it is really difficult to keep crickets alive and its and hour drive to get more mealwaxsuper worms is what i feed my other reptiles with crickets and wax worms as treat once in a while they also dont sell roaches where i live also i heard chameleons could eat veggies and like to nibble on live plants in there cage i was wondering what kind of veggies are safe to feed and what kind of plants are safe to have in the cage thanks for all the info guys appreciate it14axotik reptiles aug 5 2012chscrusader

like 2700 small mealworms for my cham and then it gets 2 crickets a day i hear you i live far away from a pet store too i live way out in the mountains city is about 40 minutes awayand im not going to buy 1000 crickets online and then pay like 30 for the shipping lol i just feed it worms mostly15chscrusader aug 5 2012camimom new member mealworms should not be fed in place of crickets an roaches no one bug should make u p more than 40 of a chams diet also mealworms have a hard exo skeleton that when consumed in excess could potentially cause imapaction by providing as many bug types as possible you can also provide many different nutrients that each bug type possess16camimom aug 5 2012chscrusader new membercamimom said ↑mealworms should not be fed in place of crickets an roaches no one bug

a roach gross   this is what i would do if i were you to start with go to amazon or e bay seriously i wish i would have started here instead of the tons of money i spent at the chain stores they sell you crap you dont need and honestly care about money money money next buy your chameleon from an actual breeder find which one you prefer and go for it a lot of places have fantastic chameleons and i guarantee you will find what you are looking for last if there is a reptile expo near you soon wait and get supplies there there are hundreds of fantastic deals there and more often than not you can meet the breeder of the chameleon you are buying and explain everything to you in person to help younot to mention from what i hear most breeders will help you weeks after buyin and will follow up on problems you have18isa my veiled aug 5 2012sandrachameleon chameleon enthusiast axotik reptiles said ↑hey guys im currently looking into getting my first veiled chameleon i have done a lot of research

member like its been said before buy the enclosure first once you have everything set up with branches trees leafs lamps supplements etc start searching for a chameleon amazon e bay and craigslist are good places to look for all of this stuff you can find it way cheaper than your local reptile store i recommend you look on your local craigslist you can find a good deal but make sure the chameleon is healthy and whatnot theres always the guy that wants to rip you off if you have any qs come here theres a lot of people that can and will help you20fabrizio hc aug 6 2012 you must log in or sign up
