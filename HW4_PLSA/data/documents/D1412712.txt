over the 11 year run of the mash television series a great number of actresses have played side or background roles as nurses some of these actresses have appeared only once while others have appeared enough times to be identified by viewers as regular members of the recurring cast very often they have gone uncredited or are not given character names being credited simply as nurse but in almost every case they take great pride in having been part of one of the greatest shows in the history of television this page documents and celebrates the many nurse characters in mash who because they have no name do not have a page of their own contents  showjeanne schulherr edit in season 3 o r jeanne schulherr plays an unnamed anesthetist who is assisting hawkeye with his patient part way through the operation she interjects to warn hawkeye that there is no pulse hawkeye attempts to revive the patient with chest compressions and finally the desparate measure of open heart massage while tension mounts in the rest of the o r all the while jeannes character calmly ventilates the patient and reports on pulse and blood pressure until she finally announces 92 over 60 a near normal blood pressure this breaks the tension in the o r as everyone realizes the patient has pulled through jeanne schulherr is probably better known as the actress who plays the role of franks wife louise burns as seen in a home movie of their wedding during the season 3 episode there is nothing like a nursejeanne schulherr as anesthetist gives the dreaded announcement no pulse nancy steen edit in season 6 the smell of music nancy steen is credited simply as nurse this is a little strange as her character has a larger role in the plot and has more lines than another nurse who is credited with the name nurse denver played by lois foraker  steens character first shows up outside the o r where hawkeye tries to hit on her for a date she turns him down because he is a bit aromatic he has not showered for days in order to protest against winchesters playing of the french horn later in the o r when potter urges hawkeye and b j to take a shower steen says hear hear hawkeye continues to hit on her across the operating table he suggests they stand at ten paces and talk dirty but she rejects the idea later steens character on post op duty is reprimanded by potter because the suicidal patient saunders had managed to steal and swallow a whole bottle of sleeping pills when she stepped into the supply room for a minute after the patient is revived potter leaves her strict instructions that a 24 hour watch is to be maintained on saunders and he must not to be left alone at any time steens character turns down the advances of the aromatic hawkeye potter leaves strict instructions for a close watch to be maintained on the suicidal patient saunders patricia stevens edit in season 7 major ego it is the turn of veteran recurring cast member patricia stevens to be given a generic credit as an unnamed duty nurse this would also be her final credited appearance in the entire series in earlier seasons she had already played multiple characters such as lieutenant mitchell lieutenant stevens lieutenant brown as well as one of the many ables just before this unnamed credit she had already served four stints as the generic nurse baker from late season 5 to season 6 however it is probably incorrect to group this unnamed duty nurse as a continuation of her string of bakers because from the beginning of season 7 jan jorden had taken over as the regular player of the baker character during the major ego hawkeye is on his rounds in post op when he notices that there is too much blood in the chest drainage tube of one of winchesters patients he asks stevens about it and she confirms that the tube had been bloody from the time she came on post op duty three hours before a few hours later hawkeye visits again and continues to be worried not only is the drainage still bloody but now according to stevens the patients pulse is 110 hawkeye decides that the patient has blown a gasket and instructs stevens to prepare the patient for surgery patricia stevens last credited appearance on mash as an unnamed duty nurse in post op phyllis katz edit phyliis katz made a total of 4 credited appearances on mash but only in one episode season 5 hawkeye get your gun would she be credited as one of the many ables in season 6 whats up doc she is credited simply as nurse and plays a bit role helping to gown hawkeye in the o r in season 7 major ego she is credited as triage nurse and is shown running alongside a jeep assisting b j with the triage of a patient on a stretcher on the hood part way through she sneezes probably due to the dust was this scripted katz would have a more substantial role in season 7 inga this time she is on post op duty when a patient she is with starts to choke she calls to winchester who is showing the swedish dr inga halvorsen around the ward winchester wants an emergency tray to do a tracheotomy but inga recognizing that this is a case of severe allergic reaction to penicillin calls for an adrenaline injection which is far less in intrusive somewhat to winchesters annoyance katz responds to ingas instructions first and then wincheters inga is proved correct winchester mutters his gratitude and then leaves afterwards he complains to hawkeye and b j and that underhanded little nurse  naturally they stick together  anything to undermine the authority of a man katz gowns hawkeye in the o r he invites her to his digs in baker street for seductive reasoning sorry sherlock you cant win them all she replies katz assisting b j with triage on the move photo shows her about to sneezewas this scripted katz right assists inga and winchester with a patient who starts choking naturally they stick together says winchester of the way katz chooses to defer to inga rather than him pamela coleman edit in season 9 bless you hawkeye pamela coleman has this very brief part in the opening triage scene where she says yes doctor to b j s instructions she is credited simply as nurse strange that they thought it necessary to introduce a new actor for this bit role nurse shari  shari saba who by this time is quite a regular recurring character appears uncredited in the final scene in the officers club she could also have been used in the triage scene instead of coleman actually this is colemans only acting credit in imdb perhaps this was an instance of giving a part to some member of the production or technical crew as a kind of reward pamela coleman as an unnamed nurse here with hawkeye and b j during a night outdoor triage scene this article is a stub you can help monster mash by expanding it categories stub
