great but game of thrones risk just adds so much more to just the roll the dice and invade the addition of character cards and maester cards just adds a whole new level to the tactical advantages you can amassbottom line yes i would recommend this to a friend was this review helpful yes  no you may also flag this review89201650absolutely in love and so funby aprilfrom san antonio tx this game is

ned starkfrom georgia very fun to play its our new favorite version of risk only con is the quality of the cards the ink rubs off and when you first open the deck the cards are stuck together bottom line yes i would recommend this to a friend was this review helpful yes  no you may also flag this review911201540great but by andy dfrom san francisco caive played this game 10 times with a group of different folks ranging from 4 players to 7 players things i love  this game adds cool new features more below to classic risk as one friend put it its harder for someone to take a commanding lead in this edition and it encourages players to assume they always stand a serious chance at winning  new game mechanics include character cards specific to each house and maester cards similar to development cards from settlers of catan these lead to new strategies  i wont spoil anything suffice it to say that it seems optimal play for different for each house  as a game of thrones fan its super cool to play in westeros and essos if nothing else the board serves as a neat map of the go t world things i dont love  so many parts of this game just feel lopsided often for the sake of squeezing in a few more game of thrones references even the player pieces which include pieces specific to each house are of remarkably different quality  one aspect of the game is the seat of power  a territory unique to each house the starks are set on winterfell as an example however the spacing of these seats of power is determined by game of thrones lore which means that theyre imbalanced for game play if youre playing by the book dont be surprised to see that the same houses win time after time  theres a huge variation in character cards that makes some houses effectively play without them while others will be using theirs each turn  some parts of the game feel unfinished as an example the rule book isnt even consistent on what some special units do one piece will either increase your sixsided defense dies value or allow you to roll an eightsided die on defense depending on what you section you reference  a character card allows you to roll all eightsided die while attacking except the game only shipped with two red attacking eightsided die and yes were smart enough to work around this but frustrating that we have to in a game that cost so much  in general the maester and objective cards arent really balanced for their costdifficulty some things will be incredibly cheap with an incredibly big payoff while others simply dont justify their cost my friends and i love this game really but weve found ourselves trying different house rules to make it more fun and fair for everyone the good news is that this works  some house rules fix major issues weve found the bad news is that weve found that we have to design our own rules for a game that cost nearly a hundred dollars including shipping bottom line yes i would recommend this to a friend was this review helpful yes

but now game of thrones is my favorite tv show ever and this new version blows lotr risk out of the water this is an exciting game that allows you to play a simple version right away and then allows you to add other elements as you learn them it is the most flexible version of risk yet it makes you feel like you are part of the game of thronesbottom line yes i would recommend this to a friend was

cimarron nmi just wish the board and cards were made to last longer then 10 play throughs i take very good care of my games and have never encountered this before i felt it was very sloppily made that being said the game play was refreshing and new compared to standard risk i wish there was another player like the dothraki in essos simply because the ghiscari conquer essos too easily other than that tho this game is a ton of fun to play and i would recommend to a friend bottom line yes i would recommend this to a friend was this review helpful yes  no you may also flag this
