eye tracker reviews pupil labs tobii eye tribe xlabs24 march 2016during my time at the uwaterloo hci lab i’ve had the opportunity to try out 5 different eye trackers and compare them these eye trackers span the price range from free to 10000 and use a variety of different tracking methods these trackers are also not always direct alternatives they are often meant for very different scenarios disclaimer these are the results that i got for myself using these eye trackers eye tracking performance varies wildly between people so it is likely that for some of these trackers i got atypically bad or good performance when my results don’t square with claimed performance or performance i’ve seen in videos i’ll try and note that also i have not done exact degrees accuracy tests on any of these trackers i may however give figures in degrees here’s what i mean when i mean by these whenever i test these out the tracked point or the filtered point if there is jitter is with high probability within a given distance of my real gaze point i then use trigenometry to work out the degree angle corresponding to that distance a handy rule of thumb is that each degree corresponds to about a centimeter of distance at a typical screenhead distance  tan 10 pi18060  104  with that out of the way lets move on to the trackers pupil labs headset my favourite research eye tracker my lab has a pupil labs eye tracking headset with a high speed world camera and 120hz binocular eye cameras it’s well suited for a variety of research and is the only eye tracker with amazing open source software pros good tracking very high precision ie low jitter and fairly high accuracy immediately after calibration 15 degreesallows free head motion because the eye tracker is fixed to your head robustly tracks markers in order to map gaze onto surfaces like screens the open source software is amazing really good interface easy to use tons of features and unlike every other eye tracker you can add any features you need yourself you don’t need a computer screen and you can do eye tracking experiments in other environments good price for a research eye tracker on the order of 1000 especially with academic discount tolerates other ir devices since the tracking doesn’t use glints you can use other ir lights like an ir head tracker at the same time it is the only eye tracker like this fully cross platform windows osx and linux cons the headset can easily be jostled if you move your head too much or crinkle your face and when that happens accuracy drops proportional to the change in position the technique i’m researching requires head motion and i typically see accuracy of 3 degrees after some head movements slightly move the headset doesn’t fit with other glasses very well and if it does fit the reflections make it worthless you have to wear something on your head it is fine at first but after an hour or two can start to feel quite uncomfortable you have to recalibrate every single time you put it on unlike some remote eye trackers watch out for eye cameras can’t adjust to get a good view of eyes very near the center of the face i had a participant like this and it still worked but lost tracking at larger gaze angles if your ears move when your face moves it will move the eye tracker out of calibration almost immediately i had a participant like this tobii eye x  steelseries sentry best consumer eye tracker the tobii eye x or the identical steelseries sentry is an incredible consumer eye tracker one downside is it only works on windows but i’ve gotten around this by running the eye x software in a vmware fusion vm and piping the data to my mac over udp two caveats are that in order to switch to the mac and have tracking continue you have to lock the vm’s screen resolution also if the load gets too high on the vm sometimes the tracker will stop and take a couple seconds before it automatically restarts this is only an issue in vms and can be mostly avoided by running no other programs on the windows vm edit 20161114 tobii has now announced the eye tracker 4c which is their new consumer eye tracker it includes an asic for ondevice processing which lowers cpu load and only needs usb 20 bandwidth this probably solves the usb 30 vm crashing issues i experienced it also has head tracking but i have no idea how accurate it is i may get one when it comes out if so i’ll write about it here pros extremely robust to head motion your calibration will last practically forever you can move your head around as much as you want and still maintain decent 23 degrees accuracy tracking this means you don’t have to calibrate every time you sit down just keep your one calibration for an arbitrarily long time the magnetic mount is extremely repeatable so it doesn’t need to be recalibrated good accuracy even on large screens although the accuracy degrades near corners in general the tracker gives me 23 degrees of accuracy which is quite decent comes with very nice software the sdk is nice and the software gives you a nice calibration test screen a very pretty gaze trace and some handy eye tracking desktop enhancements like warping your mouse cursor cons low precision there is quite a bit of jitter but it is bounded it is almost never more than 2cm from the center of the jitter so can be mostly eliminated by filtering windows only you may not record gaze data this is a developer sdk term meant to make you buy tobii’s more expensive trackers it is not an issue if you’re developing interaction techniques or just using the tracker your head needs to be relatively low with respect to the monitor i prefer my head to be near the top of my monitor but this is outside the nonadjustable view of the tracker from the monitor’s bottom edge you can fix this by tilting your monitor upwards i was lucky that my monitor had an adjustable stand the eye tribe tracker good but doesn’t work well for me the eye tribe tracker i have the older 100 model is a great piece of hardware at a great price unfortunately it barely works for me i’ve seen it work well for other people in videos so i’m not claiming this is a common problem just one that i invariably experience i’ve tried it in tons of environments with different computers positions and eyewear after reverse engineering it i think i have identified the problem as due to extra glints on the side of my eyes when looking away from the center of my screen i can calibrate in the center and get 4 degrees of accuracy within a 1000 x 1000px area but that isn’t great as such i’ve restricted my pros and cons to discussing other issues than accuracy pros great price only 100 works on osx this is better than the tobii eye x so if you’re looking for a consumer tracker on osx try the eye tribe a great high speed high resolution infrared camera i reverse engineered the control codes so you can use it for other purposes like motion tracking or writing your own eye tracking algorithms this can’t be done easily with the eye x since it uses a much more locked down custom usb protocol cons tripod mount means that if you bump it pull the cable or bump your monitor you’ll have to recalibrate this is in contrast to the sentry which mounts directly to your monitor if you’re ambitious you could improve your own clamping mount for the eye tribe tracker or fix the tripod and monitor in place limited software the software does very little compared to tobii’s and pupil’s software it is basically just a calibration and api server tobii x230 great but overpriced my lab has a tobii pro x230 which in many ways is similar to the tobii eye x the main hardware difference is that it uses two cameras instead of one but i assume they are lower resolution since it only needs usb 20 bandwidths instead of usb 30 the main legal difference is that you are allowed to record the gaze data with the pro models the main practical difference is that the x230 costs over 50 times as much the price is not public and i imagine they quote different prices to different people i’m not sure if my lab signed any agreements with regards to giving away the price so i’ll just say we paid somewhere over 50x the price of an eye x the proscons and tracking performance are very similar to the tobii eye x unless you are doing a study where you need to record gaze data the 50x increase in price is not worth it in my opinion pros extremely robust to head motion your calibration will last practically forever you can move your head around as much as you want and still maintain decent 23 degrees accuracy tracking this means you don’t have to calibrate every time you sit down just keep your one calibration for an arbitrarily long time the magnetic mount is extremely repeatable so it doesn’t need to be recalibrated good accuracy although the accuracy degrades near corners in general the tracker gives 20 degrees of accuracy when not using a chin rest which is quite good and slightly better than the eye x comes with very nice software the sdk is nice and the software gives you a nice calibration test screen a very pretty gaze trace and some handy eye tracking desktop enhancements like warping your mouse cursor the new analytics sdk 30 allows use with osx and linux cons the nice eye x software it works with is windowsonly only specified to work on relatively small monitors by modern standards 22” diagonal i found that sometimes the tracked gaze would jump for half a second or so to a wildly inaccurate position 15cm away from where i was looking this is bad because it is harder to filter out and distinguish from a saccade crazy expensive this is not unique to tobii basically every eye tracker intended for research except the pupil is absurdly overpriced many research eye trackers cost in the range of 50000 your head needs to be relatively low with respect to the monitor i prefer my head to be near the top of my monitor but this is outside the nonadjustable view of the tracker from the monitor’s bottom edge you can fix this by tilting your monitor upwards i was lucky that my monitor had an adjustable stand xlabs gaze chrome plugin best webcam only eye tracker the xlabs chrome plugin allows you to do eye tracking on a web page using only a webcam and no special hardware i’ve only ever had good results when trying out their eyes decide software although i was also in a different environment when i tried it that way pros basically your only option for eye tracking without special hardware allows you to do things like web usability eye tracking studies with only a laptop free the sdk is currently free to use although that may change and you don’t have to buy hardware rather decent tracking quite impressive for a webcam tracker can achive 24 degree accuracies varying extensively by person environment and calibration fully cross platform because it is just a chrome plugin cons very long calibration process if you want good results you need to go through a very long sequence of calibration dots on the order of 30 very short lived calibration it is not as robust to head motion as other trackers and becomes miscalibrated within a few minutes unless you are constantly calibrating with their dynamic calibration very sensitive to lighting you need bright light on your face sitting near a window is best if the lighting isn’t right it can sometimes barely work at all you can only use it within chrome no desktop apps others there are tons of crazy expensive research eye tracking systems that i haven’t tried for exactly that reason they cost way too much i’m sure some of them are quite excellent but they cost as much of a car for hardware that certainly isn’t 110th that expensive to manufacture there’s two other sub1000 eye trackers i have not tried but i have read a bit about gazepoint gp3the gazepoint gp3 is 500 and internally uses a point grey camera which probably has a 752x480 resolution which is much lower than the eye tribe tracker the only advantage it might have over the eye tribe is that it uses bright pupil tracking so perhaps more robust and their software might be better but likely is not gazepoint’s software is also windows only i see no reason to consider this tracker over the cheaper and seemingly much better tobii eye x my gaze the my gaze seems to be the deluxe consumer eye tracker i haven’t bought it since it is outside my “just trying it out” budget when i already personally own 2 consumer eye trackers however there seems to be some glowing recommendations online from people who have tried other consumer eye trakers calling it the best of everything low cost it is also made by engineers from smi which is a super fancy expensive high quality research eye tracker company there’s some recommendations and a video that shows incredible 1 degree accuracy on this forum thread if you have the budget for it i recommend you try this tracker out and then let me know how you like it one downside is that although the hardware only costs 500 you have to pay 900 to also get the developer sdk unlike every other consumer eye tracker which gives away the sdk for free with the tracker the eye tribe pro the eye tribe is soon going to release a new tracker with new algorithms and supposedly better tracking on many dimensions for 200 i have no idea how good it will be or how it will compare to other low cost eye trackers
