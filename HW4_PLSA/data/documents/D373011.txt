syria gets messy herbert mc masters last day as national security advisor was friday when new nsa john bolton gets to the office on monday hes going to have to hit the ground running why because on sunday morning the syrian government launched a chemical weapons attack on the city of douma killing at least 70 people with some estimates putting the number as high as 150 donald trump who just last week signaled that he wants the u s to be out of syria in six months flew into a rage on twitter many dead including women and children in mindless chemical attack in syria area of atrocity is in lockdown and encircled by syrian army making it completely inaccessible to outside world president putin russia and iran are responsible for backing animal assad big price— donald j trump real donald trump april 8 2018to pay open area immediately for medical help and verification another humanitarian disaster for no reason whatsoever sick— donald j trump real donald trump april 8 2018if president obama had crossed his stated red line in the sand the syrian disaster would have ended long ago animal assad would have been history— donald j trump real donald trump april 8 2018you know trump is angry when hes willing to call out vlad putin by name it would seem he calmed down pretty quickly however because not long after these he send a tweet congratulating masters champion patrick reed trumps very characteristic attempt to pass the buck and to point the finger at others did not go over too well on sunday not only is blaming barack obama getting a little dubious 18 months into the trump presidency but twitter users with a long memory couldnt help but notice that one of the loudest voices calling for obama not to cross the red line was donald trump again to our very foolish leader do not attack syria  if you do many very bad things will happen  from that fight the u s gets nothing— donald j trump real donald trump september 5 2013its in all caps so clearly trump was serious meanwhile it seems unlikely that it is a coincidence that the attack came in the same week as trumps announcement about withdrawal sen john mc cain raz who knows a thing or two about geopolitics as chairman of the senate committee on armed services certainly sees a connection he issued a statement that read in part president trump last week signaled to the world that the united states would prematurely withdraw from syria bashar assad and his russian and iranian backers have heard him and emboldened by american inaction assad has reportedly launched another chemical attack against innocent men women and children this time in douma sen lindsey graham rsc mc cains close friend and fellow hawk seconded the sentiment and declared that the time has come for strong antiassad measures trump doesnt particularly care what graham and mc cain think but he nonetheless might very well decide he has to retaliate first because he promised a big price to pay second because failing to respond might appear weak and there are few things trump hates more than looking weak and third because trumps about to have the ultrahawkish bolton filling his head with ideas about the virtues of mass bombings it may prove to be highly unfortunate that mc master couldnt hang on for another week or two zfire in trump tower a fire broke out at trump tower in new york on saturday leaving one man dead and six firefighters injured and as anyone who has been paying attention for the past two years knows anything involving trump is sure to become a political story sooner or later so it is with this news it was trump himself who got the ball rolling with this tweet late saturday fire at trump tower is out very confined well built building firemen and women did a great job thank you— donald j trump real donald trump april 7 2018it didnt take people long to notice that trump managed to thank the firefighters which is entirely apropos and to brag about how wellbuilt his building is much less apropos but to say nothing about the victim no best wishes to his family no thoughts and prayers nothing meanwhile by sunday quite a few outlets were observing that trump tower is not necessarily built all that well at least not in one very important way it lacks sprinklers of the exact sort that would have forestalled saturdays tragedy the city of new york considered mandating that such sprinklers be installed in all highrises but they were successfully lobbied to exempt older buildings by donald trump one might wonder if that does not make the building just a little dangerous to live in apparently the president and the secret service think so because when trump is in residence they take extra steps to protect him against a possible fire given that trump was clearly aware of the fire danger one might also wonder if hes about to get sued again the answer is bet on it beyond the fire hazard the building staffs response to the blaze was apparentlyincompetent some details of trump tower fire from residents in addition to the building not having a sprinkler system yesterday there were  no orders to evacuate  no working phones  no working elevators  no fire alarms  no one answering at the front desk pictwittercombxmhpcbckj— sarah kendzior sarahkendzior april 8 2018assuming the family of the deceased decides to sue the trump organization will presumably be eager to settle and finally while this has nothing to do with liability or with a lack of empathy theres also plenty of potential embarrassment for trump here particularly if people find out that the deceased had been trying desperately to sell his condo since the president was elected and that even after several price drops he could find no takers it would seem that at least in new york the trump brand is wholly tainted perhaps the donald will have better luck with trump tower moscow zrepublican issue for the midterms impeachment republicans had hoped to base their midterm case on the new tax law but in recent special elections the issue didnt get any traction even running as if minority leader nancy pelosi were on the ballot didnt work now a new idea is bubbling up  talk about impeachment the idea is to harp on the idea that if the democrats win congress they will impeach donald trump actually unlike stories about nancy pelosi being the spawn of satan this is probably true the goal is to scare trumps supporters and make sure they vote in november it could also raise grassroots campaign donations it wont be hard for republican candidates to provide proof that the democrats want to impeach trump all they have to do is replay some of the ads billionaire tom steyer has been running demanding just that most democratic leaders want to avoid any discussion of impeachment until after the elections but they cant make steyer shut up much as they want to and with republicans amplifying his voice the problem certainly wont go away from the republican perspective this is a good issue as it unites all wings of the party something that immigration and the wall dont do on the other hand there is a wild card here robert mueller if the special counsel issues a report before the midterms laying out a detailed case that trump has committed one or more impeachable offenses and the public largely believes it making the midterms about impeachment could backfire vmanafort might try to put the fbi on trial it is sometimes said that the best defense is a good offense but there are limits donald trumps former campaign manager paul manafort may try to discover where those are in particular his lawyers may try to defend him by alleging that the fbi is biased and corrupt and that he is a political prisoner one bit of evidence is the case of peter strzok who was part of muellers team until mueller fired him strzok sent thousands of text messages to his girlfriend lisa page many of which were critical of trump manaforts lawyers could subpoena them to show that muellers team had it in for manafort from day one however there are great risks with this strategy first when mueller discovered the texts he fired strzok immediately that is not the action of someone who approved of the messages second the prosecution is likely to bring up the fact that strzok was one of the leaders of the investigation into hillary clintons email server and the one who most wanted to nail her to the wall he also wrote the first draft of the letter former fbi director james comey sent to congress in july 2016 saying that although clinton hadnt technically broken any laws she was grossly negligent in addition he was the driving force behind comeys announcement 11 days before the election about new clinton emails that hardly seems like something a diehard trump hater would do third a strategy of trying to put the fbi on trial could anger the judges in manaforts two cases they could say to the lawyers please limit yourself to discussing the charges and your clients behavior not that of an fbi agent who was not on the case when the charges were brought judges arent generally stupid and manaforts judges could be thinking hes obviously guilty so his lawyers want to talk about something other than the case at hand having the judge think you are guilty is never a good thing even if she doesnt say anything worse yet one of them judge amy berman jackson has already gotten angry at manaforts lawyers for filing what she considered an irrelevant civil suit claiming that mueller has run amok vsanders and harris make gaffes donald trump can say 100 things that his base hates and they will still love him but democrats arent always as forgiving in the past week two of the leading democratic presidential candidates said things that may come back to haunt them next year when campaigning revs up sen bernie sanders ivt was in jackson ms last week to honor the 50th anniversary of the death of martin luther king jr given his problems with black voters going there was a smart move in his remarks he criticized the democratic partys business model which made a bad impression on many of the people in attendance who see sanders still focused on economic issues including the partys reliance on wealthy donors almost to the exclusion of the issue of racial justice which is front and center with many black voters in short if sanders runs in the 2020 primaries he may be wiped out in the south again because about half the democratic primary voters there are black and he still doesnt get it from their point of view the other 2020 candidate who stumbled last week is sen kamala harris dca at a town hall in sacramento someone asked her if a corporate lobbyist gave her money would she take it she said it depends the questioner declared that was the wrong answer but she didnt back down one can already envision the ads one or more of her primary opponents are going to run senator harris is ok with taking money from corporate lobbyists i hereby categorically state that i will not take even a single penny from any corporate lobbyist for much of the democratic base that is the right answer her statement could hurt harris next year if she runs vnearly all republican candidates embrace trump in simple business terms donald trump has completed a successful hostile takeover of the republican party there is simply no viable opposition left the evidence is the 11 primaries that will be held in may in just about all races the republican candidates are arguing about who loves trump the most no one is pushing for a return to the partys previous ideals free trade robust immigration respect for the rule of law etc it is all about embracing trump  the big question is simply are you for him or against him the voters demand for loyalty to trump above everything else is putting many republican candidates in a bind for example one of the republican candidates in the indiana senatorial primary is rep todd rokita rin he has supported free trade his entire life but is running as a trump loyalist he has to hope the voters arent smart enough to notice the disconnect here the same problem is playing out all over the map republicans who have always supported a robust immigration policy are tying themselves in knots to explain they havent flipflopped as a result of their new support of a strongly antiimmigrant president given how popular trump remains with the republican base tribal loyalty is going to dominate during the primaries with nearly all candidates swearing undying fealty to the president no matter what their past policy positions have been the problem is going to come in november when democratic and swing voters also get to vote but for many republicans that problem comes later step 1 is winning the primary even if what they say now jeopardizes them in the general election vgop pollster republicans are in deep trouble in 2018frank luntz is one of the most famous gop pollsters and strategists in the land right at the same level with karl rove and scott rasmussen so democrats will be very happy to hear that he is predicting doom and gloom for his party in the midterms i think the republicans are in deep trouble in the house and the senate as well he said if the election were held today frankly i think republicans would lose both luntz laid a sizable share of the blame at the feet of donald trump particularly his tweeting and his constant violations of reagans eleventh commandment thou shalt not speak ill of any fellow republican thats the good news for the blue team now the bad news luntz is actually a pretty bad prognosticator in the three presidential elections held since he achieved national prominence he has predicted victory for john mc cain mitt romney and hillary clinton none of those folks became president as you may have noticed his real talents lie in push polling and in telling gop candidates how to spin their messaging for example it was luntz who came up with death tax as a replacement for estate tax and who persuaded republicans that it was better to use the phrase climate change than to use global warming this is not to say that luntz is wrong about the midterms only that its probably not wise to bet the farm on his predictions especially since his real goal might not be to make a prediction but instead to rally the base zrace to succeed paul ryan has already begun no you didnt miss the news that house speaker paul ryan rwi is retiring he hasnt made any such announcement officially he is running for reelection but many people believe that his heart isnt in it and he may soon announce that he plans to retire from congress at the end of his current term the fact that ryan hasnt said he is leaving hasnt stopped speaker wannabes from revving up their campaigns though in particular the number two and three republicans in the house majority leader kevin mc carthy rca and majority whip steve scalise rla respectively are already gearing up to run for speaker house rules and tradition do not dictate that the nextinline member of the majority gets the top job ryan wasnt even in the leadership when he got the job he got it because he was well known and well liked due to his 2012 run for vice president in fact the speaker doesnt have to be a member of the house at all or over 18 or even an american if the house wanted to beef up britishamerican relations and elected the fouryearold prince george of cambridge as speaker that would be perfectly legal because ryan is not officially out both precandidates are running lowprofile campaigns so as not to alienate him if he decides to stay on mc carthy ran for speaker in 2015 and lost which is probably why scalise thinks he has a chance one longtime house republican told politico everyone is talking about this mc carthy probably has the inside track here because he is tight with donald trump if trump endorses him that will probably seal the deal however there is someone else who is also running for speaker who could mess up mc carthys welllaid plans nancy pelosi if the democrats capture the house they will have enough votes to elect a democrat as speaker most likely pelosi nevertheless that is not a sure thing since some democrats running in conservative districts have said they wont vote for her if the democrats end up with say 220 seats and five members defect and no republicans vote for her she will lose and the democrats will have to switch to plan b rep steny hoyer dmd is 2 in the democratic leadership but he will be 79 in january so he is no shooin if pelosi cant get 218 votes still
