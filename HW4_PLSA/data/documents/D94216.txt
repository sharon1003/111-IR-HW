goy plural goyim ethnos people nation goy or goi is rendered gentiles in the king james version in some 30 passages but much more frequently heathen and oftener still nation which latter is the usual rendering in the revised version british and american but it is commonly used for a nonisraelitish people and thus corresponds to the meaning of gentiles it occurs however in passages referring to the israelites as in genesis 122 deuteronomy 3228 joshua 317 41 1013 2 samuel 723  isaiah 14 zec 29 but the word am is the term commonly used for the people of god in the new testament ethnos is the word corresponding to goy in the old testament and is rendered gentiles by both vss while laos is the word which corresponds to am the king james version also renders hellenes gentiles in six passages  john 735 romans 2910 39  1 corinthians 1032 1213  but the revised version british and american renders greeks the gentiles were far less sharply differentiated from the israelites in old testament than in new testament times under old testament regulations they were simply nonisraelites not from the stock of abraham but they were not hated or despised for that reason and were to be treated almost on a plane of equality except certain tribes in canaan with regard to whom there were special regulations of nonintercourse the gentile stranger enjoyed the hospitality of the israelite who was commanded to love him  deuteronomy 1019  to sympathize with him for ye know the heart of the stranger seeing ye were strangers in the land of egypt  exodus 239 the king james version the kenites were treated almost as brethren especially the children of rechab  judges 116 524 jeremiah 35  uriah the hittite was a trusted warrior of david  2 samuel 11  ittai the gittite was captain of davids guard  2 samuel 182  araunah the jebusite was a respected resident of jerusalem the gentiles had the right of asylum in the cities of refuge the same as the israelites  numbers 3515  they might even possess israelite slaves  leviticus 2547  and a gentileservant must not be defrauded of his wage  deuteronomy 2415  they could inherit in israel even as late as the exile  ezekiel 472223  they were allowed to offer sacrifices in the temple at jerusalem as is distinctly affirmed by josephus bj ii xvii 2 4 ant xi viii 5 xiii viii 2 xvi ii 1 xviii v 3 cap ii 5 and it is implied in the levitical law  leviticus 2225  prayers and sacrifices were to be offered for gentilerulers  jeremiah 297 baruch 11011 ezra 610 1 macc 733 josephus bj ii x 4 gifts might be received from them 2 macc 516 josephus ant xiii iii 4 xvi vi 4 bj v xiii 6 cap ii 5 but as we approach the christian era the attitude of the jews toward the gentiles changes until we find in new testament times the most extreme aversion scorn and hatred they were regarded as unclean with whom it was unlawful to have any friendly intercourse they were the enemies of god and his people to whom the knowledge of god was denied unless they became proselytes and even then they could not as in ancient times be admitted to full fellowship jews were forbidden to counsel them and if they asked about divine things they were to be cursed all children born of mixed marriages were bastards that is what caused the jews to be so hated by greeks and romans as we have abundant evidence in the writings of cicero seneca and tacitus something of this is reflected in the new testament  john 1828 acts 1028 113  if we inquire what the reason of this change was we shall find it in the conditions of the exiled jews who suffered the bitterest treatment at the hands of their gentile captors and who after their return and establishment in judea were in constant conflict with neighboring tribes and especially with the greek rulers of syria the fierce persecution of antiochus iv who attempted to blot out their religion and hellenize the jews and the desperate struggle for independence created in them a burning patriotism and zeal for their faith which culminated in the rigid exclusiveness we see in later times h porter copyright statement these files are public domain bibliography information orr james m a d d general editor entry for
