the world participate in them and the reputations of the greatest players in golf history are largely based on the number and variety of major championship victories they accumulate the top prizes are not actually the largest in golf being surpassed by the players championship three of the four world golf championships events the hsbc champions promoted to wgc status in 2009 has a top prize comparable to that of the majors and some other invitational events however winning a major boosts a players career far more than winning any other tournament if he is already a leading player he will probably receive large bonuses from his sponsors and may be able to negotiate better contracts if he is an unknown he will immediately be signed up perhaps more importantly he will receive an exemption from the need to annually requalify for a tour card on his home tour thus giving a tournament golfer some security in an unstable profession currently the pga tour gives a fiveyear exemption to all major winners while the european tour gives a sevenyear exemption three of the four majors take place in the united states the masters is played at the same course augusta national golf club every year while the other three rotate courses the open championship however is always played on a links course  each of the majors has a distinct history and they are run by four different golf organizations but their special status is recognized worldwide major championship winners receive the maximum possible allocation of 100 points from the official world golf ranking which is endorsed by all of the main tours and major championship prize money is official on the three richest regular ie under50 golf tours the pga tour european tour and japan golf tour although the majors are considered prestigious due to their history and traditions there are still other nonmajor tournaments which prominently feature top players competing for purses meeting or exceeding those of the four traditional majors such as the world golf championships the european tour s dp world tour championship dubai and the pga tours players championship as the players has the largest prize fund of any golf event and is promoted as the tours flagship tournament it is frequently considered to be an unofficial fifth major by players and critics after the announcement that the evian masters would be recognized as the fifth womens major by the lpga tour players shared objections to the concept of having a fifth mens major owing to the longstanding traditions that the existing four have established 3 4history  editthe majors originally consisted of two british tournaments the open championship and the amateur championship and two american tournaments the u s open and the u s amateur with the introduction of the masters tournament in 1934 and the rise of professional golf in the late 1940s and 1950s the term major championships eventually came to describe the masters the u s open the open championship and the pga championship it is difficult to determine when the definition changed to include the current four tournaments although many trace it to arnold palmers 1960 season after winning the masters and the u s open to start the season he remarked that if he could win the open championship and pga championship to finish the season he would complete a grand slam of his own to rival bobby jones s 1930 feat until that time many u s players such as byron nelson also considered the western open and the north and south open as two of golfs majors 5 and the british pga matchplay championship was as important to british and commonwealth professionals as the pga championship was to americans during the 1950s the shortlived world championship of golf was viewed as a major by its competitors as its first prize was worth almost ten times any other event in the game and it was the first event whose finale was televised live on u s television the oldest of the majors is the open championship commonly referred to as the british open outside the united kingdom dominated by american champions in the 1920s and 1930s the comparative explosion in the riches available on the u s tour from the 1940s onwards meant that the lengthy overseas trip needed to qualify and compete in the event became increasingly prohibitive for the leading american professionals their regular participation dwindled after the war years ben hogan entered just once in 1953 and won but never returned sam snead won in 1946 but lost money on the trip first prize was 600 and did not return until 1962 golf writer dan jenkins often seen as the world authority on majors since hes attended more 200 than anyone else has noted that the pros didnt talk much about majors back then i think it was herbert warren wind who starting using the term he said golfers had to be judged by the major tournaments they won but its not like there was any set number of major tournaments 6in 1960 arnold palmer entered the open championship in an attempt to emulate hogans 1953 feat of winning on his first visit though a runnerup by a stroke in his first attempt palmer returned and won the next two in 1961 and 1962 scheduling difficulties persisted with the pga championship but more americans began competing in the 1960s restoring the events prestige and with it the prize money that once again made it an attractive prospect to other american pros the advent of transatlantic jet travel helped to boost american participation in the open a discussion between palmer and pittsburgh golf writer bob drum led to the concept of the modern grand slam of golf 7in august 2017 after the previous years edition was scheduled earlier due to golf at the 2016 summer olympics the pga of america announced that the pga championship would be moved to latemay beginning in 2019 in between the masters and u s open the pga tour concurrently announced that it would move the players championship back to march the same year as a result the players and the four majors will still be played across five consecutive months 8 2television coverage  editunited kingdom  republic of ireland  editin the united kingdom the bbc used to be the exclusive tv home of the masters tournament and the open championship however from 2011 onwards sky sports has exclusive live coverage of the first two days of the masters with the weekend rounds shared with the bbc the u s open is shown exclusively on sky sports beginning in 2016 sky sports also became the exclusive broadcaster of the open championship the bbc elected to forego the final year of its contract 9 the bbc continues to hold rights to broadcast a nightly highlights programme 10sky also held rights to the pga championship but in july 2017 it was reported that the pga of america had declined to renew its contract seeking a different media model for the tournament in the united kingdom 11 the bbc acquired rights to the pga championship for 2017 with most coverage relegated to bbc red button and the conclusion of coverage on bbc two the pga reached a separate deal to also stream coverage in the uk via facebook live hosted by give me sport 12 13united states  editas none of the majors fall under the direct jurisdiction of tours broadcast rights for these events are negotiated separately with each sanctioning body all four majors have been broadcast at some point by one of the big three networks —all of whom are currently or have previously been pga tour broadcast partners in 2015 cbs was the only big three network that held weekendround rights to one or more majors as the remainder along with early round coverage of all four were held either by fox or cable networks the masters has been televised by cbs since 1956 beginning in 1966 abc obtained the broadcast rights for the other three majors and held them for a quarter century the pga championship moved to cbs in 1991 and the u s open returned to nbc in 1995 14 15abc retained the open championship as its sole major but moved its live coverage on the weekend to sister cable network espn in 2010 in june 2015 it was announced that nbc and golf channel would acquire rights to the open championship under a 12year deal 16 while the nbc deal was originally to take effect in 2017 espn chose to opt out of its final year of open rights so the nbc contract took effect beginning in 2016 instead 9the masters operates under oneyear contracts cbs has been the main tv partner every year since 1956 with espn broadcasting cbsproduced coverage of the first and second rounds since 2008 replacing usa network which had shown the event since the early 1980s 17 as of 2015 fox sports holds broadcast rights to the u s open and other usga events replacing nbc and espn with fox sports 1 as the primary pay tv outlet 18 cbs and turner sports hold rights to the pga championship with tnt handling early round and weekend morning coverage and cbs airing weekend afternoon coverage their respective contracts with the pga of america run through 2019 19 20distinctive characteristics of majors  editbecause each major was developed and is run by a different organization they each have different characteristics that set them apart these involve the character of the courses used the composition of the field and other idiosyncrasies the masters tournament sometimes referred to as the u s masters is the only major that is played at the same course every year  augusta national golf club  being the invitational tournament of that club the masters invites the smallest field of the majors generally under 100 players although like all the majors it now ensures entry for all golfers among the worlds top 50 prior to the event and is the only one of the four majors that does not use alternates to replace qualified players who do not enter the event usually due to injury former champions have a lifetime invitation to compete and also included in the field are the current champions of the major amateur championships and most of the previous years pga tour winners winners of alternate events held opposite a highprofile tournament do not receive automatic invitations the traditions of augusta such as the awarding of a green jacket to the champion create a distinctive character for the tournament as does the course itself with its lack of primary rough but severely undulating fairways and greens and punitive use of ponds and creeks on several key holes on the back nine the u s open is notorious for being played on difficult courses that have tight fairways challenging greens demanding pin positions and thick and high rough placing a great premium on accuracy especially with driving and approach play additionally while most regular tour events are played on courses with par 72 the u s open has almost never been held on a par72 course in recent decades the 2017 event was the first since 1992 to be played at par 72 21 during this time the tournament course has occasionally been played to a par of 71 but most commonly par 70 the u s open is rarely won with a score much under par the event is the championship of the united states golf association and in having a very strict exempt qualifiers list – made up of recent major champions professionals currently ranked high in the world rankings or on the previous years money lists around the world and leading amateurs from recent usga events – about half of the 156person field still enters the tournament through two rounds of open qualification events mostly held in the u s but also in europe and japan the u s open has no barrier to entry for either women or junior players as long as they are a professional or meet amateur handicap requirements as of 2016 however no female golfer has yet qualified for the u s open although in 2006 michelle wie made it to the second qualifying stage the u s open continues to have an 18hole playoff if players are tied after four rounds the open and pga championships use four and threehole aggregate playoffs respectively followed by sudden death if necessary and most regular events as well as the masters only have simple suddendeath playoffs the sunday of the championship has also in recent years fallen on fathers day at least as recognized in the us and the uk which has lent added poignancy to winners speeches the open championship sometimes referred to as the british open is organized by the ra an offshoot of the royal and ancient golf club of st andrews and is typically played on a linksstyle course in the united kingdom primarily england or scotland  it carries the prestige of being the oldest professional golf tournament currently in existence and the original open championship although the very first event was held only for british professionals it is respected for maintaining the tradition of links play that dates back to the very invention of the game in scotland links courses are generally typified as coastal flat and often very windswept with the fairways cut through dune grass and gorse bushes that make up the rough and have deep bunkers the course is generally not doctored to make it more difficult effectively making the variable weather the main external influence on the fields score 22 as well as exempting from qualifying recent professional major and amateur champions all former open championship winners under age 60 and leading players from the world rankings the ra ensures that leading golfers from around the globe are given the chance to enter by holding qualifying events on all continents as well as holding final qualifying events around the uk in the weeks prior to the main tournament the champion receives and has his name inscribed on the base of the famous claret jug a trophy that dates back to 1872 champions from 1860 until 1871 received instead a championship belt much like a champion professional boxers belt nowadays and the engraving of the champions name on the trophy prior to them receiving it is in itself one of the traditions of the closing ceremony of the championship as is the award of the silver medal to the leading amateur player to have made the cut to play the last 36 holes the pga championship sometimes referred to as the u s pga is traditionally played at a parkland club in the united states and the courses chosen tend to be as difficult as those chosen for the u s open with several such as baltusrol golf club medinah country club oakland hills country club oak hill country club and winged foot golf club having hosted both the pga generally does not set up the course as difficult as the usga does the pga of america enters into a profitsharing agreement with the host club except when the event is hosted by valhalla golf club in louisville kentucky a club that it owns in a parallel with the masters previous winners of the pga championship have a lifetime invitation to compete as well as inviting recent champions of the other three professional majors and leading players from the world rankings the pga championship field is completed by qualifiers held among members of the pga of america the organization of club and teaching professionals that are separate from the members of the pga tour the pga championship is also the only one of the four majors to invite all winners of pga tour events in the year preceding the tournament amateur golfers do not normally play on the pga tour and could only qualify by winning one of the other three majors winning a pga tour event while playing under a sponsors exemption or having a high world ranking the pga tends to be played in high heat and humidity that characterize the american climate in august which often sets it apart as a challenge from in particular the open championship which precedes it that is often played in cooler and rainy weather major championship winners  editsee also list of mens major championships winning golfers win number out of total wins is shown in

overall record in the four majors although the pgas player of the year system favors performances in the major championships since 1984 world ranking points have been assigned to finishes in the majors which has allowed a calculation of which player has earned the most ranking points in majors in a season – in almost every year since one of the years major winners has either won two of them or has been the only player to win one and record a high finish in another like justin leonard in 1997 david duval in 2001 lucas glover in 2009 or dustin johnson in 2016 enough to finish top of such a merit table in those years the single exception was nick faldo in 1988 whose finishes of 2nd 3rd and 4th earned him more world ranking points than any of that years champions achieved during the season tables are occasionally constructed for interest showing the overall scoring records for those players who have completed all 288 holes in the majors during a season in the 1970s jack nicklaus led such a table in 1970–73 1975 and 1979 with gary player leading in 1974 raymond floyd in 1976 and tom watson in 1977 and 1978 in the 1980s a notable leader was in 1987 when ben crenshaw was top of this compilation after finishing 4th 4th 4th and 7th in the four majors in total crenshaw took 1140 strokes only 12 more than the sum total of the four respective champions scores of 1128 recent winners of this accolade are pádraig harrington in 2008 ross fisher in 2009 phil mickelson in 2010 charl schwartzel in 2011 and adam scott in 2012 in 2013 scott and fellow australian jason day tied for this accolade with a cumulative score of 2 rickie fowler led in 2014 with −32 after topfive finishes in all four tournaments while in 2015 jordan spieth led the standings by achieving the lowest alltime cumulative score in a year of −54 one shot better than the cumulative score of tiger woods in 2000 in 2016 jason day again led with −9 achieved despite not winning any of the major tournaments during the year in 2017 brooks koepka topped the list with a cumulative scored of −21 one shot better than matt kuchar and hideki matsuyama consecutive victories at a major championship

one season  editit was rare before the early 1960s for the leading players from around the world to have the opportunity to compete in all four of the modern majors in one season because of the different qualifying criteria used in each at the time the costs of traveling to compete in an era when tournament prize money was very low and only the champion himself would earn the chance of ongoing endorsements and on occasion even the conflicting scheduling of the open and pga championships in 1937 the u s ryder cup side all competed in the open championship but of those who finished in the top ten of that event only ed dudley could claim a top ten finish in all four of the majors in 1937 if his defeat in the last16 round of that years pga championship then at matchplay was considered a joint 9th position following 1960 when arnold palmer s narrowly failed bid to add the open championship to his masters and u s open titles and thus emulate hogans 1953 triple crown helped to establish the concept of the modern professional grand slam it has become commonplace for the leading players to be invited to and indeed compete in all four majors each year even so those who have recorded topten finishes in all four in a single year remains a small and select group three majors won in calendar year that the top ten was completed two majors won in calendar year that the top ten

the third prize eg 1870 open championship 1966 masters tournament  these players are still regarded as being runnersup for match play pga championships up to 1957 the runnerup is the losing finalist
