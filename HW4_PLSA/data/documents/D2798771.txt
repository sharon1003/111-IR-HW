project information what is seattle rain watch seattle rain watch is a realtime weather system that provides rain accumulation totals for the past 1 to 48hours and forecasts rain accumulation for the next hour for the seattle metropolitan region it uses rainfall estimates derived from radar data that are calibrated with local rain gauge networks to improve accuracy over other radar only indicated precipitation estimate products the forecasts are made using radar echo motion vectors over the past hour and are extrapolated outward temporally and spatially how does it work radar reflectivities d bz from the level ii datastream provided by the katx camino island wsr88d doppler radar are ingested in realtime by the seattle rain watch system the reflectivities are converted into rainfall rates using a standard d bz to rainfall rate conversion and are then calibrated by realtime data provided by ontheground local rain gauge networks these calibrated rainfall estimates are then integrated into rainfall accumulation totals for 161224 and 48hours who is involved with seattle rain watch the seattle rain watch project is lead by prof cliff mass the realtime system was developed by phil regulski and david carey provides web design and graphics it is a product of the mesoscale analysis and forecasting group at the university of washingtons department of atmospheric sciences funding and one of rain gauge networks is supplied by seattle public utilities please send us an email if you would like to get involved or expand coverage to your region cliffatmoswashingtonedu what benefits does seattle rain watch provide users traditional rainfall estimates calculated by radar reflectivity are prone to a number of problems that can create incorrect rainfall accumulation estimates see what are common problems with the radar reflectivity to rainfall rate conversion without calibration from ontheground rain gauges these errors can propagate and intensify as successive rainfall estimates are combined to calculate accumulations over longer timescales seattle rain watch removes these radar biases by calibrating the radarindicated rainfall rates to rain gauge networks scattered throughout the region therefore seattle rain watch provides a more accurate picture of the current hydrological state of the region what are common problems with the radar reflectivity to rainfall rate conversion there are many different reasons why the radar reflectivity to rainfall rate conversion can produce errors wsr88d radar rainfall estimation capabilities limitations and potential improvements by s m hunter provides a good introduction to this subject below is a summary of that paper known problems with radar reflectivity radar calibration biases in the measurement of reflectivity can arise from incorrect hardware calibration at the radar site attenuation small 1d b errors due to wet radome frozen hydrometeors and the melting layer the weather radar equation assumes scatterers are spherical in shape liquid and evenly distributed drops distributed evenly throughout the volume scan region there will be a difference between the true distribution and the assumed introducing errors anomalous propagation refractivity lapse rates created by large gradients in temperature andor water vapor produce superrefraction and subrefraction of the radar beam and inaccurate calculations of the beam height this will alter return reflectivities from the true state of the atmosphere beam blockage terrain blocks radar pulses and result in areas of no coverage range effects earth curvature and resulting beam overshoot and beam spreading can all alter the radar reflectivities zr relationship issues many studies have shown there are variations in the particle size distribution which the zr relationship is based in order to account for different distributions people have developed different zr relationships for different types of rain stratiform convective types of precipitation drizzle rain hail snow joss et al 1970 geographic locations maritime continental carins et al 1998 quinlan and sinsabaugh 1999 etc  the most commonly used is z  300r14 but errors will be introduced based on the difference between the true particle size distribution and the assumed product information products page map domains each of the following products have three
