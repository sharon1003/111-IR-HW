sirius xm has a new owner jan1813  about sirius xm siristephen faulkner long only research analyst portfolio strategy media sirius xm radio inc nasdaq siri has a new owner and it is certainly no surprise that owner is liberty media lmca as of thursday evening 1172013 liberty released a form 4 indicating that it had purchased 50000000 shares of sirius xm on 1152013 this brings libertys stake to roughly 505 and cements control of the company in libertys hands liberty media now owns 199 billion common shares and 129 billion convertible shares according to a filing today if the converted stock is added to the outstanding shares of new yorkbased sirius liberty media owns about 505 percent this move by liberty as well as the speed with which it was executed has not been unexpected for those who have read my most recent articles i originally hypothesized on 132013 that liberty would make its purchases quickly its simply another bell rung for sirius xm as the new year enters into full swing now that liberty is approved it can purchase the final shares it needs to go to control and that should happen within the next 60 days i dont expect liberty to wait and i expect liberty will purchase these shares in very short order i reinforced this opinion on 192013 but patience is not necessary or even prudent in all moves liberty may make and on the other end of the spectrum i believe liberty media will be in a hurry instead of exhibiting patience with regard to taking control of sirius xm theres no reason to wait liberty needs a relatively small number of shares to move to control and it should be expected that the final shares will be scooped up as soon as possible it doesnt particularly matter if liberty pays 3 310 or even 320 on these final shares they are a drop in a massive bucket and a few hundred thousand dollars extra or even a few million on a stake that is ultimately worth billions is chump change if it cements control do not expect liberty to be patient here and do not expect liberty to take the full 60 days there is no reason for it to do so like this article
