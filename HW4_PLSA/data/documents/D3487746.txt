tweet natural news sugar lurks in many places within our food system today from certain breads and juices to childrens cereal it has been discretely introduced into the food supply on a catastrophic level over the years much research has been conducted regarding the toxic effects of sugar and the conclusions have all been quite troubling  cancer being a common trend within many of the studies the cancer problem is not slowing down over 15 million cancer cases are predicted to occur in the united states in 2013 and sadly approximately half a million of these cases are expected to die in 2008 alone there were over 12 million cases of cancer worldwide and this figure is expected to climb to over 20 million by the year 2030 if society cant call this a worldwide epidemic then what is with these types of statistics it seems that the current approaches in place to prevent or even treat cancer simply arent working at this point its probably safe to say that its going to take more than a cancer walk to stop this horrible trend once and for all interestingly enough many researchers are now shifting their focus to understanding environmental influences like eating behaviors by means of putting a new light on the cancer problem research shows that sugar is a perfect fuel for cancer cells studies have shown that cancer cells primarily run on glucose with this being the case it makes sense to regulate sugar intake in order to prevent cancerous cells from forming or to stop them from spreading if a person has already been diagnosed unfortunately the westernized approach to treating cancer doesnt involve much credible dietary input or advice tactics employed nowadays as far as treatment options go seem to revolve more around chemotherapy and medications rather than which foods or substances to incorporate or avoid much of the research on sugar in relation to this disease has proven that cancer patients should certainly be watching how much of it they are consuming in simpler terms less sugar can undoubtedly equate to better controlling the invasive nature of cancer sugar hides in many places sugar is literally everywhere and it doesnt seem as if too many people are concerned with how prevalent it is within the food system nowadays • storebought dressings • kids snacks • juices • soda • canned foods • enriched breads • processed meats • baked goods • sports drinks • nutrition bars • nutritional supplements society must remind itself that if leading a conventional lifestyle it is going to be difficult to avoid these types of foods if looking to improve your health and avoid diseases like cancer shifting to a more holistic low sugar lifestyle seems to be a great preventative measure to take consuming less sugar eating more vegetables drinking more filtered water and eating cleaner foods are all appropriate strategies that have been scientifically proven to work as far as disease prevention goes the end message with sugar and cancer there is now an obvious connection between diseases like cancer and the consumption of sugar if looking to avoid cancer or ultimately beat it if already diagnosed watching your added sugar intake is a crucial method to employ the scientific facts behind the claims are obviously real so its time that more people look into assessing their diets if looking to avoid many of these fatal diseases its not just cancer that society has to worry about these days either as sugar consumption has also been linked to conditions like heart disease and diabetes as well sources for this article includehttpwwwwcrforgcancerstatisticsworldcancerstatisticsphphttponlinelibrarywileycomdoi103322caac21166abstracthttpwwwsciencedailycomreleases200606060630094933htm about the author joey cardillo has been heavily involved in the online health community for over three years when his company versatile health llc  wwwversatilehealthcom was launched in 2010 he began his journey into the online world of health blogging since then he has published 1 best selling books on amazon and has been able to help people from all over the world gain better health with simple lifestyle reformations joey studied journalism in college and received his ba in mass communications in 2010 a year later in 2011 he decided to become a certified fdn functional diagnostic nutritionist his fdn training allows him to correct common ailments with his clients by utilizing natural protocols follow joey on facebook here https wwwfacebookcomversatilehealth25
