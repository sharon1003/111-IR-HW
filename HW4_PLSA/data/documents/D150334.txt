car craft engine pursuing performance written by terry mc gean on september 12 2006view all 13 photos after a mild refresh and shakedown of our 96 9c1 caprice its time to step up the game on the old girl just a bit the excop car gets some basic performance upgrades and some basic maintenance items in preparation for future upgrades its always nice some months ago we introduced you to our inhouse ’96 chevy caprice 9c1 better known as a cop car this specimen of the last fullsize rear wheel drive chevy is equipped with the vaunted gen ii lt1 engine displacing 57 liters and rated at 260 hp with iron cylinder heads our interest in the car was primarily as an urban commuter battling its way through the mean streets of la while providing a degree of comfort and utility along with their wellknown durability we selected an lt1 caprice specifically because of the impressive performance these cars deliver and since mechanically the 9c1 is nearly identical to the impala ss of the same era aftermarket support is available to make it even better the time lapse between our introduction of the car and now was due primarily to an extended “shakedown” period which shook out a steady stream of maladies since our car had 175000 miles when purchased the engine was replaced with a gm service longblock at 106000 as was the trans niggling problems like leaky coolant hoses burnedout fan relays and fried ignition parts are expected but now that the car has provided about 10000 miles of relatively troublefree motoring it’s time to turn up the heat for the initial thrashing we strapped our retiree to the superflow chassis dyno at westech performance group in mira loma california rather than throwing a pile of gofast parts at the highmileage cruiser we opted instead for simple tweaks to monitor the car’s reaction to ensure the old enforcer is up to the task if the car responds favorably to the basics we’ll take it as an indication that it’s safe to venture on to more serious hardware1 we wanted to make sure the caprice’s lubricants and filters were up to snuff prior to hitting the dyno to ensure that we weren’t introducing other variables into the equation besides the dyno can give a car a real workout so having fresh fluids is always a good idea to begin we used standard valvoline 5w30 factory spec along with a kn oil filter the fuel filter was also replaced with a fram service replacement part2 the ignition parts on our chevy were also well worn so we swapped in a fresh set of stockspec ac plugs and a set of msd plug wires the wires for the lt1 are somewhat unusual since all gen ii smallblocks use the optispark ignition system which is based in a distributor mounted behind the water pump the task of changing these wires looks deceptively simple but is actually a major chore since the wires are routed behind the front accessory drive components and behind the exhaust manifolds in steel looms it’s worth doing on highmileage cars though since this routing allows the engine’s heat to take its toll on the lt1’s ignition wires3 this being the first trip to the rollers for the caprice we wanted to establish a solid baseline the first pulls were made as the car came off the street–210degree coolant 91octane fuel and with all factory air intake and exhaust pieces in place the caprice has an excellent cooling system but the factory programmed the electric fans to stay off until the coolant reaches nearly 225 degrees to keep idle emissions clean this is reflected in the temp gauge as the needle reaches just shy of the threequarters mark when the needle sweeps past the straightup point typical for nonhighway driving performance falls off substantially judging by seatofthepants input our first pulls were made at around 210 degrees and showed 217 hp and 276 lbft4 there are several means of activating the cooling fans at lower temps including computer reflashing and aftermarket programmer devices both are effective but we decided to take a more mechanical approach by using one of jet performance’s fan controller switches the switch comes with wiring to tap into the factory harness and triggers the fans at a lower temp which in turn allows the engine to run closer to the temp dictated by the thermostat in this case around 195 degrees this simple change bumped power up to 222 while torque climbed to 280 lbft5 lowering the fan switching temp may cause the fans to turn on frequently as the coolant will still be fairly warm thanks to the stock thermostat the gen ii smallblocks use a uniquely designed thermostat and while replacements are readily available all the ones we found at the local parts store were for the stock temperature fortunately the aftermarket offers cooler tstats for the lt1 so we sourced one from jet and tried again lowering the coolant temp further should continue to boost power and the next round of pulls confirmed this as we gained an additional 2 hp we suspect that this change may normally be worth a little more as our coolant was already fairly warm from previous tests6 another area often compromised on latemodel vehicles is the air cleaner and its ducting since auto manufacturers have to subject their vehicles to driveby noise tests most air cleaners are baffled to reduce intake “roar”–the sound your mom’s station wagon used to make when you flipped the air cleaner lid over the lt1 caprice seemed strangled judging by the look of its stock air intake setup the filter box itself is fed by a small oval inlet that faces the back of the headlamps and the duct to the massairflow sensor maf has a huge resonance chamber with offset inlet and outlet connections another resonance chamber is mounted atop the intake manifold though it doesn’t seem to obstruct airflow we figured a more direct shot to the throttle body would have to help output at least a little7 as a trial experiment we pulled the lid off of the filter box and faced it forward so it became the inlet to the intake tract we stuck the stock paper filter element in it and made a pull showing an instant gain of another 3 hp and this was with the resonance baffle still in place we were onto something8 we started scheming to create a highflow air intake setup with visions of drilled filter boxes and 3inch exhaust tubing dancing in our heads of course we also wanted to use a highflow aftermarket filter and that’s when we learned that kn actually offers a complete coldair kit for the caprice actually this fipk fuel injection performance kit was developed for the impala ss but the hardware is identical on the copspec caprice so we ordered it up this kit includes a new filter box which seals to the hood to keep out hot enginebay air it also uses a conical filter rather than the stock paneltype and it even includes a tube to replace the resonance baffle9 installation is relatively simple the stock filter box is removed which is a simple matter of a couple screws and a few snapfit connections at the base the kn box then attaches to the same mounting points and includes a separate filter for the hose that feeds the engine’s air injection pump which was originally attached to the stock airbox the filter and tube attach to the box and the tube is then connected to the stock maf when it was all said and done the kn kit boosted power to 235 hp and 290 lbft of torque10 after the dyno test was over we realized there was another simple trick up our sleeves for the caprice that should have been tested the throttle body used on lt1s like the tunedport engines before them has a small passage inside for coolant which is fed via a small hose that taps into the cooling system the purpose of this arrangement is to prevent ice from accumulating on the throttle blades during coldclimate startups but the rest of the time it just adds heat to the incoming air by simply bypassing the coolant connections on the throttle body connect hose a to hose b the heat is eliminated–a change reputed to be worth around 35 hp in many cases we’ll try this out next time we hit the rollers injector detector one of the latest additions to the everexpanding arsenal of automotive test equipment at westech performance group is the asnu fuelinjector analyzer the asnu rig is intended to provide automotive service centers a means of determining the performance of each injector allowing technicians to pinpoint defective components by testing them individually under a number of conditions the rig can test up to eight injectors at a time and provides the ability to vary fuel pressure and injector pulse width meanwhile allowing the technician to visually observe the injector’s spray pattern and compare delivery rates between the injectors in a set injectors can be tested for static performance held open or dynamic performance pulsed there are also programs to simulate typical driving operation and the rig is capable of simulating engine operation up to 10000 rpm if so desired once the injectors have been tested the asnu can also be used to clean them using its patented ultrasonic treatment process as the name implies most used injectors can be returned to “asnew” performance using this apparatus although the asnu was developed for service work it is obviously an excellent tool for performance tuning and diagnostic work our caprice had fairly new injectors so we observed a set of mustang injectors going through the process see all 13 photos from the articlerelated tags engine
