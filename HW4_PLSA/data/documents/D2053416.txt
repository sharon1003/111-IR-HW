crap out of him in order to teach him how to fight and kept him in terror by threatening to eat him he also told quill that they kept him because he was a skinny little kid who could squeeze into places that adults couldnt therefore making it easier for thieving quill is later told that the threat of being eaten was actually a joke but as a child he believed it to be serious as he grew older

checking stuff out ― korath the pursuer and starlord srcliving in space for 26 years quill built up a reputation as the selfproclaimed legendary outlaw starlord and continued to work for yondu udonta during his time with the ravagers quill had became disloyal to them eventually planning to leave when udonta was given a job by the broker to steal a mysterious item called the orb from morag quill decided to steal the orb for himself and flew to the planet starlord successfully discovers the orb quill flew his ship to morag where he used his holographic map to locate an ancient temple where he believed the orb was being held as starlord and made his way through all of the various traps and dangers waiting for him in a temple including little orloni which had attempted to attack him he kept himself entertained as he went through the temple by playing his own walkman and danced to the music when starlord eventually managed to locate the orb inside the temple vault he found it unprotected and so proceeded to use one of his gravity mines to pull it out of its shielded display and steal it finding the job much easier than he had expected starlord is threatened by korath the pursuer however just as he prepared to get away with his prize starlord was attacked by korath the pursuer and his team of sakaarans who demanded that he drop the orb when starlord tried to claim that he was just a junker korath noted that he was clearly a member of the ravagers not believing his stories korath then ordered his men to take starlord back to ronan the accuser for questioning as starlords name clearly did not impress korath at all starlord manages to escape from morag quill was able to distract korath and killed his sakaaran soldiers by using his plasma sphere before he then shot korath with his quad blasters believing he was now safe starlord picked the orb up and made his escape while being chased down by korath starlord used his jet boots to pick up speed as he made it to the milano and used the gravity mine again to stop the other soldiers from shooting at him all while korath furiously ran closely behind him starlord escapes from the sakaaran soldiers having taken off his helmet starlord started up his ship and flew away from morag while korath still shot at him from a large canon forcing starlord to use his flying skills to dodge the blasts once he had gotten away from the kree soldier starlord confidently began cheering until he accidentally flew into a blast of steam which almost caused him to crashland until he was just able to regain control of his ship and then continued to make his hasty escape starlord is surprised by bereet appearance while he was flying away from morag and catching his breath from the ordeal starlord was then startled when he discovered that his girlfriend bereet was still inside the ship quill had forgotten that she was there when he went on his heist something which he quickly informed her of while he left morag in order to take the orb away and sell it for a huge profit quill is confronted by a furious yondu udonta while travelling through space and listening to reports on the kreenova war  bereet then inadvertently answered a call from yondu udonta who informed quill that he and his ravagers had arrived on morag to find that the orb was already taken much to udontas rage quill refused to tell him where he was and what his plans were as udonta then threatened him and confronted him about breaking the ravager code before quill hung up 2bounty hunters attack starlord brings the orb to brokeryou have the bearing of a man of honor well you know i wouldnt say that people say it about me all the time but its not something id ever say about myself ― gamora and starlord srcstarlord went to xandar in order to sell the orb saying goodbye to bereet before he left he brought it to the broker who had made the deal with yondu udonta in hopes of selling it to another buyer the merchant refused to take the orb after quill told him that korath the pursuer had been working for ronan the accuser who desired to destroy xandar starlord attempts to flirt with gamora as he was being pushed outside of brokers shop quill protested brokers actions before he encountered gamora who was standing outside the shop watching the commotion changing his tone quill claimed that broker had quit on a deal and did not have any integrity like he did quill then attempted to flirt with gamora introducing himself as starlord while gamora seemed less than impressed by him despite calling him a man of honor which quill agreed with starlord fights against gamora for the orb while quill continued to try and flirt with gamora he was suddenly attacked and kicked in the chest as gamora took the orb from his hand and attempted to get away quill quickly used energy bolas to trip over gamora before chasing after her and trying to wrestle the orb away from her hands however quill quickly found himself being overpowered by the assassin who drew godslayer and prepared to kill him while quill was pinned down and defenseless starlord attempts to escape with the orb moments before gamora could execute starlord however he was inadvertently saved when gamora was also attacked by the outlaw duo of rocket raccoon and groot who both desired the bounty that had been placed on quills head by the ravagers while gamora attempted to fight off the two bounty hunters so she could regain the orb starlord attempted to escape only to have gamora throw a knife at his hand and cause him to drop the orb once again the pair then wrestled for the orb with starlord losing the fight again and was pinned to the ground and called a fool by gamora starlord is almost captured by groot refusing to be defeated however starlord distracted gamora by teaser her while he place one of his jet boot attachments and then activated it causing gamora to be sent flying backwards while quill celebrated he was then captured by groot only for gamora to free him by cutting off groots arms once the bag was opened starlord used the chance to shoot gamora with his quad blasters and then attempted to escape on foot with the orb still in his hand starlord is arrested by rhomann dey however before he could get away from his attackers starlord was shot by rockets laser cannon causing him to fall to the floor in agony while rocket laughed at him after a lengthy chase all four were eventually apprehended by the nova corps quill was arrested by rhomann dey who he had previously been arrested by picking him up dey teased quill by mistaking his name as starprince much to his annoyance as he was taken away 2held in the kyln starlord arriving inside the kylnhey hey hey thats mine hey take those headphones off right now hooked on a feeling blue swede 1973 that song belongs to me ―starlord to mean guard srconce they all arrived in their holding cells starlord and the others were forced into a line up by the nova corps where all of their own criminal histories were presented for garthan saal by rhomann dey frustrated by this experience starlord amused himself by giving the middle finger to those looking at him before claiming that it was an accident starlord is taken to the kyln for his sentence the group were all sent to the kyln by saal to begin their sentence where they all arrived together and continued their disagreements quill found himself questioning why groot would only way the same words on repeat and then comparing rocket raccoon to a normal racoon that he remembered from earth quill began questioning what gamora had planned for the orb until eventually she revealed to them that she was planning on betraying ronan the accuser and selling the orb to a third party who she refused to name quill demands to get his walkman back quill then spotted one of the mean guards using his own walkman quill quickly stepped through the doorway into the guards quarters in order to ensure the walkman was not lost forever while the others watched quill confronted the guard and demanded that he put the walkman into storage noting that the song was blue swede as the guard refused and instead used a taser rod to then electrocute quill knocking him to the floor and easily subduing him quill is threatened by the nova corps quill and all the others were then processed by the nova corps as he was stripped down and washed humiliating him when quill then attempted to confront the guards over his treatment quill soon found himself being threatened by armed drones which kept him in his place while being given his prison uniform quill was briefly put into the same cell as rocket racoon where he noticed the cybernetic enhancements attached to rockets back although quill did not comment on them and instead sat in complete silence quill and the others are threatened in the kyln once quill and the other members of the group had been processed and stepped into the prison gamora was threatened due to her own connection with ronan and thanos quill himself then almost found himself a target in the prison when a monstrous inmate attempted to start a fight however quill was saved by both rocket and groot who defeated the inmate in humiliating fashion and declared that quill was their booty and no one else was to go near them quill did not argue and proudly stated that he was indeed with them 2saving gamora quill attempts to sleep while inside the kylnhere’s the point she betrayed ronan he’s coming back for her and when he does that’s when you why would i put my finger on his throat oh this is a symbol this is a symbol for you slicing his throat ―peter quill and drax the destroyer srcquill went to sleep in the group quarters while gamora got her own personal cell where the prisoners continued to threaten her during his night in the kyln quill found himself in a tightly kept room where he had to rest of the backs of the other prisoners however while he could not sleep quill overheard gamora being abducted by one of the guards as well as some of the other prisoners quill watches gamora being ambushed not willing to let her die quill followed the activity along with rocket raccoon where he found moloka dar attempting to slice gamoras throat before drax the destroyer appeared from the shadows and furiously demanded that he be the one to execute gamora in order to avenge his late wife and daughter quill watched as dar handed drax his knife while gamora tried to get free and claimed to be no family to thanos and was the only one able to stop the mad titan quill saves gamora from drax the destroyer as drax furiously pinned gamora to the wall and tried to kill her quill jumped forward and attempted to distract and keep drax from killing gamora when drax noted gamora had tried to kill him quill noted all the women including aaskavariianss who had tried to kill him in the past quill then tried to convince drax that since she had now betrayed ronan the accuser he would likely come for her allowing drax to finally exact his revenge which he soon accepted quill and gamora discuss selling the orb quill had assured gamora that he didnt care about her wellbeing but knew that she would be able to show him where to sell the orb gamora agreed that if they could escape the prison and retrieve the orb for her third party she would split all the profit between them all and groot who rocket berated for sleeping through everything quill promised that rocket would be able to help them escape although rocket noted he still wanted yondu udonta s bounty 2prison break quill discusses rocket raccoon s planwhat is he doing here we promised him he could stay by your side until he kills your boss i always keep my promises when theyre musclebound whackjobs who will kill me if i dont ― gamora and starlord srcthe next day rocket raccoon devised a plan to break them all out of the kyln as a team they would collect a series of items from across the prison which would allow rocket and hack into the security tower quill expressed his fear that the plan would be impossible to pull off but rocket insisted that they try the plan went awry when groot completed the last step first setting off the alarms quill successfully takes a mans false leg as the nova corps began charging into the room to stop groot and while gamora went to collect the angry guard s own cybernetic arm implant quill ran off to steal one legged prisoner s false leg offering the prisoner 30000 units in exchange although the prisoner was highly confused by the offer he soon accepted and quill got the leg as rocket had requested as he charged back outside avoiding the gunfire quill was almost recaptured by one of the guards but was able to use the false leg to quickly defend himself starlord shoots down the attacking drones having taken the subdued guards gun for himself quill made his way towards the security tower shooting at the drones that tried to stop him while quill attempted to continue the mission groot and rocket continued to be fired on by the other drones in order to regain the quarnyx battery groot had stolen causing chaos for all the other prisoners rocket continued his part of the plan until he was finally ready for all of the others to regroup with him quills life is saved by drax the destroyer quill began climbing up groots leg in order to get into the security tower but soon himself defenceless and with a drone aiming its guns directly at him however before quill could be killed he was assisted by drax the destroyer who joined them in order to find and kill ronan the accuser drax celebrated ripping the drone apart with his bare hands while referring to quill as one who had previously laid with an aaskavariian much to quills embarrassment quill and his new allies make their escape once they got into the watchtower and locked the door behind them gamora confronted starlord about why drax had been allowed to join them rocket then revealed that stealing the leg was simply a joke which greatly annoyed quill due to the money he had spent to get it they soon found the head riot guard had gathered his team as they attempt to shoot the watchtower while rocket worked quill began to worry rocket did not have a plan until he managed to turn on the antigravity and flew the watch tower to safety starlord tells the others to go to his ship now safely out of the way of the nova corps quill and the others prepared to escape into deep space onboard the milano as they all began collecting their belongings quill noticed that the mean guard had stolen his walkman for himself determined not to lose his most prized possession due to its connection to his mother quill gave gamora his own bag claiming it contained the orb and went to find the guard telling the others to wait for him to get back starlord prepares to fight the nova corps in reality however quill had kept the orb with him to ensure that the others did not leave without him as he knew they would not leave the chance to sell it to their buyer and make a large profile so quill changed into his own clothes and went on his mission to reclaim his walkman starlord fought through all the guards using his quad blasters easily subduing them before they had a chance to fight back when one of the guards he had knocked down complained about seriously damaging his next starlord continued walking past him and shot him once again with a blast of electricity knocking him out while starlord continued searching for his walkman starlord takes back his walkman from the guard having taken out most the the other nova corps guards starlord eventually found the mean guard who was listening to escape the piña colada song on his walkman with the guard distracted by the music starlord sneaked up on his before knocking out the guard who had stolen it with a blow from the orb starlord then focused his efforts on regrouping with the others who were being forced to wait for him to finally return to the ship with the orb starlord flying through space to the milano using his own helmet to survive in deep space starlord then flew outside the prison to the ship where drax the destroyer was amazed by his brave efforts once starlord was back onboard he handed gamora the orb while drax complimented him on all his incredible bravery and questioned what he had left them to collect noting he would be a key ally in the battle against ronan the accuser however when quill then revealed what it was he had gone back for drax then called him an imbecile for risking his life for such an item 2keeping the peace quill finds and confronts rocket raccoonhey nobody is killing anybody on my ship we’re stuck together until we get the money i have no interest in money great that means more money for the three of us ―starlord and drax the destroyer srcon the milano quill found rocket raccoon pulling apart bits of his ship to build weapons including the hadron enforcer quill was furious and told him to stop noting that he did not want any bombs or moon destroying weapons on his ship when rocket suggested putting the bomb in a box he tried to use the box of meredith quill s present to quill to which he insisted he does not touch it quill and the other discussing about the orb quill then asked gamora to give him her buyer s coordinates which she refused to do leading to a conversation about who trusted the other more they began discussing what the orb really was with drax the destroyer excitingly asking if it was a weapon that they could use to kill ronan the accuser leading to an argument between him and gamora which quill was forced to break up as he insisted that nobody kill anyone onboard his ship upon commenting on the large sum that was going to be paid to the group drax claimed to have no interest in money which quill joked meant more money for the rest of them including groot who was listening on quill makes a crude joke about his own ship quill then stated that the dysfunctional group was going to have to start trusting each other if they were actually going to start working together as a new team but gamora showed little interest in having anything to do with any of them after they had all sold the orb as gamora walked away from the group she noted that quills ship was filthy to which quill claimed that under a black light it would look like a jackson pollock painting much to the disgust of rocket 2trouble on knowhere quill and the guardians arrive at knowherefour billion units rocket come on man suck it up for one more lousy night and were rich fine but i cant promise when all of this is over im not going to kill every last one of you jerks ―starlord and rocket raccoon srcwhile practicing with his quad blasters quill was informed that they were now arriving on knowhere a remote criminal outpost in space built in the giant severedhead of a celestial as they explored knowhere quill told the group about his time of the earth describing it as a planet of outlaws which drax the destroyer expressed interest in visiting quill and gamora discuss the upcoming deal the group decided to relax while waiting to meet gamora s contact the collector once he had filled the milano up with fuel quill joined gamora outside and they spent time together where they discussed her relationship with her adoptive father thanos gamora told quill how thanos had murdered her entire family in front of her before her took her into his custody and turning her into a weapon explaining that when he agreed to destroy xandar for a new deal with ronan the accuser that was the moment she chose to betray him quill attempts to share a kiss with gamora gamora asked about quills walkman and why he had gone back for it during the escape from the kyln quill explained that it had been a gift from his mother before her death telling her that he used the walkman to listen to music and dance he even allowed gamora to listen to his music before trying to kiss her however gamora drew her knife and held it directly to quills throat refusing to kiss him and accusing him of trying to trick her which he denied quill breaks up rocket raccoon and drax however they were interrupted by the fight that had just broken out between drax rocket raccoon and groot quill broke up the fight then told them that their lack of trust for others has prevented them from ever making friends as rocket still tried to fight quill reminded him to sell the orb for billions of units first then he could leave them for good however quill could not stop drax from leaving as he was furious that he still had not had a chance to kill ronan 2meeting the collector quill stands inside the collector s museum these carriers can use the stone to mow down entire civilizations like wheat in a field theres a little pee coming out of me right now ― collector and starlord srcwhile the group let drax the destroyer walk away they were then greeted by carina the assistant of the collector who invited them into the collectors museum which housed several species and items in cages including dark elves and howard the duck quill took a step back and watched as the collector then greeted gamora and questioned if he could buy groot from them as he wished to have his corpse in his own collection some day quill then presented the orb to the collector briefly dropping it onto the floor quill learns the history of the infinity stones as the collector began to open the orb he explained that it was in fact one of the infinity stones an item of immeasurable power that was capable of destroying entire planets and kills all but the most powerful beings who wield it the collector then showed the group footage of one of the celestials using the orbs power to destroy a planet as quill claimed it was scary enough to make him pee while the collector marvelled at the power stone in the orb quill and gamora avoid the orb s explosion with his demonstration now over rocket raccoon insisted that the collector now pay them for their trouble before the collector could pay them all however his tormented assistant grabbed the stone triggering an explosion that engulfed his collection while ripping the screaming carina apart from the inside the team barely managed to survive the explosion as groot pulled rocket outside while quill and gamora hid behind a desk and barely dodged the flames 2skirmish on knowhere quill argues about where to take the orbi saw you out there i dont know what came over me but i couldnt let you die i found something inside of myself something incredibly heroic i mean not to brag but objectively ―starlord to gamora srcas they left the collectors museum with the power stone now back incased within the orb quill found that rocket raccoon was utterly horrified by seeing that they still had the orb after witnessing its true power claiming that they should just give it back to ronan the accuser and escape quill suggested they give it to yondu udonta in exchange for money quill is cornered by yondu udonta s ravagers before they could continue arguing ronan and nebula arrived with their entire army of sakaarans behind them having learned that drax the destroyer had called his enemy for a chance to kill him to avenge his murdered family quill looked on in horror before realizing that udonta and his own team of ravagers had also arrived to find and capture him with limited options gamora attempted to flee with orb only to be pursued by nebula while quill followed behind starlord pilots one of the mining pods taking command of mining pods alongside rocket quill and rocket assisted gamora in fighting off the sakaarans necrocraft which were attempting to shoot her out of the sky in order to reclaim the orb during their arial battle starlord and rocket managed to destroy many of the sakaaran ships as quill recommended to rocket that they begin using the mining pods as battering rams causing ronans battle ships to crash land on knowhere and then explode starlord takes control of a necrocraft s guns while drax fought against ronan on the ground starlord attempted to gain the advantage in the fight by using his mining pods claws to rip open one of the necrocraft and pull out the sakaaran driving it starlord then proceeded to use the necrocrafts weapons to shoot the other ships out of the sky trying to allow gamora to get away with the orb however despite starlords best efforts gamora had eventually found herself cornered by all of nebulas ships starlord watches gamora freezing to death with no other choice gamora was forced to fly out into deep space where nebula destroyed her pod and retrieved the orb leaving her sister to die in space starlord and rocket watched this from afar as their mining pods did not have the power to get closer rocket recommended they turn back before they got trapped but starlord refused to allow gamora to die calling yondu udonta and telling him his location starlord made his decision to save gamora quill saving gamora from freezing in space starlord proceeded to exit his pod and flew through deep space to reach gamora despite all of rockets protests that he would not be able to survive in the extreme conditions of deep space refusing to listen to rocket starlord gave gamora his mask to help her survive while his own body began to freeze from the extreme cold and lack of oxygen before quill could suffocate and die in space they were both then surrounded by the eclector piloted by udonta quill claims all his own actions were heroic with moments to spare starlord and gamora were rescued by the ravagers and udonta who then teleported them onboard looking gamora in the eye quill told her that he had not been able to bring himself to allow her to die claiming that he was being very heroic in doing so as quill revealed that ronan the accuser had reclaimed the orb during the battle kraglin obfonteri and a team of ravagers then held them at gunpoint and took them into their custody 2deal with yondu quill is furiously confronted by yondu udontaif you kill me now you are saying goodbye to the biggest score you have ever seen the stone i hope you got something better than that because ain’t nobody stealing from ronan  ―peter quill and yondu udonta srcwhile on yondu udonta s ship quill was beaten and mocked by his former boss who was still furious that quill had betrayed them and stolen the orb from morag to try and sell it himself quill argued with udonta about how udonta claimed quill should be grateful that he wasnt eaten by the other ravagers which enraged quill as he noted that udonta had been threatening that every since he had been taken from earth by udonta all those many years earlier quill makes a new deal with yondu udonta udonta lost patience and aimed his yaka arrow at quill throat quill attempted to talk udonta out of killing him by telling him that he now knew where the orb was and claiming that they could work together to retrieve it knowing the orb was with ronan the accuser udonta claimed that it was impossible to steal it from the kree however quill noted that with gamora s help they may have a chance to exploit his weaknesses at which point udonta dropped the arrow quill orders rocket raccoon to stop attacking while quill udonta and the other ravagers celebrated the new deal suddenly rocket raccoon fired at the eclector from the milano quill and the others ran to investigate as they all saw that rocket was explaining that drax the destroyer was aiming the hadron enforcer at the eclector and threatened to blow it up with quill and gamora were not freed rocket gave a short countdown until drax fired however luckily quill just managed to defuse the situation in time 2uniting the team deal with the ravagers quill discussing the plan with yonduwhen i look around at us do you know what i see losers i mean like folks who have lost stuff and we have man we have all of us our homes our families normal lives ―starlord srcback on the milano quill berated rocket groot and drax about their foolish attempt to rescue them from yondu in which they would have destroyed the ship if yondu hadnt handed them over in just five seconds quill told the group that he has a plan to stop ronan as they could not simply stand back as ronan kills billions of innocent people when he destroys xandar rocket argued that they plan meant certain death for them all however the entire group agreed and were willing to put their lives on the line to stop ronan with the rest of the team on board quill came out with a plan and recruited the ravagers help yondu told quill that if he did not give him the stone at the end of the battle he would kill him quill then called rhomann dey and told him of his plan asking for the help of the nova corps 2battle of xandar quill pilots his ship in battlethis plan of yours is truly crazy hey youre the one who said you wanted to die among friends ― gamora and starlord srcronan arrived on xandar with the dark aster and thousands of sakaaran soldiers quill and the ravagers engaged them in a massive ariel battle while kraglin and rocket shot a hole in the side of the ship to allow quill and yondu udonta to board yondus ship was shot down in the battle and for a moment it appeared that they would not be able to defeat ronans army however the nova corps arrived helped in the battle quill was able to land his ship inside the dark aster quill and drax on the dark aster as the nova corps hold off the large ship by creating a forcefield quill groot and drax fought their way to ronan while gamora battled nebula they were attacked by a squad of sakaaran soldiers led by korath the pursuer during the fight drax managed to kill korath eventually they made it to ronan and quill shot him with the hadron enforcer however ronan is unaffected by the attack for a moment they were defenseless drax was held by the throat by ronan but before he could kill them rocket comes crashing in with his own ship heavily damaging the dark astercausing it to crash quill saving rocket raccoon quill pulled the injured rocket out of the crashed ship and he joined the rest of the group believing ronan to be dead and their own lives to be lost when the ship crashed to the ground however they were protected from serious injury by groot who shielded them seemingly at the cost of his life making a dome around the team when the dark aster crash landed to the ground groots body was destroyed and the rest of the team survived with only minor injuries they looked to each other to ensure they were all okay only to witness ronan the accuser unharmed exiting the wreckage of his ship 2self sacrifice challenging ronan to a dance offyou said it yourself bitch were the guardians of the galaxy ―starlord to ronan the accuser srcronan began to mock the injured team calling them the guardians of the galaxy which everyone took a liking to as he prepared to use the infinity stone to destroy xandar quill seeing no other opinion distracts ronan by dancing to  ooh child  by the five stairsteps and challenging the war monger to a dance off while ronan starred at quill with utter confusion the time allowed drax and rocket to repair the hadron enforcer and use it to destroy his hammer as the infinity stone hung in the air quill willingly sacrificed himself and grabbed the stone quills body is ripped apart by the orb the stones power began to rip quills body apart causing him unbearable pain gamora comes to quills aid asking him to take her hand hearing those words makes quill hallucinate which he sees an image of his dying mother asking him to take her hand but snapped out of the hallucination after hearing gamora calling out to him again then takes her hand with both of them taking the pain drax comes in and hangs on to quill shoulder taking the pain as well along with rocket grabing on to one of drax fingers also taking the pain from the stone between all of them they successfully absorbed its power and were able to control it ronan stared in horror demanding to know how it was possible quill responded that they are the guardians of the galaxy the four then directed the orb s power to blast ronan obliterating him quill after the battle with ronan and his army now destroyed yondu udonta demanded that quill hand over the orb despite quill telling him that it is only safe with the nova corps quill tricked yondu into taking a container supposedly containing the stone but actually contained a troll doll  as the ravagers left xandar they remarked that it turned out well that they did not deliver quill to his father as a child after the ravagers left back on xandar quill spoke to gamora about how although they would now want him dead the ravagers were the only family he had ever known gamora told him that wasnt true anymore quill gave the real orb to the nova corps 2the guardians of the galaxy quill about to leave xandar with his team what should we do next something good something bad bit of both well follow your lead starlord a bit of both ―starlord and gamora srcquills group now known as the guardians of the galaxy had their criminal records expunged by the corps and quill learned that he is only halfhuman his father being part of an ancient species that could wield the infinity stone without being destroyed quill finally opened the last present he received from his mother a second cassette tape filled with her favorite songs the guardians left in the rebuilt milano accompanied by a twig recovered from groot which was already regrowing 2battle on sovereign starlord monitors the incoming abiliskshowtime aholes it will be here any minute ―starlord srca few months after the battle of xander the guardians of the galaxy were hired by the high priestess ayesha leader of the sovereign race to defend some interdimensional batteries from a creature known as the abilisk during the fight quill and the guardians were badly beaten until quill and rocket forced the creature to look up exposing a neck wound that gamora widened to kill the creature afterwards the guardians were thanked by ayesha who handed over nebula as part of a trade due to having been arrested by the sovereign while flirting with quill and discussing natural reproduction with him ayesha also made various disparaging comments about quills hybrid status that slightly upset him as it caused him to wonder once again who his father was 3skirmish with the sovereign starlord attempts to escape the sovereignlooks like an entire sovereign battle fleet is right behind us why would they do that probably because rocket stole some of their batteries drax i mean what batteries he did not do that ―quill drax and rocket srclater after apologizing to gamora for supposedly flirting with ayesha  something she didnt care about  drax the destroyer told him he had no chance with her since he was a dancer whilst gamora was not the guardians of the galaxy were then attacked by a sovereign fleet and discovered that rocket raccoon had stolen the anulax batteries from them starlord and rocket tried to pilot the milano to safety but their arguments over who was the more capable pilot caused them to run into a sovereign fleet trap the ships were then suddenly destroyed by a mysterious figure in a ovalshaped vessel but due to the damage caused to the milano they crashed on another planet 3reunion with his father meeting ego starlord is reunited with his long lost fatherafter all these years i found you and who the hell are you i figured my rugged good looks would make that obvious my name is ego and im your dad peter ―ego and peter quill srcas the milano crash landed on berhert the guardians of the galaxy got out and immediately began arguing over who was responsible for the incident with starlord and rocket raccoon both blaming each other for the crash as they were still all arguing the guardians were almost immediately greeted by their saviors who were revealed to be ego and his servant mantis when asked who exactly he was ego introduced himself as quills own long lost father quill and ego discuss their long lost histories the group set up a camp fire where ego explained that he had been searching for quill ever since yondu udonta and his ravagers had failed to deliver him as he was paid to do so when asked how he had found them ego claimed that even as far out as he resided he had heard stories of starlord and his great victory over ronan the accuser during the battle of xandar ego promised quill he would take him to his home planet and explain to him his true heritage while also getting to be the father to quill that he had always wanted to be though initially skeptical gamora persuaded quill that he should go with ego to see egos own planet and finally learn the truth quill gamora and drax head off with ego quill decided to take the risk and go along with ego to see if he was telling the truth the next day drax the destroyer and gamora accompanied quill ego and mantis on board egos ship whilst rocket and groot were told to remain on berhert in order to repair the ship and guard nebula to ensure that she did not attempt to escape while onboard egos ship quill watched as mantis used her powers to help ego sleep during the long journey mantis feel the emotions of quill on the way mantis revealed her ability to feel the feelings of others and demonstrated by touching quill and revealing his feelings for gamora to everyone in the room when drax burst into hysterics at the announcement quill became defensive arguing that it was not that funny though he was clearly embarrassed quill is welcomed onto ego s home planet arriving on egos planet ego revealed that he was a celestial and explained his origins he revealed that the planet was a part of him and his human form was an avatar body he walked in to explore the galaxy and seek other lifeforms ego explained how he met quills mother and fell in love with her whilst visiting earth and hired yondu udonta to bring quill to him quill learns of his and ego s true heritage quill asked ego why he then chose to leave his mother behind and ego revealed that he had to return to his planet otherwise his avatar body would die after prolonged distance from his main source ego then helped quill to access his abilities as a celestial which allowed him to create objects greatly exciting quill who then proceeded to play catch with his father using a ball he had created 3egos treachery quill and gamora dance on egos planetit broke my heart to put that tumor in her head what now now alright i know that sounds bad  who in the hell do you think you are you killed my mother ― ego and peter quill srcquill later danced with gamora trying to persuade her that she felt something for him too something she denied gamora revealed her suspicions about the planet as mantis seemed unusually fearful but quill argued that he had finally found his family and demanded to know why she couldnt be happy for him gamora replied that she thought he had found his family with the guardians of the galaxy before walking off due to quills arrogance quill sees eternity ego came to comfort quill afterwards and revealed that he was immortal due to his celestial dna and offered to bring him into what he had been working on excited quill accepted which was overheard by mantis ego explained what he had not told him earlier that when he found life he was disappointed by it which helped him find meaning then hypnotized quill into helping him before continuing to tell his plans to him ego revealed that he planned on improving the universe by planting parts of himself in every planet he visited his plan was to bring all the planets together to become a part of himself starlord is captured by ego s light tentacle he revealed that on every planet he went to he would impregnate one woman to activate the part of himself needed for his expansion as he needed two celestial beings to active the seeds he had left on each planet ego also had yondu udonta deliver some of the children to him however they never inherited his genes until quill as quill listened in forced silence ego cried out that he was no longer alone reminding quill of his friends the bond he has for his friends and his mother along with egos revelation that he had caused the death of meredith quill enabled quill to break free of egos control in anger quill attacked his father only to have his weapons destroyed and ego begin his expansion harnessing his son to achieve his plan however quill escaped when ego was crushed by a ship piloted by rocket raccoon and yondu as mantis drax the destroyer gamora and nebula arrived to save quill after learning of egos treachery from mantis 3battle on egos planet starlord and yondu udonta piloting the laser drill listen to me you are a god if you kill me youll be just like everybody else whats so wrong with that no ―egos final words to starlord srcmantis explained that ego s only weakness was his brain at the core of the planet so starlord and yondu udonta piloted the industrial craft underground tunneling through the planet surface they arrived to find egos brain sealed in a core that was connected to the rest of the planet and began cutting into it knowing they only had a limited time before ego found them they were interrupted when the sovereign fleet arrived causing drax the destroyer mantis and gamora to fall out of the craft mantis used her power to subdue ego by putting him to sleep whilst starlord rocket raccoon and groot flew to the core to plant a bomb on ego made from the anulax batteries stolen from the sovereign and nebula and udonta piloted the ship starlord defended the core from the sovereign while rocket gave groot the bomb temporarily taking a break to ask if anyone had any tape to put over the death button starlord argues with rocket raccoon he then argued with rocket after the answer being no with groot running off whilst still being unsure about how to operate the bomb quill continued to fight the sovereign before being shot at and knocked back into the ship when the ship exploded after nebula hacked herself into the infrastructure quill floated down with udonta who used his yaka arrow commenting that the udonta looked like mary poppins and assuring him that he was very cool mantis was then knocked out by a piece of shrapnel which awoke ego who began to fight the guardians of the galaxy after subduing all of them ego resumed using his power to force quill into reactivating the seedlings around the universe however from udontas encouragement and advice how he uses his arrow quills love for his mother and the bond he had with his friends even for udonta was so strong it helped him unlock his own celestial power to fight his father creating a giant rocklike glove to punch him quill distracted his father enough to free nebula and udonta from his grasp and stop the seedlings quill also used his celestial powers to construct a rocky giant avatar resembling pacman to hit ego with starlord fights off all of ego s many attacks both eventually collapsed into exhaustion with ego furiously trying to plead with quill to help him after discovering the bomb on his brain ego told quill that with ego dead quills powers would fade away and he would be rendered mortal quill stated that he accepted this fact much to his fathers horror he held him down as the bomb exploded destroying egos brain and grievously watched as his fathers avatar passed away in his arms while his celestial powers seemingly faded away 3yondus sacrifice starlord being saved by yondu udonta without ego s essence the planet began to break down and collapse in on itself a ship piloted by kraglin obfonteri rescued the other guardians leaving quill stranded at the core yondu udonta saved quill with an aerorig telling him that ego may have been his biological father but he wasnt his daddy before giving him the only holographic space suit quill tried to give to yondu who silent told him that it was okay as yondu died from the vacuum of space quill broke down crying 3yondus funeral quill pays tribute to yondu udontaboth yondu and david hasselhoff went on kickass adventures and hooked up with hot women and fought robots i guess david hasselhoff did kind of end up being my dad after all and it was you yondu i had a pretty cool dad ―starlord about yondu srcin the wake of yondu udonta s death quill came to realize that udonta was the father figure in his life he had always been searching for before kraglin obfonteri and the other guardians of the galaxy burned the body as part of a ravager funeral obfonteri gave quill a zune that udonta had bought for him that contained 300 tracks that everyone on earth was now listening to while quill gave him udontas yaka arrow  quill watches the ravagers farewell quill listened to his new zune with groot before noticing the arrival of the other ravagers who had heard about udontas sacrifice and reaccepted him as one of their own with the tributes being led by stakar ogord quill and the other guardians of the galaxy watched as udonta was honored with a proper ravager funeral and gamora hinted to quill that she may reciprocate his feelings with the two embracing 3adolescent groot quill argues with a teenage grooti am not boring youre boring you know whats boring sitting there playing that mind numbing game whats boring is me tripping over your vines everyday im not boring i am groot and now i know how yondu felt ―peter quill and groot srcyears later quill told a nowadolescent groot to tidy his room and to stop wasting his time playing a video game quill then noted that groot acted the same way he had as a teenager commenting that now he knew how yondu had felt when dealing with him when he was one 4 5personalityyou got issues quill―rocket to quill srcpeter quill was abducted from earth by the thieves and smugglers called the ravagers their leader yondu udonta raised quill and showed him how to survive in deep space yondu also taught quill how to be the perfect thief peter quill is naturally upbeat and sarcastic and is known for looking on the bright side it seems that his 1980s pop cultureladen references his life on earth he is also very protective of his sony walkman that was given to him by his mother this was shown numerous times when he attempted to assault a prison guard who took it and when during the prison break when quill made his way back into the prison just to retrieve the device later quills anger for his father was more focused due to ego breaking the walkman despite the confession that ego had also murdered his mother being a memento of his mother its quite understandable why quill was so protective and possessive of his walkman before joining the guardians quill lived in the ways of an average criminal and thug going so far as killing korath s men and attempting to kill korath himself when they seemingly threatened his well being as they were arresting him for interrogation by ronan although he only attacked them when he was aware that he could get the drop on them and win as well as when he knew that he could not convince them to let him go however he merely stunned and knocked out the guards on the kyln with his quad blasters instead of using lethal force which shows that he only would kill to defend himself or in battles with foes that are outside the law such as ronan and koraths men he is very conscientious of his physical weaknesses which prevents him from acting impulsive as he is always aware of the dangers of his actions especially in combat quill has shown he can be heroic he was unwilling to watch gamora die in space so he exited his pod giving gamora his mask saving her life nearly at the cost of his own he was also the one who brought the guardians together to save xandar showcasing his leadership qualities and a certain amount of charisma since all the members were wellknown outlaws while not showing it often  quill does have romantic feelings for gamora even though she puts up a serious and cold demeanor towards him  she also reciprocates his feelings quill can create inventive and often extremely unorthodox solutions to problems on the fly his confrontation with ronan the accuser is an example of this distracting him long enough for rocket and drax to put the enforcer back together to destroy ronans hammer to break loose the stone due to being raised as a child by aliens having possibly not learned just how weak humans are compared to other beings he never suspected that he was half alien himself and assumed his inhuman resilience to be normal for any creature quill is also quite sarcastic  similar to tony stark and stephen strange  powers and abilities powerslisten to me you are a god if you kill me youll be just like everybody else whats so wrong with that no ―egos final words to starlord srchybrid physiology due to his heritage he is part celestial and part human giving him superhuman abilities ego explained to him that as long as the light of the planet which is egos essence is alive peter quill has celestial powers however after the death of ego quill apparently became a regular human superhuman durability due to his paternal heritage from ego quill was able to physically withstand the exposure to the energy from an infinity stone he held the power stone for a short length of time without dying and was able to harness its power when sharing the burden with the other guardians quill himself also noted that he was able to survive numerous injuries while working for the ravagers though none were implausible enough to raise any suspicion former powerswell get ready for a 800foot statue of pacman with skeletor and heather locklear  ―starlord being ecstatic over his newfound celestial powers srcmolecular manipulation while battling ego yondu udonta s encouragement allowed starlord to realize his ability to manipulate matter he used it to propel himself into the air at a high velocity he was able to construct things and weapons out of matter such as gloves of rock to punch his father and later he enveloped himself into a giant pacman to counter the giant materialized by his father energy manipulation while on egos planet ego taught him how to manipulate energy and how to use it to create solid constructions by drawing energy from the planet he once created a ball to play catch with his father like he always dreamed of he can even empower his fists with energy to produce superhuman physical strikes such as he did with his father moments prior to his fathers death selfaugmentation he use his connection to the light of the planet to enhance his physical strength and durability to the point where he was almost immune to damage allowing him to easily smashing through stone and survive crashing into the ground at bulletlike speed death will remain a stranger to the both of us as long as the light burns within the planet ― ego to starlord srcimmortality while battling his father ego ego told him that as long as egos essence is still alive starlord himself will never die abilities expert combatant quill is an expert in closequarters combat he was able to hold his own against gamora an assassin trained by thanos he uses his two blasters as melee weapons to strike and knock his foes unconscious with a hard strike to the head he was able to take down multiple nova corps kyln and sakaaran soldiers by striking them with the blasters i picked this guy up a while back for petty theft hes got a code name ― rhomann dey srcexpert thief raised by the ravagers quill mastered the art of thievery and evasion though starlord had a criminal record thievery was not one of the charges though rhomann dey picked him up for petty theft expert marksman quill is wellversed in the use of weapons from all over the galaxy but he prefers using his own quad blasters which he is shown to be skilled with he also handled a kyln guards rifle a weapon he was not believed to have even seen before and easily shot and destroyed a drone with it skilled acrobat quill is highly athletic and has high level dexterity reflexes and coordination which notably allows him to do parkour and free running his extreme reflexes allowed him to effortlessly catch a small lunging creature trying to bite him while he was wearing head phones and seemingly distracted by his music he was able to leap several feet across a chasm perform a combat roll while sliding along his ship directly into the cockpit expert pilot quill is an accomplished starship pilot he has used this skill to escape korath and his men on morag multilingual after spending an amount of time with groot quill has learnt to understand what groot is saying despite only hearing i am groot it is possible that this is in fact not a power but more a note to how longwell they know each other equipment weapons hadron enforcer designed and built by rocket raccoon the enforcer shoots a concentrated bolt of nuclear explosive force that only detonates on its target the mass and size of the target determine how large the explosion will be rocket claimed it could destroy a moon he briefly handled the weapon in the guardians plan to kill ronan the accuser but has not held it since quad blasters quill carries dual direct energy weapons in the form of handguns they each have two triggers for the index and middle finger for the top and bottom barrel respectively with the bottom barrel shooting lightning and the top barrel shooting fiery bolts or blasts while the firelike blast on the top barrel is lethal killing its live targets on impact and even sends the target flying backwards with great force the bottom barrel produces streaks of non lethal electricity to electrocute its targets and incapacitate them he has used his two blasters as melee weapons in the past to strike and knock out his foes specifically kyln guards with a strike to the head he was even shown striking enemies with the barrels while shooting the lethal setting which allowed him to hit harder and harm stronger opponents energy bolas a hitech version of an ancient throwing weapon made of weights on the ends of an interconnected energy cord designed to capture targets by entangling their legs during the attack on peter quill starlord used these bolas to try and subdue gamora although she quickly escaped items helmet quill wears a helmet that shows threats on hud and has internal comm systems the helmet allows him to breathe in the vacuum of space when he presses the button on the side of his head a light blue energy wraps around his face and the back of his head and becomes the helmet jet boot attachments quill has jets that he attaches to his boots to make jet boots while he activates them with buttons on his leg the jet attachments can rotate in any direction and can be used to propel him through the air at great speed though they do not allow for sustained flight and only allow him to jump and briefly float for several feet they can also be used in flying in deep space due to the lack of gravity and weight removing the limitations they experience in environments of normal gravity quill improvised the technology as weapons by attaching one of them on a hostile and activated them which sent the target flying backwards translator implant starlord has a translator implanted in his neck that helps him understand many of the languages of almost every known species in the universe starlord uniform  the uniform protects quill from the effects of absolute zero temperature of deep space as well as its vacuum aerorigs peter uses one of rocket raccoons jetpack like devices to seemlessly fly through the air giving him great mobility in combat unlike his jet boot aerorig allows quill sustained flight to any altitude plasma sphere one of peter quills gadgetry and weapons is a glass like ball that much like a glowstick lit up when shook it was dangerous when shattered as it could ensnare and disintegrate living creatures in a cloud of its released plasma though it quickly diminishes holographic map part of his arsenal and tools is a holographic device given him by the broker able to project and holographic map on the planet morag of the size of a foot ball field and projects what was there before even people moving around quill scanned the ruined temple area of morag and could identify the creatures and people living their before it could also highlight a certain area red to show star lord where it detects a certain object this is how quill knew to go up the temple stairs to find the orb gravity mine a device that could exert greater amounts of the force of gravity on a designated object and gravitate it towards itself was in quills possession it can generate gravity as powerful as a planet and pull something to itself as if the object were in a planets orbit if it is not programmed to pull a certain object while active it will pull everything in a 1 foot radius towards itself at great speed quill used this to incapacitate koraths troops before it was shot and destroyed earth memorabilia much of his personal items from earth traveled with him when he was taken by the ravagers as a child his ship the milano now houses this memorabilia with the songs from his walkman being able to be played on the ships sound system with what appeared to be a stereo being added to the ship peter quills walkman sony tpsl2 walkman headset  quill is very protective of his sony walkman when deprived of it in prison he challenged a guard for its return but was electrocuted in response he received it from his mother along with two mix tapes containing several songs from the 60s all the way through to the 80s unfortunately this walkman was destroyed by ego after revealing to peter that he put the tumor inside meredith quills head awesome mix vol 1 meredith quill put together a mixtape named awesome mix vol 1 so that her son could listen to songs she used to listen to when she was growing up awesome mix vol 2 when meredith was dying from cancer and gave her son a second mixtape as a gift as moments before she died however quill never opened his gift and kept the tape as one of the few mementos from earth after he and the other guardians of the galaxy members saved xandar from ronan he finally opened his mothers gift unfortunately the cassette was inside the walkman when ego crushed it troll doll a type of plastic doll with furry upcombed hair depicting a troll quill use it as a memento from earth after the attack on xandar was
