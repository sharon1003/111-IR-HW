decorated by the commanderinchief 73 74 75 since 1941 more than half of the medals of honor have been awarded posthumously 76evolution of criteria  edit19th century several months after president abraham lincoln signed public resolution 82 into law on december 21 1861 for a navy medal of honor a similar resolution was passed in july 1862 for an army version of the medal six union army soldiers who hijacked a confederate locomotive named the general in 1862 were the first medal of honor recipients 77 james j andrews a civilian led the raid he was caught and hanged as a union spy but was a civilian and not eligible to receive the medal many medals of honor awarded in the 19th century were associated with saving the flag and country not just for patriotic reasons but because the u s flag was a primary means of battlefield communication at the time because no other military decoration was authorized during the civil war some seemingly less exceptional and notable actions were recognized by a medal of honor during that conflict20th century early in the twentieth century the navy awarded many medals of honor for peacetime bravery for instance in 1901 john henry helms aboard the uss chicago ca14 was awarded the medal for saving the ships cook from drowning seven sailors aboard the uss iowa bb4 were awarded the medal after the ships boiler exploded on january 25 1904 richard byrd and floyd bennett were awarded the medal—combat tiffany version despite the existence then of a noncombat form of the navy medal—for the 1926 flight they claim reached the north pole 78 and admiral thomas j ryan was awarded the medal for saving a woman from the burning grand hotel in yokohama japan following the 1923 great kantō earthquake 79 between 1919 and 1942 the navy issued two separate versions of the medal of honor one for acts related to combat and one for noncombat bravery the criteria for the award tightened during world war i for the army version of the medal of honor while the navy version retained a noncombat provision until 1963 in an act of congress of july 9 1918 the war department version of the medal required that the recipient distinguish himself conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty and also required that the act of valor be performed in action involving actual conflict with an enemy 80 this was in reaction to the results of the army medal of honor review board which struck 911 medals from the medal of honor roll in february 1917 for lack of basic prerequisites these included the members of the 27th maine erroneously awarded the medal for reenlisting to guard the capital during the civil war 29 members of abraham lincolns funeral detail and six civilians including buffalo bill cody restored along with four other scouts in 1989 81 and mary edwards walker though the latters was restored posthumously in 1977 82world war ii starting in 1942 the medal would only be awarded for action in combat although the navy version of the medal of honor technically allowed noncombat awards until 1963 83 official accounts vary but generally the medal of honor for combat was known as the tiffany cross after the company that designed the medal the tiffany cross was first awarded in 1919 but was unpopular partly because of its design 84 the tiffany cross medal of honor was awarded at least three times for noncombat by a special authorized act of congress the medal was presented to byrd and bennett see above 85 86 in 1942 the united states navy reverted to a single medal of honor although the statute still contained a loophole allowing the award for both action involving actual conflict with the enemy or in the line of his profession 87 arising from these criteria approximately 60 percent of the medals earned during and after world war ii have been awarded posthumously 88public law 8877 july 25 1963 the requirements for the medal of honor were standardized among all the services requiring that a recipient had distinguished himself conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty 89 thus the act removed the loophole allowing noncombat awards to navy personnel the act also clarified that the act of valor must occur during one of three circumstances 90while engaged in action against an enemy of the united states while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing foreign force while serving with friendly foreign forces engaged in an armed conflict against an opposing armed force in which the united states is not a belligerent party 91 92congress drew the three permutations of combat from president kennedys executive order of april 25 1962 which previously added the same criteria to the purple heart on august 24 kennedy added similar criteria for the bronze star medal 93 94 the amendment was necessary because cold war armed conflicts did not qualify for consideration under previous statutes such as the 1918 army medal of honor statute that required valor in action involving actual conflict with an enemy since the united states has not formally declared war since world war ii as a result of the provisions of the united nations charter 95 according to congressional testimony by the armys deputy chief of staff for personnel the services were seeking authority to

edwin m stanton promised a medal of honor to every man in the 27th maine volunteer infantry regiment who extended his enlistment beyond the agreedupon date the battle of gettysburg was imminent and 311 men of the regiment volunteered to serve until the battle was resolved the remaining men returned to maine but with the union victory at gettysburg the 311 volunteers soon followed the volunteers arrived back in maine in time to be discharged with the men who had earlier returned since there seemed to be no official list of the 311 volunteers the war department exacerbated the situation by forwarding 864 medals to the commanding officer of the regiment the commanding officer only issued the medals to the volunteers who stayed behind and retained the others on the grounds that if he returned the remainder to the war department the war department would try to reissue the medals 164in 1916 a board of five army generals on the retired list convened under act of law to review every army medal of honor awarded the board was to report on any medals of honor awarded or issued for any cause other than distinguished service the commission led by nelson a miles identified 911 awards

who also advised that the war department should not seek the return of the revoked medals from the recipients identified by the board in the case of recipients who continued to wear the medal the war
