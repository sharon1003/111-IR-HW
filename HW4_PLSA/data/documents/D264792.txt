18 1980 catastrophism is the theory that the earth has been affected in the past by sudden shortlived violent events possibly worldwide in scope  1 the dominant paradigm of modern geology is uniformitarianism sometimes described as gradualism  in which slow incremental changes such as erosion create the earths appearance this view holds that the present is the key to the past and that all things continue as they were from the beginning of the world recently a more inclusive and integrated view of geologic events has developed changing the scientific consensus to accept some

deluge myth christians up until the 19th century held dominant scientific beliefs that were founded on the biblical narratives of creation and the universal deluge other ancient deluge myths have been discovered since then explaining why the flood story was stated in scientific methods with surprising frequency among the greeks  an example being plutarch s account of the ogygian flood  2earths history was viewed as the result of an accumulation of catastrophic events over a relatively short time period before the depth of geological time was appreciated in this way they were able to explain the observations of early geologists within the framework of a short earth history cuvier and the natural theologians the leading scientific proponent of catastrophism in the early nineteenth century was the french anatomist and paleontologist georges cuvier his motivation was to explain the patterns of extinction and faunal succession that he and others were observing in the fossil record while he did speculate that the catastrophe responsible for the most recent extinctions in eurasia might have been the result of the inundation of lowlying areas by the sea he never made any reference to noahs flood  3 nor did he ever make any reference to divine creation as the mechanism by which repopulation occurred following the extinction event in fact cuvier influenced by the ideas of the enlightenment and the intellectual climate of the french revolution avoided religious or metaphysical speculation in his scientific writings  4 cuvier also believed that the stratigraphic record indicated that there had been several of these revolutions which he viewed as recurring natural events amid long intervals of stability during the history of life on earth this led him to believe the earth was several million years old  5by contrast in england where natural theology was very influential during the early nineteenth century a group of geologists that included william buckland and robert jameson would interpret cuviers work in a very different way jameson translated the introduction cuvier wrote for a collection of his papers on fossil quadrupeds that discussed his ideas on catastrophic extinction into english and published it under the title theory of the earth he added extensive editorial notes to the translation that explicitly linked the latest of cuviers revolutions with the biblical flood and the resulting essay was extremely influential in the englishspeaking world  6 buckland spent much of his early career trying to demonstrate the reality of the biblical flood with geological evidence he frequently cited cuviers work even though cuvier had proposed an inundation of limited geographic extent and extended duration and buckland to be consistent with the biblical account was advocating a universal flood of short duration  7 eventually buckland would abandon flood geology in favor of the glaciation theory advocated by louis agassiz who had briefly been one of cuviers students as a result of the influence of jameson buckland and other advocates of natural theology the nineteenth century debate over catastrophism took on religious overtones in britain that were not nearly as prominent elsewhere  8the rise of uniformitarianism in geology uniformitarian explanations for the formation of sedimentary rock and an understanding of the immense stretch of geological time or as the concept came to be known deep time were found in the writing of james hutton sometimes known as the father of geology in the late 18th century the geologist charles lyell built upon huttons ideas during the first half of 19th century and amassed observations in support of the uniformitarian idea that the earths features had been shaped by same geological processes that could be observed in the present acting gradually over an immense period of time lyell presented his ideas in the influential three volume work principles of geology published in the 1830s which challenged theories about geological cataclysms proposed by proponents of catastrophism like cuvier and buckland  9from around 1850 to 1980 most geologists endorsed uniformitarianism the present is the key to the past and gradualism  geologic change occurs slowly over long periods of time and rejected the idea that cataclysmic events such as earthquakes volcanic eruptions or floods of vastly greater power than those observed at the present time played any significant role in the formation of the earths surface instead they believed that the earth had been shaped by the long term action of forces such as volcanism earthquakes erosion and sedimentation that could still be observed in action today in part the geologists rejection was fostered by their impression that the catastrophists of the early nineteenth century believed that god was directly involved in determining the history of earth some of the theories about catastrophism in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were connected with religion and catastrophic origins were sometimes considered miraculous rather than natural events  10immanuel velikovskys views main article velikovskyism in the 1950s immanuel velikovsky propounded catastrophism in several popular books he speculated that the planet venus is a former  comet  which was ejected from jupiter and subsequently 3500 years ago made two catastrophic close passes by earth 52 years apart and later interacted with mars which then had a series of near collisions with earth which ended in 687 b c before settling into its current orbit velikovsky used this to explain the biblical plagues of egypt the biblical reference to the sun standing still for a day joshua 1012  13 explained by changes in earths rotation and the sinking of atlantis scientists rejected velikovskys theories often quite passionately  11current application neocatastrophism is the explanation of sudden extinctions in the palaeontological record by high magnitude low frequency events as opposed to the more prevalent geomorphological thought which emphasises low magnitude high frequency events  12luis alvarez impact event hypothesis main article impact event over the past 25 years a scientifically based catastrophism has gained wide acceptance with regard to certain events in the distant past one impetus for this change came from the publication of a historic paper by walter and luis alvarez in 1980 this paper suggested that a 10 kilometres 62 mi asteroid struck earth 65 million years ago at the end of the cretaceous period the impact wiped out about 70 of all species including the dinosaurs leaving behind the cretaceous–paleogene boundary k–t boundary in 1990 a 180 kilometres 110 mi candidate crater marking the impact was identified at chicxulub in the yucatán peninsula of mexico since then the debate about the extinction of the dinosaurs and other mass extinction events has centered on whether the extinction mechanism was the asteroid impact widespread volcanism which occurred about the same time or some other mechanism or combination most of the mechanisms suggested are catastrophic in nature the observation of the shoemakerlevy 9 cometary collision with jupiter illustrated that catastrophic events occur as natural events comparison to uniformitarianism one of the key differences between catastrophism and uniformitarianism is that to function uniformitarianism requires the assumption of vast timelines whereas catastrophism can function with or without assumptions of long timelines today most geologists combine catastrophist and uniformitarianist standpoints taking the view that earths history is a slow gradual story punctuated by occasional natural catastrophic events that have affected earth and its inhabitants  13moonformation main article giant impact theory modern theories also suggest that earths anomalously large moon was formed catastrophically in a paper published in icarus in 1975 william k hartmann and donald r davis proposed that a catastrophic nearmiss by a large planetesimal early in earths formation approximately 45 billion years ago blew out rocky debris remelted earth and formed the moon thus explaining the moons lesser density and lack of an iron core  14 the impact theory does have some faults some computer simulations show the formation of a ring or multiple moons post impact and elements are not quite the same between the earth and moon  15  16  17see also uniformitarianism gradualism paradigm shift punctuated equilibrium occasional periods of sudden
