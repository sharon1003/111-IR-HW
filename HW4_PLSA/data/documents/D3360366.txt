4x day but does not take care of my pain dr is going to take labs on me will be 7 days since i took a methadone only took for 5 days respond to this question report favorite responses 6sort jk jk13 26 apr 2011methadone is a really strange drug that effects everyone who takes it differently thus the reason why youre probably asking this question cause theres no good answer the longer that you take the drug the more of the drug there is that builds up in your liver it however doesnt harm the liver just hangs out there so when you take it for the first week the drug would be out of your system anywhere from 8 to 50 hours according to one source if youve taken the medication for a long time then the clearance rate will of course be much much slower also this is the same reason as to why there is no good conversion rate from methadone to anything else it simply varies too much i know that there are some sources that will quote a conversion but these are never very accurate and are really nothing more than a loose guess if it converts for long term usage hope that this is of some help sincerely jeff kvotes 5 comment vote up report sp springer10 27 apr 2011jk13 when i was on methadone 13yrs my clinic expressly stated that it was a 36hr period in ones system there may be some active metabolites by then but i would go into wd after 24hrs of no use so there are too many variables with the halflife of methadone the first week on it was just as you said after about 8 to 10 hrs id be feeling the ache so to speak add your comment dz dzoo baby 10 may 2011about 25 days in

recedes from the receptors sites slowly when we take opiates in general even short acting ones it can slow your metabolism down making you test positive longer you may be lucky and test clean but you may also pop positive for a couple of weeks for methadone sorry good luck pattishan votes 6 comment vote up report re real dalton 26 apr 2012thank you finally somebody might be able to shed some light on an issue that im having i was on 80 mgs of methadone for about 5 months and then i switched over to subutex stopping the methadone completely its been about 2 weeks since my last dose on 80 mgs and im still testing positive for mtd methadone on a ten panel test everywhere else i search is saying that ti leaves the system after 35 days but i say thats bullshit can you possibly give me a clue as to how long it might be an anonymous 27 apr 2012a few weeks subutex suboxone methadone and benzos actually build in the fat layers in the body plus most of those meds i just listed are supposed to act for a long time your brain is mainly fat so these meds build up in there making you test positive until you metabolize or burn them out i know it is frustrating to keep testing positive for the methadone now that you arent on it but you still could pop positive for a couple more weeks and still be normal in every other way if your dr is questioning you please refer him to a pharmacist or an addiction therapist who will tell him that is normal for a while after coming off methadone any dr who takes the 8 hour subs training can then legally write a subs rx from an opthamologist to a dermatologist and all specialties in between they learn about suboxone in that class not necessarily addiction or what goes on as a result of that addiction you can even print this out and tke it too him so then at least he will know that a person tests positive for methadone for weeks after the last dosepatti view all 7 comments add your comment la laurie shay 27 jul 2011hey geminigurlmethadone
