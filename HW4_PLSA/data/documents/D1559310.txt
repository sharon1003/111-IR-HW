sphagnidae order sphagnales family sphagnaceae genus sphagnum l species list of sphagnum species synonyms 1isocladus lindb sphagnum is a genus of approximately 380 accepted species 2 of mosses commonly known as peat moss accumulations of sphagnum can store water since both living and dead plants can hold large quantities of water inside their cells plants may hold 16–26 times as much water as their dry weight depending on the species 3 the empty cells help retain water in drier conditions hence as sphagnum moss grows it can slowly spread into drier conditions forming larger mires both raised bogs and blanket bogs 4 these peat accumulations then provide habitat for a wide array of peatland plants including sedges and ericaceous shrubs as well as orchids and carnivorous plants 5 sphagnum and the peat formed from it do not decay readily because of the phenolic compounds embedded in the mosss cell walls in addition bogs like all wetlands develop anaerobic soil conditions which produces slower anaerobic decay rather than aerobic microbial action peat moss can also acidify its surroundings by taking up cations such as calcium and magnesium and releasing hydrogen ions under the right conditions peat can accumulate to a depth of many meters different species of sphagnum have different tolerance limits for flooding and p h so any one peatland may have a number of different sphagnum species 6individual peat moss plants consist of a main stem with tightly arranged clusters of branch fascicles usually consisting of two or three spreading branches and two to four hanging branches the top of the plant or capitulum has compact clusters of young branches along the stem are scattered leaves of various shapes named stem leaves the shape varies according to species the leaves consist of two kinds of cells small green living cells  chlorophyllose cells and large clear structural dead cells  hyaline cells the latter have the large waterholding capacity contents1 life

an alternation of generations like other bryophytes the haploid gametophyte generation is dominant and persistent unlike other mosses the longlived gametophytes do not rely upon rhizoids to assist in water uptake 3 sphagnum species can be unisexual male or female dioecious or bisexual male and female gametes produced from the same plant monoecious  in north america 80 of sphagnum species are unisexual 7 gametophytes have substantial asexual reproduction by fragmentation producing much of the living material in sphagnum peatlands 8 swimming sperm fertilize eggs contained in archegonia that remain attached to the female gametophyte the sporophyte is relatively shortlived and consists almost entirely of a shiny green spherical spore capsule that becomes black with spores sporophytes are raised on stalks to facilitate spore dispersal but unlike other mosses sphagnum stalks are produced by the maternal gametophyte tetrahedral haploid spores are produced in the sporophyte by meiosis which are then dispersed when the capsule explosively discharges its cap called an operculum and shoots the spores some distance the spores germinate to produce minute protonemae which start as filaments can become thalloid and can produce a few rhizoids soon afterwards the protonema develops buds and these differentiate into its characteristic erect leafy branched gametophyte with chlorophyllose cells and hyaline cells 9 this stage dominates the environment where sphagnum grows obliterating and burying the protonema and eventually building up into layers of dead moss called peat carpets of living sphagnum may be attacked by various fungi and one fungus that is also a mushroom sphagnurus paluster produces conspicuous dead patches when this fungus and other agarics attack the protonema sphagnum is induced to produce nonphotosynthetic gemmae that can survive the fungal attack and months later germinate to produce new protonema and leafy gametophytes 10 it is unknown whether the leafy stage can produce such gemmae taxonomy and phylogeny  editmain article list of sphagnum species peat moss can be distinguished from other moss species by its unique branch clusters the plant and stem color the shape of the branch and stem leaves and the shape of the green cells are all characteristics used to identify peat moss to species sphagnum taxonomy has been very contentious since the early 1900s most species require microscopic dissection to be identified in the field most sphagnum species can be identified to one of four major sections of the genus—classification and descriptions follow andrus 2007 flora north america red sphagnum closeup sphagnum sect acutifolia plants generally form hummocks above the water line usually colored orange or red examples sphagnum fuscum and sphagnum warnstorfii sphagnum sect cuspidata plants are usually found in hollows lawns or are aquatic and are green examples sphagnum cuspidatum and sphagnum flexuosum sphagnum sect sphagnum plants have the largest gametophytes among the sections forming large hummocks their leaves form cuculate hoodshaped apices and are green except for sphagnum magellanicum example sphagnum austinii sphagnum sect subsecunda plants vary in color from green to yellow and orange but never red and are found in hollows lawns or are aquatic species always with unisexual gametophytes examples sphagnum lescurii and sphagnum pylaesii the reciprocal monophyly of these sections and two other minor ones  rigida and squarrosa has been clarified using molecular phylogenetics 11 all but two species normally identified as sphagnum reside in one clade two other species have recently been separated into new families within the sphagnales reflecting an ancestral relationship with the tasmanian endemic ambuchanania and long phylogenetic distance to the rest of sphagnum 12 within main clade of sphagnum phylogenetic distance is relatively short and molecular dating methods suggest nearly all current sphagnum species are descended from a radiation that occurred just 14 million years ago 13geographic distribution  editsphagnum with northern pitcher plants  sarracenia purpurea at browns lake bog ohio sphagnum mosses occur mainly in the northern hemisphere in peat bogs conifer forests and moist tundra areas their northernmost populations lie in the archipelago of svalbard arctic norway at 81° n in the southern hemisphere the largest peat areas are in southern chile and argentina part of the vast magellanic moorland  circa 44000 square km 14 peat areas are also found in new zealand and tasmania in the southern hemisphere however peat landscapes may contain many moss species other than sphagnum sphagnum species are also reported from dripping rocks in mountainous subtropical brazil 15spore dispersal  editas with many other mosses sphagnum species disperse spores through the wind the tops of spore capsules are only about 1 cm above ground and where wind is weak as the spherical spore capsule dries the operculum is forced off followed by a cloud of spores the exact mechanism has traditionally attributed to a pop gun method using air compressed in the capsule reaching a maximum velocity of 36 meters per second 16 but alternative mechanisms have been recently proposed 17 highspeed photography has shown vortex rings are created during the discharge which enable the spores to reach a height of 10 to 20 cm further than would be expected by ballistics alone the acceleration of the spores is about 36000 g 18 19 spores are extremely important in establishment of new populations in disturbed habitats and on islands 20uses  editpeat moss soil amendment made of partly decayed dried sphagnum moss decayed dried sphagnum moss has the name of peat or peat moss this is used as a soil conditioner which increases the soils capacity to hold water and nutrients by increasing capillary forces and cation exchange capacity this is often necessary when dealing with very sandy soil or plants that need increased or steady moisture content to flourish a distinction is sometimes made between sphagnum moss the live moss growing on top of a peat bog and sphagnum peat moss north american usage or sphagnum peat british usage the latter being the slowly decaying matter underneath 21dried sphagnum moss is also used in northern arctic regions as an insulating material anaerobic acidic sphagnum bogs have low rates of decay and hence preserve plant fragments and pollen to allow reconstruction of past environments 5 they even preserve human bodies for millennia examples of these preserved specimens are tollund man haraldskær woman clonycavan man and lindow man such bogs can also preserve human hair and clothing one of the most noteworthy examples being egtved girl denmark because of the acidity of peat however bones are dissolved rather than preserved these bogs have also been used to preserve food 22 up to 2000yearold containers of butter or lard have been found 23sphagnum moss has also been used for centuries as a dressing for wounds including through world war i 3 24 since it is absorptive and extremely acidic it inhibits growth of bacteria and fungi so it is used for shipping seeds and live plants peat moss is used to dispose of the clarified liquid output effluent from septic tanks in areas that lack the proper conditions for ordinary disposal means it is also used as an environmentally friendly alternative to chlorine in swimming pool sanitation 25 the moss inhibits the growth of microbes and reduces the need for chlorine in swimming pools 26in new zealand both the species s cristatum and s subnitens are harvested by hand and exported worldwide for use as hanging basket liners as a growing medium for young orchids and mixed with other potting mixes to enhance their moisture retaining value peat moss is a critical element for growing mushrooms the fungal mycelium grows in compost with a layer of peat moss on top through which the mushrooms come out a process called casing peat moss dead or alive is also a very important soil and topper for most carnivorous plants in the 7th framework programme mossclone peat mosses multiplied in moss bioreactors are developed as a new tool to monitor air pollution sphagnum is also used in air layering a method of propagation used to propagate woody stems like guavas a ball of sphagnum is tied against a midway ringed bark of a branch still attached on the parent plant using a translucent plastic material vitalon native americans used peat moss as diaper material for their babies and is used to wick away the moisture and absorb the excrement from the baby conservation  editmer bleue conservation area a large protected sphagnum bog near ottawa ontario canada several of the worlds largest wetlands are sphagnumdominated bogs including the west siberian lowland the hudson bay lowland and the mackenzie river valley these areas provide habitat for common and rare species they also store large amounts of carbon which helps reduce global warming 27the u s gets up to 80 of sphagnum peat moss it uses from canada in canada it has been estimated that peat bog mass is harvested each year 60 times less than the mass that accumulates approximately 02 percent of the 270 million acres 422000 square miles of canadian peat bog are used for peat moss mining 28 there are some efforts made to restore peat bogs after peat mining there is some debate as to whether the peat bogs can be restored to their premining condition and how long the process takes ″the north american wetlands conservation council estimates that harvested peatlands can be restored to ′ecologically balanced systems′ within five to 20 years after peat harvesting″ some wetlands scientists assert that ″ a managed bog bears little resemblance to a natural one like tree farms these peatlands tend toward monoculture lacking the biodiversity of an un harvested bog″ 29pitt moss a peat moss alternative made from recycled newspaper has emerged as a sustainable substitute in growing media 30 coir has also been touted as a sustainable alternative to peat moss in growing media 31 another peat moss alternative is manufactured in california from sustainably harvested redwood fiber semiopen cell polyurethane materials available in flaked and sheet stock are also finding application as sphagnum replacements with typical usage in green wall and roof garden substrates 32europe  editeurope has a long history of the exploitation of peatlands the netherlands for example once had large areas of peatland both fen and bog between 100 ad and the present they were drained and converted to agricultural land 5 fig 142 the english broadlands have small lakes that originated as peat mines 33 more than 90 of the bogs in england have been damaged or destroyed 34 35 a handful of bogs have been preserved through government buyouts of peatmining interests 36 over longer time scales however some parts of england ireland scotland and wales have seen expansion of bogs particularly blanket bogs in response to deforestation and abandonment of agricultural land 5 fig 118new zealand  editnew zealand has like other parts of the world lost large areas of peatland the latest estimates for wetland loss in new zealand are 90 over 150 years 37 in some cases better care is taken during the harvesting of sphagnum to ensure enough moss is remaining to allow regrowth an eightyear cycle is suggested but some sites require a longer cycle of 11 to 32 years for full recovery of biomass depending on factors including whether reseeding is done light intensity and the water table 38 this farming is based on a sustainable management program approved by new zealands department of conservation it ensures the regeneration of the moss while protecting the wildlife and the environment most harvesting in new zealand swamps is done only using pitchforks without the use of heavy machinery during transportation helicopters are commonly employed to transfer the newly harvested moss from the swamp to the nearest road references  edit tropicos isocladus lindb sphagnum on
