how is cellular respiration carried out in the human body extracts from this document introduction how is cellular respiration carried out in the human body all livings need a continuous supply of energy as energy is used in a wide range of process including active transport and protein synthesis with happen in the human body most of these processes need energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate atp which is a chemical substance that can disperse to any part of the cell and release energy every cell produces its own atp by a process of cell respiration cell respiration is defined as controlled release of energy in the form of atp from organic compounds in cells 1 cell respiration can be either aerobic using oxygen or anaerobic without the use of oxygen glucose is often the organic compound used in cellular respiration the chemical reactions that take place in the cytoplasm break down the glucose into a simpler organic compound called pyruvate in these reactions a very small amount of atp is produced using energy released from glucose read more middle lastly atp is created in the electron transport chain through a channel of protein in stage one of cellular respiration where glucose is broken down in the cytoplasm glycolysis occurs during glycolysis one six carbon molecule of glucose is broken down into three pyruvates this is helped by the use of enzymes pyruvate is an ion and a molecule that can either gain or loss one or more electrons pyruvate being an ion makes up a three carbon organic acid called pyruvic acid even after glycolysis the pyruvate contains energy that had been once stored in the six carbon compound which is the glucose molecule glycolysis diagram 4 providing that hydrogen atoms are transferred to nad and electron acceptor nadh can be produced nadh assists during glycolysis as the nadh gives electrons to other organic compounds as a consequently to this nad is produced that can then accept more electrons apart from pyruvates being produced during glycolysis four atp molecules are also produced read more conclusion then the enzyme called coenzyme a co a is combined with the left over acetyl co a and is then fed into the kerbs cycle secondly citrate is formed when the acetyl group from acetyl co a joins with oxaloacetate from the previous krebs cycle then the citrate is converted into its isomer isocitrate which is then oxidized to form the 5carbon ketoglutarate this step releases one molecule of co2 and reduces nad to nadh2 3  consequently the ketoglutarate is oxidized to succinyl co a yielding carbon dioxide and nadh2 the succinyl co a then releases coenzyme a and phosphorylates adp into atp succinate is then oxidized to fumarate converting fad to fadh2 the fumarate is hydrolysed to form malate which then is oxidized to oxaloacetate reducing nad to nadh2 3 therefore this cycle is back at the beginning of the krebs cycle as the glycolysis produces two pyruvate molecules from one glucose and each glucose is processed through the kreb cycle twice for each molecule of glucose there are six nadh2 two fadh2 and two atp 3 1 allot andrew 2003 biology for the ib diploma 2 httpwwwgeocitiescomdurandfactbiologycellularrespirationhtm 3 httplibrarythinkquestorgc004535aerobicrespirationhtml 4 httplibrarythinkquestorgc004535glycolysishtml read more the above preview is unformatted text this student written piece of work is one of many that can be found in our university degree miscellaneous section found what youre looking for start learning 29 faster today150000 documents available just Â£699 a month get full access nowor learn more
