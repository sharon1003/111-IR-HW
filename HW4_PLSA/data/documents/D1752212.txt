do you write your social security number on checks to the irs paula january 9 2009do you write your social security number on checks to the irs financially organized taxes 11 comments while the big tax day is still a few months in the future for business owners january 15th is one of the dreaded estimated tax payments deadlines as i was writing out my check to the irs i got to the part where it says “write your social security number and 2008 form 1040es on your check or money order” and wondered in this day and age of identity theft is this such a great idea a little over a year ago nina wrote about “how to prevent identity theft”  all good basic tips when i think about it it seems like a total display of negligence to scribble my social security number in the memo of a handwritten check that will be wander through the postal service into the hands of government processing centers and ultimately back through the banking system yet if i don’t clearly identify myself on the check and it gets separated from the form along the way the chances my payment will be properly credited is about nil on more than one occasion in the past the pa department of treasury has sent me a nasty gram telling me i didn’t pay my taxes when i investigated and dealt with their offices by sending in a copy of my cancelled check it was discovered that the payment was accidentally credited to someone else and that was with my social written on the check according to e how here is what they have to say about this matter in “how to write a check to the irs” write clearly in the memo section of your check your social security number the tax year to which the payment applies and the tax form related to the check 1040 1040a 1040ez – or es for estimated payments i find it fascinating that the irs explicitly tells you to write your social security number on your check then if you hop on over to another venerated government agency the federal trade commission ftc and check out their tips on “deter minimize your risk of identity theft” they tell you don’t carry your social security card in your wallet or write your social security number on a check um ok got it i wouldn’t think of writing my social security number on a check but… uncle sam just told me to i certainly don’t have any earthshattering answer to this conundrum i suppose you could do a hybrid and put the last 4 digits of your social on the tax check but i’m not sure that helps a thing what has been your experience what do you do when you write a check to the irs — do you put your social on it or not if you have been a victim of identity theft how has that changed your approach please share in the comments…share this related tax tidbit 12 avoid common tax return errors march 31 2008in tax tidbitshow to prevent identity theft during tax season march 5 2009in hintstax tidbit 8 benefits of electronic filing efilefebruary 25 2008in tax tidbitsirs ss on checks
