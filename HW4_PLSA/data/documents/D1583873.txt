carnivora family mustelidae genus mustela 1stoats mustela erminea are elusive predators with long slender bodies and short legs 2 the pelage is reddish to ginger in colour with white or cream underparts 2 some individuals turn either partially or fully white in winter 2 the tail has a black tip a feature that allows stoats to be distinguished from weasels 2 the head which is supported by a fairly long neck is triangular in shape and features bright black eyes long whiskers and round ears 4 male stoats are much larger than females 4 at birth the kits are covered with fine white hair and a dark mane of fur forms around the neck after the third week 4 french hermine spanish armiño size female weight 140  280 g 2male weight 200  445 g 2male headbody length 275  312 mm 2female headbody

and a very skillful predator 4 typically feeding on birds and small mammals particularly rabbits and small rodents even taking prey as large as rats and grey squirrels 6 they hunt in a zigzag pattern making use of features such as walls and hedgerows to provide cover probing crevices and holes and often standing alert on the hind legs to look around 4 their exceptionally keen senses help them to locate prey they try to get as close as possible to their target before rushing in and dispatching it with a swift bite to the back of the neck 4 males dogs bucks jacks or hobs 7 and females bitches does or jills 7 live in separate territories which they defend against individuals of the same sex 2 in spring males set off to search for females 2 mating occurs in early summer but births do not occur until the spring of the following year as development of the fertilised egg is delayed 2 for eight to nine months 4 between 6 and 12 blind helpless kits are born per litter 2 after about eight weeks the young stoats begin to hunt alongside their mother 4 females are able to mate before they are fully weaned at just 60 to 70 days of age whereas males are unable to breed until they reach at least 2 years of age 4 females typically stay within or close to the area of birth and males disperse and establish large territories that overlap several female ranges 4 predators of stoats include owls larger carnivores and hawks 2 the average life expectancy of a stoat is just 15 years 5 top stoat range widespread and common throughout mainland britain and ireland 5 and occurs on a number of the larger islands around the uk 5 the stoat is found throughout north temperate and cold parts of eurasia and north america 4 more »species with a similar range common scarletdarter crocothemis

cyaneustop stoat status the stoat is classified as least concern lc on the iucn red list 1 listed under appendix iii of the bern convention and classified as a species of conservation concern under the uk biodiversity action plan 3 top stoat threats stoats are controlled by gamekeepers because they prey on gamebirds 5 historically they were trapped extensively for their winter fur ermine at present competition with foxes declines of farmland bird populations habitat loss 5 and the effects of rodenticides 6 may all be affecting stoats 5 although the current status of stoats in the uk is unclear it is apparent that the population has not shown an increase following the postmyxamatosis recovery of rabbit populations 7 this fact is cause for concern regarding the conservation status of this species 7 top stoat conservation research is currently being carried out to determine whether the populations of weasels and stoats our smallest carnivores are in decline 7 there may be further
