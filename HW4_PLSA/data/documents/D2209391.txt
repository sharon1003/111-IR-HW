what does map term to subject heading mean in databases with a controlled vocabulary or thesaurus like medlines me shmedical subject headings  a checkbox labeled map term to subject heading appears above the command line on the main search page when this is checked ovid applies the mapping process to your search mapping attempts to match the word or phrase that you enter on the command line to an appropriate medical subject heading me sh the suggested terms list that appears shows the me sh terms which are most likely to retrieve documents on your desired topic for example if you type in tylenol the system will map to acetaminophen as the obvious correlated me sh term or if you enter a more general term such as pregnancy the suggested terms list will be much more comprehensive  including all of the pregnancyrelated me sh terms the examples below issustrate the process when using me sh be sure to choose the most specific me sh term s for example if you are searching for arrhythmia selecting the heart diseases subject heading would not be particularly effective because its too broad try to find the subject heading s that best matches your particular topic or concept click the checkbox to the left of one or more term s and follow the prompts you may also want to click on the term itself to display the tree structure which shows the me sh terms family hierarchy and relationship to other potentially useful subject headings why cant i map in some databases some databases like bioethicsline dont have a controlled vocabulary or thesaurus in the ovid system in these cases ovid does not offer the mapping feature instead it searches verbatim for the keyword or phrase you entered on the command line in most databases the search results will include citations with the word or phrase in the titles abstracts identifiers and subject headings what does it mean to explode a search term the explode function searches for an index term subject heading and automatically ors it with all of its narrower terms in other words when you activate the explode function you are searching for the subject heading you originally selected plus all of the subject headings in its family hierarchy during mapping an explode checkbox appears to the right of each me sh term click the checkbox to explode the term results will be posted to a new set on the main search page exploding is important because documents are indexed ie subject headings are assigned using the most specific terms possible so a document about endocarditis would not also be indexed with the term heart diseases heart diseases would be too broad instead articles on endocarditis would be indexed to the most specific subject heading  endocarditis your options would be to search for endocarditis as the subject heading or to explode heart diseases to retrieve endocarditis plus all the other related subjects in the heart diseases tree structure ruleofthumb be sure to use explode for comprehensive searching how do i view the family hierarchy or tree structure for a subject heading during the mapping process you can click on any term that appears on the mapping page to view its complete hierarchy from the tree structure page you can select subject headings or apply the explode function how do i use subheadings if you are using medline cinahl or healthstar which all contain a subject heading mapping feature you will automatically be presented with a subheadings selection page during the mapping process subheadings can be attached to a subject to make it more specific and relevant to your search for example if you are searching for surgical treatments for a ruptured spleen you can attach the surgery subheading to the spleen subject or if you are searching for prevention of hiv in the latino population you can attach the prevention and control subheading to the hiv infections subject heading you may select one or more appropriate subheadings by checking on the box next to each term if you do not check any particular subheading s the system will actually search for all of them a common mistake made by medline searchers is to overuse subheadings this means that searchers have a tendency to check subheadings too frequently because subheadings specify a particular aspect of a topic they effectively reduce the number of citations you retrieve if you find that you are finding too little information you may be overusing the subheadings ruleofthumb only select subheading s if you are certain that you want to limit the retrieval to the few citations that match the specific subheadings you have selected what does the forward slash  mean in a search statement the forward slash  means that the term is a valid controlled vocabulary term which has been searched in the subject headings field of the database if there are no subheading abbreviations after the forward slash  that means that you have selected all subheadings but if there are subheading abbreviations after the forward slash  that means that you have selected subheadings for example if you seehiv infectionspc this means that you have selected the hiv infections subject with the prevention and control subheading attached what does the asterisk  mean in a search statement the asterisk  means that when you were going through the mapping process you selected the focus option selecting the focus option tells the system that the retrieved citations should include your subject heading as a major focus of the articles if you do not select the focus option you will retrieve all of the citations in which your subject heading is a major focus and a minor focus in other words the focus means that you want your subject heading to be emphasized in the articles selecting focus retrieves fewer more precise citations while not selecting focus retrieves more less precise citations for example if you seehiv infections the asteriskindicates that you have selected the hiv infections subject determining that retrieved citations should include this subject as a major focus of the articles what does the exp mean in a search statement the exp means that you have exploded the subject heading see a more detailed explanation of the explode function for example if you seeexp heart diseases the exp indicates that you have selected the heart diseases subject heading along with all of the narrower subject headings in its tree hierarchy how do i search for authors if i only know their last names author searching is most effective if you know the persons last name and first and middle initials when articles are indexed in medline the authors name stanley j bernard is translated to bernard sj so to find articles by this particular individual you would ideally need to know his first and middle initials however it is not necessary to know the first and middle initials in order to search for an author when you invoke the author feature from the icon bar ovid will prompt you with instructions on how to search the author field enter as much of the authors last name as you know ovid will display the author index listing the names which most closely match the name you entered you may then choose from among the displayed names commandlevel search syntax  called direct entry  can also be used enter the authors last name on the enter subject prompt click here for more information on using direct entry commands to bypass menu options on the example below notice that the authors missing initials are replaced by the dollar sign   this is called truncation truncation can be used with author searching to retrieve all forms of an authors name for example if you are looking for articles published by a dr bernard but you do not know his first name and middle initial truncate the author searchbernard  au retrieves all articles written by any author whose surname is bernard regardless of the authors first name  initials this search would retrieve articles by a udrey bernard b rendan j ames bernard c athleen bernard d oris a nn bernard e than l bernard etcbernard s au retrieves all articles written by s bernard regardless of the middle initial this search would retrieve articles by s elma j bernard s ylvia g arland b ernard s amuel b ernard s tanley f b ernard etc sometimes authors use variations of their names when publishing so truncation helps guarantee that you wont miss finding articles simply because of inconsistencies in the authors name for example thomas e starzl a transplant surgeon has published hundreds of articles in the biomedical journal literature usually he uses his full name when publishing  thomas e starzl occasionally dr starzl publishes as thomas starzl  eliminating his middle initial to find dr starzls publications you could search forstarzl te au retrieves all articles written by t homas e starzlstarzl t au retrieves all articles written by t homas starzl this strategy does not retrieve articles by thomas e starzl however because no truncation symbol was used for the middle initialstarzl t au retrieves all articles written by thomas starzl regardless of whether he used his middle initial when publishingstarzl  au retrieves articles by starzl regardless of the first name and middle initials used if you knew that a dr starzl had published a number of articles about transplantation but didnt know that the doctors name is thomas you could use the truncation symbol in place of the first and middle names notice below that search results vary dramatically based on how the truncation symbol is used in conjunction with an authors initials what is the difference between textword and subject searching textword searching looks for a word or phrase in the titles or abstracts of the articles its called textword searching because it searches the original text  titles and abstracts  of the articles subject searching looks for controlled vocabulary terms ie me sh that have been assigned to represent each articles subject content subject searching is more precise than textword searching because subject searching guarantees continuity of language and terminology it also allows you to manipulate the subject by indicating whether to explode what subheadings to select etc consider this example if you are looking for information on hiv and aids the appropriate way to approach the topic is to explode the hiv infections subject heading this will retrieve articles that are indexed to hiv aids the aidsrelated complexes and so on but if you are searching for hivaids as a textword youll have to guess at what terminology the authors have used in writing the titles and abstracts if you do a textword search for hiv youll miss all of the articles that say aids if you do a subject search for aids youll miss all of the articles that say hiv acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and acquired immune defficiency syndrome in other words textword searching runs the risk of missing potentially useful literature how do i learn more about a database information about the scope and coverage of each database can be found on the choose a database page  go to this menu by clicking on the change databases option then click on the i icon located next to the database name if you dont see your question here or if youd like to recommend that we post a particular question contact a
