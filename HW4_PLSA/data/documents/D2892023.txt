a company town around the sawmill and logging camp of robert e lee wilson for whom it is named and his fatherinlaw socrates beall it is an unusually attractive town with its entire downtown commercial district constructed in the english revival or tudor style and its streets all lined with large cottonwood trees r e lee wilson was a mississippi county native who after being orphaned at the age of thirteen in memphis returned to arkansas at fifteen to work as a wage laborer on a farm near bassett mississippi county he began farming a portion of his late father’s land a year later by the time he was eighteen he had traded his cleared farm for more than 2000 acres of timber and had gone into the logging business he established a sawmill at what is today wilson in 1886 with residences and a company store going up at the same time unlike most timber men wilson held on to his cleared land and began farming operations the town of wilson became the center of his operations constructed as a model town its residents enjoyed a standard of living that was higher than the average for most delta residents in the 1930s all households paid 125 to cover basic medical care and had access to healthcare from company doctors at a time when most people had none at all homes were rented for low monthly rates with lawn maintenance and water included in the rental price after wilson’s son r e lee wilson jr and his new bride returned from their wedding trip to england they set out to build a large home in the tudor style from the time it was finished in 1925 all buildings in wilson were built in the same manner existing buildings were retrofitted with brick façades to obtain the tudor styling as well the cottonwood trees that shade the community were one of the first beautification projects they were chosen because they had no commercial value and no one would be tempted to cut them down lee wilson  company operated the town of wilson as a wholly owned subsidiary until after world war ii its residents were all company employees and no tax revenue was collected to assist with maintenance and upkeep of the town by 1945 the town was operating at a considerable loss and the company decided to sell the homes to their owners and incorporate the town this allowed the town access to tax dollars which finally stabilized it financially the average price of a home in wilson at the time was around 4000 r e lee wilson iii who by this time was in charge of the operations believed that individual ownership of homes made the residents happier and more involved in the success of the community with the increased mechanization in agriculture fewer laborers were needed to successfully operate the wilson farming operation residents of wilson began seeking employment elsewhere today most of the town’s residents commute to the larger communities in the region such as osceola mississippi county or blytheville mississippi county to work however since 2012 wilson has undergone significant revitalization with the lawrence group which purchased lee wilson  company in 2010 investing heavily in the community including the installation of free wifi and the renovation of several local buildings the delta school a private academy opened in 2015 wilson is home to hampson archeological museum state park the park is located on five acres on the north side of the town on land
