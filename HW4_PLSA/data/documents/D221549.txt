desert climate animals plants health concerns the desert is dry barren hot and silent not a drop of water for months if the desert is so hostile then how can living things survive first we will look into the desert climate climate there are two main types of desert in the worldthe hot desert and the semidesert the hot desert is usually near the equator a hot desert is usually the sandyegyptian type of desert the semidesert looks like a scrubland the semidesert is the one you usually see on westerns deserts are formed when something gets in the way of rain clouds this can be caused by winds or mountains some deserts are near oceans the mediterranean sea is near the sahara desert california is another good example of a desert by the sea deserts by bodies of water are usually caused by winds mountains also play a roll in forming deserts a rain soaked wind could be strolling along planning a day in the desert when wham a big old mountain jumps in front them then the angry cloud might say where the heck did that mouintain come from being really mad the cloud will drop all of his rain in order to get over the mountain where he can raise a big windstorm in the desert a good place to find plenty of mountains jumping up in front of innocent clouds is by the himalayas a cloud trying to visit his relatives in mongolia might run into the himalayas being a very angry cloud he would drop all of his rain right on india leaving everything behind the himalayas like the gobi desert dry animals when most people think of the desert they think of camels snakes and lizards as being the only animals that live in the desert really there are many more animals living in the desert there are coyotes foxes peccaries tarantulas scorpions ring tailed cats antelope skunks mule deer boars and in some places lions and elephants there is an abundance of small animals that support the deserts population of hawks falcons owls roadrunners buzzards and eagles wood peckers make their homes in the large cactuses here in the oregon desert you can find bobcats and chipmunks and woodchucks among the sycamores most of the animals that live in the deserts have adapted to the desert life very well all desert dwellers have adapted to conserve water food and energy the camel is an example the camel is one of the best survivors in the desert the camel stores fat in its hump camels have long legs to keep the sands heat away and long hair to keep the cold desert nights warmer some animals have special eyelids that they can see through to keep the sand out during a sand storm no matter what the animal each one has a special adaptation plants plant life in the desert is scarce but there are more plants living here than you would expect for example two of the most popular desert plants are the ocotillo which is a leafy green plant that produces flowers the other one is the saguaro cactus which was named arizonas state flower plants in the desert are forced to make many adaptions in order to survive in this dry hot land some adaptions are when rain falls they sprout at that moment bloom quickly ripen their seed in a few days then whither and die other plants depend on underground water most plants have developed roots that grow up to 80 ft long the cactus also survives because it has a thick waxy layer on the outside of its stems and leaves this helps to retain water and protect tissues from intense sunlight other plants store water in their fleshy stems or leaves and are called succulents the desert plants are of great importance to the animals of the desert they find most of their food and water from plants dew left on plants and salt which helps the plant take in water are vital sources of life the whisker cactus provides food for insects goats also feed on a small cactus called the living rock it grows among rocks to camouflage itself as to avoid being eaten by hungry animals health concerns there are many health concerns in the desert a person who is traveling
