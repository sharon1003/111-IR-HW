range so i dont expect you need insulin to control your diabetes at this point i go back to see him in about 3 weeks the janumet hasnt lowered my bg at all yet but ive only been on it 10 days i do feel better much more energy but i suspect thats just from cutting the metformin dose in half with the janumet 1000mgday instead of the 2000mgday i was taking four months of taking 15002000mg of metformin did nothing for my bg but did make me sick and very exhausted ill stop by the doctors office and pick up the actual lab reports so i can see the real resultsnormal isnt enough information for me id like to know if its high normal or low normalmy bg was high 187 at the time so normal insulin levels werent doing the trick in theory i agree that if im making normal levels of insulin i shouldnt need to add more high blood insulin levels worry me as much as high blood glucose levels but then what should i do low carb exercise metformin havent worked so far janumet hasnt worked and i dont feel janumet is a safe drug to take long term if i have insulin resistance will low carb and exercise reduce it eventually lynnw diagnosed 909 a1c 98 at diagnosis taking berberine and glipizide

the whole insulin thing is interesting if youre insulin resistant and your fbg is high i would think your insulin might be high because you are insulin resistant but your fbg could be high because your are insulin insufficient if it is normal but your fbg is high then it means youre insulin resistant it is all confusing it is hard to interpret insulin levels reply lynnw liked this post22810

normal insulin production it says you have deficient insulin production i forget was this an endo or just a gp if it was a gp then it might be a good time to see an endo replyfurball64801 lynnw liked

range is not conclusive information for a doctor to make a decision about prescribing insulin you need to be lower than the reference range to make a strong case for using insulin based on your cpeptide number many dd members are t2s with cpeptide in the low normal range who use exogenous insulindennyhttpantiinflammatoryremarksblogspotcom reply lynnw liked this post30110 5lynnw d d family

would be nonfunctional pancreas type 1 right why is that in the normal range and 69 is pretty low if 00 is the bottom isnt it or is 00 the bottom of the normal range cpeptide came out to 33mgml with a normal range of 1144 all fasting so that does seem normal im more confused than ever if all my numbers are so friggin normal why is my bg so high reply30110 6shanghaied guy d d family t2 since 1996

cpeptide numbers my uninformed analysis would be if your cpeptide is that high on a low carb diet with high bgs then it seems to me like you are very insulin resistant but you do not have all the classic symptoms of insulin reistance and do not seem to benefit from metformin time to find a good endo reply30110 7lynnw d d family type 2  age 62 join date october 2009location northcentral pennsylvania posts  100originally posted by shanghaied guy time to find a good endo yeah maybe i go back to the gp on the 19th if the janumet isnt working by then we may both be scratching our heads ill ask if hell send me to an endo my numbers have dropped a lot from the original 364 so he isnt very alarmed even though they arent anywhere near normal even ada normal they are usually under 200 it just frustrates me no end that after that initial drop nothing i do budges my numbers downward eat dont eat exercise dont exercise take metformin or notno change maybe im just impatient jeanne and other point out that it took them time to get their numbers down reply30110 8ktcwyo retired t2 since at least 2006 age 59 join date august 2008location wyoming posts  100originally posted by lynnw i

if all my numbers are so friggin normal why is my bg so high i have posted this before the range is often what range the lab sees it is not a normal range that you would see from a population of healthy people it is very confusing somewhere there are normal values for nondiabetics maybe you can google insulin values and find a labs website for what is normal that should get you close  but then every lab has a slightly hopefully slightly different range i agree with denny your cpeptide looks high and your insulin is on the low end reply lynnw liked this post30110 9jwags d d family t2

higher numbers he didnt see the urgency to get my numbers down quickly the more research i do i think sometimes high bgs may have to do with inflammation in other parts of our body i know you have had a lot of problem with wheat allergies do you think you may have other allergies that are causing inflammation which may raise bg i know for a long time i think my problem was cortisol production and stress even when i exercised my numbers would hit 200 now i am very conscious of my stress level and try to stay even keeled i do meditation and deep breathing exercises most days i wish i knew more about those test results to give you an answer reply lynnw liked this post30110 10triv moderator t2 dxd 2009 low carb diet metformin januvia join date may 2009location central florida posts  100lynn i take janumet 50500 in addition to 2000 mg daily of glucophage nongeneric metformin it took me some time to start to get my numbers down and yes i do lowcarb when i was first dxd my fasting b was 444 and my a1c was out of this world my endo started me slowly on generic metformin because i had requested generic then later added the janumet in the meantime i had bought dr bernsteins book diabetes solutions and started listening to his webcasts and found that he believed that generic met doesnt work nearly as well as the brandname glucophage and that dr b only prescribes the brandname drug to his patients in two webcasts he stated he believes that the only part of janumet that works is the metformin in it when he wrote his book 2nd edition he raved about januvia but now doesnt feel it works in most diabetics well for what its worth thats dr bs opinion after hearing dr bs thoughts on generic vs nongeneric met i asked my endo for a script for glucophage and told him id heard it works better than the generic to my surprise he said that yes he believed it works better too i still take the janumet tho i am going to ask my endo to stop it and just increase my glucophage by the 500 mg that was in the janumet because tell the truth ive stopped the janumet for a while and noticed no difference in my numbers but i did notice a difference in my numbers with the glucophage vs the generic oh i hate the cost differencefor me its 116 per month for the glucophage whereas the generic was costing me about 10 but i believe its worth it interesting too that my cpeptide was 23 with the reference range being 08  31 ngm l tested back in may 2009 when i was first dxd anyway i know its confusing half the time i see replyjwags lynnw amanda02 liked this post
