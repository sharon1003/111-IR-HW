effects of estrogen deficiency osteoporosis one of the most important health issues for middleaged women is the threat of osteoporosis it is a condition in which bones become thin fragile and highly prone to fracture numerous studies over the past 10 years have linked estrogen insufficiency to this gradual yet debilitating disease in fact osteoporosis is more closely related to menopause than to a womans chronological age bones are not inert they are made up of healthy living tissue which continuously performs two processes breakdown and formation of new bone tissue the two are closely linked if breakdown exceeds formation bone tissue is lost and bones become thin and brittle gradually and without discomfort bone loss leads to a weakened skeleton incapable of supporting normal daily activities each year about 500000 american women will fracture a vertebrae the bones that make up the spine and about 300000 will fracture a hip nationwide treatment for osteoporotic fractures costs up to 10 billion per year with hip fractures the most expensive vertebral fractures lead to curvature of the spine loss of height and pain a severe hip fracture is painful and recovery may involve a long period of bed rest between 12 and 20 percent of those who suffer a hip fracture do not survive the 6 months after the fracture at least half of those who do survive require help in performing daily living activities and 15 to 25 percent will need to enter a longterm care facility older patients are rarely given the chance for full rehabilitation after a fall however with adequate time and care provided in rehabilitation many people can regain their independence and return to their previous activities for osteoporosis researchers believe that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure the condition of an older womans skeleton depends on two things the peak amount of bone attained before menopause and the rate of the bone loss thereafter hereditary factors are important in determining peak bone mass for instance studies show that black women attain a greater spinal mass and therefore have fewer osteoporotic fractures than white women other factors that help increase bone mass include adequate intake of dietary calcium and vitamin d particularly in young children prior to puberty exposure to sunlight and physical exercise these elements also help slow the rate of bone loss certain other physiological stresses can quicken bone loss such as pregnancy nursing and immobility the biggest culprit in the process of bone loss is estrogen deficiency bone loss quickens during perimenopause the transitional phase when estrogen levels drop significantly doctors believe the best strategy for osteoporosis is prevention because currently available treatments only halt bone lossthey dont rebuild the bone however researchers are hopeful that in the future bone loss will be reversible building up your reserves of bone before you start to lose it during perimenopause helps bank against future losses the most effective therapy against osteoporosis available today for postmenopausal women is estrogen see managing menopause remarkably estrogen saves more bone tissue than even very large daily doses of calcium estrogen is not a panacea however while it is a boon for the bones it also affects all other tissues and organs in the body and not always positively its impact on the other areas of the body must be considered cardiovascular disease most people picture an older overweight man when they think of a likely candidate for cardiovascular disease cvd but men are only half the story heart disease is the number one killer of american women and is responsible for half of all the deaths of women over age 50 ironically in past years women were rarely included in clinical heart studies but finally physicians have realized that it is as much a womans disease as a mans influences on bone development increases bone formation speeds bone loss dietary calcium estrogen deficiency vitamin d pregnancy exposure to sunlight nursing exercise lack of exercise cvds are disorders of the heart and circulatory system they include thickening of the arteries atherosclerosis that serve the heart and limbs high blood pressure angina and stroke for reasons unknown estrogen helps protect women against cvd during the childbearing years this is true even when they have the same risk factors as men including smoking high blood cholesterol levels and a family history of heart disease but the protection is temporary after menopause the incidence of cvd increases with each passing year posing a greater risk the good news though is that cvd can be prevented or at least reduced by early recognition lifestyle changes and many physicians believe hormone replacement therapy menopause brings changes in the level of fats in a womans blood these fats called lipids are used as a source of fuel for all cells the amount of lipids per unit of blood determines a persons cholesterol count there are two components of cholesterol high density lipoprotein hdl cholesterol which is associated with a beneficial cleansing effect in the bloodstream and low density lipoprotein ldl cholesterol which encourages fat to accumulate on the walls of arteries and eventually clog them to remember the difference think of the h in hdl as the healthy cholesterol and the l in ldl as lethal ldl cholesterol appears to increase while hdl decreases in postmenopausal women as a direct result of estrogen deficiency elevated ldl and total cholesterol can lead to
