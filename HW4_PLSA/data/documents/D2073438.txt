goldfish anatomy frequently asked questions about goldfish anatomy do they have ears and can they hear can it smell through its nose do scales grow back after injury or disease what are the goldfish body parts called how good is their eyesight how do they breathe through their gills what is a swim bladder are they cold blooded click to see all the types of goldfish do they have ears and can they hear goldfish don’t have external ears but they do have internal ear bone masses called otolith that are suspended above a densely hair covered macular membrane these internal ears are more complex than a human ear since sound vibration in water travel up to five times faster than sound does in air when sound vibrations travel through the water and hit a goldfish they are received through the goldfish’s swim bladder and weberian ossicles the vibrations then enter the internal ears where the vibrations get deciphered and tells the goldfish where that sound is coming form even though the ear of a goldfish is more complex they do not have the same hearing range as a human a goldfish can hear 40 to 3200 hz and a healthy human can hear 20 to 20000 hz many goldfish can pick up on the vibrations or music or even the foot steps of a passerby tapping on the glass of a goldfish aquarium can be harmful to the health of a goldfish a goldfish can become stressed out or even die if the vibrations from the tapping are severe enough vibrations that enter a goldfish aquarium can bounce off the other sides of the tank confusing the goldfish for that reason goldfish in an aquarium are more sensitive to sound than those in a large pond or stream lateral line the lateral line of a goldfish also has the ability to detect vibrations but also senses water currents pressures and motion the lateral line runs along the side of a goldfish’s body from the head to caudal tail this sensory organ is often called a fish’s sixth sense a great resource on goldfish care back to top can it smell through its nose a goldfish has a nose located above it’s mouth but its nares similar to nostrils of humans are not connected to its mouth instead nares are connected to chamber pouches lined with sensory nerve pads a goldfish can smell various odors and chemicals from substances in the water when raised flaps of skin between each nare channels water into its chamber pouch and passes it over thousands of tiny hairs that make up a sensory pad a goldfish can distinguish between sweet sour savory and saline smells and the sense of smell in a goldfish is more powerful than a humans there are odors and chemicals that signal for food chemicals that signal a predator chemicals that signal when it’s breeding time or even chemicals that are given off by wounded or alarmed fish back to top do goldfish scales grow back after injury or disease if a scale is lost due to an illness or injury it will quickly grow back much like how a finger nail grows back but it will lack these rings more about the scales a goldfish’s scales are created in the dermis and are bony plates that over lap like the shingles on a roof as a goldfish grows its scales grow with it when the water is warm in the summer months the goldfish grows fast and when the water is cold in the winter months the goldfish grows slowly under microscope goldfish scales of a mature goldfish will have several growth rings in the summer they grow spread out and in the winter they grow tightly close together by counting the spread out and tightly compacted groups of rings one can get the age of a goldfish skin and slime coat beneath a protective slime coat is the outer most layer of a goldfish called the epidermis the slime coat layer is produced by the epidermis to help cut down surface tension for mobility in the water and it also acts as a protective barrier to fend off fungus bacteria and parasites like ich the epidermis is a very thin delicate layer of living skin tissue that covers the scales the outer layer of skin is so thin that extra precaution should be taken whenever a goldfish is handled a dry net or hand can easily tear it the coloring below the epidermis is the dermis the dermis is layer of skin that contains cells that produce the color of a goldfish there are two types of cells create color the first are called chromatophores which produce ‘true’ color patterns from their pigment granules they are named based on the color that is created by the pigment granules expansion and contraction of these pigment granules dictate what color the goldfish is it’s common for goldfish to be one color and eventually transform into another color several factors that can lead to a color change in a goldfish include water temperature the age of the goldfish the health or it’s diet the other type of cells in the dermis are called iridocytes iridocytes are cells that act like reflective mirrors and give the goldfish its metallic finish silvery guanine in the cells are responsible for their reflective nature unlike the chrmatophores the silvery guanine in iridocytes do not expand and contract it’s the combination of theses cells that are responsible for every color and pattern a goldfish might display these include the metallic self colored goldfish with one solid color a metallic variegated color of two or more colors and calico colors that are created by three different scale patterns the three types include the metallic scales that has guanine present nacreous scales that contain some guanine and the matt scale type that has no guanine present in the dermis back to top quick facts related content goldfish breed types books on goldfish care treat disease and illness tank water conditions caring for goldfish what are the goldfish body parts called back to top how good is a goldfish’s eyesight a goldfish eye contains rods that are responsible for seeing in low light levels known as scotopic vision the goldfish eye also contains cones that are responsible for several things one of which is seeing in color a human eye contains three different chemicals that allow it to see colors but a goldfish eye contains those plus another chemical that allows it to see in the ultraviolet spectrum on top of all of that a goldfish eye contains a thin coating over it that allows a goldfish to see clearly underwater the placement of the eyes on a goldfish limit its ability to see not only does the eye placement create a substantial blind spot right in front of the goldfish it makes it harder to see well at greater distances certain goldfish breeds have added obstructions that make their vision even worse the telescope goldfish has its eyes at the ends of globe like protuberance the pompon goldfish has exterior nasal septa the bubble eye goldfish has fluid filled skin sacks below its eyes the oranda and ranchu goldfish have a wen hood cover that can cover its eyes the celestial goldfish has its eyes pointed upwards back to top how do they breathe through their gills a goldfish does need to breath oxygen but instead of using lungs like mammals they use a pair of gills goldfish gills work much like a pair of lungs but instead use the dissolved oxygen in their water since a goldfish lives its entire live in water it uses osmosis these gills are located right behind the the head and eyes on both sides of the goldfish’s body and covered by the operculum commonly called gill covers the process of breathing for a goldfish starts when it draws in oxygenated water through its open mouth and closes it’s throat and operculum the goldfish then shuts it’s mouth and opens its operculum forcing oxygenated water out through the gills before the oxygen in the water can enter the goldfish’s blood stream it must pass over important parts of the gills the oxygenated water will first get filtered when it hits the gill rakers the gill rakers catch free floating food particles and other waste materials they act much like the hairs inside your nose do to filter out dust and debris after the gill rakers the water passes through the gill arches and then over the gill filaments the gill filaments contain two rows of a series of thin membranes called lamellae the filaments that contain the disclike lamellae are set up to create a large surface area in a small space this allows for a maximum amount of gasses to be exchanged up to 85 of all the oxygen in the water is taken in when it passes over the gills oxygenated water that passes over the lamellae permeate into the goldfish’s blood stream through the tiny capillaries in the lamellae this is a similar process that occurs in lungs of mammals when oxygen gets absorbed through the capillaries in the alveoli that are set up to have a large surface area in a small space at these capillaries clean oxygen enters the goldfish’s blood stream while the byproduct deoxygenated carbon dioxide exits and is forced out into the water through the gill covers note colder water contains more oxygenated water than warm water by keeping a goldfish’s tank water cooler than 70f oxygen levels will be elevated making it easier for goldfish to breath back to top what is a swim bladder for a goldfish’s swim bladder consists of two small gasfilled sacs located near its dorsal region the gasfilled sacs of the swim bladder have the ability to expand and contract from the ambient pressure of the surrounding water the swim bladder sac material contains crystal guanine making it impermeable to gasses a goldfish can add or subtract air into its swim bladder through its gas gland by creating lactic acid and carbon dioxide the hemoglobin of goldfish’s blood looses oxygen and some of that oxygen is diffused into the swim bladder through what is called the oval window these gases can also be diffused back into the blood stream function of a swim bladder the swim bladder in a goldfish work similarly as a ballast tank in a submarine does by adding or subtracting air in the swim bladder the buoyancy of the goldfish allows it to sit submerged at certain depth with out an extra effort the location of the swim bladder in the dorsal region gives the goldfish lateral stability and keeps it from rolling over upside down not only does it help with the buoyancy and stability of the goldfish it assists in its sense of hearing back to top are goldfish cold blooded goldfish like most fish species are coldblooded unlike a warm blooded animal who uses homeostasis to keep its internal body temperature constant the body temperature of a coldblooded goldfish is regulated by external environmental factors when a coldblooded amphibian like a pond turtle is cold it will seek out a nice place to sunbathe to warm its body temperature goldfish don’t have the luxury of getting out of the cold water to warm itself up instead a goldfish simply slows down this is most noticeable in a goldfish pond during winter when the water temperature drops to 50f 10c or below goldfish become less active sit at the bottom of the goldfish pond and eat very little at 40f 5c goldfish go into a semihibernation and don’t eat at all there is little they can do raise their internal body temperature other than sit at the bottom where the water temperature is slightly warmer or seek out any pond heaters to sit next to the main difference between being coldblooded or warmblooded is that warmblooded animals use a lot of their intake of calories to warm their bodies while coldblooded animals don’t have to warmblooded animals need to eat 34 times as much as coldblooded animals a coldblooded goldfish can go a week or more without eating and not die from starvation the goldfish will not look emaciated or show signs of malnutrition but it will be hungry while warmblooded animals would waste away and die a goldfish will just stop growing during extended periods of not eating as soon as food is reintroduced the goldfish will resume growing this makes it okay to err on the side of underfeeding a goldfish as overfeeding is more harmful to a goldfish back to topphoto credits andrew share  like please  thanks
