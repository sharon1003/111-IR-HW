previous proposed lottery reform will not hurt only the philadelphia 76ers next the following players are untradeable cbawhat is a cap hold and why might one matter october 6 2014 mark deeks the calculation of a team’s cap space would you would hope be as easy as looking at their owed contracts to both current and waive players and subtracting it from the salary cap amount for that year nope not close there are a few extra things that go into the determination of a team’s “team salary” amount and by association that team salary amount’s proximity to the salary cap thresholds and of these extra things the most important obvious and prevalent are things we know as “cap holds” there are two types of cap hold – a free agent’s cap hold and a draft pick’s cap hold the first one the free agent cap hold is the most common a free agent’s cap hold is an amount of money that is charged to your team’s salary cap number even though the player is not under contract this is a deliberate ploy that exists to close a loophole if free agent cap holds did not exist it is theoretically possible for a team to have its entire roster become free agents at the same time have their entire cap to spend on other team’s free agents and then use bird rights to resign their own ones afterwards that would be disingenuous and would create a rather ludicrous situation whereby there would be no incentive to ever sign a long term deal in having cap holds your free agents eat into your cap room forcing you to prioritise a bit better the juggling of these priorities is a key component in team building and roster management there are multiple ways to get rid of a cap hold firstly if you waive a player they are automatically removed and so will not have a cap hold secondly if a player signs with another nba team they also no longer have a cap hold to their former team thirdly if a player retires by which it is meant that he properly retires sending official retirement paperwork to the league and not just informally saying that they have retired then their free agent cap hold or ‘free agent amount’ is removed too and fourthly teams can just ask for them to be removed which is called ‘renouncing’ the cap holds players often do not formally retire until they are eligible for their nba pension as there is no incentive to do so prior to that this all can lead to a situation whereby players from years past can have cap holds outstanding to teams they have not played for for years – unless the team has had cap space which has meant renouncing these redundant cap holds for space there is no reason to renounce them there is also no reason not to renounce them yet they gather up over time as archaic relics more than through any conscious effort to keep them around there used to be a reason to keep them around once upon a time having a free agent’s cap hold no matter when they were last with the team meant that the team could still incorporate that player if they were willing into sign and trades as salary filler for trades it would have been an extremely unlikely thing to imagine happening had it not happened twice at the 2007 trade deadline when both the longdeparted aaron mc kie and keith van horn were both signed and traded to complete deals while being unofficially retired and all they had to do to be eligible was never file the retirement paperwork this however is no longer permissible under the 2011 cba now only players who finished the season immediately prior can now be signed and traded and the ancient the cap holds remain only as archaic relics they are not automatically renounced unless the retirement paperwork is filed which as seen above it rarely is similarly if a player’s contract with an nba team expires without him going through waivers and he then signs with a nonnba team he will continue to have a cap hold until he is renounced only if he signs with another nba team as mentioned in point two above does it disappear as such these things pile up and affect a team’s salary cap picture when teams have set themselves up for cap room they renounce these basically useless free agent amounts to maximize how much room they have for example in the summer of 2007 milwaukee orlando and memphis all figured to have cap room and so they renounced all their free agents who were not under contract these included players from previous years orlando renounced darko milicic grant hill andrew de clercq stacey augmon jaren jackson mark jones shawn kemp sean rooks bo outlaw and olumide oyedeji milwaukee renounced reece gaines jermaine jackson ervin johnson toni kukoc jiri welsch ruben patterson brian skinner jared reiner and earl boykins and memphis renounced mahmoud abdulrauf junior harrington lawrence roberts mike batiste antoine carr kevin edwards antonis fotsis dahntay jones will solomon and doug west this year in their first pursuit of cap room for some years the l a lakers renounced a whole load of free agent cap holds ranging from pau gasol and kent bazemore of last season all the back to brian shaw and john salley from their threepeat days as seen above shaw and salley never played for another nba team after the lakers never filed their retirement paperwork were not waived in their last contract and had never previously been renounced for cap space because the lakers had not had any in the years since they left and as such their cap holds were still kicking around despite how meaningless they become the cap hold that each free agent has varies and is dependent on how much the salary in the final year of their last nba contract was the cap hold is a percentage of that salary and is also dependent on what kind of free agent rights the team has on that player the exact parameters can be found in question 38 of larry coon’s eternally beautiful cba faq while the exact salaries in question can be found here when a free agent is renounced the team can still resign that player however they do lose the ability to resign them with bird rights this means that to resign them they need to use cap space or a cap exception and this of course makes it difficult to resign them normally then if a player is renounced they are not coming back what you do sometimes however see is a player with a big cap hold be renounced so as to accommodate other players into the cap room then resign for a smaller amount of it later or via the new room exception an exception that teams get as well as cap space as opposed to all other exceptions which are instead of cap space an example of that this year would be kirk hinrich whose 57 million cap hold was an obstacle to chicago’s cap space plans but who agreed to resign for the amount of the room exception and who they thus renounced even though they intend to keep him the other type of cap hold is the draft pick cap hold specifically it is the first round draft pick cap hold as second round draft picks do not have them back in the day first round picks were allowed to sign for whatever they could get this however started to get ridiculous as negotiations aided by the very real threat of holdouts started to reach 10 years and tens of millions of dollars so starting with the 1995 cba the league and players union collectively bargained the rookie salary scale depending on where they are drafted first round picks now have a set contract amount that they can sign for the actual amount changing slightly year by year the only allowed variance is that players can sign for between 80 and 120 of the amount in practice almost everyone takes the full 120 and on only a handful of occasions has that not been true almost every first round pick signs in the year they were drafted there are currently only four first round picks from drafts prior to 2014 that have never signed their rookie deals one of whom lucas nogueira is about to the other three are fran vasquez orlando 2005 petteri koponen dallas 2007 and livio jeancharles san antonio 2013 when a first round pick does not sign their rookie scale deal however their team nevertheless still have a cap hold charged to their cap number and that amount is equal to 100 of that season’s rookie scale salary amount this means then that koponen are vasquez were eating into their team’s cap space this is why you sometimes see numbers for these players you were not expected to see numbers for players you had long forgotten about they are still there and present in the maths if not the hearts and minds note also the difference between the cap hold and the usuallysignedfor amount cap holds are always 100 while signed contracts are almost always 120 and while this difference is negligible in the lower amounts it can mean much more at the top the 1 pick this year for example has a cap hold of 4592200 while 120 of that figure would be 5510640 that difference of 918440 is a pretty significant amount of cap room and is why andrew wiggins has still yet to sign with the cavaliers it is custom for teams with cap room and aspirations to use a lot of it to not sign their draftees until after they have completed their cap space wrangling and such if a team with cap room signs their draftees early it is often a sign they do not intend to use the cap space fully what teams can do under the 2011 cba is sign a written agreement between themselves and the unsigned drafted player that they will not sign in the nba in the upcoming season if they sign this agreement and submit it to the league that player’s cap hold is expunged from the team’s salary cap number and this is what dallas who valued every dollar of space they could get did with koponen phoenix have also done that this season with bogdan bogdanovic and while orlando have not done so with vasquez maybe they will do once they get nearer the limit so if you see a calculation of a team’s salary figure that includes this seemingly inexplicable numbers to otherwise irrelevant players now you know why they are there and what can be done about it and if you see a calculation of a team’s salary figure that does not include these things you now know to add them relatednba trade deadline buyers the
