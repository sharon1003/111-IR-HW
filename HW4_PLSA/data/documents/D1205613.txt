a glass jar or clear drinking glass vegetable oil salt water food coloring if you wantdangerdont forget to be careful with glass pour about 3 inches of water into the jar pour about 13 cup of vegetable oil into the jar when everything settles is the oil on top of the water or underneath it if you want add one drop of food coloring to the jar what happens is the drop in the oil or in the water does the color spread lava lites are lamps that were invented by an english man named craven walker in 1964 they are basically tall thin glass jars filled with liquid and a special kind of colored wax set on top of a base with a light bulb when the bulb is turned on the lamp glows the liquid heats up and the wax begins to melt blobs of wax rise to the top of the lamp then cool and sink back downover and over again shake salt on top of the oil while you count slowly to 5 wow what happens to the food coloring what happens to the salt add more salt to keep the action going for as long as you want sixyearold nina gumkowsky shared this activity with the other students in her firstgrade class everyone loved it they did it over and over again and kept trying to touch the layers it was messy but it was funwhy does the oil float on the water oil floats on water because a drop of oil is lighter than a drop of water the same size another way of saying this is to say that water is denser than oil density is a measurement of how much a given volume of something weighs things that are less dense than water will float in water things that are more dense than water will sink even though oil and water are both liquids they are what chemists call immiscible liquids thats a fancy word that means they dont mix what happens when i pour salt on the oil salt is heavier than water so when you pour salt on the oil it sinks to the bottom of the mixture carrying a blob of oil with it in the water the salt starts to dissolve as it dissolves the salt releases the oil which floats back up to the top of the water this looks like a lava lite how does a lava lite work like your oil and water the lava in a lava lite doesnt mix with the liquid that surrounds it when its cool the lava is a little bit denser than the liquid surrounding it when the lava rests on the bottom of the lava lite the light bulb in the lamp warms it up as it warms up the lava expands a little when it expands the lava stays the same weight but it takes up more spaceso its less dense when its warm enough the lava is less dense than the surrounding liquid and so it rises up to the top to float at the top of the lamp it cools down becomes more dense and sinks once again this cycle repeats over and over as the lava warms up and rises then cools down and sinks where did this experiment come from anyway exploratorium teacherinresidence eric muller created this activity while playing with his food in a chinese restaurant this and dozens of other cool activities are included in the exploratoriums science explorer books available for purchase from our online store published by owl books henry holt  company new york 1996  1997isbn 0b0504536  isbn 0805045376 1295 eachÂ© 1998 exploratorium
