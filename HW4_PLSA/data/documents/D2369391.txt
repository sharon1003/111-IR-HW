great buddha sweet shop from the miyako meisho zue 1787between the 6th and 4th centuries bce the persians followed by the greeks discovered the people in india and their reeds that produce honey without bees they adopted and then spread sugar and sugarcane agriculture 5 sugarcane is indigenous to tropical south and southeast asia while the word sugar is derived from the sanskrit word sharkara 6 pieces of sugar were produced by boiling sugarcane juice in ancient india and consumed as khanda dubbed as the original candy and the etymology of the word 7 8 9 10 11before sugar was readily available candy was based on honey 12 honey was used in ancient china middle east egypt greece and the roman empire to coat fruits and flowers to preserve them or to create forms of candy 13 candy is still served in this form today though now it is more typically seen as a type of garnish before the industrial revolution candy was often considered a form of medicine either used to calm the digestive system or cool a sore throat in the middle ages candy appeared on the tables of only the most wealthy at first at that time it began as a combination of spices and sugar that was used as an aid to digestive problems digestive problems were very common during this time due to the constant consumption of food that was neither fresh nor well balanced banquet hosts would typically serve these types of candies at banquets for their guests one of these candies sometimes called chamber spice was made with cloves ginger aniseed juniper berries almonds and pine kernels dipped in melted sugar 13the middle english word candy began to be used in the late 13th century 14 15the first candy came to america in the early 18th century from britain and france only a few of the early colonists were proficient in sugar work and were able to provide the sugary treats for the very wealthy rock candy made from crystallized sugar was the simplest form of candy but even this basic form of sugar was considered a luxury and was only attainable by the rich 16industrial revolution the candy business underwent a drastic change in the 1830s when technological advances and the availability of sugar opened up the market the new market was not only for the enjoyment of the rich but also for the pleasure of the working class there was also an increasing market for children while some fine confectioners remained the candy store became a staple of the child of the american working class penny candies epitomized this transformation of candy penny candy became the first material good that children spent their own money on for this reason candy storeowners relied almost entirely on the business of children to keep them running even penny candies were directly descended from medicated lozenges that held bitter medicine in a hard sugar coating 17in 1847 the invention of the candy press also known as a toy machine made it possible to produce multiple shapes and sizes of candy at once in 1851 confectioners began to use a revolving steam pan to assist in boiling sugar this transformation meant that the candy maker was no longer required to continuously stir the boiling sugar the heat from the surface of the pan was also much more evenly distributed and made it less likely the sugar would burn these innovations made it possible for only one or two people to successfully run a candy business 16etymology the word candy comes from middle english sugrecandy from old french sucre candi candy sugar from arabic قَنْدِيّ qandiyy “candied” from arabic قَنْد qand “hard candy made by boiling cane sugar” from persian کند kand ultimately from sanskrit खण्ड khaṇḍa “candied sugar” root खण्ड् khaṇḍ means “to divide break into pieces” production main article candy making candy is made by dissolving sugar in water or milk to form a syrup which is boiled until it reaches the desired concentration or starts to caramelize candy comes in a wide variety of textures from soft and chewy to hard and brittle the texture of candy depends on the ingredients and the temperatures that the candy is processed at the final texture of sugar candy depends primarily on the sugar concentration as the syrup is heated it boils water evaporates the sugar concentration increases and the boiling point rises a given temperature corresponds to a particular sugar concentration these are called sugar stages in general higher temperatures and greater sugar concentrations result in hard brittle candies and lower temperatures result in softer candies 18 once the syrup reaches 171 °c 340 °f or higher the sucrose molecules break down into many simpler sugars creating an amber colored substance known as caramel this should not be confused with caramel candy although it is the candys main flavoring most candies are made commercially the industry relies significantly on trade secret protection because candy recipes cannot be copyrighted or patented effectively but are very difficult to duplicate exactly seemingly minor differences in the machinery temperature or timing of the candymaking process can cause noticeable differences in the final product 19packaging salt water taffy is usually wrapped in pieces of wax paper candy wrapper or sweets wrapper is a common term for this packaging 20purposes of packaging packaging preserves aroma and flavor and eases shipping and dispensation wax paper seals against air moisture dust and germs while cellophane is valued by packagers for its transparency and resistance to grease odors and moisture in addition it is often resealable polyethylene is another form of film sealed with heat and this material is often used to make bags in bulk packaging plastic wraps are also common aluminum foils wrap chocolate bars and prevent a transfer of water vapor while being lightweight nontoxic and odor proof vegetable parchment lines boxes of highquality confections like gourmet chocolates cardboard cartons are less common though they offer many options concerning thickness and movement of water and oil packaging may be used as a type of gift wrapping packages are often sealed with a starchbased adhesive derived from tapioca potato wheat sago or sweet potato occasionally glues are made from the bones and skin of cattle and hogs for a stronger and more flexible product but this is not as common because of the expense 21history prior to the 1900s candy was commonly sold unwrapped from carts in the street where it was exposed to dirt and insects by 1914 there were some machines to wrap gum and stick candies but this was not the common practice after the polio outbreak in 1916 unwrapped candies garnered widespread censure because of the dirt and germs at the time only upscale candy stores used glass jars with advancements in technology wax paper was adopted and foil and cellophane were imported  vague from france by du pont in 1925 necco packagers were one of the first companies to package without human touch 22candy packaging played a role in its adoption as the most popular treat given away during trickortreating for halloween in the us in the 1940s most treats were homemade during the 1950s small individually wrapped candies were recognized as convenient and inexpensive by the 1970s after widely publicized but largely false stories of poisoned candy myths circulating in the popular press factorysealed packaging with a recognizable name brand on it became a sign of safety 23marketing and design packaging helps market the product as well manufacturers know that candy must be hygienic and attractive to customers in the childrens market quantity novelty large size and bright colors are the top sellers 22 many companies redesign the packaging to maintain consumer appeal shelf life because of its high sugar concentration bacteria are not usually able to grow in candy as a result the shelf life is longer for candy than for many other foods most candies can be safely stored in their original packaging at room temperature in a dry dark cupboard for months or years as a rule the softer the candy or the damper the storage area the sooner it goes stale 24shelf life considerations with most candies are focused on appearance taste and texture rather than about the potential for food poisoning that is old candy may not look appealing or taste very good even though it is very unlikely to make the eater sick candy can be made unsafe by storing it badly such as in a wet moldy area typical recommendations are these 24hard candy may last indefinitely in good storage conditions milk chocolates and caramels usually become stale after about one year dark chocolate lasts up to two years soft or creamy candies like candy corn may last 8 to 10 months in ideal conditions chewing gum and gumballs may stay fresh as long as 8 months after manufacture nutrition most sugar candies are defined in us law as a food of minimal nutritional value 25even in a culture that eats sweets frequently candy is not a significant source of nutrition or food energy for most people the average american eats about 11 kg 25 pounds of sugar or similar sweeteners each week but almost 95 of that sugar—all but about 70 grams 25 ounces—comes from noncandy sources especially soft drinks and processed foods 26meal replacements candy is considered a source of empty calories because it provides little or no nutritional value beyond food energy at the start of the 20th century when undernutrition was a serious problem especially among poor and workingclass people and when nutrition science was a new field the high calorie content was promoted as a virtue researchers suggested that candy especially candy with milk and nuts was a lowcost alternative to normal meals to get the food energy necessary for a day of labor candy might cost half as much as eggs 27 during the 1920s and 1930s candy bars selling for five cents were often marketed as replacements for lunch 28at the 1904 world fair the quaker oats company made a candycoated puffed cereal a wheatbased product similar to cracker jack s candycoated popcorn the product concept was reintroduced unsuccessfully in 1939 by another business as ranger joe the first presweetened candycoated breakfast cereal post foods introduced their own version in 1948 originally called happy jax and later sugar crisp they marketed it as both a replacement for unsweetened breakfast cereals and also for eating as a snack or as candy using three animated cartoon bears as the mascots candy handy and dandy the early slogans said as a cereal its dandy—for snacks its so handy—or eat it like candy 29traditional holiday candy house in more recent times a variety of snack bars have been marketed these include bars that are intended as meal replacements as well as snack bars that are marketed as having nutritional advantages when compared to candy bars such as granola bars however the actual nutritional value is often not very different from candy bars except for usually a higher sodium content and the flavors most popularly chocolate fudge and caramel and the presentation mimic candy bars 28among the bengali people candy may be eaten for an entire meal especially during festivals candy may also be offered to vegetarian guests in lieu of fish or meat dishes in india 30vegetarianism most candy contains no meat or other animal parts and many contain no milk or other animal products some candy including marshmallows and gummi bears contains gelatin derived from animal collagen a protein found in skin and bones and is thus avoided by vegans and some vegetarians  kosher gelatin  is also unsuitable for vegetarians and vegans as it is derived from fish bones 31 other substances such as agar pectin starch and gum arabic may also be used as setting and gelling agents and can be used in place of gelatin jelly beans are often coated with shellac 32other ingredients commonly found in candy that are not suitable for vegetarian or vegan diets include carmine a red dye made from cochineal beetles and confectioners glaze which contains shellac a resin excreted by female lac bugs health effects cavities candy generally contains sugar which is a key environmental factor in the formation of dental caries cavities 33 several types of bacteria commonly found in the mouth consume sugar particularly streptococcus mutans when these bacteria metabolize the sugar found in most candies juice or other sugary foods they produce acids in the mouth that demineralize the tooth enamel and can lead to dental caries heavy or frequent consumption of highsugar foods especially lollipops sugary cough drops and other sugarbased candies that stay in the mouth for a long time increases the risk of tooth decay 33 34 candies that also contain enameldissolving acids such as acid drops increase the risk 34 cleaning the teeth and mouth shortly after eating any type of sugary food and allowing several hours to pass between eating such foods reduces the risk and improves oral health 33 34however frequent consumption of fruits and fruit juice which contain both acid and sugars may be a more significant factor in dental decay than candies 34glycemic index most candy particularly lowfat and fatfree candy has a high glycemic index gi which means that it causes a rapid rise in blood sugar levels after ingestion this is chiefly a concern for people with diabetes but could also be dangerous to the health of nondiabetics 35health benefits candies that primarily consist of peppermint and mint such as candy canes have digestive benefits peppermint oil can help soothe an upset stomach by creating defense against irritable bowel syndrome and is effective in killing germs 36mintflavored gum increases shortterm memory heart rate and the amount of oxygen in the brain the correlation between heart rate and oxygen in the brain triggers shortterm memory chewing gum can also provide a burst of insulin in the anticipation for food 37when eaten in moderation dark chocolate can have health benefits the cocoa in chocolate can help reduce the risk of heart disease vitamins and minerals such as calcium magnesium and sodium can be found in chocolate as well as antioxidants 38in a study of approximately 8000 individuals candy consumers enjoyed an average of 092 years of longer life with greater consumption of candy not associated with progressively lower mortality nonconsumers typically ate less red meat and salads drank more and were more likely to smoke mortality was lowest among those consuming candy 1–3 times a month and highest among those consuming candy three or more times a week the study concluded that one possible explanation for this was the presence of antioxidant phenols in chocolate but the study could not differentiate between consumption of sugar candy and chocolate in they study 39contamination some kinds of candy have been contaminated with an excessive amount of lead in it 40 claims of contamination have been made since shortly after industrialscale candy factories began producing candy in the mid19th century 41choking deaths hard round candies are a leading cause of choking deaths in children 42 some types of candy such as lychee mini fruity gels have been associated with so many choking deaths that their import or manufacture is banned by some countries 42 43nonnutritive toy products such as chocolate eggs containing packaging with a toy inside are banned from sale in the us if the material attached to confectionery does have a function and will not cause any injury to the consumer it is allowed to be marketed in the eu however the toy safety directive 200948ec specifies that toys contained in food only need separate packaging that cannot be swallowed 44sales see also list of topselling candy brands global sales of candies were estimated to have been approximately us 118 billion in 2012 45all assorted mm candies at new york shop because each culture varies in how it treats some foods a food may be a candy in one place and a dessert in another for example in western countries baklava is served on a plate and eaten with a fork as a dessert but in the middle east northern africa and eastern europe it is treated as a candy 1cultural significance candy is the source of several cultural themes adults worry that other people will use candy to poison or entice children into harmful situations stranger danger warnings include telling children not to take candy from strangers for fear of the child being abducted poisoned candy myths persist in popular culture especially around trickortreating at halloween despite the rarity of actual incidents 41the phrase like taking candy from a baby is a common simile and means that something is very easy to do 41a 1959 swedish dental health campaign encouraged people to reduce the risk of dental problems by limiting consumption of candy to once a week the
