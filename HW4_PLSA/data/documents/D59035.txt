official currency since the british occupation of the country in world war i at a rate of 1 dinar  11 rupees the dinar was pegged at par with the british pound until 1959 when without changing its value the peg was switched to the united states dollar at the rate of 1 dinar  28 dollars by not following the devaluations of the us currency in 1971 and 1973 the dinar rose to a value of us33778 before a 5 percent devaluation reduced the value of the dinar to us32169 a rate which remained until the gulf war although in late 1989 the black market rate was reported at five to six times higher than the official rate 1after the gulf war in 1991 due to un sanctions the previously used swiss printing method was no longer available so new inferior quality notes were produced the previously produced notes became known as the swiss dinar and continued to circulate in the kurdish region of iraq due to sanctions placed on iraq by the united states and the international community along with excessive government printing the new dinar notes devalued quickly by late 1995 us1 was valued at 3000 dinars at the black market following the deposition of saddam hussein in the 2003 invasion of iraq the iraqi governing council and the office for reconstruction and humanitarian assistance began printing more saddam dinar notes as a stopgap measure to maintain the money supply until new currency could be introduced between 15 october 2003 and 15 january 2004 the coalition provisional authority issued new iraqi dinar coins and notes with the notes printed by the british security printing firm de la rue using modern antiforgery techniques to create a single unified currency that is used throughout all of iraq and will also make money more convenient to use in peoples everyday lives multiple trillions of dinar were then shipped to iraq and secured in the cbi for distribution to the masses in exchange for the saddam dinar 2 old banknotes were exchanged for new at a onetoone rate except for the swiss dinars which were exchanged at a rate of 150 new dinars for one swiss dinar at this point the un imf wb and us combined to limit the value of the dinar to less than 110 of a cent to prevent looting and counterfeiting the us treasury was commissioned to print multiple billions of us currency specific to iraq so as to easily identified as different from that used elsewhere in the world this new currency was then wrapped and stacked on pallets and shipped in dozens of usaf transports to iraq there it was transferred covertly to the cbi where it was stored in very secure vaults  citation neededsince iraq has few exports other than oil which is sold in dollars there is little demand for dinars and they remain in exotic status however the new currency has sparked a multimilliondollar industry in selling dinars to speculators these socalled money service companies will sell dinar to speculators at an inflated price and push the idea that the dinar will rv or be revalued to greatly increase the exchange rate against the dollar as of january 2016 the dinar is pegged to the dollar at a rate of 11821180 sellbuy dinars per dollar 3 the current exchange rate is published by the central bank of iraq on its englishlanguage home page the exchange rate reportedly available on the streets of iraq is around 1300 dinars per u s dollar there is considerable confusion perhaps intentional on the part of dinar sellers around the role of the international monetary fund in iraq the imf as part of the rebuilding of iraq is monitoring their finances and for this purpose uses a single rate not a sellbuy of 1170 dinars per dollar this program rate 4 is used for calculations in the imf monitoring program and is not a rate imposed on iraq by the imf for a wider history surrounding currency in the region see british currency in the middle east speculation  editin response to the growing concerns with fraud and scams related to investment in the iraqi dinar state agencies such as washington state 5 utah 6 oklahoma 7 alabama 8 and others have issued statements and releases warning potential investors further alerts have been issued by news agencies 9the better business bureau has included dinar investments in its list of top 10 scams 10 there has also been a book written on the subject 11these alerts warn potential investors that there is no place outside iraq to exchange their dinar that they are typically sold by dealers at inflated prices and that there is little to substantiate the claims of significant appreciation of their investment due to revaluation of the currency coins  edit10 fils 1967  250pxaltobverse lettering ١٣٨٧ ١٩٦٧ reverse الجمهورية العراقية ١٠ فلوسmade of coppernickel coin was engraved by geoffrey colley

500 fils and 1 dinar coins in 1982 a number of the coins for 1982 were a commemorative series celebrating babylonian achievements during this period many of the coins were identified by their shape

were printed in the united kingdom by bradbury wilkinson  co 13 from 1931 to 1947 the banknotes were issued by the iraqi currency board for the government of iraq and banknotes were convertible into pound sterling from 1947 the banknotes were issued by the national bank of iraq then after 1954 by the central bank of iraq100 dinars notes ceased production in the 1940s however the same denominations were used until 1978 when 25 dinars notes were introduced in 1991 50 dinars were introduced and 100 dinars reintroduced followed in 1995 by 250 dinar notes and 10000 dinars notes in 2002 banknotes that were issued between 1990 and october 2003 along with a 25dinar note issued in 1986 bear an idealized engraving of former iraqi president saddam hussein following the 1991 gulf war iraqs currency was printed both locally and in china using poor grade wood pulp paper rather than cotton or linen and inferior quality lithography some notes were reputedly printed on presses designed for printing newspapers the primitive printing techniques resulted in a limitless variety in coloration and detail one layer of the printing would be too faint while another would be too dark counterfeit banknotes often appeared to be of better quality than real notes  citation needed some notes were very poorly cut and some notes even lacked serial numbers despite the collapse in the value of the iraqi dinar the highest denomination printed until 2002 was 250 dinars in 2002 the central bank of iraq issued a 10000dinars banknote to be used for larger and interbank transactions this note was rarely accepted in practice due to fears of looting and counterfeiting this forced people to carry around stacks of 250dinars notes for everyday use the other smaller bills were so worthless that they largely fell into disuse this situation meant that iraq for the most part had only one denomination of banknote in wide circulation currency printed before the gulf war was often called the swiss dinar it got its name from the swiss printing technology that produced banknotes of a considerably higher quality than those later produced under the economic sanctions that were imposed after the first gulf war after a changeover period this currency was disendorsed by the iraqi government however this old currency still circulated in the kurdish regions of iraq until it was replaced with the new dinar after the second gulf war during this time the swiss dinar retained its value whilst the new currency consistently lost value at sometimes 30 percent per annum in 2003 new banknotes were issued consisting of six denominations 50 250 1000 5000 10000 and 25000 dinars the notes were similar in design to notes issued by the central bank of iraq in the 1970s and 1980s a 500 dinars note was issued a year later in october 2004 in the kurdish regions of iraq the 50 dinar note is not in circulation in march 2014 the central bank of iraq began replacing banknotes with anticounterfeiting
