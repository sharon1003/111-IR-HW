keyboard sip history biography inventor invention the story look at the keyboard of any standard typewriter or computer qwert and y are the first six letters who decided on this arrangement of the letters and why the first practical typewriter was patented in the united states in 1868 by christopher latham sholes his machine was known as the typewriter it had a movable carriage a lever for turning paper from line to line and a keyboard on which the letters were arranged in alphabetical order but sholes had a problem on his first model his abc key arrangement caused the keys to jam when the typist worked quickly sholes didnt know how to keep the keys from sticking so his solution was to keep the typist from typing too fast he did this using a study of letterpair frequency prepared by educator amos densmore brother of james densmore who was sholes chief financial backer the qwerty keyboard itself was determined by the existing mechanical linkages of the typebars inside the machine to the keys on the outside sholes solution did not eliminate the problem completely but it was greatly reduced  the keyboard arrangement was considered important enough to be included on sholes patent granted in 1878 some years after the machine was into production qwertys effect by reducing those annoying clashes was to speed up typing rather than slow it down the new arrangement was the qwerty arrangement that typists use today of course sholes claimed that the new arrangement was scientific and would add speed and efficiency the only efficiency it added was to slow the typist down since almost any word in the english language required the typists fingers to cover more distance on the keyboard the advantages of the typewriter outweighed the disadvantages of the keyboard typists memorized the crazy letter arrangement and the typewriter became a huge success to learn morerelated information chrisopher sholes biography from the great idea finder history of office equipment from
