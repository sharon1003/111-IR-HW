forces during the american civil war the battle involved the largest number of casualties of the entire war and is often described as the wars turning point 12 13 union maj gen george meade s army of the potomac defeated attacks by confederate gen robert e lee s army of northern virginia halting lees invasion of the north after his success at chancellorsville in virginia in may 1863 lee led his army through the shenandoah valley to begin his second invasion of the north—the gettysburg campaign with his army in high spirits lee intended to shift the focus of the summer campaign from warravaged northern virginia and hoped to influence northern politicians to give up their prosecution of the war by penetrating as far as harrisburg pennsylvania or even philadelphia prodded by president abraham lincoln maj gen joseph hooker moved his army in pursuit but was relieved of command just three days before the battle and replaced by meade elements of the two armies initially collided at gettysburg on july 1 1863 as lee urgently concentrated his forces there his objective being to engage the union army and destroy it low ridges to the northwest of town were defended initially by a union cavalry division under brig gen john buford and soon reinforced with two corps of union infantry however two large confederate corps assaulted them from the northwest and north collapsing the hastily developed union lines sending the defenders retreating through the streets of the town to the hills just to the south 14on the second day of battle most of both armies had assembled the union line was laid out in a defensive formation resembling a fishhook in the late afternoon of july 2 lee launched a heavy assault on the union left flank and fierce fighting raged at little round top the wheatfield devils den and the peach orchard on the union right confederate demonstrations escalated into fullscale assaults on culps hill and cemetery hill all across the battlefield despite significant losses the union defenders held their lines on the third day of battle fighting resumed on culps hill and cavalry battles raged to the east and south but the main event was a dramatic infantry assault by 12500 confederates against the center of the union line on cemetery ridge known as picketts charge the charge was repulsed by union rifle and artillery fire at great loss to the confederate army 15lee led his army on a torturous retreat back to virginia between 46000 and 51000 soldiers from both armies were casualties in the threeday battle the most costly in us

april 30 – may 6 1863 robert e lee decided upon a second invasion of the north the first was the unsuccessful maryland campaign of september 1862 which ended in the bloody battle of antietam  such a move would upset u s plans for the summer campaigning season and possibly reduce the pressure on the besieged confederate garrison at vicksburg the invasion would allow the confederates to live off the bounty of the rich northern farms while giving warravaged virginia a muchneeded rest in addition lees 72000man army 6 could threaten philadelphia baltimore and washington and possibly strengthen the growing peace movement in the north 19initial movements to battle thus on june 3 lees army began to shift northward from fredericksburg virginia following the death of thomas j stonewall jackson lee reorganized his two large corps into three new corps commanded by lt gen james longstreet first corps lt gen richard s ewell second and lt gen a p hill third both ewell and hill who had formerly reported to jackson as division commanders were new to this level of responsibility the cavalry division remained under the command of maj gen j e b stuart 20the union army of the potomac under maj gen joseph hooker consisted of seven infantry corps a cavalry corps and an artillery reserve for a combined strength of more than 100000 men 5the first major action of the campaign took place on june 9 between cavalry forces at brandy station near culpeper virginia the 9500 confederate cavalrymen under stuart were surprised by maj gen alfred pleasonton s combined arms force of two cavalry divisions 8000 troopers and 3000 infantry but stuart eventually repulsed the union attack the inconclusive battle the largest predominantly cavalry engagement of the war proved for the first time that the union horse soldier was equal to his southern counterpart 21by midjune the army of northern virginia was poised to cross the potomac river and enter maryland after defeating the union garrisons at winchester and martinsburg ewells second corps began crossing the river on june 15 hills and longstreets corps followed on june 24 and 25 hookers army pursued keeping between the u s capital and lees army the union army crossed the potomac from june 25 to 27 22lee gave strict orders for his army to minimize any negative impacts on the civilian population 23 food horses and other supplies were generally not seized outright although quartermasters reimbursing northern farmers and merchants with confederate money were not well received various towns most notably york pennsylvania were required to pay indemnities in lieu of supplies under threat of destruction during the invasion the confederates seized some 40 northern african americans a few of them were escaped fugitive slaves but most were freemen all were sent south into slavery under guard 16 17 18on june 26 elements of maj gen jubal early s division of ewells corps occupied the town of gettysburg after chasing off newly raised pennsylvania militia in a series of minor skirmishes early laid the borough under tribute but did not collect any significant supplies soldiers burned several railroad cars and a covered bridge and destroyed nearby rails and telegraph lines the following morning early departed for adjacent york county 24meanwhile in a controversial move lee allowed j e b stuart to take a portion of the armys cavalry and ride around the east flank of the union army lees orders gave stuart much latitude and both generals share the blame for the long absence of stuarts cavalry as well as for the failure to assign a more active role to the cavalry left with the army stuart and his three best brigades were absent from the army during the crucial phase of the approach to gettysburg and the first two days of battle by june 29 lees army was strung out in an arc from chambersburg 28 miles 45 km northwest of gettysburg to carlisle 30 miles 48 km north of gettysburg to near harrisburg and wrightsville on the susquehanna river 25in a dispute over the use of the forces defending the harpers ferry garrison hooker offered his resignation and abraham lincoln and generalinchief henry w halleck who were looking for an excuse to rid themselves of him immediately accepted they replaced hooker early on the morning of june 28 with maj gen george gordon meade then commander of the v corps 26on june 29 when lee learned that the army of the potomac had crossed the potomac river he ordered a concentration of his forces around cashtown located at the eastern base of south mountain and eight miles 13 km west of gettysburg 27 on june 30 while part of hills corps was in cashtown one of hills brigades north carolinians under brig gen j johnston pettigrew ventured toward gettysburg in his memoirs maj gen henry heth pettigrews division commander claimed that he sent pettigrew to search for supplies in town—especially shoes 28when pettigrews troops approached gettysburg on june 30 they noticed union cavalry under brig gen john buford arriving south of town and pettigrew returned to cashtown without engaging them when pettigrew told hill and heth what he had seen neither general believed that there was a substantial union force in or near the town suspecting that it had been only pennsylvania militia despite general lees order to avoid a general engagement until his entire army was concentrated hill decided to mount a significant reconnaissance in force the following morning to determine the size and strength of the enemy force in his front around 5 am on wednesday july 1 two

three ridges west of the town herr ridge mc pherson ridge and seminary ridge these were appropriate terrain for a delaying action by his small cavalry division against superior confederate infantry forces meant to buy time awaiting the arrival of union infantrymen who could occupy the strong defensive positions south of town at cemetery hill cemetery ridge and culps hill buford understood that if the confederates could gain control of these heights meades army would have difficulty dislodging them 33first shot monument heths division advanced with two brigades forward commanded by brig gens james j archer and joseph r davis they proceeded easterly in columns along the chambersburg pike three miles 5 km west of town about 730 am on july 1 the two brigades met light resistance from vedettes of union cavalry and deployed into line according to lore the union soldier to fire the first shot of the battle was lt marcellus jones 34 in 1886 lt jones returned to gettysburg to mark the spot where he fired the first shot with a monument 35 eventually heths men reached dismounted troopers of col william gambles cavalry brigade who raised determined resistance and delaying tactics from behind fence posts with fire from their breechloading carbines 36 still by 1020 am the confederates had pushed the union cavalrymen east to mc pherson ridge when the vanguard of the i corps maj gen john f reynolds finally arrived 37north of the pike davis gained a temporary success against brig gen lysander cutler s brigade but was repulsed with heavy losses in an action around an unfinished railroad bed cut in the ridge south of the pike archers brigade assaulted through herbst also known as mc phersons woods the u s iron brigade under brig gen solomon meredith enjoyed initial success against archer capturing several hundred men including archer himself 38general reynolds was shot and killed early in the fighting while directing troop and artillery placements just to the east of the woods shelby foote wrote that the union cause lost a man considered by many to be the best general in the army 39 maj gen abner doubleday assumed command fighting in the chambersburg pike area lasted until about 1230 pm it resumed around 230 pm when heths entire division engaged adding the brigades of pettigrew and col john m brockenbrough 40as pettigrews north carolina brigade came on line they flanked the 19th indiana and drove the iron brigade back the 26th north carolina the largest regiment in the army with 839 men lost heavily leaving the first days fight with around 212 men by the end of the threeday battle they had about 152 men standing the highest casualty percentage for one battle of any regiment north or south 41 slowly the iron brigade was pushed out of the woods toward seminary ridge hill added maj gen william dorsey pender s division to the assault and the i corps was driven back through the grounds of the lutheran seminary and gettysburg streets 42as the fighting to the west proceeded two divisions of ewells second corps marching west toward cashtown in accordance with lees order for the army to concentrate in that vicinity turned south on the carlisle and harrisburg roads toward gettysburg while the union xi corps maj gen oliver o howard raced north on the baltimore pike and taneytown road by early afternoon the u s line ran in a semicircle west north and northeast of gettysburg 43however the u s did not have enough troops cutler whose brigade was deployed north of the chambersburg pike had his right flank in the air the leftmost division of the xi corps was unable to deploy in time to strengthen the line so doubleday was forced to throw in reserve brigades to salvage his line 44around 2 pm the confederate second corps divisions of maj gens robert e rodes and jubal early assaulted and outflanked the union i and xi corps positions north and northwest of town the confederate brigades of col edward a oneal and brig gen alfred iverson suffered severe losses assaulting the i corps division of brig gen john c robinson south of oak hill earlys division profited from a blunder by brig gen francis c barlow when he advanced his xi corps division to blochers knoll directly north of town and now known as barlows knoll this represented a salient 45 in the corps line susceptible to attack from multiple sides and earlys troops overran barlows division which constituted the right flank of the union armys position barlow was wounded and captured in the attack 46as u s positions collapsed both north and west of town gen howard ordered a retreat to the high ground south of town at cemetery hill where he had left the division of brig gen adolph von steinwehr in reserve 47 maj gen winfield s hancock assumed command of the battlefield sent by meade when he heard that reynolds had been killed hancock commander of the ii corps and meades most trusted subordinate was ordered to take command of the field and to determine whether gettysburg was an appropriate place for a major battle 48 hancock told howard i think this the strongest position by nature upon which to fight a battle that i ever saw when howard agreed hancock concluded the discussion very well sir i select this as the battlefield hancocks determination had a moraleboosting effect on the retreating union soldiers but he played no direct tactical role on the first day 49general lee understood the defensive potential to the union if they held this high ground he sent orders to ewell that cemetery hill be taken if practicable ewell who had previously served under stonewall jackson a general well known for issuing peremptory orders determined such an assault was not practicable and thus did not attempt it this decision is considered by historians to be a great missed opportunity 50the first day at gettysburg more significant than simply a prelude to the bloody second and third days ranks as the 23rd biggest battle of the war by number of troops engaged about one quarter of meades army 22000 men and one third of lees army 27000 were engaged 51second day of battle robert e lee s plan for july 2 1863further information battle of gettysburg second day little round top culps hill and cemetery hill plans and movement to battle throughout the evening of july 1 and morning of july 2 most of the remaining infantry of both armies arrived on the field including the union ii iii v vi and xii corps two of longstreets brigades were on the road brig gen george pickett had begun the 22 mile 35 km march from chambersburg while brig gen e m law had begun the march from guilford both arrived late in the morning law completed his 28mile 45 km march in eleven hours 52the union line ran from culps hill southeast of the town northwest to cemetery hill just south of town then south for nearly two miles 3 km along cemetery ridge terminating just north of little round top most of the xii corps was on culps hill the remnants of i and xi corps defended cemetery hill ii corps covered most of the northern half of cemetery ridge and iii corps was ordered to take up a position to its flank the shape of the union line is popularly described as a fishhook formation the confederate line paralleled the union line about a mile 1600 m to the west on seminary ridge ran east through the town then curved southeast to a point opposite culps hill thus the union army had interior lines while the confederate line was nearly five miles 8 km long 53lees battle plan for july 2 called for a general assault of meades positions on the right longstreets first corps was to position itself to attack the union left flank facing northeast astraddle the emmitsburg road and to roll up the u sline the attack sequence was to begin with maj gens john bell hood s and lafayette mc laws s divisions followed by maj gen richard h anderson s division of hills third corps 54on the left lee instructed ewell to position his second corps to attack culps hill and cemetery hill when he heard the gunfire from longstreets assault preventing meade from shifting troops to bolster his left though it does not appear in either his or lees official report ewell claimed years later that lee had changed the order to simultaneously attack calling for only a diversion to be turned into a fullscale attack if a favorable opportunity presented itself 55 56lees plan however was based on faulty intelligence exacerbated by stuarts continued absence from the battlefield though lee personally reconnoitered his left during the morning he did not visit longstreets position on the confederate right even so lee rejected suggestions that longstreet move beyond meades left and attack the union flank capturing the supply trains and effectively blocking meades escape route 57lee did not issue orders for the attack until 1100 am 58 about noon general andersons advancing troops were discovered by general sickles outpost guard and the third corps–upon which longstreets first corps was to form–did not get into position until 100 pm 59hood and mc laws after their long march were not yet in position and did not launch their attacks until just after 4 pm and 5 pm respectively 60attacks on the union left flank overview map of the second day of the battle of gettysburg july 2 1863as longstreets left division under maj gen lafayette mc laws advanced they unexpectedly found maj gen daniel sickles s iii corps directly in their path sickles had been dissatisfied with the position assigned him on the southern end of cemetery ridge seeing ground better suited for artillery positions a half mile 800 m to the west— centered at the sherfy farms peach orchard—he violated orders and advanced his corp to the slightly higher ground along the emmitsburg road moving away from cemetery ridge the new line ran from devils den northwest to the peach orchard then northeast along the emmitsburg road to south of the codori farm this created an untenable salient at the peach orchard brig gen andrew a humphreys s division in position along the emmitsburg road and maj gen david b birney s division to the south were subject to attacks from two sides and were spread out over a longer front than their small corps could defend effectively 61 the confederate artillery was ordered to open fire at 300 pm 62 after failing to attend a meeting at this time of meades corps commanders meade rode to sickles position and demanded an explanation of the situation knowing a confederate attack was imminent and a retreat would be endangered meade refused sickles offer to withdraw 63meade was forced to send 20000 reinforcements 64 the entire v corps brig gen john c caldwell s division of the ii corps most of the xii corps and portions of the newly arrived vi corps hoods division moved more to the east than intended losing its alignment with the emmitsburg road 65 attacking devils den and little round top mc laws coming in on hoods left drove multiple attacks into the thinly stretched iii corps in the wheatfield and overwhelmed them in sherfys peach orchard mc lawss attack eventually reached plum run valley the valley of death before being beaten back by the pennsylvania reserves division of the v corps moving down from little round top the iii corps was virtually destroyed as a combat unit in this battle and sickless leg was amputated after it was shattered by a cannonball caldwells division was destroyed piecemeal in the wheatfield andersons division coming from mc lawss left and starting forward around 6 pm reached the crest of cemetery ridge but could not hold the position in the face of counterattacks from the ii corps including an almost suicidal bayonet charge by the 1st minnesota regiment against a confederate brigade ordered in desperation by hancock to buy time for reinforcements to arrive 66as fighting raged in the wheatfield and devils den col strong vincent of v corps had a precarious hold on little round top an important hill at the extreme left of the union line his brigade of four relatively small regiments was able to resist repeated assaults by brig gen evander m law s brigade of hoods division meades chief engineer brig gen gouverneur k warren had realized the importance of this position and dispatched vincents brigade an artillery battery and the 140th new york to occupy little round top mere minutes before hoods troops arrived the defense of little round top with a bayonet charge by the 20th maine ordered by col joshua l chamberlain but possibly led by lt holman s melcher was one of the most fabled episodes in the civil war and propelled col chamberlain into prominence after the war 67 68attacks on the union right flank union breastworks on culps hill ewell interpreted his orders as calling only for a cannonade 56 his 32 guns along with a p hills 55 guns engaged in a twohour artillery barrage at extreme range that had little effect finally about six oclock ewell sent orders to each of his division commanders to attack the union lines in his front maj gen edward allegheny johnson s division had not been pushed close to culps hill in preparation for an assault although one had been contemplated all day it now had a full mile 1600 m to advance and rock creek had to be crossed this could only be done at few places and involved much delay only three of johnsons four brigades moved to the attack 69 most of the hills defenders the union xii corps had been sent to the left to defend against longstreets attacks leaving only a brigade of new yorkers under brig gen george s greene behind strong newly constructed defensive works with reinforcements from the i and xi corps greenes men held off the confederate attackers though giving up some of the lower earthworks on the lower part of culps hill 70early was similarly unprepared when he ordered harry t hays  and isaac e avery s brigades to attack the union xi corps positions on east cemetery hill once started fighting was fierce col andrew l harris of the union 2nd brigade 1st division came under a withering attack losing half his men avery was wounded early on but the confederates reached the crest of the hill and entered the union breastworks capturing one or two batteries seeing he was not supported on his right hays withdrew his right was to be supported by robert e rodes  division but rodes—like early and johnson—had not been ordered up in preparation for the attack he had twice as far to travel as early by the time he came in contact with the union skirmish line earlys troops had already begun to withdraw 71jeb stuart and his three cavalry brigades arrived in gettysburg around noon but had no role in the second days battle brig gen wade hampton s brigade fought a minor engagement with newly promoted 23yearold brig gen george armstrong custer s michigan cavalry near hunterstown to the northeast of gettysburg 72third day of battle further information culps hill picketts charge and battle of gettysburg third day cavalry battles overview map of the third day of the battle of gettysburg july 3 1863lees plan general lee wished to renew the attack on friday july 3 using the same basic plan as the previous day longstreet would attack the u s left while ewell attacked culps hill 73 however before longstreet was ready union xii corps troops started a dawn artillery bombardment against the confederates on culps hill in an effort to regain a portion of their lost works the confederates attacked and the second fight for culps hill ended around 11 am harry pfanz judged that after some seven hours of bitter combat the union line was intact and held more strongly than before 74lee was forced to change his plans longstreet would command picketts virginia division of his own first corps plus six brigades from hills corps in an attack on the u s ii corps position at the right center of the union line on cemetery ridge prior to the attack all the artillery the confederacy could bring to bear on the u s positions would bombard and weaken the enemys line 75much has been made over the years of general longstreets objections to general lees plan in his memoirs longstreet described their discussion as follows lee rode over after sunrise and gave his orders his plan was to assault the enemys left centre by a column to be composed of mc lawss and hoods divisions reinforced by picketts brigades i thought that it would not do that the point had been fully tested the day before by more men when all were fresh that the enemy was there looking for us as we heard him during the night putting up his defences that the divisions of mc laws and hood were holding a mile 1600 m along the right of my line against twenty thousand men who would follow their withdrawal strike the flank of the assaulting column crush it and get on our rear towards the potomac river that thirty thousand men was the minimum of force necessary for the work that even such force would need close cooperation on other parts of the line that the column as he proposed to organize it would have only about thirteen thousand men the divisions having lost a third of their numbers the day before that the column would have to march a mile 1600 m under concentrating battery fire and a thousand yards 900 m under longrange musketry that the conditions were different from those in the days of napoleon when field batteries had a range of six hundred yards 550 m and musketry about sixty yards 55 m he said the distance was not more than fourteen hundred yards 1280 m general meades estimate was a mile or a mile and a half 16 or 24 km captain long the guide of the field of gettysburg in 1888 stated that it was a trifle over a mile he then concluded that the divisions of mc laws and hood could remain on the defensive line that he would reinforce by divisions of the third corps and picketts brigades and stated the point to which the march should be directed i asked the strength of the column he stated fifteen thousand opinion was then expressed that the fifteen thousand men who could make successful assault over that field had never been arrayed for battle but he was impatient of listening and tired of talking and nothing was left but to proceed 76the high water mark on cemetery ridge as it appears today the monument to the 72nd pennsylvania volunteer infantry regiment baxters philadelphia fire zouaves appears at right the copse of trees to the left the largest artillery bombardment of the war around 1 pm from 150 to 170 confederate guns began an artillery bombardment that was probably the largest of the war in order to save valuable ammunition for the infantry attack that they knew would follow the army of the potomacs artillery under the command of brig gen henry jackson hunt at first did not return the enemys fire after waiting about 15 minutes about 80 u s cannons added to the din the army of northern virginia was critically low on artillery ammunition and the cannonade did not significantly affect the union position 77picketts charge around 3 pm the cannon fire subsided and 12500 southern soldiers stepped from the ridgeline and advanced the threequarters of a mile 1200 m to cemetery ridge in what is known to history as  picketts charge  as the confederates approached there was fierce flanking artillery fire from union positions on cemetery hill and north of little round top and musket and canister fire from hancocks ii corps in the union center the commander of artillery had held fire during the confederate bombardment in order to save it for the infantry assault which meade had correctly predicted the day before leading southern commanders to believe the northern cannon batteries had been knocked out however they opened fire on the confederate infantry during their approach with devastating results nearly one half of the attackers did not return to their own lines although the u s line wavered and broke temporarily at a jog called the angle in a low stone fence just north of a patch of vegetation called the copse of trees reinforcements rushed into the breach and the confederate attack was repulsed the farthest advance of brig gen lewis a armistead s brigade of maj gen george pickett s division at the angle is referred to as the  highwater mark of the confederacy  arguably representing the closest the south ever came to its goal of achieving independence from the union via military victory 78 union and confederate soldiers locked in handtohand combat attacking with their rifles bayonets rocks and even their bare hands armistead ordered his confederates to turn two captured cannons against union troops but discovered that there was no ammunition left the last double canister shots having been used against the charging confederates armistead was wounded shortly afterward three times cavalry battles there were two significant cavalry engagements on july 3 stuart was sent to guard the confederate left flank and was to be prepared to exploit any success the infantry might achieve on cemetery hill by flanking the u s right and hitting their trains and lines of communications three miles 5 km east of gettysburg in what is now called east cavalry field not shown on the accompanying map but between the york and hanover roads stuarts forces collided with u s cavalry brig gen david mc murtrie gregg s division and brig gen custers brigade a lengthy mounted battle including handtohand sabre combat ensued custers charge leading the 1st michigan cavalry blunted the attack by wade hamptons brigade blocking stuart from achieving his objectives in the u s rear meanwhile after hearing news of the days victory brig gen judson kilpatrick launched a cavalry attack against the infantry positions of longstreets corps southwest of big round top brig gen elon j farnsworth protested against the futility of such a move but obeyed orders farnsworth was killed in the attack and his brigade

captured or missing 9 nearly a third of lees general officers were killed wounded or captured 81 the casualties for both sides during the entire campaign were 57225 82in addition to being the deadliest battle of the war in terms of total casualties gettysburg also had the highest number of generals killed in action of any battle in the war the confederacy lost generals paul jones semmes william barksdale william dorsey pender richard garnett and lewis armistead as well as j johnston pettigrew during the retreat after the battle the union lost generals john reynolds samuel k zook stephen h weed and elon j farnsworth as well as strong vincent who after being mortally wounded was given a deathbed promotion to brigadier general additional senior officer casualties included the wounding of union generals dan sickles lost a leg francis c barlow and winfield scott hancock for the confederacy major general john bell hood lost the use of his left arm while major general henry heth received a shot to the head on the first day of battle though incapacitated for the rest of the battle he remarkably survived without long term injuries credited in part due to his hat stuffed full of paper dispatches confederate generals james kemper and isaac r trimble were severely wounded during picketts charge and captured during the confederate retreat general james j archer in

civilian death during the battle ginnie wade also widely known as jennie 20 years old was hit by a stray bullet that passed through her kitchen in town while she was making bread 85 another notable civilian casualty was john l burns a 69year old veteran of the war of 1812 who walked to the front lines on the first day of battle and participated in heavy combat as a volunteer receiving numerous wounds in the process despite his age and injuries burns survived the battle and lived until 1872 86 nearly 8000 had been killed outright these bodies lying in the hot summer sun needed to be buried quickly over 3000 horse carcasses 87 were burned in a series of piles south of town townsfolk became violently ill from the stench 88 meanwhile the town of gettysburg with its population of just 2400 found itself tasked with taking care of 14000 wounded union troops and an additional 8000 confederate prisoners 89confederate retreat further information retreat from gettysburg gettysburg campaign july 5 – july 14 1863the armies stared at one another in a heavy rain across the bloody fields on july 4 the same day that the vicksburg garrison surrendered to maj gen ulysses s grant lee had reformed his lines into a defensive position on seminary ridge the night of july 3 evacuating the town of gettysburg the confederates remained on the battlefield hoping that meade would attack but the cautious union commander decided against the risk a decision for which he would later be criticized both armies began to collect their remaining wounded and bury some of the dead a proposal by lee for a prisoner exchange was rejected by meade 90lee started his army of northern virginia in motion late the evening of july 4 towards fairfield and chambersburg cavalry under brig gen john d imboden was entrusted to escort the mileslong wagon train of supplies and wounded men that lee wanted to take back to virginia with him using the route through cashtown and hagerstown to williamsport maryland meades army followed although the pursuit was halfspirited the recently rainswollen potomac trapped lees army on the north bank of the river for a time but when the union troops finally caught up the confederates had forded the river the rearguard action at falling waters on july 14 added some more names to the long casualty lists including general pettigrew who was mortally wounded 91 general james kemper severely wounded during picketts charge was captured during lees retreat in a brief letter to maj gen henry w halleck written on july 7 lincoln remarked on the two major union victories at gettysburg and vicksburg he continued now if gen meade can complete his work so gloriously prosecuted thus far by the literal or substantial destruction of lees army the rebellion will be over 92halleck then relayed the contents of lincolns letter to meade in a telegram despite repeated pleas from lincoln and halleck which continued over the next week meade did not pursue lees army aggressively enough to destroy it before it crossed back over the potomac river to safety in the south the campaign continued into virginia with light engagements until july 23 in the minor battle of manassas gap after which meade abandoned any attempts at pursuit and the two armies took up positions across from each other on the rappahannock river 93union reaction to the news of the victory the news of the union victory electrified the north a headline in the philadelphia inquirer proclaimed victory waterloo eclipsed new york diarist george templeton strong wrote 94the results of this victory are priceless  the charm of robert e lees invincibility is broken the army of the potomac has at last found a general that can handle it and has stood nobly up to its terrible work in spite of its long disheartening list of hardfought failures  copperheads are palsied and dumb for the moment at least  government is strengthened fourfold at home and abroad— george templeton strong diary p 330 however the union enthusiasm soon dissipated as the public realized that lees army had escaped destruction and the war would continue lincoln complained to secretary of the navy gideon welles that our army held the war in the hollow of their hand and they would not close it 95 brig gen alexander s webb wrote to his father on july 17 stating that such washington politicians as  chase seward and others disgusted with meade write to me that lee really won that battle 96effect on the confederacy in fact the confederates had lost militarily and also politically during the final hours of the battle confederate vice president alexander stephens was approaching the union lines at norfolk virginia under a flag of truce although his formal instructions from confederate president jefferson davis had limited his powers to negotiate on prisoner exchanges and other procedural matters historian james m mc pherson speculates that he had informal goals of presenting peace overtures davis had hoped that stephens would reach washington from the south while lees victorious army was marching toward it from the north president lincoln upon hearing of the gettysburg results refused stephenss request to pass through the lines furthermore when the news reached london any lingering hopes of european recognition of the confederacy were finally abandoned henry adams wrote the disasters of the rebels are unredeemed by even any hope of success it is now conceded that all idea of intervention is at an end 97compounding the effects of the defeat would be end of the siege of vicksburg which surrendered to grants federal armies in the west on july 4 the day after the gettysburg battle the immediate reaction of the southern military and public sectors was that gettysburg was a setback not a disaster the sentiment was that lee had been successful on july 1 and had fought a valiant battle on july 2–3 but could not dislodge the union army from the strong defensive position to which it fled the confederates successfully stood their ground on july 4 and withdrew only after they realized meade would not attack them the withdrawal to the potomac that could have been a disaster was handled masterfully furthermore the army of the potomac had been kept away from virginia farmlands for the summer and all predicted that meade would be too timid to threaten them for the rest of the year lee himself had a positive view of the campaign writing to his wife that the army had returned rather sooner than i had originally contemplated but having accomplished what i proposed on leaving the rappahannock viz relieving the valley of the presence of the enemy and drawing his army north of the potomac he was quoted as saying to maj john seddon brother of the confederate secretary of war sir we did whip them at gettysburg and it will be seen for the next six months that that army will be as quiet as a sucking dove some southern publications such as the charleston mercury criticized lees actions in the campaign and on august 8 he offered his resignation to president davis who quickly rejected it 98gettysburg became a postbellum focus of the lost cause a movement by writers such as edward a pollard and jubal early to explain the reasons for the confederate defeat in the war a fundamental premise of their argument was that the south was doomed because of the overwhelming advantage in manpower and industrial might possessed by the north however they claim it also suffered because robert e lee who up until this time had been almost invincible was betrayed by the failures of some of his key subordinates at gettysburg ewell for failing to seize cemetery hill on july 1 stuart for depriving the army of cavalry intelligence for a key part of the campaign and especially longstreet for failing to attack on july 2 as early and as forcefully as lee had originally intended in this view gettysburg was seen as a great lost opportunity in which a decisive victory by lee could have meant the end of the war in the confederacys favor 99after the war general pickett was asked why confederates lost at gettysburg he replied i always thought the yankees had something to do with it 100gettysburg address main article gettysburg address gettysburg november 19 1863 crowd of citizens soldiers and etc with a red arrow indicating abraham lincoln gettysburg national cemetery the ravages of war were still evident in gettysburg more than four months later when on november 19 the soldiers national cemetery was dedicated during this ceremony president abraham lincoln honored the fallen and redefined the purpose of the war in his historic gettysburg address 101historical assessment decisive victory controversies the nature of the result of the battle of gettysburg has been the subject of controversy for years  when although not seen as overwhelmingly significant at the time particularly since the war continued for almost two years in retrospect it has often been cited as the turning point usually in combination with the fall of vicksburg the following day 13 this is based on the observation that after gettysburg lees army conducted no more strategic offensives—his army merely reacted to the initiative of ulysses s grant in 1864 and 1865—and by the speculative viewpoint of the lost cause writers that a confederate victory at gettysburg might have resulted in the end of the war 102 the army of the potomac had won a victory it might be less of a victory than mr lincoln had hoped for but it was nevertheless a victory—and because of that it was no longer possible for the confederacy to win the war the north might still lose it to be sure if the soldiers or the people should lose heart but outright defeat was no longer in the cards bruce catton glory road 103it is currently a widely held view that gettysburg was a decisive victory for the union but the term is considered imprecise it is inarguable that lees offensive on july 3 was turned back decisively and his campaign in pennsylvania was terminated prematurely although the confederates at the time argued that this was a temporary setback and that the goals of the campaign were largely met however when the more common definition of decisive victory is intended—an indisputable military victory of a battle that determines or significantly influences the ultimate result of a conflict—historians are divided for example david j eicher called gettysburg a strategic loss for the confederacy and james m mc pherson wrote that lee and his men would go on to earn further laurels but they never again possessed the power and reputation they carried into pennsylvania those palmy summer days of 1863 104however herman hattaway and archer jones wrote that the strategic impact of the battle of gettysburg was  fairly limited steven e woodworth wrote that gettysburg proved only the near impossibility of decisive action in the eastern theater edwin coddington pointed out the heavy toll on the army of the potomac and that after the battle meade no longer possessed a truly effective instrument for the accomplishments of his task the army needed a thorough reorganization with new commanders and fresh troops but these changes were not made until grant appeared on the scene in march 1864 joseph t glatthaar wrote that lost opportunities and near successes plagued the army of northern virginia during its northern invasion yet after gettysburg without the distractions of duty as an invading force without the breakdown of discipline the army of northern virginia remained an extremely formidable force ed bearss wrote lees invasion of the north had been a costly failure nevertheless at best the army of the potomac had simply preserved the strategic stalemate in the eastern theater  105 furthermore the confederacy soon proved it was still capable of winning significant victories over the northern forces in both the east  battle of cold harbor and west  battle of chickamauga  peter carmichael refers to the military context for the armies the horrendous losses at chancellorsville and gettysburg which effectively destroyed lees offensive capacity implying that these cumulative losses were not the result of a single battle thomas goss writing in the u s armys military review journal on the definition of decisive and the application of that description to gettysburg concludes for all that was decided and accomplished the battle of gettysburg fails to earn the label decisive battle 106 the military historian john keegan agrees gettysburg was a landmark battle the largest of the war and it would not be surpassed the union had restored to it the belief in certain victory and the loss dispirited the confederacy if not exactly a decisive battle gettysburg was the end of confederate use of northern virginia as a military buffer zone the setting for grants overland campaign 107lee vs meade george g meade prior to gettysburg robert e lee had established a reputation as an almost invincible general achieving stunning victories against superior numbers—although usually at the cost of high casualties to his army—during the seven days the northern virginia campaign including the second battle of bull run  fredericksburg and chancellorsville only the maryland campaign with its tactically inconclusive battle of antietam had been less than successful therefore historians have attempted to explain how lees winning streak was interrupted so dramatically at gettysburg although the issue is tainted by attempts to portray history and lees reputation in a manner supporting different partisan goals the major factors in lees loss arguably can be attributed to 1 his overconfidence in the invincibility of his men 2 the performance of his subordinates and his management thereof 3 his failing health and 4 the performance of his opponent george g meade and the army of the potomac robert e lee throughout the campaign lee was influenced by the belief that his men were invincible most of lees experiences with the army of northern virginia had convinced him of this including the great victory at chancellorsville in early may and the rout of the union troops at gettysburg on july 1 since morale plays an important role in military victory when other factors are equal lee did not want to dampen his armys desire to fight and resisted suggestions principally by longstreet to withdraw from the recently captured gettysburg to select a ground more favorable to his army war correspondent peter w alexander wrote that lee acted probably under the impression that his troops were able to carry any position however formidable if such was the case he committed an error such however as the ablest commanders will sometimes fall into lee himself concurred with this judgment writing to president davis no blame can be attached to the army for its failure to accomplish what was projected by me nor should it be censured for the unreasonable expectations of the public—i am alone to blame in perhaps expecting too much of its prowess and valor 108the most controversial assessments of the battle involve the performance of lees subordinates the dominant theme of the lost cause writers and many other historians is that lees senior generals failed him in crucial ways directly causing the loss of the battle the alternative viewpoint is that lee did not manage his subordinates adequately and did not thereby compensate for their shortcomings 109 two of his corps commanders— richard s ewell and a p hill —had only recently been promoted and were not fully accustomed to lees style of command in which he provided only general objectives and guidance to their former commander stonewall jackson jackson translated these into detailed specific orders to his division commanders 110 all four of lees principal commanders received criticism during the campaign and battle 111james longstreet suffered most severely from the wrath of the lost cause authors not the least because he directly criticized lee in postbellum writings and became a republican after the war his critics accuse him of attacking much later than lee intended on july 2 squandering a chance to hit the union army before its defensive positions had firmed up they also question his lack of motivation to attack strongly on july 2 and 3 because he had argued that the army should have maneuvered to a place where it would force meade to attack them the alternative view is that lee was in close contact with longstreet during the battle agreed to delays on the morning of july 2 and never criticized longstreets performance there is also considerable speculation about what an attack might have looked like before dan sickles moved the iii corps toward the peach orchard 112j e b stuart deprived lee of cavalry intelligence during a good part of the campaign by taking his three best brigades on a path away from the armys this arguably led to lees surprise at hookers vigorous pursuit the meeting engagement on july 1 that escalated into the full battle prematurely and it also prevented lee from understanding the full disposition of the enemy on july 2 the disagreements regarding stuarts culpability for the situation originate in the relatively vague orders issued by lee but most modern historians agree that both generals were responsible to some extent for the failure of the cavalrys mission early in the campaign 113richard s ewell has been universally criticized for failing to seize the high ground on the afternoon of july 1 once again the disagreement centers on lees orders which provided general guidance for ewell to act if practicable many historians speculate that stonewall jackson if he had survived chancellorsville would have aggressively seized culps hill rendering cemetery hill indefensible and changing the entire complexion of the battle a differently worded order from lee might have made the difference with this subordinate 114a p hill has received some criticism for his ineffective performance his actions caused the battle to begin and then escalate on july 1 despite lees orders not to bring on a general engagement although historians point out that hill kept lee well informed of his actions during the day however hills illness minimized his personal involvement in the remainder of the battle and lee took the explicit step of temporarily removing troops from hills corps and giving them to longstreet for picketts charge 115winfield s hancock in addition to hills illness lees performance was affected by heart troubles which would eventually lead to his death in 1870 he had been diagnosed with pericarditis by his staff physicians in march 1863 though modern doctors believe he had in fact suffered a heart attack 116 he wrote to jefferson davis that his physical condition prevented him from offering full supervision in the field and said i am so dull that in making use of the eyes of others i am frequently misled 117as a final factor lee faced a new and formidable opponent in george g meade and the army of the potomac fought well on its home territory although new to his army command meade deployed his forces relatively effectively relied on strong subordinates such as winfield s hancock to make decisions where and when they were needed took great advantage of defensive positions nimbly shifted defensive resources on interior lines to parry strong threats and unlike some of his predecessors stood his ground throughout the battle in the face of fierce confederate attacks lee was quoted before the battle as saying meade would commit no blunders on my front and if i make one  will make haste to take advantage of it that prediction proved to be correct at gettysburg stephen sears wrote the fact of the matter is that george g meade unexpectedly and against all odds thoroughly outgeneraled robert e lee at gettysburg edwin b coddington wrote that the soldiers of the army of the potomac received a sense of triumph which grew into an imperishable faith in themselves the men knew what they could do under an extremely competent general one of lesser ability and courage could well have lost the battle 118meade had his own detractors as well similar to the situation with lee meade suffered partisan attacks about his performance at gettysburg but he had the misfortune of experiencing them in person supporters of his predecessor maj gen joseph hooker lambasted meade before the u s congress s joint committee on the conduct of the war where radical republicans suspected that meade was a copperhead and tried in vain to relieve him from command daniel e sickles and daniel butterfield accused meade of planning to retreat from gettysburg during the battle most politicians including lincoln criticized meade for what they considered to be his halfhearted pursuit of lee after the battle a number of meades most competent subordinates— winfield s hancock john gibbon gouverneur k warren and henry j hunt all heroes of the battle—defended meade in print but meade was embittered by the overall experience 119battlefield preservation
