reference canyons formed by rivers making deep cuts within the earths terrain1  9endless grand canyon the red of cactus blooms pops in a grand canyon valley cut by the colorado river over millions of years the grand canyon is considered one of the finest examples of aridland erosion in the world the immense canyon is 277 miles 446 kilometers long and averages 4000 feet 1200 meters deep but it is only 15 miles 24 kilometers across at its widest photograph by barry tessman ethiopian highlands sheer basalt towers rooted in floodcarved gorges mark the simen mountains in ethiopia this harsh landscape sometimes called the african alps is the only home of the endangered gelada baboon the monkeys find protection from jackals hyenas and leopards on the canyons sheer cliffs photograph by michael nichols colorado river bed water rushes around rocks as the colorado river continues to cut its way through the grand canyon it takes two days by foot or mule to get to the bottom of the grand canyon and back and at least two weeks to complete the journey through the canyon by raft in 1963 the glen canyon dam was completed upstream of the grand canyon radically changing the flow of the

canyon scores the arizona desert just one of many dotting the states border with utah slot canyons are comparatively short and unusually narrow canyons that can be several hundred feet deep a region needs a special combination of rainfall and geographical features to make slot canyons possible rainwater and snowmelt cut and rubbed the red rock of this region for eons to form these slots

vital resource in the arid southwest—exists in the form of springs streams and seeps photograph by michael nichols antelope canyon arizona sunlight sneaks into the crevices of arizonas antelope canyon painting the undulations crafted by years of flash floods and other erosive processes the slot canyon is one of the most visited canyons in the southwest photograph by paul nicklen grand canyon of

its sand and gravel photograph by norbert rosing canyon de chelly arizona carved rock stretches as far as the eye can see in canyon de chelly national monument in arizona canyon de chelly is unique among u s national parks—it is composed entirely of navajo tribal trust land which remains home to a navajo community according to navajo beliefs a deity named spider woman lived on top of spider rock the sandstone monolith in the foreground of this picture she devoured children who misbehaved and their bleached bones turned the top of spider rock white photograph by bill hatcher bound by cliffs and cut by erosion canyons are deep narrow valleys in the earths crust that evoke superlatives and a sense of wonder layers of rock outline stories of regional geology like the table of contents to a scientific text the landforms commonly break parched terrain where rivers are the major force that sculpts the land they are also found on ocean floors where the currents dig underwater grooves grand is the word used to describe one of the most famous canyons of all cut by the colorado river over the last few million years the grand canyon is 277 miles 446 kilometers long more than 5000 feet 1500 meters deep but only 18 miles 29 kilometers across at its widest yawn layers of rock in the grand canyon tell much about the colorado plateaus formative years a mountain range built with twobillionyearold rock and then eroded away sediments deposited from an ancient sea more mountains more erosion another sea a burst of volcanic activity and the birth of a river that has since carved the chasm by washing the layers away you might also like canyons are we losing the grand canyon the larsen c ice shelf collapse is just the beginning—antarctica is melting each layer erodes differently some crumble into slopes others sheer cliffs they stack together like a leaning staircase that leads to the rivers edge a mixture of minerals gives each layer a distinctive hue of yellow green or red and its immense size has been seen by very few more people have orbited the earth than have hked the grand canyon from end to end follow the trek of pete mc bride and kevin fedarko using this interactive map types of canyons other canyons start where a spring sprouts from the base of a cliff such cliffs are composed of permeable or porous rock instead of flowing off the cliff water seeps down into the rock until it hits an impermeable layer beneath and is forced to leak sideways where the water emerges the cliff wall is weakened and eventually collapses a box canyon forms as sections of wall collapse further and further back into the land the heads of these canyons are marked by cliffs on at least three sides slot canyons are narrow corridors sliced into eroding plateaus by periodic bursts of rushing water some measure less than a few feet across but drop several hundred feet to the floor submarine canyons are similar to those on land in shape and form but are cut by currents on the ocean floor many are the mere extension of a river canyon as it dumps into the ocean and flows across the continental shelf others are gouged from turbid currents that occasionally plunge to the ocean floor
