nba referee scott foster standing next to detroit pistons forward anthony tolliver signals during a gameon friday carlos osorio  apevery play can result in a foul call a technical or even an ejection the momentum of a game and sometimes the outcome can depend on the skill of the referees blowing or not blowing the whistles this season there are 64 nba referees ranging from rookies gediminas petraitis tyler ford and mitchell ervin to veterans joey crawford in his 39th season and danny crawford 31st season who were making calls when magic johnson and michael jordan were in their prime given the importance of referees the times conducted an anonymous survey with nearly three dozen nba players head coaches and assistants to see who they consider the three best referees in the league are there any out there one longtime assistant coach asked incredulously the players and coaches were also asked to list the three worst referees in the association oh there are a lot of them said a veteran player who was laughing clearly the adversarial relationship is a constant between the officials who call the games and the players and coaches who resent the calls that go against them nevertheless according to our survey here are the three best nba referees1 danny crawford who got 30 votes2 joey crawford no relation with 25 votes3 monty mc cutchen with 13 votes and now the three worst officials in the league according to players and coaches we surveyed1 scott foster with 24 votes2 lauren holtkamp with 14 votes3 marc davis with 12 votes lets be honest there are some very good refs and some bad refs they make some good calls and they make some bad calls said one veteran player we make mistakes too as players we like some refs and we hate some refs thats just the way it is danny crawford 62 came out on the top of our survey because he is wellliked because of his communication skills hes been in the league for a long time and a lot of guys respect him one player said you wont get cheated by him now does he make mistakes yes i like it where hell tell a star to shut up at the same time he knows there is a pecking order and he gives certain players more respect than others a lot of the new refs are terrible and the old refs wont speak to you but danny gives you a happy medium danny is good because hell talk to you another player said he doesnt take it personal if you question him as long as youre not tripping or your tone is not all messed up if youre asking a question even if youre questioning his call he doesnt take it like its an affront to his manhood he might tell you some stuff like youre wrong but hell treat you like a man like a human being every player and coach knows that joey crawford 64 can have a short fuse and is not to be crossed but they all say crawford who is retiring after this season is fair once upon a time you couldnt talk to joey an nba head coach said hes cleaned that up â€” big time he runs it when hes on the floor now for me thats big i dont care if its at home or on the road hes not going to get intimidated by the crowd to me thats big with officials you have guys that are homers where the home crowd can sway them but not joey theres no nonsense when joey is doing stuff one player said when joey says yall been warned everybody stops players joke about how welldressed mc cutchen is when he arrives at games but they also like his honesty mc cutchen 49 is in his 23rd season there was a game against us where he missed the call and during a timeout he was like yeah when i watch that one back im probably going to want to slap myself thats cool said an assistant coach youre going to miss a call and were going to mess up coaching you just own to what you do and monty does that monty is just solid a player said he explains things he doesnt have an attitude and he does wear some nice suits but if hes going to call your game you know hes going to be fair the trio of top referees all have lengthy experience in the league but time served doesnt automatically make you a good referee at least according to our survey foster 48 who got the worst grades of any referee has been in the business for 22 seasons he had one of our playoff games and as soon as he walked in i was like this game is over we all knew we were going to get bad calls and we did said one veteran player you couldnt say anything to him hell i dont think you could even look at him you cant talk to him hes never wrong one player complained about foster i like refs where they say you know what i made a mistake i saw it at halftime you were right but scott foster thinks he never makes a mistake the players see the stats of how he is on the road he always helps the road team out he loves to stick it to teams holtkamp 35 is in her second season in the nba take the female part aside shes just new a player said but with her i thought she took it a little bit personal thinking players talk to her the wrong way when youre young like an nba player or a ref youve got to come in seeking knowledge you cant come in blowing the whistle she came in like im a female and youre not going to talk a certain way to me no one called her a bad name no one disrespected her its her terrible calls shes got no feel for the game and shes terrible a head coach said and closing out the list is davis 48 an 18year veteran official hes cool as they come but hes so arrogant one player said he instigates things sometimes marc will go back at a player he forgets that hes talking to another man dont challenge a mans manhood now you are going too far marc davis is hands down the worst a player said he acts likes hes your friend but hell just screw you hell screw you and hell get the biggest attitude about it broderickturnerlatimescom twitter
