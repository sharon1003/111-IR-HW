studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior with antidepressant use in patients over age 24 there was a trend toward reduced risk with antidepressant use in patients aged 65 and older see warnings and precautions 51 in patients of all ages who are started on antidepressant therapy monitor closely for worsening and for emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors advise families and caregivers of the need for close observation and communication with the prescriber see warnings and precautions 51 trintellix has not been evaluated for use in pediatric patients see use in specific populations 84  indications and usage for trintellix major depressive disorder trintellix is indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder mdd the efficacy of trintellix was established in six 6 to 8 week studies including one study in the elderly and one maintenance study in adults see clinical studies 14 slideshow cymbalta  cause for concern trintellix dosage and administration general instruction for use the recommended starting dose is 10 mg administered orally once daily without regard to meals dosage should then be increased to 20 mgday as tolerated because higher doses demonstrated better treatment effects in trials conducted in the united states the efficacy and safety of doses above 20 mgday have not been evaluated in controlled clinical trials a dose decrease down to 5 mgday may be considered for patients who do not tolerate higher doses see clinical studies 14  maintenancecontinuationextended treatment it is generally agreed that acute episodes of major depression should be followed by several months or longer of sustained pharmacologic therapy a maintenance study of trintellix demonstrated that trintellix decreased the risk of recurrence of depressive episodes compared to placebo discontinuing treatment although trintellix can be abruptly discontinued in placebocontrolled trials patients experienced transient adverse reactions such as headache and muscle tension following abrupt discontinuation of trintellix 15 mgday or 20 mgday to avoid these adverse reactions it is recommended that the dose be decreased to 10 mgday for one week before full discontinuation of trintellix 15 mgday or 20 mgday see adverse reactions 6 switching a patient to or from a monoamine oxidase inhibitor maoi intended to treat psychiatric disorders at least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of a maoi intended to treat psychiatric disorders and initiation of therapy with trintellix to avoid the risk of serotonin syndrome see warnings and precautions 52 conversely at least 21 days should be allowed after stopping trintellix before starting an maoi intended to treat psychiatric disorders see contraindications 4  use of trintellix with other maois such as linezolid or methylene blue do not start trintellix in a patient who is being treated with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue because there is an increased risk of serotonin syndrome in a patient who requires more urgent treatment of a psychiatric condition other interventions including hospitalization should be considered see contraindications 4  in some cases a patient already receiving trintellix therapy may require urgent treatment with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue if acceptable alternatives to linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are not available and the potential benefits of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are judged to outweigh the risks of serotonin syndrome in a particular patient trintellix should be stopped promptly and linezolid or intravenous methylene blue can be administered the patient should be monitored for symptoms of serotonin syndrome for 21 days or until 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue whichever comes first therapy with trintellix may be resumed 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue see warnings and precautions 52  the risk of administering methylene blue by nonintravenous routes such as oral tablets or by local injection or in intravenous doses much lower than 1 mgkg with trintellix is unclear the clinician should nevertheless be aware of the possibility of emergent symptoms of serotonin syndrome with such use see warnings and precautions 52  use of trintellix in known cyp2d6 poor metabolizers or in patients taking strong cyp2d6 inhibitors the maximum recommended dose of trintellix is 10 mgday in known cyp2d6 poor metabolizers reduce the dose of trintellix by onehalf when patients are receiving a cyp2d6 strong inhibitor eg bupropion fluoxetine paroxetine or quinidine concomitantly the dose should be increased to the original level when the cyp2d6 inhibitor is discontinued see drug interactions 73 use of trintellix in patients taking strong cyp inducers consider increasing the dose of trintellix when a strong cyp inducer eg rifampin carbamazepine or phenytoin is coadministered for greater than 14 days the maximum recommended dose should not exceed three times the original dose the dose of trintellix should be reduced to the original level within 14 days when the inducer is discontinued see drug interactions 73 dosage forms and strengths trintellix is available as immediaterelease filmcoated tablets in the following strengths5 mg pink almond

has been reported in patients treated with trintellix the use of maois intended to treat psychiatric disorders with trintellix or within 21 days of stopping treatment with trintellix is contraindicated because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome the use of trintellix within 14 days of stopping an maoi intended to treat psychiatric disorders is also contraindicated see dosage and administration 24 and warnings and precautions 52 starting trintellix in a patient who is being treated with maois such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue is also contraindicated because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome see dosage and administration 25 and warnings and precautions 52  warnings and precautions clinical worsening and suicide risk patients with major depressive disorder mdd both adult and pediatric may experience worsening of their depression andor the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior suicidality or unusual changes in behavior whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide there has been a longstanding concern however that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment pooled analyses of shortterm placebocontrolled studies of antidepressant drugs selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ssris and others showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior suicidality in children adolescents and young adults ages 18 to 24 with mdd and other psychiatric disorders shortterm studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24 there was a trend toward reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older the pooled analyses of placebocontrolled studies in children and adolescents with mdd obsessivecompulsive disorder ocd or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 shortterm studies of nine antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients the pooled analyses of placebocontrolled studies in adults with mdd or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 shortterm studies median duration of two months of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77000 patients there was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied there were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications with the highest incidence in mdd the risk differences drug vs placebo however were relatively stable within age strata and across indications these risk differences drugplacebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated are provided in table 1 table 1 drugplacebo difference in number of cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated age range increases compared to placebo18 14 additional cases18  24 5 additional cases decreases compared to placebo25  64 1 fewer case≥65 6 fewer cases no suicides occurred in any of the pediatric studies there were suicides in the adult studies but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide it is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longerterm use ie beyond several months however there is substantial evidence from placebocontrolled maintenance studies in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression all patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening suicidality and unusual changes in behavior especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy or at times of dose changes either increases or decreases the following symptoms anxiety agitation panic attacks insomnia irritability hostility aggressiveness impulsivity akathisia psychomotor restlessness hypomania and mania have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for mdd as well as for other indications both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression andor the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen including possibly discontinuing the medication in patients whose depression is persistently worse or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality especially if these symptoms are severe abrupt in onset or were not part of the patients presenting symptoms families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for mdd or other indications both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation irritability unusual changes in behavior and the other symptoms described above as well as the emergence of suicidality and to report such symptoms immediately to healthcare providers such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers screening patients for bipolar disorder a major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder it is generally believed though not established in controlled studies that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixedmanic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown however prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history including a family history of suicide bipolar disorder and depression it should be noted that trintellix is not approved for use in treating bipolar depression serotonin syndrome the development of a potentially lifethreatening serotonin syndrome has been reported with serotonergic antidepressants including trintellix when used alone but more often when used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs including triptans tricyclic antidepressants fentanyl lithium tramadol tryptophan buspirone and st johns wort and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin in particular maois both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes eg agitation hallucinations delirium and coma autonomic instability eg tachycardia labile blood pressure dizziness diaphoresis flushing hyperthermia neuromuscular symptoms eg tremor rigidity myoclonus hyperreflexia incoordination seizures andor gastrointestinal symptoms eg nausea vomiting diarrhea patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome the concomitant use of trintellix with maois intended to treat psychiatric disorders is contraindicated trintellix should also not be started in a patient who is being treated with maois such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue all reports with methylene blue that provided information on the route of administration involved intravenous administration in the dose range of 1 mgkg to 8 mgkg no reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes such as oral tablets or local tissue injection or at lower doses there may be circumstances when it is necessary to initiate treatment with a maoi such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking trintellix trintellix should be discontinued before initiating treatment with the maoi see contraindications 4 and dosage and administration 24 if concomitant use of trintellix with other serotonergic drugs including triptans tricyclic antidepressants fentanyl lithium tramadol buspirone tryptophan and st johns wort is clinically warranted patients should be made aware of a potential increased risk for serotonin syndrome particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases treatment with trintellix and any concomitant serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately if the above events occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated abnormal bleeding the use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake inhibition including trintellix may increase the risk of bleeding events concomitant use of aspirin nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids warfarin and other anticoagulants may add to this risk case reports and epidemiological studies casecontrol and cohort design have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding bleeding events related to drugs that inhibit serotonin reuptake have ranged from ecchymosis hematoma epistaxis and petechiae to lifethreatening hemorrhages patients should be cautioned about the increased risk of bleeding when trintellix is coadministered with nsaids aspirin or other drugs that affect coagulation or bleeding see drug interactions 72  activation of maniahypomania symptoms of maniahypomania were reported in 01 of patients treated with trintellix in premarketing clinical studies activation of maniahypomania has been reported in a small proportion of patients with major affective disorder who were treated with other antidepressants as with all antidepressants use trintellix cautiously in patients with a history or family history of bipolar disorder mania or hypomania angle closure glaucoma angle closure glaucoma the pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs including trintellix may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy hyponatremia hyponatremia has occurred as a result of treatment with serotonergic drugs in many cases hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion siadh one case with serum sodium lower than 110 mmoll was reported in a subject treated with trintellix in a premarketing clinical study elderly patients may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with a serotonergic antidepressant also patients taking diuretics or who are otherwise volumedepleted can be at greater risk discontinuation of trintellix in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia and appropriate medical intervention should be instituted signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache difficulty concentrating memory impairment confusion weakness and unsteadiness which can lead to falls more severe andor acute cases have included

mechanism of action of trintellix and the potential for serotonin toxicity serotonin syndrome may occur when trintellix is coadministered with other drugs that may affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems eg ssris snris triptans buspirone tramadol and tryptophan products etc closely monitor symptoms of serotonin syndrome if trintellix is coadministered with other serotonergic drugs treatment with trintellix and any concomitant serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately if serotonin syndrome occurs see warnings and precautions 52  other cns active agents no clinically relevant effect was observed on steady state lithium exposure following coadministration with multiple daily doses of trintellix multiple doses of trintellix did not affect the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics composite cognitive score of diazepam a clinical study has shown that trintellix single dose of 20 or 40 mg did not increase the impairment of mental and motor skills caused by alcohol single dose of 06 gkg details on the potential pharmacokinetic interactions between trintellix and bupropion can be found in section 73 drugs that interfere with hemostasis eg nsaids aspirin and warfarinserotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis epidemiological studies of casecontrol and cohort design have demonstrated an association between use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding these studies have also shown that concurrent use of an nsaid or aspirin may potentiate this risk of bleeding altered anticoagulant effects including increased bleeding have been reported when ssris and snris are coadministered with warfarin following coadministration of stable doses of warfarin 1 to 10 mgday with multiple daily doses of trintellix no significant effects were observed in inr prothrombin values or total warfarin protein bound plus free drug pharmacokinetics for both r

is unlikely to induce the metabolism of drugs metabolized by these cyp isoforms furthermore in a series of clinical drug interaction studies coadministration of trintellix with substrates for cyp2b6 eg bupropion cyp2c9 eg warfarin and cyp2c19 eg diazepam had no clinical meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of these substrates figure 2 because vortioxetine is highly bound to plasma protein coadministration of trintellix with another drug that is highly protein bound may increase free concentrations of the other drug however in a clinical study with coadministration of trintellix 10

specific populationspregnancy risk summary there are limited human data on trintellix use during pregnancy to inform any drugassociated risks however there are clinical considerations regarding neonates exposed to ssris and snris including trintellix during the third trimester of pregnancy see clinical considerations vortioxetine administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses ≥15 times and 10 times the maximum recommended human dose mrhd respectively resulted in decreased fetal body weight and delayed ossification no malformations were seen at doses up to 77 times and 58 times the mrhd respectively vortioxetine administered to pregnant rats during gestation and lactation at oral doses ≥20 times the mrhd resulted in a decrease in the number of liveborn pups and an increase in early postnatal pup mortality decreased pup weight at birth to weaning occurred at 58 times the mrhd and delayed physical development occurred at ≥20 times the mrhd these effects were not seen at 5 times the mrhd see data advise a pregnant woman of the potential risk to a fetus the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown all pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect loss or other adverse outcomes in the u s general population the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 24 and 1520 respectively clinical considerations diseaseassociated maternal andor embryofetal risk a prospective longitudinal study followed 201 pregnant women with a history of major depressive disorder who were euthymic and taking antidepressants at the beginning of pregnancy the women who discontinued antidepressants during pregnancy were more likely to experience a relapse of major depression than women who continued antidepressants consider the risks of untreated depression when discontinuing or changing treatment with antidepressant

the third trimester of pregnancy for pphn and drug discontinuation syndrome see data data human data third trimester exposure neonates exposed to ssris or snris late in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization respiratory support and tube feeding these findings are based on postmarketing reports such complications can arise immediately upon delivery reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress cyanosis apnea seizures temperature instability feeding difficulty vomiting hypoglycemia hypotonia hypertonia hyperreflexia tremor jitteriness irritability and constant crying these features are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of ssris and snris or possibly a drug discontinuation syndrome in some cases the clinical picture was consistent with serotonin syndrome see warnings and precautions 52 exposure during late pregnancy to ssris may have an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn pphn pphn occurs in one to two per 1000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality in a retrospective casecontrol study of 377 women whose infants were born with pphn and 836 women whose infants were born healthy the risk for developing pphn was approximately six fold higher for infants exposed to ssris after the 20th week of gestation compared to infants who had not been exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy a study of 831324 infants born in sweden in 1997  2005 found a pphn risk ratio of 24 95 ci 1243 associated with patientreported maternal use of ssris in early pregnancy and a pphn risk ratio of 36 95 ci 1283 associated with a combination of patientreported maternal use of ssris in early pregnancy and an antenatal ssri prescription in later pregnancy animal data in pregnant rats and rabbits no malformations were seen when vortioxetine was given during the period of organogenesis at oral doses up to 160 and 60 mgkgday respectively these doses are 77 and 58 times the maximum recommended human dose mrhd of 20 mg on a mgm 2 basis in rats and rabbits respectively developmental delay seen as decreased fetal body weight and delayed ossification occurred in rats and rabbits at doses equal to and greater than 30 and 10 mgkg 15 and 10 times the mrhd respectively in the presence of maternal toxicity decreased food consumption and decreased body weight gain when vortioxetine was administered to pregnant rats at oral doses of 40 and 120 mgkg 20 and 58 times the mrhd respectively throughout pregnancy and lactation the number of liveborn pups was decreased and early postnatal pup mortality was increased additionally pup weights were decreased at birth to weaning at 120 mgkg and

premarketing clinical studies cases of overdose were limited to patients who accidentally or intentionally consumed up to a maximum dose of 40 mg of trintellix the maximum single dose tested was 75 mg in men ingestion of trintellix in the dose range of 40 to 75 mg was associated with increased rates of nausea dizziness diarrhea abdominal discomfort generalized pruritus somnolence and flushing management of overdose no specific antidotes for trintellix are known in managing over dosage consider the possibility of multiple drug involvement in case of overdose call poison control center at 18002221222 for latest recommendations trintellix description trintellix is an immediaterelease tablet for oral administration that contains the beta β polymorph of vortioxetine hydrobromide hbr an antidepressant vortioxetine hbr is known chemically as 1 2 24dimethylphenylsulfanylphenylpiperazine hydrobromide the empirical formula is c 18 h 22 n 2 s hbr with a molecular weight of 37936 gmol the structural formula is vortioxetine hbr is a white to very slightly beige powder that is slightly soluble in water each trintellix tablet contains 6355 mg 1271 mg or 2542 mg of vortioxetine hbr equivalent to 5 mg 10 mg or 20 mg of vortioxetine respectively the inactive ingredients in trintellix tablets include mannitol microcrystalline cellulose hydroxypropyl cellulose sodium starch glycolate magnesium stearate and film coating which consists of hypromellose titanium dioxide polyethylene glycol 400 iron oxide red 5 mg and 20 mg and iron oxide yellow 10 mg trintellix  clinical pharmacology mechanism of action the mechanism of the antidepressant effect of vortioxetine is not fully understood but is thought to be related to its enhancement of serotonergic activity in the cns through inhibition of the reuptake of serotonin 5ht it also has several other activities including 5ht3 receptor antagonism and 5ht1a receptor agonism the contribution of these activities to vortioxetines antidepressant effect has not been established pharmacodynamics vortioxetine binds with high affinity to the human serotonin transporter ki16 n m but not to the norepinephrine ki113 n m or dopamine ki1000 n m transporters vortioxetine potently and selectively inhibits reuptake of serotonin ic5054 n m vortioxetine binds to 5ht3 ki37 n m 5ht1a ki15 n m 5ht7 ki19 n m 5ht1d ki54 n m and 5ht1b ki33 n m receptors and is a 5ht3 5ht1d and 5ht7 receptor antagonist 5ht1b receptor partial agonist and 5ht1a receptor agonist in humans the mean 5ht transporter occupancy based on the results from two clinical pet studies using 5htt ligands   11 cmadam or  11 cdasb was approximately 50 at 5 mgday 65 at 10 mgday and approximately 80 at 20 mgday in the regions of interest effect on cardiac repolarization the effect of vortioxetine 10 mg and 40 mg administered once daily on qtc interval was evaluated in a randomized doubleblind placebo and activecontrolled moxifloxacin 400 mg fourtreatmentarm parallel study in 340 male subjects in the study the upper bound of the onesided 95 confidence interval for the qtc was below 10 ms the threshold for regulatory concern the oral dose of 40 mg is sufficient to assess the effect of metabolic inhibition effect on driving performance in a clinical study in healthy subjects trintellix did not impair driving performance or have adverse psychomotor or cognitive effects following single and multiple doses of 10 mgday pharmacokinetics vortioxetine pharmacological activity is due to the parent drug the pharmacokinetics of vortioxetine 25 mg to 60 mg are linear and doseproportional when vortioxetine is administered once daily the mean terminal halflife is approximately 66 hours and steadystate plasma concentrations are typically achieved within two weeks of dosing absorption the maximal plasma vortioxetine concentration c max after dosing is reached within 7 to 11 hours postdose t max  steadystate mean c max values were 9 18 and 33 ngm l following doses of 5 10 and 20 mgday absolute bioavailability is 75 no effect of food on the pharmacokinetics was observed distribution the apparent volume of distribution of vortioxetine is approximately 2600 l indicating extensive extravascular distribution the plasma protein binding of vortioxetine in humans is 98 independent of plasma concentrations no apparent difference in the plasma protein binding between healthy subjects and subjects with hepatic mild moderate or severe or renal mild moderate severe esrd impairment is observed metabolism and elimination vortioxetine is extensively metabolized primarily through oxidation via cytochrome p450 isozymes cyp2d6 cyp3a45 cyp2c19 cyp2c9 cyp2a6 cyp2c8 and cyp2b6 and subsequent glucuronic acid conjugation cyp2d6 is the primary enzyme catalyzing the metabolism of vortioxetine to its major pharmacologically inactive carboxylic acid metabolite and poor metabolizers of cyp2d6 have approximately twice the vortioxetine plasma concentration of extensive metabolizers following a single oral dose of  14 clabeled vortioxetine approximately 59 and 26 of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and feces respectively as metabolites negligible amounts of unchanged vortioxetine were excreted in the urine up to 48 hours the presence of hepatic mild moderate or severe or renal impairment mild moderate severe and esrd did not affect the apparent clearance of vortioxetine nonclinical toxicology carcinogenesis mutagenesis impairment of fertility carcinogenesis carcinogenicity studies were conducted in which cd1 mice and wistar rats were given oral doses of vortioxetine up to 50 and 100 mgkgday for male and female mice respectively and 40 and 80 mgkgday for male and female rats respectively for two years the doses in the two species were approximately 12 24 20 and 39 times respectively the maximum recommended human dose mrhd of 20 mg on a mgm 2 basis in rats the incidence of benign polypoid adenomas of the rectum was statistically significantly increased in females at doses 39 times the mrhd but not at 15 times the mrhd these were considered related to inflammation and hyperplasia and possibly caused by an interaction with a vehicle component of the formulation used for the study the finding did not occur in male rats at 20 times the mrhd in mice vortioxetine was not carcinogenic in males or females at doses up to 12 and 24 times respectively the mrhd mutagenicity vortioxetine was not genotoxic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay ames test an in vitro chromosome aberration assay in cultured human lymphocytes and an in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus assay impairment of fertility treatment of rats with vortioxetine at doses up to 120 mgkgday had no effect on male or female fertility which is 58 times the maximum recommended human dose mrhd of 20 mg on a mgm 2 basis clinical studies the efficacy of trintellix in treatment for mdd was established in six 6
