about 175 million years ago 4 in contrast to the present earth and its distribution of continental mass much of pangaea was in the southern hemisphere and surrounded by a superocean panthalassa

derived from ancient greek pan  πᾶν all entire whole and gaia  γαῖα  mother earth land 5 10 the concept that the continents once formed a continuous land mass was first proposed by alfred wegener the originator of the scientific theory of continental drift in his 1912 publication the origin of continents  die entstehung der kontinente  11 he expanded upon his hypothesis in his 1915 book the origin of continents and oceans  die entstehung der kontinente und ozeane  in which he postulated that before breaking up and drifting to their present locations all the continents had formed a single supercontinent that he called the  urkontinent  the name pangea occurs in the 1920 edition of die entstehung der kontinente und ozeane but only once when wegener refers to the ancient supercontinent as the pangaea of the carboniferous 12 wegener used the germanized form pangäa but the name entered german and english scientific literature in 1922 13 and 1926 respectively in the latinized form pangaea of the greek pangaia especially due to a symposium of the american association of petroleum geologists in november 1926 14formation appalachian orogeny the forming of supercontinents and their breaking up appears to have been cyclical through earths history there may have been many others before pangaea the fourthlast supercontinent called columbia or nuna appears to have assembled in the period 20–18 ga 15 16 columbianuna broke up and the next supercontinent rodinia formed from the accretion and assembly of its fragments rodinia lasted from about 11 billion years ago ga until about 750 million years ago but its exact configuration and geodynamic history are not nearly as well understood as those of the later supercontinents pannotia and pangaea when rodinia broke up it split into three pieces the supercontinent of protolaurasia the supercontinent of protogondwana and the smaller congo craton protolaurasia and protogondwana were separated by the prototethys ocean next protolaurasia itself split apart to form the continents of laurentia siberia and baltica baltica moved to the east of laurentia and siberia moved northeast of laurentia the splitting also created two new oceans the iapetus ocean and paleoasian ocean most of the above masses coalesced again to form the relatively shortlived supercontinent of pannotia this supercontinent included large amounts of land near the poles and near the equator only a relatively small strip connecting the polar masses pannotia lasted until 540 ma near the beginning of the cambrian period and then broke up giving rise to the continents of laurentia baltica and the southern supercontinent of gondwana in the cambrian period the continent of laurentia which would later become north america sat on the equator with three bordering oceans the panthalassic ocean to the north and west the iapetus ocean to the south and the khanty ocean to the east in the earliest ordovician around 480 ma the microcontinent of avalonia – a landmass incorporating fragments of what would become eastern newfoundland the southern british isles and parts of belgium northern france nova scotia new england south iberia and northwest africa – broke free from gondwana and began its journey to laurentia 17 baltica laurentia and avalonia all came together by the end of the ordovician to form a minor supercontinent called euramerica or laurussia closing the iapetus ocean the collision also resulted in the formation of the northern appalachians siberia sat near euramerica with the khanty ocean between the two continents while all this was happening gondwana drifted slowly towards the south pole this was the first step of the formation of pangaea 18the second step in the formation of pangaea was the collision of gondwana with euramerica by the silurian 440 ma baltica had already collided with laurentia forming euramerica avalonia had not yet collided with laurentia but as avalonia inched towards laurentia the seaway between them a remnant of the iapetus ocean was slowly shrinking meanwhile southern europe broke off from gondwana and began to move towards euramerica across the newly formed rheic ocean it collided with southern baltica in the devonian though this microcontinent was an underwater plate the iapetus oceans sister ocean the khanty ocean shrank as an island arc from siberia collided with eastern baltica now part of euramerica behind this island arc was a new ocean the ural ocean by the late silurian north and south china split from gondwana and started to head northward shrinking the prototethys ocean in their path and opening the new paleotethys ocean to their south in the devonian period gondwana itself headed towards euramerica causing the rheic ocean to shrink in the early carboniferous northwest africa had touched the southeastern coast of euramerica creating the southern portion of the appalachian mountains the meseta mountains and the mauritanide mountains south america moved northward to southern euramerica while the eastern portion of gondwana  india antarctica and australia headed toward the south pole from the equator north and south china were on independent continents the kazakhstania microcontinent had collided with siberia siberia had been a separate continent for millions of years since the deformation of the supercontinent pannotia in the middle carboniferous western kazakhstania collided with baltica in the late carboniferous closing the ural ocean between them and the western prototethys in them  uralian orogeny  causing the formation of not only the ural mountains but also the supercontinent of laurasia this was the last step of the formation of pangaea meanwhile south america had collided with southern laurentia closing the rheic ocean and forming the southernmost part of the appalachians and ouachita mountains by this time gondwana was positioned near the south pole and glaciers were forming in antarctica india australia southern africa and south america the north china block collided with siberia by the late carboniferous completely closing the prototethys ocean by the early permian the cimmerian plate split from gondwana and headed towards laurasia thus closing the paleotethys ocean but forming a new ocean the tethys ocean in its southern end most of the landmasses were all in one by the triassic period pangaea rotated a little and the cimmerian plate was still travelling across the shrinking paleotethys until the middle jurassic the paleotethys had closed from west to east creating the cimmerian orogeny pangaea which looked like a c with the new tethys ocean inside the c had rifted by the middle jurassic and its deformation is explained below evidence of existence the distribution of fossils across the continents is one line of evidence pointing to the existence of pangaea fossil evidence for pangaea includes the presence of similar and identical species on continents that are now great distances apart for example fossils of the therapsid lystrosaurus have been found in south africa india and antarctica alongside members of the glossopteris flora whose distribution would have ranged from the polar circle to the equator if the continents had been in their present position similarly the freshwater reptile mesosaurus has been found in only localized regions of the coasts of brazil and west africa 19additional evidence for pangaea is found in the geology of adjacent continents including matching geological trends between the eastern coast of south america and the western coast of africa the polar ice cap of the carboniferous period covered the southern end of pangaea glacial deposits specifically till of the same age and structure are found on many separate continents that would have been together in the continent of pangaea 20paleomagnetic study of apparent polar wandering paths also support the theory of a supercontinent geologists can determine the movement of continental plates by examining the orientation of magnetic minerals in rocks when rocks are formed they take on the magnetic properties of the earth and indicate in which direction the poles lie relative to the rock since the magnetic poles drift about the rotational pole with a period of only a few thousand years measurements from numerous lavas spanning several thousand years are averaged to give an apparent mean polar position samples of sedimentary rock and intrusive igneous rock have magnetic orientations that are typically an average of the secular variation in the orientation of magnetic north because their remanent magnetizations are not acquired instantaneously magnetic differences between sample groups whose age varies by millions of years is due to a combination of true polar wander and the drifting of continents the true polar wander component is identical for all samples and can be removed leaving geologists with the portion of this motion that shows continental drift and can be used to help reconstruct earlier continental positions 21the continuity of mountain chains provides further evidence for pangaea one example of this is the appalachian mountains chain which extends from the southeastern united states to the caledonides of ireland britain greenland and scandinavia 22rifting and breakup animation of the rifting of pangaea there were three major phases in the breakup of pangaea the first phase began in the early  middle jurassic about 175 ma when pangaea began to rift from the tethys ocean in the east to the pacific in the west the rifting that took place between north america and africa produced multiple failed rifts one rift resulted in a new ocean the north atlantic ocean 22the atlantic ocean did not open uniformly rifting began in the northcentral atlantic the south atlantic did not open until the cretaceous when laurasia started to rotate clockwise and moved northward with north america to the north and eurasia to the south the clockwise motion of laurasia led much later to the closing of the tethys ocean and the widening of the sinus borealis which later became the arctic ocean meanwhile on the other side of africa and along the adjacent margins of east africa antarctica and madagascar new rifts were forming that would lead to the formation of the southwestern indian ocean that would open up in the cretaceous the second major phase in the breakup of pangaea began in the early cretaceous 150–140 ma when the minor supercontinent of gondwana separated into multiple continents africa south america india antarctica and australia the subduction at tethyan trench probably caused africa india and australia to move northward causing the opening of a south indian ocean in the early cretaceous atlantica todays south america and africa finally separated from eastern gondwana antarctica india and australia then in the middle cretaceous gondwana fragmented to open up the south atlantic ocean as south america started to move westward away from africa the south atlantic did not develop uniformly rather it rifted from south to north also at the same time madagascar and india began to separate from antarctica and moved northward opening up the indian ocean madagascar and india separated from each other 100–90 ma in the late cretaceous india continued to move northward toward eurasia at 15 centimeters 6 in a year a plate tectonic record closing the eastern tethys ocean while madagascar stopped and became locked to the african plate new zealand new caledonia and the rest of zealandia began to separate from australia moving eastward toward the pacific and opening the coral sea and tasman sea the third major and final phase of the breakup of pangaea occurred in the early cenozoic  paleocene to oligocene  laurasia split when north americagreenland also called laurentia broke free from eurasia opening the norwegian sea about 60–55 ma the atlantic and indian oceans continued to expand closing the tethys ocean meanwhile australia split from antarctica and moved quickly northward just as india had done more than 40 million years before australia is currently on a collision course with eastern asia both australia and india are currently moving northeast at 5–6 centimeters 2–3 in a year antarctica has been near or at the south pole since the formation of pangaea about 280 ma india started to collide with asia beginning about 35 ma forming the himalayan orogeny and also finally closing the tethys seaway this collision continues today the african plate started to change directions from west to northwest toward europe and south america began to move in a northward direction separating it from antarctica and allowing complete oceanic circulation around antarctica for the first time this motion together with decreasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations caused a rapid cooling of antarctica and allowed glaciers to form this glaciation eventually coalesced into the kilometersthick ice sheets seen today 23 other major events took place during the cenozoic including the opening of the gulf of california the uplift of the alps and the opening of the sea of japan the breakup of pangaea continues today in the red sea rift and east african rift tectonic plate shift the breakup of pangaea over time pangaeas formation is now commonly explained in terms of plate tectonics the involvement of plate tectonics in pangaeas 24 separation helps to show how it did not separate all at once but at different times in sequences additionally after these separations it has also been discovered that the separated land masses may have also continued to break apart multiple times the formation of each environment and climate on pangaea is due to plate tectonics and thus it is as a result of these shifts and changes different climatic pressures were placed on the life on pangaea although plate tectonics was paramount in the formation of later land masses it was also essential in the placement climate environments habitats and overall structure of pangaea 25what can also be observed in relation to tectonic plates and pangaea is the formations to such plates mountains and valleys form due to tectonic collisions as well as earthquakes and chasms consequentially this shaped pangaea and animal adaptations furthermore plate tectonics can contribute to volcanic activity 26 which is responsible for extinctions and adaptations that have evidently affected life over time and without doubt on pangaea life example of an ammonite for the approximately 160 million years pangaea existed many species had fruitful times whereas others struggled the traversodontidae 27 is an example of such prospering animals eating a diet of only plants plants dependent on spore reproduction had been taken out of the ecosystems and replaced by the gymnosperm plant which reproduces through the use of seeds instead later on insects beetles dragonflies mosquitos also thrived during the permian period 299 to 252 million years ago 28 however the permian extinction at 252 mya greatly impacted these insects in mass extinction being the only mass extinction to affect insects when the triassic period came many reptiles were able to also thrive including archosaurs which were an ancestor to modernday crocodiles and birds little is known about marine life during the existence of pangaea scientists are unable to find substantial evidence or fossilized remains in order to assist them in answering such questions however a couple of marine animals have been determined to have existed at the time  the ammonites and brachiopods additionally evidence pointing towards massive reefs with varied ecosystems especially in the species of sponges and coral have also been discovered  citation neededclimate change after pangaea pangaea has tremendously affected the setup of the world now in the post pangaea time period the reconfiguration of continents and oceans has changed the climate of many areas there is scientific evidence that proves that climate was drastically altered when the continents separated and reformed themselves it changed the flow of the oceanic currents and winds the scientific reasoning behind all of the changes is continental drift the theory of continental drift created by alfred wegener explained how the continents shifted earth’s surface and how that affected many aspects such as climate rock formations found on different continents and plant and animal fossils 29 wegener studied plant fossils from the frigid arctic of svalbard norway he determined that such plants were not meant to adapt to a glacial climate the fossils he found were from tropical plants that were meant to adapt and thrive in warmer and tropical climate 30 because we would not assume that the plant fossils were capable of traveling to a different place we suspect that svalbard possibly had a warmer less frigid climate in the past 31when pangaea separated the reorganization of the continents changed the function of the oceans and seaways the restructuring of the continents changed and altered the distribution of warmth and coolness of the oceans when north america and south america connected it stopped equatorial currents from passing from the atlantic ocean to the pacific ocean 32 researchers have found evidence by using computer hydrological models to show that this strengthened the gulf stream by diverting more warm currents towards europe warm waters at high latitudes led to an increased evaporation and eventually atmospheric moisture increased evaporation and atmospheric moisture resulted in increased precipitation evidence of increased precipitation is the development of snow and ice that covers greenland which led to an accumulation of the icecap greenland’s growing ice cap led to further global cooling 32 scientists also found evidence of global cooling through the separation of australia and antarctica and the formation of the antarctic ocean ocean currents in the newly formed antarctic or southern ocean created a circumpolar current 32 the creation of the new ocean that caused a circumpolar current eventually led to atmospheric currents that rotated from west to east atmospheric and oceanic currents stopped the transfer of warm tropical air and water to the higher latitudes as a result of the warm air and currents moving northward antarctica cooled down so much that it became frigid although many of alfred wegener’s theories and conclusions were valid scientists are constantly coming up with new innovative ideas or reasoning behind why certain things happen wegener’s theory of continental drift was later replaced by the theory of tectonic plates 33implications of extinction there is evidence to suggest that the deterioration of northern pangaea contributed to the permian extinction one of earth’s five major mass extinction events which resulted in the loss of over 90 of marine and 70 of terrestrial species there were three main sources of environmental deterioration that are believed to have had a hand in the extinction event the first of these sources is a loss of oxygen concentration in the ocean which caused deep water regions called the lysocline to grow shallower with the lysocline shrinking there were fewer places for calcite to dissolve in the ocean considering calcite only dissolves at deep ocean depths this led to the extinction of carbonate producers such as brachiopods and corals that relied on dissolved calcite to survive the second source is the eruption of the siberian traps a large volcanic event that is argued to be the result of pangaean tectonic movement 34 this had several negative repercussions on the environment including metal loading and excess atmospheric carbon metal loading the release of toxic metals from volcanic eruptions into the environment led to acid rain and general stress on the environment these toxic metals are known to infringe on vascular plants ’ ability to photosynthesize which may have resulted in the loss of permianera flora excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is believed to be the main cause of the shrinking of lysocline areas the third cause of this extinction event that can be attributed to northern pangaea is the beginnings of anoxic ocean environments or oceans with very low oxygen concentrations the mix of anoxic oceans and ocean acidification due to metal loading led to increasingly acidic oceans 35 which ultimately led to the extinction of benthic species
