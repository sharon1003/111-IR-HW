  ss64  power shell syntax getadgroup member get the members of an active directory group syntax getadgroup member identity adgroup auth type  negotiate  basic credential pscredential partition string  recursive server string  common parameters  key auth type  negotiate  basic the authentication method to use negotiate or 0 basic or 1 a secure sockets layer ssl connection is required for basic authentication credential pscredential the user account credentials to use to perform this task the default credentials are those of the currently logged on user unless the cmdlet is run from an active directory power shell provider drive if the cmdlet is run from such a provider drive the account associated with the drive is the default type a user name such as user64 or domain64user64 or specify a pscredential object such as one generated by getcredential if a user name is specified the cmdlet will prompt for a password identity adgroup an active directory group object by providing one of the following values the identifier in parentheses is the ldap display name for the attribute distinguished name example cnannual reportsoueuropecnusersdccorpdcss64dccom guid object guid example 599c3d2ef72d4d208a88030d99495f20 security identifier object sid example s152131652978883015673705764104231103 security accounts manager sam account name s amaccount name example annual reports the cmdlet searches the default naming context or partition to find the object if two or more objects are found the cmdlet returns a nonterminating error this parameter can also get this object through the pipeline or you can set this parameter to an object instance this example shows how to set the parameter to a distinguished name identity cnannual reportsoueuropecnusersdccorpdcss64dccom this example shows how to set this parameter to a group object instance named adgroup instance identity adgroup instance partition string the distinguished name of an ad partition the distinguished name must be one of the naming contexts on the current directory server the cmdlet searches this partition to find the object defined by the identity parameter the following two examples show how to specify a value for this parameter partition cnconfigurationdceuropedctestdcss64dccom partition cnschemacnconfigurationdceuropedctestdcss64dccom in many cases a default value will be used for partition if no value is specified recursive specify that the cmdlet get all members in the hierarchy of a group that do not contain child objects the following example shows a hierarchy for the group ss64 ss64 group karen user laptop65 computer sales team group julie user armando user sales computers group pc21345 computer if you specify ss64 as the group and specify the recursive parameter the following members and sub members are returned karen laptop65 julie armando pc21345 if the specified group does not have any members then nothing is returned server string the ad domain services instance to connect to this may be a fully qualified domain name net bios name fully qualified directory server name with or without port number common parameters  verbose debug error action error variable warning action warning variable out buffer out variable getadgroup member gets the members of an ad group members can be users groups and computers the identity parameter specifies the ad group to access identify a group by its distinguished name dn guid security identifier sid or security accounts manager sam account name or by passing a group object through the pipeline for example you can use getadgroup to retrieve a group object and then pass the object through the pipeline to getadgroup member if the recursive parameter is specified the cmdlet gets all members in the hierarchy of the group that do not contain child objects the size limit for this request was exceeded the maximum number of members that can be retrieved with getadgroup member is 5000 one workaround for this is to use getadgroup with the properties members option ad lightweight directory services for ad lds environments the partition parameter must be specified except in the following two conditions the cmdlet is run from an ad provider drive a default naming context or partition is defined for the ad lds environment to specify a default naming context for an ad lds environment set the ms dsdefault naming context property of the active directory directory service agent dsa object n tdsdsa for the ad lds instance examples get all the members of the administrators groups using the
