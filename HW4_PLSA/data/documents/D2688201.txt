transportation from san jose to san francisco jun 23 2009 108 pmare you traveling between the two airports sjc and sfo or the two cities sj and sf i ask because especially with sf sfo is nowhere near sf assuming you are asking about the cities themselves yes caltrain operates train service directly between the two cities the main stops will be diridon station in sj and 4th  king in sf see httpwwwcaltraincom for details if youd like to tell us where your exact starting and ending points are as well as your time of day and day of week of travel we can help you with busstreetcar connections on either end alternatively you could try httpwwwvtaorg and httpwwwsfmtacom and work them out yourself also if you did in fact mean the airports let us know and we can fill in those

time to the city when i was a student at santa clara although its been a few years theres a stop across from the university and i think that the stop that the shuttle from the airport will take you the end of the line is the 4th  townsend stop it is a few blocks away from the giants ballpark  att park try to buy your ticket from the kiosk they charge more to buy it on board from the conductor

transportation from san jose to san francisco jul 17 2009 1254 pmyou can catch one of the last caltrain trains of the night 935 and 1035 weekdays and 1035 saturdays no late night trips on sunday catch the train at the santa clara station to get there take vta route 10make sure youre going toward caltrain and not the metroairport light rail station the vta bus is free but you have to buy a caltrain ticket from the vending machine before boarding caltrain hasnt sold tickets on board for years and youll end up with a fine if you dont have a valid ticket in your possession caltrain has very strict enforcement and the conductor will issue you a ticketand not the kind of ticket youre hoping for once you arrive at 4th  king in the city the muni line you should take is dependent upon your final destination we can lead you to the correct line if you give us a hotel name or nearest cross streets httpwwwvtaorghttpwwwcaltraincom report inappropriate content gustavopalm springs rancho mirage
