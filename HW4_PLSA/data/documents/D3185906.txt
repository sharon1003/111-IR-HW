forgotten gift the original formula of this scent is simple optimistic  lovely when you spray it on you get a chlorinated kids pool vibe which i absolutely love and then it gets sweeter as time goes by without losing its initial airiness what i admire is the overall fresh  airy character it is refreshing in high temperatures and suits all casual day situations i consider this a unisex scent and much better than todays sweet masculine freshies sorry aqua invictus if i was writing this review in the 90s the rating would have been three stars but nowadays you dont get that kind of freshness anywhere the fabulous amongst waves by gallagher could be an exception as its also successfully sweet  airy at the same time in conclusion the original formula of ralph is sweet  easy youthful  fresh not exceptional but truly a 90s staplelj9142ralph by ralph lauren smells something awful on me something like a floral garden meets avinegsr bottle i know this is a beloved scent but it doesn’t work with my body chemistry im sure its some kind of floral scent but it is so cloying i cannot pick out anything other than thick which i know is not a scent but its the only descriptor i have one positive the dry down is a nice soft vanilla which i found to be a pleasure after the opening floral vinegar scent i wish the whole fragrance was the dry down and i would have loved this perfume also ralph had no staying power on my skin it lasted less than three hours on me so having a bottle with you at all times to reapply throughout the day was a mustcarolinneus this smells achingly like something from my childhood though i havent been able to put my finger on what its really cute  a shame i didnt have this at 14 id say the apple and freesia are the most noticeable it stays quite crisp and clear as it progresses as well ashalia this is one of the perfumes i genuinely love i wear it quite often and will always have a bottle of ralph in my collection if youve got a teenager who is new to perfumes this is a good one to start with i think this is a younger scent longevity is 8 hours pisceanblue ralph like many others is the grandchild or greatgrandchild of debbie gibsons electric youth and to a lesser extent fragrances like cotys wonderful tribe introduced in the late 80s electric youth was the first true fruitbomb scent and unfortunately because of the slew of ifra restrictions implemented since that time its difficult to see how a scent like electric youth with its insane bombastic performance could happen again so we have to settle for releases like ralph which is pretty terrific and of course the wannabees like justin biebers girlfriend avons wink escadas rockin rio etc im not going to go as far as to say ralph is the pale shadow of electric youth truly it is unfair to compare the two considering the restraints put on the fragrance industry as a whole but it certainly lags behind still its quite acceptable basically what youre getting is a pleasant swim in a bowl of fruit punch whereas with electric youth you got a fruit laden hiroshimalike explosion followed by the sensation of getting beaten in the face by a bag of watermelon candies its girlish lovingly obnoxious youthful and fun if the sitcom saved by the bell gave off a scent this would be it highly recommended but not for folks who are only into supersophisticated affairs ralph is a portrait of a thirteen year old boycrazy gossipy junior high school student as seen through technicolor lenseskathrinkat i got this because its supposed to smell like paris hiltons perfume and you cant get any good ones anymore now i dont know if i just got a bad one but instead of that fresh fruity smell that i liked about paris it smelled more like the expired version i would describe it as a smell that reminds me of ricerice pudding does anyone even know what i mean lilahill in canada one of the drugstore chains will sell 30 ml bottles of designer fragrances for 20 so i bought ralph ugh too sweet and floral for me spectacular for attracting bees thoughnicole et88i was feeling extra nostalgic and found myself obsessively craving a bottle of this not a sample or even a splash mini i needed an entire bottle to get the full effect of spraying this all over the way i did back in high school and my freshman year of college in spite of inwardly knowing that i had long outgrown this scent and fragrances like it i couldnt help myself and bid on a used bottle spoiler alert i won the opening is fresh and sugary very fruity in a crisp clean way with an interesting if not synthetic undertone of pretty flowers definitely freesia super girly then it gets much sportier as the fruit burns off and for a while this is a pleasant dated little ditty inoffensive and perfect for casual day wear freshly showered jeans and tshirt hair in a ponytail only young teenagers can get away with wearing this to be fancy its not immature but its underwhelming and sexually sterile also it has a bitter metallic afterbite that sticks in the back of my throat and gives me the impression of eating ink like those hyperpigmented purple gumballs you get out of the machine for 25 cents the dry down is acceptable nondescript chemical musk i wish i got more of the iris i know why i enjoyed this when i was younger and i feel like it set the stage for some of my preferences in adulthood these days i tend to gravitate toward more natural smelling blends with a little more depth and intrigue a little more sex its true and less freesia so much less freesia nicole f i loved this fragrance wore it the year my daughter was born in summer 2002 its fresh clean and a bit fruity i can detect the apple a green crisp apple jaa3i used to think this was the most amazing stuff in the whole world lol wore it for much of my college life up until about 28 years old one day while smelling it it became overwhelmingly tart i love the musk in it my bf loves it though as it is sentimental for him now i think i will keep it but i think its time for a new signature overall this perfume holds a special place in my heart and is great for women under 25 i’d say but i could see an older eccentric woman rocking it too age doesnt matter we dont all have to smell the same wear what you want to wearsparklyunicorn i looooove this scent so much there is just something about it it lasts on my skin it is deeper than just fruity sweetness on me it must be that musk i enjoy musky scents it brings back nice memories of when i was younger i think i will forever purchase this scent pmy this is my weekend perfume i reach for this often as it is casual and fresh fruity and airy fragrance that i absolutely love this summery scent lasts long too even on hot weather when i tend to perspire too muchkristen0129ralph smells like beach and tropical fruits i know the notes are not exactly that but i cant get any flowers here fruits and musk thats what it is therefore it reminds me old school escadas i cant tell which one celan domino so lovely fresh and young it is so citrusy im impressed because i had it for such a long time about 8 years and the scent remained the same longevity and projection are ok good quality in general worth the price mirella86i loved this perfume since i smelled it about 12 years ago in high school and always wanted it i got it as gift then and i still love it for casual summer days its my most repurchased bottle and unlike other fruity summer fragrances that i do not like anymore at 31 years old this i still love i could call it the smell of my youth sailor vralph is more freesia than apple to me with melony aquatic notes and a clean musk in the background maybe the bottle design has a part in this cause of course it doesnt smell like chlorine and french fries with mayo but it reminds me of a swimming pool it is a bit synthetic and not the most expensive smelling or refined perfume but refreshing and summery i wouldnt buy it but sniffing it makes me feel a little nostalgic its very 2000s i had ralph cool the fruitier version back then theyre nowhere near the same but they share the ralph dna now im not into this kind of fragrance as much anymore but if you like fresh and sweet floral aquatics this is a classic kendelem1999this smells exactly like escada rockin rio the original formulagildedcrystal summer in a bottle makes me feel like im poolside without the awkward tan lines never fails to put me in a good mood fruity and sweet in the best way youthful and energetic bbo i am a big fan of green apple note and it is no surprise that i love this perfume to me this perfume doesnt only smell like green apple like be delicious but it has some sweet floral side to it which is a good change for me i dont usually like sweet perfume but this one is exception this perfume also represents nostalgic and i remember always wanting this perfume when i was younger because my mum had it even though lots of people hate this perfume and say it smells like your generic shampoo or soap it smells like that on paper but on my body and clothing it is purely amazingsoobee11unfortunately this blind but didnt work out for me i like sweet scents but the sweetness of the apple was just too cloying i thought it would tone down but it never did very disappointed piji robyn it straight up smells like shampoo it reminds me of dkny be delicious and twilight mauve by zara fruity clean crisp floral contessa01a great everyday fragrance i always go back to its fresh and a bit sweet a real crowd pleaser and a good choice for a gift jedi 20a womens perfume named ralph really why didnt they call it lauren nana clearance4444as soon as i sprayed this on i immediately smelled suave waterfall mist shampoo from so long ago it actually brought back good memories of when my grandparents lived with me3 very pretty too fun summer scentdebbielimbl i had it when i was in my late teens to early 20s it was my signature scent then its a nice scent for younger ladies for suredovey escada rock n rio 2011 copy pasteguestthis perfume was my second look into the world of fragrance funnily enough unlike green tea by elizabeth arden this perfume has some notes i recognize when i looked up ralph i was shocked to see iris freesia and magnolia in the fragrances notes these are notes that i know work well with my skin chemistry and love in perfumes so even though i didnt know it i chose a perfume with notes that complimented my skin chemistry and notes that i look for today when purchasing perfume pretty hilarious when you think about itlmwimsattthis wasnt a favorite of mine growing up i wore his cool and his hot religiously though now dcd my best friend had this one and luckily for the fans of this original its not only still around in true form i get it from many other perfumes i wish just one designer would dupe cool or hot geezstacia79a woman whose children i used to care for kept a bottle of this in her bathroom every once in awhile if it was a hot day i would steal a squirt as a pickmeup it was such a fresh apple smell but definitely had magnolia underneath that came out on the drydown later on i discovered that paris hiltons eponymous fragrance was a straight up copy of ralph i could see having a bottle of this one day for nostalgia purposes my babysitter days are long past and because it is a nice fresh fruity summer scentlaurniko here is another fragrance that my mother bestowed upon me unprovoked for a good five years in my late teens and twenties my first name is lauren and i had a gym teacher in high school who used to call me ralph so thats a point docked off this right away however like clinique happy which i was also receiving yearly from my mother in tandem with this i wore it excessively through college and my early twenties simply because i was poor and because it was there my memories of this are the fruitiness the scent mixed with dance sweat and cigarette smoke from long nights spent sneaking into bars on the weekend with fake ids of unfortunate dates and the even more unfortunate mornings that followed my scent memory for this is strong and while its not my favorite or even my style by any stretch of the imagination it was one of the first fragances i had ever worn as an adult on my own and theres definitely a special place in my life for that it smells like those years too  happy innocent sort of and full of youthful promiseminnie02ive had this perfume for a few years now and it is one of my go to perfumes for the fall i mostly wear dkny delicious candy apples ripe raspberry during the fall but i like alternating it with ralph just for fun i get sweet apples from it its subtle fresh and light with a bit of sweetness the perfect transition for a month or two before starting to wear those gourmand winter fragrancesangelamartini my very first fragrance obviously it has a special place in my heart but actually the fragrance itself is very well made im not a huge fan of rl fragrances they dont seem to last on me and theyre a bit on the cool side than i like my scents to be warm ralph is an appley flowery goodness that i find appropriate for every age the opening can be a bit sharp but after 10 minutes or so it becomes so pleasant ralph is incredibly fresh yummy energetic optimistic and for me rls best hit another great side is the lasting power which in my case was all day and i remember it always lingered on my clothes and it draws so many compliments vanessaprom surprisingly juicy and bubblegumy nice for a young bubbly girl or child dbo this is what my gf wears and it is also all she ever wears i like it its simple but i feel like its gone within a few hours on her this is a like for me but ladies dont make this a signature scent if you do you could come across as unadventurous lacks depth in my opinion ju ju bell i got this as a gift my senior year of high school it was my signature scent for awhile then it smells very fresh and clean its not all that complex just very crisp i do remember not having to spray much at all 1 or 2 sprays it can be very strong a bottle lasts a very long time for that reason miss iness this is the case when note list and actual perfume doesnt match i can agree about apple leaf note on first spray but later it gets sooo tropical i could bet theres peach or apricot hidden in this floral bouquetsarage this belongs to the same category in my likelist with bright crystal and brit sheer  a lovely fresh scent which has good balance between fruit and florals fresh feminine scent that is very comfortable easy to wear it might not be the most unique i might not go and buy it but if i got this as a gift id use till the last drop kajira suzanne this scent reminds me of bath and body works beautiful day but with more musk i enjoyed the crisp apple notes and the musky drydown but longevity was on the low end of moderate with a skin scent sillage i was expecting more sillage from this because ralph lauren fragrances usually are more noticeable its a good choice for a daytime summer fragrance and is officefriendly i would not buy this for myself but if i received a bottle as a gift i would not be unhappy its just not my favorite fluffyandpuffy this a fresh citrusy type that doesnt last at all and is way overpriced for sure its an ok scent but there are better options out there for the money in my opinion nothing special teacup breaker im surprised so many people voted that this smells like paris hilton which is one of my favorites because i dont smell the resemblance ralph is such a general nondescript fragrance the dry down is heavy and old ladyishlike a lot of perfumes overall disappointing for its lack of personalitydglightblue acceptable casual frag fruity tropical cant remember if its very sweet or not though i smelled this in a friend of middle eastern decent and it was gorgeous in a fresh fruity clean way on me it isnt my thing i could use it but would rather have others instead not citrus i dont think more juicy more sophisticated than a britney spears option from memory fine good inoffensivebatgirl27this is the epitome of cheap and cheerful for me my mother used to wear it on very hot nights whilst on holiday in greece when i was younger it always has very pleasant connotations for me for that alone i think that this is where it shines  hot summer nights when its freshness sits against warm skin quite potently and feels tropical i used to steal sprays but it always smelt better on her than on me though in grey london today it feels considerably more subdued but not in a bad way i have a hangover this morning and couldnt face all my usual daytime suspects as powder and white flowers risked intensifying my headache so i reached for ralph its so fresh and fun the apple is the overwhelming takeaway from the opening but the citrus stops it from becoming a solo act the apple stays strong throughout the drydown and is still detectable later along with some iris and freesia its a lovely light youthful and casual fragrance for a murky day and has lifted my spirits but oh those summer naahiiighhttsss i cant wait to take it to portugal in a few weeks time to get that hot skin under it and unleash its full potential i paid £15 for 30ml  bargainmelime87my first perfume  i remember i smelled it in a magazine my mom couldnt afford it so my grandma bought it for meshe bought me probably 3 bottles since i always told her when i ran out i was prob about 16 i remember it being on my counter the day i was getting ready for prom i went alone i was shy kid but ralph was always with me i felt like one of the cool girls who wore it back then 2004 nowadays i still love it and get compliments a staple in my collection nostalgia to the max i sometimes want to cry when i smell it reminds me of no worries youth beach with family the good times i wish i could go back violet noir i got ralph lauren as a scentbrid sample i like it it doesnt smell exactly like paris hilton though i should put paris on one wrist and ralph on the other wrist and do a side by side lolbut i think ralph is just little bit fruiter and fresher paris hilton is more floral i like them both tbh neckromancer oh my gosh so fresh many people say some fragrances like bombshell and miracle smell like shampoo but if youre looking for a shampoo scent this is the one this is the freshest scent ive ever encountered i love it so much im not even sure which shampoo it smells like perhaps herbal essences its soso nice no funky musk eithervidalagustina i used to love this one it was actually one of my first perfumes as a teenager i had the 100ml one and couldnt finish it i got bored and couldnt even smell it on my skin at times it becomes too overpowering and irritates meimgeaslan this is an unchanging thing for me from my highschool and university years i always miss and need freshness of it and had compliments from guys all the time men love it girls for information joliecat this is a fun scent for summer chic fresh light casual leaves a soft gentle feminine trail not offensive its pretty and inviting if youre looking for a clean airy fruity shampoo smell this is it  sweet juicy apples soft subtle flowers fresh air and a very light clean white musk are blended beautifully for a very uplifting refreshing joyous perfume lasts about 6 to 8 hours on skin and 10 hours in hair i get lots of flattering compliments every single time i wear this lyoness despite the negative reviews of this i love it it lightens up my senses and tickles my nose a fruity aquatic concoction that screams summer in the water and cool jeanswearing catalogue girl it may smell like shampoo but that’s why i love it a whiff of it resembles that fresh out of the shower scent anything with italian mandarin and magnolia is the way to gojurisprude sweet understated lovely a day wear candidate but before i go for the full bottle id go for other classics still this is fruity and clean a casual if chic beauty loca del tónothing special for the price this smells like some of those fresh edts by adidas or nike fresh clean and fruity sweet but not cloying this is something a teenage girl can wear with ease or something good after taking a shower at the gym also reminds me of some herbal essences shampoo i wouldnt pay that much for this juice as i find it too common and some of the cheaper offerings by adidas would perform equally well sillage is small and longevity is not very good fortunately it was a gift because id rather spend those euros in something more distinctive and less juvenile dort0625as bizarre as this nay sound i had a gal i used to work with that well she was a lover of the marijuana lol and anytime she went on her lunch break she would smoke as she was getting ready to come back into the building she would give herself a spray of this so as much as i loooooved this i always related it to the smell of pot and her lol any who its been a number of years since i have worked there or seen her so when i came across this today on for 1999 i couldnt believe it first of all 20 bucks for a 50 mls bottle of ralph lauren perfume is unheard of i had to ask and then double ask the cashier if that was the right price any who it is such a gorgeous fresh floral and although its been worn hundreds of millions of times by i would say millions of women world wideit still smells so pretty its a safe bet for a work place fragrance or any gathering of people you may or nay not know love qawi kah this perfume always reminds me of my mom she was the first person i ever smelled this on my mom is not a white diamonds or guerlain musky kind of mom my mom loves modern scents this perfume is beautiful it reminds me of the beach a sunny day glistening turquoise sea with tons of people enjoying their selves the longevity however is a whole different story anything past 2 hours you will smell on your clothes onlyalfalázcares i kinda like it but not really is is fruity but i agree with a lot here that say it smells like shampoo to me is not exactly that scent but it is a combination of the fruity scents they use on shampoo im not really sure i can recognize the apple or mandarin it just smells fruity not really flowery and a bit musky not a bad scent it smells clean it is just not for me it was there very softly for maybe 4 or 5 hours with a moderate sillagenightcat23it smells like a fruity clean shampoo very 90sx inax my favorite perfume smelling of tropical fruitsapples and apple blossom i was always sure theres something like pineapple or melon note in it i dont mind it smelling like shampoo it means this perfume is good and big if the formula is used everywhere few years forward and we will have hairsprays smelling like viva la juicy or fantasyemt1986i had a bottle of this in high school back in the early 00s i loved it then and whenever i sniff a store tester im reminded why it takes me right back to standing in front of my mirror in my childhood bedroom getting dressed for school and riding in my thenboyfriends car i think i actually got this as a birthday present from his mom i remember my pink plaid capri pants that i thought were the coolest thing ever and pukashell necklaces very fruity juicy and fresh i wouldnt wear it anymore but it was just perfect for being that age during that time period and with great qualitylongevity if i needed to buy a gift for a teenage girl i wouldnt hesitate to get this i think it could be a nice change of pace from most of the scents teenage girls are wearing these daysgreatbitch this one might be a nice perfume in 90s but nowadays it smells like hairspray if a young girl with this perfume passing me byi may think thathmmthis girl must just have a hairdo from a salon nearby jasmine2024the more i smell this fragrance the more i like it at first it was a bit sharp and in ya face but now i kinda like that i think its the apple i can smell apple can be tart and sweet thats this fragrance with crispness added its fresh and refreshing i have many many perfumes i find this unique contrary to other opinions all entitled it has long silage too mmmm just smelt again nice update now it smells like an apple flower if that even exists getting even better update settles beautifullycafe au lait joyous fun clean suitable for young ages very enjoyable to wear but not a unique scent your shower gel or any of your cosmetics may be smelling like thisnnwb1001i visualise swans when i smell tis scent watery and white i tried to like it but its a bit meh magf1993it smells clean like when you just got out of the shower like if you had used a very strong shampoo and as somebody says it does smell like sedal for curly hair tough not exactly like it but almost the same space cowgirl ralph was one of my very first perfumes as a teenager it does hold a lot of memories for me as i wore it exclusively through some formative years so i may be a bit biased i may not wear this scent as much anymore and even though my bottle is over 10 years old it still smells the same and lasts just as long they really dont make then like they used to i feel like not many people wear it anymore so it has actually become unique again the freesia and magnolia in this are so delightful it has just enough apple in it to keep it young and fresh i think that younger girls would still enjoy wearing this scent and it is literally a breath of fresh air compared to the candy sweet caramel floral bombs popular todaydalenbaby one of my favorite perfumes it smells so romantictahialoky se parece mucho a la colonia de adida  la rosada  y también a un antiguo body mist de victoria secret que se llama appletini pero es olor es mejor y dura mas me encanta  dovey this perfume has the exact frutiness of all the escada annualy limited edition summer scentsfebeleuteria its nothing special another fragrance that i find juvenile more appropriate for a young woman to wear between the ages of 1417 it reminds me of the britney spear fragrance curious mirandahsophia i love it i got it when it first came out as a gift always got so many complements till this day i still use it every now and again never get tired of it still smells lovely clean and fresh just so unique still get complements every time i wear this fragrence last all day on me for sure more than 8 hours and i can still smell it they say its for younger women early 20s but youre only as young as u feel this will always be a must have in my collection they say paris hilton smells like it and i can definitely smell the similarities but to me paris hilton will always smell like a doop a cheap version of a wannabe ralph laurenmilkin such a lovely scent fresh and soft with flowers and fruits i could wear this any time at yearsummer or winterits doesnt matter not too overpoweringbut last long at skin about 10 hours one of my favoritesaquamoon ralph is fresh and sour smells like apple tree and magnolia theres sexy beachy tropical vibe locked in blue bottle i dont understand all the fuss about vs or marc jacobs these perfumes last not longer than fifteen minutes and you pay extreme price for the fancy tacky bottles if ralph had a big black bow on top it would be superhit just saying yayatan dear ralph i have admired you for the past decade or so heres a good one i would tell my friends whenever i happen to see you ive even seen a close friend of mine get together with you at one point it is strange to consider how long it has taken us to be together despite me knowing all along how nice you were but ralph ive been playing the field for the past few months and ive developed a taste for some complexity youre still nice of course and you will always be but sometimes being nice just isnt enough for me well dont you worry im not breaking up with you its just that i would like to keep it casual between us kind of like an open relationship you know oops got to go ive got a date with someone more exciting see you when i see youpisceanblue this fragrance is a real winner a very feminine sweet fruity floral much more fruity than floral its just fun in a bottle be warned this is an attention getter you will be stopped and asked what you are wearing note this stuff is shockingly similar to escadas rockin rio and j los live luxe the difference is in the details first of all ralph is a much more powerful fragrance waaay better longevity and sillage second ralph just has a more expensive feel to it its tough to explain not that rio and luxe arent great scents they are but i would say that ralph is a more upgraded version of those two mayuko oh what a history i have with this one such a lovely affection for this fragrance it was my first perfume  i was like what turning eight or nine years old  and back there i didnt have lot of knowledge for a buy but i was turning eight or nine and my grandma was up to pay any fragrance on the store and ralph was the one that i chose 30ml that evaporated so fast in an intense way i dont know why but i never bought ralph again thought that was a special experience and another one would ruin the first one maybe somehow it makes me happy and is wearable mainly for sunny happy days its girly fruity fruity fruity lovely apple and flowery feminine and gets soapy on me not for fancy ocasions its casual and refreshing reminds me my childhood my grandmas hugs and birthdays recently my cousin gifted a bottle to me cause it gave her headache  its kinda too sweet and she doesnt like  but to me oh man what a happy coincidence to meet ralph again so many memories definitely when i desire to feel younger im gonna wear thishomershippo i love this fragrance a very summery one for sure it smells like summer flowers and roses to me fresh as well my husband however always says it smells like bug sprayshelly84nzi loved ralph hot and tried the other ralph scents hoping i might like them too its not that theres anything offensive about this sweet strong scent but to me it smells cheap like ive accidentally sprayed on something little girls would use while pretending to be princessess24kouz very sweet fruity perfume loved it but it wasnt special in any way pretty generic reminds me of adidas fruity rhythm but more intense sam hdwell im in my 40s and i love this i dont really understand the its too youngold for me approach to fragrances if you like it wear it its a crisp clean fruity floral not remotely seductive theres no real depth to it but its a happy scent its not a smouldering gaze its a happy grin and sometimes thats just perfectbasgam young and sweet after a while turns a bit sour on clothes but its one of those fragrances that contains heat in them and remind of summer definitely for younger generation fawkey i wore this in my early 30s  felt it was a little youthful very fruity distinct  very sweet too sweet for me a teenagers fragrancejavagirl1972this is a very juicy scent on me at least i get almost no floral only fruit i love it doesnt seem to last very long so i will probably get the big bottle and then keep some perfume in a travelo in my bag my husband loves it so thats a miraclearenee92im on the fence with this i love the way it smells but on my skin it smells so sharp and screechy but after i washed it off it was still there but this time it was lighter it was juicy fruity and the floral notes came through beautifully this fragrance is so light clean and fun but my skin just doesnt agreesigh sleek geek chic i think this might have been my first real perfume it was too strong and in your face for me so i rarely wore it it made me nauseous although i wouldnt say the perfume smelled bad by any means im not good at describing notes i guess if i had to it reminds me of lychee fruit and maybe since i was 18 or 19 when i wore it i tend to think this fragrance would appeal more to the younger crowd perfume godess this just is a jubilant cheery fragrance i feel like i am at the beach having a great time it is also super youthful it makes me feel 20 year youngerlauren daseriously what this one brings to my mind is relaxing on a yacht on a hot summer evening while drinking cocktails awesome happy scent which smells expensive yet very fresh and youthful at the same timeeither it doesnt last long or my nose is too used to this one cant tell for sure but it is an excellent choice for a summer scent littlewing89it is too strong for me i liked the scent when i was a teenager but now it gives me a headache i wish they made a light body mist or something it is good but too many toxins are in perfumes even essential oils can give me a headache i wonder how much of this is synthetic i guess if you are on this website you are not sensitive to fragrances i love perfumes especially this one but i wish they had very mild formulations in any case this scent will probably last all daydreamstate my first perfume how could i forget so innocent fresh young floral sweet and so common at the time perfect for the teenage girl fragrance lover 30i ended up selling this one after i came to the realization that after years of not being used i would not magically wake up one day and like it i tried but this just is too sharp clean in my nose it just hits a speed bump every time i smell it oddly enough i get a similar sensation with every ralph lauren fragrance ive tried curious hopefully the person who bought it will enjoy itthenewesta this is the scent all the teenage body sprays copied when they came out  cant stand it although its not horribly offensive le vitrail when i sprayed it on my wrist at macys earlier todayi couldnt believe how similar it is to adidas fruity rhythmor since ralph came 1st how similar fr is similar to r it is more sophisticated and has more depth to it though love fruity perfumes this one is very happy not offensive  light i find it weird that ralph does not contain any black currant and raspberry notes because its dupe does and these two fragrances are insanely similar when i run out of my bottle of fruity rhythm i will purchase ralph i wonder if it stays on longer lilium86ive used to like it now it remind me an hairspray  haus frau jillybean i couldnt agree with you more i came to this page to talk about how it smells like pickles to me and bam thats the first review i see so yeah smells like high school girls and pickle juice not an appealing combo in my opinion jillybean17at first this kind of smelt like sweet pickles to me or at least it made me think of sweet pickles but with hairspray on them lol yeah i know its a weird description but i like this perfume though i still definitely prefer the original pink by victorias secret over this id probably only wear this if i ran out of pink  id only wear it until i bought more overall this fragrance is good for summer  its clean  kind of strong but there are better perfumes ive smelt celina96i dont really like it that much but still very fresh and in my opinion for a younger audience ive smelled a perfume that is really similar its called new brand tracy it must be a copy of thisdoveyok its june 2014 i was just introduced to this perfume by the shop lady once i told her that i like sweet  fruity scentsits fruity chic in an expensive way kinda reminds me of escada summer limited edition perfumes  which i adore  but i gotta add pineapple to the notes its very tropical yet nothing unique about it the escada s have more distinguished personalities  if u know what i mean hellita i found a great deal yesterday summer sale and it was so cheap that i had to give this a go i remember my best friend wore this all through high school so it does remind me of those days but ive never had it myself hence i wanted to try it out its fresh fruity and clean and i love that the top notes reminds me of pantene shampoo which is the best smelling shampoo i know of the longevity is amazing on my skin and also the sillage isnt too bad but i consider it as moderate sillage it will probably be a one time purchase but i do like this on a summer day togiii in my college years most of the female students wore this it is not very overpowering a very nice scent but i dont want to have this because i want in search for a scent that will open new horizons for me not remind me of my college years everyday sweelty smells like hair spraymistykerryn smells like shampoo in a good way super sweet fruity apple that will have you smelling clean and fresh sweelty smells exactly like hair spray miss yoo this is a classic in my books started loving this scent since my highschool days and have to admit dont wear it much nowadays but i still adore the scent its super fresh with strong floral notes the bottle is simple and clean too silkpuppet haha this was definitely many peoples first fragrance i remember finding this fruity fresh scent so beautiful at 14 while i dont believe in relegating perfumes to age groups i definitely outgrew this scent it is a tad synthetic and rather linear i dont hate the smell or anything it is quite nostalgic and cute but these days if it isnt a spicy sultry earthy musky gourmand i wont wear it au revoir ralph we had a great runtessture went on a nice green apple but got dirty and sort of nasty fairly quick not sure what happened there the green apple blend was really crisp and fun then a dirtlike sweatlike note crept in and ruined it try before buying i guessjmarie92theres something about this scent that just rubs me the wrong way a synthetic sweetness to it thats nauseating and overpowering i can see how a lot of people love it its definitely the kind of scent that appeals to a broad audience but not my cup of tea generic and synthetic imhoperfumelili7its a lovely fragance perfect for everydaysmells soft and fruty and reminds me summer and sunny days lia riadi such a nostalgic scent it reminds me of summer going to the beach with your first love so young full of energy and happy it smells so fruity and fresh like the first summer breeze one of my favesss79had swapped this thinking i wouldnt miss it well i did i was actually using the its a 0 miracle treatment in my hair and the smell reminded me of this so thankfully our local shoppers had it and actually scored a 50ml for 1999  yay nylonster i remember how much i dreamed of this parfume when i was 1617 years old and now i bought it i guess that the reviews for the young smell had some affect on meand i was really affraid of my reaction when i open the box and sniff it in the next moment i sensed the sea the freshness and felt the summer wind i dont regret buying it  infact i can imagine myself with a white elegant shirt skinny jeans and undone bun walking in the office with this fresh scent ah yes  and i am 27 holly biani blue raspberry excellent lasting power this perfume is lasting longer than some bond fragrances right now nina spakdi i think this is a very nice fragrance a floral with a burst of freshness sporty classic and feminine all in one spritz the lasting power and sillage were both also quite decent on me that being said however there was something in this that just gave everyone i cared about a giant headache and nausea i also read in an article that this is the perfume that men hate most yikes glassjules well maybe im too old to be wearing this by all the reviews ha i was given a three pack set of ralph lauren fragrances for christmas blue romance and ralph i hate romance but i love love love blue most and this one second its a bright cheery scent that i think would be unoffensive to most so probably a good choice for office i will admit the first smells make me think of a typical summertime bath and bodyworks scent which isnt bad just not super interesting however after 30 min or so this becomes more complex and enjoyable love itledavis727this was my signature scent all throughout high school and for that reason every time i get a whiff of this perfume it reminds me of carefree days and late summer nights sneaking out to see friends its a very clean aquatic almost scent with lots of apple quite sporty and fresh but nothing really special i got a small bottle of this a year or so ago and while i was excited to be reunited with an old favorite i realized after spraying it on that i had outgrown it it was too linear to generic for me maybe ill give it another shot if we have a hot summer but with all the other much more interesting summer fragrances out there i doubt it so long old friend arlenebeatrix it is a perfect mix of fresh and soft flowery notes so no wonder it was one of my favourite fragrances when i was younger anyway i think i chose it because of the beautiful bottle color joking when i like perfume very much i will buy it no matter of the bottle but i have to admit when i love bottle looks i am more tempted to buy perfume if only it smells nicely on my skin ralph perfume smells good and looks good if you like gentle flowery fruity scents you might like itrafatramon it starts very green and flowery wich i don´t like much of course the green apple is always there but to be really pleased by this perfume i wait like 30 min or so it is different fresh summery and juicy lasts longalmarie i love this fragrance still to this day i remember my boyfriend bought this for me for valentines day back in 2002 i have had several bottles since but i always make sure its in my collection because it definitely is a pretty scentjanelle70strangely goodsmelling enough for me to try it on skin but gave me a headache as soon as i tested it i dont mind strong perfumes but this one i can feel scratching up my nostrils  not sure if its the magnolia or the apple leaf doing this sabrinah love this one so much im ready to buy my next bottle redfraggle a fresh fruity and playful fragrance for the young ones or the ones who are still young at heart no drama no seduction i really like it one of my favourites snowbunny10always try perfumes at the department store prior to purchase wait a couple hours before the big decision because scents tend to smell differently on different people i fell in love with this perfume when i was very young and i figured id grow out of itbut its been almost 4 years since i first discovered it and i still love it it has a light fresh scent that is not too overpowering i feel like this perfume is for the younger crowd perhaps under 30 i know that many of my friends own this perfume kaylan smells really good but save this for the 15 year oldsruxandra19first i have to say that this scent i find incredibly fresh and clean the first spray its a fruity explosion where the apple is the key element with the time when it becomes more sedate it gains also some floral notes but it doesnt loose the charming from the beginning this perfume has a soft sillage and a great longevity since it is only an edt when i smell it it leads me to a fresh smell of an apple orchard where you totally get lost the best season for this its summer and its perfect for a hot summer day when we need a refresh with an youthful aspect this scent i think it thanks everyone no matter the ageblackw0lfxi wore this a lot in highschool and college its a clean bright floral tart apple on me really fresh i like it alot however since i wore it soo much when i was younger i associate it with young women i think a fun and flirty fragrance the type of girl who is confident and on the go between classes one could wear this to work but think more of a business casual attire summertime daytime fragrance ice ange1to be honest this is the first perfume i ever got i had it for quite some time and i still have the bottle even though its empty right now im very into sweet scents and second come fruity but im not a very floral person its the only appley sent that i honestly love its very crisp and refreshing and as soon as i get a new bottle it will automatically be my signature fragrance yet again cant wait aliora this was as ubiquitous as cliniques happy when i was a teen itll always remind me of the high school hallways worn by one of the most popular girls at school pretty and crisp primarily due to the apple in this ralph is also one of the few scents that automatically lifts my mood and despite the many copy cats in the years there after i can always identify it when someone wore this if you want something thats easy for everyone to like this is it its very clearly a casual scent not something glamorous at the same time its so commonly worn that id prefer not to own it i like smelling it but i cant see myself owning a bottlehusnabakhi love love love so fresh and fruity i live in a place with a hot climate all year round and this perfume is just perfectcarolinedb this is like nostalgia in a bottle im pretty sure every girl has owned this at some point its sweet fruity beachy and unique still love it thurea fruity and fresh light but very noticable in the air around you i have been in love with this since i was 16 and its still my signature scent you just cant go wrong with it perfect for every season lets just hope this one never gets discontinuedksantina smell is good its fresh light and foral love itcharmybird smells so fresh in the bottle kinda reminds me of dkny be delicious fresh blossom but on my skin it turns immediately into a smokey tobacco smell which is not very pleasant its a shame it didnt work out for me  viviane frança gosto desse perfume acho ele bem fresco o que predomina é a maçã verde portanto se você não curte maçã verde nem pense em usálo bom para ser usado durante o dia mesmo em dias quentesmarily so beachy and summery scent love it you will get a lot of compliments wearing it its sillage is very good and it lasts long time its definately appropriate for summer daysscandi very pleasant scent i get a burst of squeeky clean apples and freesia last all day when using this it has the same luminous light feel as be delicious fresh blossom but it lasts longer and it is more linear i always bring this in my bag when i go clubbing i do think its mostly suitable for a younger crowd but having said that my mother in her 50s borrows this regularly and gets compliments from her friends used this today and noticed a slightly sweet banana scentritaramirezz i absolutely love this perfume however too many fragrances are copying this scent so the smell is now becoming too common jlos live luxe paris by paris hilton true religions hippie chic some perfume by victorias secret which i cant remember the name and adidas fruity rhythmn are just to name a few anyways i will never get tired of ralph by ralph laurenperfumemad62i love this perfume fresh juicy apples and musk very fruity sweet  clean perfect everyday fragrance i love to spritz this through my hair long lasting and moderated sillage overall a fantastic perfume that is very fruity clean and uplifting one of my all time favourites highly recommendedcgvdefinitely a winner my wifes favourite beside alain delons lyra3 its the ultimate holiday smell with extremely good longevity and projection its 13 years since its release but still going strong a fresh modern classic amy emporiadou i tasted this at sephora today and i was ledt speechless this one is delicious so fresh so clean and so yummy i love it unfortunatelly i didint buy it because i needed a night scent fir the autum and winter and this one is a daytime scent for the summer but this one is gonna be mine next year  it is a must beautifulzoehhh i find this to be an incredibly fresh and clean fragrance the first spray is a fruity floral explosion with apple playing the main role as it settles i find that is becomes more floral than fruity but still very crisp on me it lasts a long time so i rated it as longlasting the sillage however is between softmoderate this perfume makes me think of just stepping out of the shower its zingy cleansing and without meaning to be repetitive clean it is best suited for a hot summers day it is also perfect if you have been on the go all day in the summer and need a quick refresh i like to use it around sunset on a long hot day as it feels like it is reverting you back to the just stepped out of the shower feeling some people are commenting on the youthful aspect of this fragrance im not really sure it does smell overly youthful but maybe that is because there is a perception that the older generation tend to wear classic smelling scents i am in my 20s and my mum is in her 60s and she loves it just as much as me i believe that regardless of your age it is a very nice summer scent molliepops i bought a bottle of this and have used it up but i will not buy another its quite bland nothing special its pleasant enough sweet and fruity very young and would suit a teenager in my opinion its fine for daytime summer wear its not offensive but it does smell quite cheap i prefer a bit more sophistication from my fragrancedelica67just finished my sample i find it too innocent and even worse too weak it left me totally uninterested no doubt a disappointment as i would expect more from a ralph lauren perfumefdmc i really like this scent especially now that we are in the summer this perfume is very feminine and youthful when use is a perfume that feel fresh and stolen i recommendtimida88very nice youthful fruity perfume it smells like apples and magnolias on me the best balance between sweet and fresh i have found so fardensire it gives me headache i wanted to like it but it didnt worki had to give it awaysummerwong13i think personally i more interested in the perfumes with more layers this one is very simple rgrthis is young and carefree summer in a bottle it brings me so many memories of the time when i used to wear this the initial phase of ralph perfume is a platter of juicy tart apples the next is a feminine freesia and magnolia that settles down to a muskyskin soap and water just got out of the shower effect it kind of reminds me of wearing a ponytail with my hair still wet and letting it down after a while only to rediscover a yummy shampoo scent left behind its a very refreshing kind of perfume it manages to be fruity subtle fresh classy and clean all at once i would wear this on spring or summer time on days where i dont want to smother people with overly spiced up perfumes this is also an office friendly type of scent because its not offensive or overwhelmingly strong i always got tons of compliments mostly people who would say i smelled sweet and floweryamaebi519i have no sense of smell but my testing panel loved this one they didnt find it overly familiar or too young either one thought she detected gardenia though i dont see that in the notes looks like ive found my summer signaturejanahullinghorstthis always smelled terrible on me bad chemistry very moldy and off putting but in the true spirit of rl scents it starts off rough around the edges and softens into something more approachable for other people i assume just smells awful on memodelleighi love this perfumebut now that im 24 25 next month i feel like im getting a little old to be wearing it it was my signature from middleschool when my friends older sister gave me a bottle of it up until the end of college i bought it last year also i still get compliments everytime i wear it it seems to drive men wild but i still feel a little hscollegey wearing it so now i use as my signatures jdore dior and miss dior ralph is still one of my favorites i just cant get the hscollegey feel out of my head i think its for ppl 22 and younger maybe 23guesteverytime i where this i get complimentshowever i am 24 almost 25 and i too wore this exclusively almost from middleschool throughout collegeeven though i still get compliments on it i this after 21 its really no longer too appropriate ive moved on to jdore dior and miss dior i think ralph lauren is still my favorite but it just screams hscollege to me eckorxi thought this smelled expectacular very ordinary reminds me of a sweet shampoo scent smelled this coz i wanted to get something for my mom for mothers day i will not be getting thisthe search is still on for that perfect scentperfume for my mom aina harryna very fresh but it this scent very similar scent with other perfumes like jlo escada and othernothing specialemeliestar really fruity like pineapple smells gooood sissis its a nice aromatic fruity scent but for some reason easily forgettable i dont notice it when i wear it i dont think the longevity and sillage are great and occassionaly reapplying feels in order im feeling very neutral on this one dont love it dont hate it i bought it on a special sale not sure if i would repurchase for full price for me it cannot compete with the richness and depth of dolce  gabbana limperatrice 3 but it is a nice fruity scent for normal daysbrianaaaahthis scent is brilliant it is 100 fresh and clean this took me by complete surprise when i first smelled it i dont know what i thought it was gonna smell like but i was not ready for what i got it was so pleasant and i knew i was going to get it even though i waited a few months to buy it it is the perfect scent on a really hot day where youll be outside for a long time this will be a long time part of my collectionmelzdon i love love love this scent omg this is semi sweet with a really clean fresh fragrance jonayla again one of my 20s scents the most i smell is apple its very fresh little bit sweet but nothing unique i still think it will be good holiday scent like a caribbean fresh wind on my skin recommend not love but i like it insolent its inoffensive and fairly pleasant fresh lightbut feminine but probably best for a teen in summer there is a note in it that jumps out to me that i dislikebluemelvery suitable for summer fragrance where is the melon note it smells like melon and appledomodomo i like it but dont love it smells fresh and a little too youthful would be great for a teenager but has a bit of a waxy drydown marilulu no entiendo porque existe una fascinación por esta fragancia se parece al shampoo sedal el de botella verde para pelo ondulado es el mismo perfume que le ponen a ese shampoo puede ser que perciba algo de menta pero en mi opinión esta sobrevalorado es un perfume de aloe vera con menta x d sheiloka not for me smells like moldy green apple weirdgabygol it was on vogue when i bought it and everybody had it so i left it remembered i even had the travel bottle in my bag it was fun i was on my 20s and the smell was great lots of citrics specially mandarine you could just smell it from miles it was a boom and im happy i was part of it for a whileearthbender10just got it today and love it reminds me of a beautiful sparkly ocean with mermaids and oranges strawberries and apples perfect for summer sooo refreshing i love it so much i will wear it alll year round yumyuliabarca30me gusya aunque no dura tanto como quisiera ps es un edtlinzilou92i bought this in a blind buy because so many beauty gurus and bloggers had it in their collection it sounded like something i would really like so i bought it from debenhams on sale it smells great very fresh and clean its not your normal apple scent to me it has an earthiness to it and when i read that the actual note was apple leaf i knew what i was smelling i literally smells of what i imagine apple leaf to smell like if you want to buy a scent for someone but dont want to take the chance on something they might hate i think this is a great one to go for as its not offensive in any way just a great day time scentwhitewidow this fragrance was recomended to me by a friend ive been looking for something fresh youthful and sexy for me it meets the first two criteria it would be ok for a summer frag but i got discouraged by the longetivity or rather its lack it was gone as soon as i left the shop it didnt even last 10 minutes and im not saying gone  faint literally gone without a trace lozza16i tested this at a frag shop recently and realised it smells exactly like jlos live luxe which i already have its very fresh and clean smelling i feel like a lot of people would like this scent for summerskimrandereally love this smell to me it smells like summer bought it when it first came out and have worn it on and off since thenannaiilyzii i wear this in the summer fruity bright citrusy at times theres definitely nothing woodsy or musky about this this was always the go to fragrance for us girls back in junior high now my little sister wears it and hasnt swayed from it since although ive moved on to stronger more mature scents it still smells amazing spritzing it on on a hot summer day its good for spraying in your hair right before or after your blow dry thats where it lasts the bestmaryummalikthis is my workout perfume well kind of a waste since it really isnt all that cheap  p but its one of the very few perfumes out there that smells refreshing and long lasting at the same time smells like green apples to me juicy and sweet  lasts long enough to project even when im sweating and emitting heat lolcourtneylirilli i love this scent opening begins with a juicy green apple jolly rancher scent and then slowly turns into a beautiful bouquet of white flowers i finally understand the popularity of this kysyona it was nice fresh clean und a little spicy but nothing special and a little too synthetic for my liking at the age of 25 i found it to be waaaay to meh for me and i dont think i would have found it more interesting when i was 18colorblindlove this is a really nice scent but everyone smells like this i dont want to smell like everyone else so i will not be purchasing but this is not a bad scentsomethingbrighter everyone everyone seemed to be wearing this when i was at university and wanting to fit in with the crowd i asked for some for christmas too i recall liking it at the time but my tastes have changed completely  the apple is far too strong and i dont enjoy the floral notes tante simone i had this back in college but i had mixed feelings because i wanted rl blue then so badly but my uncle made a mistake and bought me this instead however it seemed to work well with my chemistry because i have been told so many times that i smelled like an angel whenever i wore it a guy even asked me if it was unisex it seemed to me that my skin absorbs all the giddy fruits and flowers so what remains is a mysterious abstract scent dominated by cold musk it is the benchmark of all other similar fragrances like j lo live luxe compared to them it is more well constructed brighter and more natural smelling it projects like crazy so be careful with the amount you spraynimiel22this was my first real fragrance which i got in high school and i loved it so much i would describe it as fresh clean and zesty it evokes one who isnt a frilly girly girl with pink ruffles and bows but a girl nonetheless a bit sporty and fun a decade later i consider getting this again for nostalgia purposes and because it smells goodialwayssmellgood this was a bit boozy and gross smelling to memiza norizansmells heavenly for about the first 30 minutes after that only acrid alcohol smell i will never repurchase this again just not right on my skin even though i notice it smells nice on others xyria was heavenly and still is so fresh energetic and young scent it makes me feel so fresh and get my boost of energy just putting on it will definetly always keep a bottle no matter what other scent i start usinggofruityourselfsmells like green apples that are not ripe zslnkit was my high school fragrance when i smell it all the memories r comin to my mind actually it smells like a high quality cologne not so special scent  but im sure its so special for majority of us iflipcess0527i have a 30 ml bottle someone gave this to me not my type so its just stayed up in my closet for years sabrinaaoh my god  this scent really takes me back to 20022005 i used to wear it during the summers and i remember that my favourite cousin gave it to me as a gift how i miss her and how i miss them days we had so much fun and we always had this perfume withon us all the guys loved it haha and we loved the attention i bought a new bottle last week and i spray the scent around the house when i want to remember almost everything from my adolescence  it feels like it was yesterday  time pass by so fast  amor amor cacharel and ralph makes me feel so nostalgic  i almost wanna cry now hahaha  anyway  this scent is great and i willcan wear it in my 20s as well  makes me feel 14 again  and i love it  nancy920this really smells like its a 10 leave in hair conditioner it definitely smells fresh but just reminds me too much of hair productmolson316too sweet for my blood edit i have found that layering my sandalwood essential oil to it really balances it out the sandalwood tones down  softens the highpitched tart sweet edge while rounding it out  giving it some more depth vicious delicious really fresh and fun one of those fragances you can never really forgetkarenrobertone word fresh  its so fresh airy clean and summery its like being in love for the first time happy optimistic perky sweet and innocent its youthful young refreshing clean fruity sweet and romantic i smell lots of fruits in this perfume take your depression away take your worries away just be with the moment and see your world through the eyes of a child no cloying no heaviness no fattiness no drama the sweetness is not overdosed however i can get a head ache from this perfume when people started using it like pepper spray overall its a pleasant healthy fragranttrenchlove1i dont see the big hype about this perfume i tried it today and dont get mad but this smells really gross smelled like soap n water n green leafs idk its not my style i guess i just think its way to hyped up to have a cheap smell like

the price is the only issue i have for any of his fragrancessooliifor some reason this perfume goes with sports outfits i used to put it on when playing sport and the smell barely wears off simply amazingsweetstar1ralph smells clean but not in a good way more like a cleaning product maybe its the the florals mixed with musk that i do not like josefyn i like the fragrance is fresh for the day is excellent but hardly lasts in the body  it is applied to clothing to last a little longerxostarshipsox i think it smells amazing very light and fresh perfect for summer cuban fairy tale beauty wayy too sporty for my taste reminds me of a unisex perfume anajuli i must say the fragance is not as idyllic as the commercial spot but when i wear it i feel young and freshusername101my experiences are similar to hpr2010  i liked it a lot even up to my early 20s but recently i discovered i didnt like it  keep in mind i had the bottle for years the wateriness was gone and it smelled very dry even though it was appley even though im not in my teens id still wear appley perfume because i like the way it smells i think itd be perfect for off days or to spray as a quick pick me up mirlo its funny how the mood feelings and impressions a fragance evokes to someone are totally subjective and cultural i had never smelled this perfume until this year i didnt know it was by ralph lauren or particulary popular among teenagers it seems most of you used it while at highschool i fell in love with it instantly i found it very stylish and fresh a tad sweet but not too much something any woman could wear and pull off nicely on a summer or spring day it reminded me of the sea of coming out of the shower feeling great but kind of pretty and feminine and chic i would have never guessed it was a teen perfume that people in their twenties would consider inappropiate for their age im 23 i didnt get the whole middleupper class girl image either the way i see it its just a lovely fragance fresh and flowery a bit watery somewhat innocent and somewhat sweet always flattering and very stylish i feel very confortable when i put it onhpr2010i had this perfume when i was 16 and i loved it im now 19 and i smelled it again in the store and there was something about it that i really didnt like almost sickeningveritech i consider this a great summer fragrance fresh green and watery love ralph people used to say aahhh thats ralph when id walk by at work nice happy scentjamieleeshaw its such a watery fresh beachy scent great for girls younger then 25 but i tend to find it doesnt last long on my skin say hour max and its starts fading seconds after i put it on it would be great after gym or at the beach overall is good apart from the length of time it last hippyhop2this one is fresh and sweet perfect for spring summer i really like this perfume its a clean smell refreshing but sweet totally not offensive had some people asking me what perfume it was so sillage isnt bad but it needs a bit more than 2 spraysramaeil it smells so good  sweet i 3 ralph laurenzatenhaar this is a everyday perfume watery freshness energetic clean in one word blue also it smell like the sea withouth the salt someone described it as sporty fresh and thats exactly what it is with just a little bit of sweetness to me its like a scent you could imagine for that highermiddle class rich girl whos 1418 from a good family whos really into sports who probably goes to ivy league who is always nicely groomed the allamerican tommyralp girl if you know what i meanpomdgf absolutely summer fragrance fresh cool light funny sunny sea and sand when im wearing this its wake me up and suddenly im ready to go somewhere with my tote bag loveeee this one amsi when i was in 8th grade we had a class project in which we had to make a collage of magazine cutouts to represent our personalities all we had at home were newspapers and the occasional news magazine i asked my dad to buy me a biggirl magazine teen people

lingered in the pages i never bought the perfume but always remembered the fragrance fastforward years later im in grad school and 8th grade was literally over a decade ago i recently smelled a similar fragrance and i was instantly reminded of the magazine project from years ago i had never actually purchased the perfume but now that i have a little more money i went right out and bought it

one outnernanator lighthearted and sweet happy summer scent with great longevity and sillage reminds me of driving in my old vw convertible with the top down on a beautiful new england summer day karaaslangvery clean very fresh sweet fragrance it is light it is great for summer and will be a great choice for teens but for the ladies over 20 this can be a seaside vacation fragrance option and for the ladies over 25a big no no overall lil mju about the same happens to me as to chkchk out of the bottle its fresh juicy and great for the summer but when i spray it on myself its a plain flat smell with a weird scent it also gets sticky and on my skin its cloying and annoying  chkchk i love the scent of this but on my skin it morphs into the an offensive musky body odor smell so unfortunate because its a good perfumedlt1277to me it smells clean and crisp which is perfect for daytime wear this is one of my favorite scents i just really wished it was a bit stronger and lasted longer it faintly reminds me of rockin rio but a lot less fruity and like i said more crisp sidenote if anyone knows of perfumes similar to ralph or rockin rio please let me know thankscerebellum i got this perfume when i was a teenager it is very youthful fresh and definitely smells like crisp apples i like this perfume but i am over it now i feel like it is too young for me and i am only in my twentiesanacarol202one of my favourites ever perfect to days and summer nights so delicious she she the scent is fresh and quite strong but it has an irritating note apple with something freesia  it makes the scent going on the one tiring note i guess i dont like apples in perfumes the lasting power is really good and i guess the scent may be liked its just not made for me i prefer ralph hot  i wear it sometimes in winter though because its less shouting apple on me its a kind of aquatic fragrance but not exactly reminds me a bit of light clouds by moschino or light blue by dolcegabbana but its different uplifting smooth i like the drydown best urban beautifulthis was my signature perfume when i was about 1517 years old now in my twenties i cant wear it anymore its just waaay to sweet for my grownup nose haha but i actually was crazy about it at that time so was my best friend and another friend of mine  its fresh and sweet and smells really quite nice i think it is perfect for a younger teenage girl in the age of 1316 maybe as i said its fresh and sweet and its perfect for that agegroup its something that wont make a 14year old smell older than she is something she cant pull of yet but it wont make her barbielike in my opinion its not that typical barbiedollpinkprincess sweet but just really nice teenagefreshsweet nadia beatriz i dont know how there is so much good feedback about this one on me smells cheap i would never spend my precious money on it i´m just saying habanita this smells very much like an avon bubble bath to me its not bad and reminds me of a nice bath but i wouldnt want a scent like this as a perfume mizzjnice whenever i smell this it evokes memories of high school hanging out with friends my first boyfriend etc this perfume and cool water were all i ever wore as a teenager i loved it and bought several bottles of it back in the day it was so crisp and clean and i wore it day night summer winter i almost want to buy it again just out of nostalgia annica there is something in this perfume that is so repulsive still have not figured out which ingredient it is absolutely one of the worst perfume i have ever experiencedlalalalathis was my first perfume ever 3 smelled so freshh for some reason it reminds me of shi by alfred sung guestfashionkid123i love this fragrance timeless something i will be getting for the summer months for years to come i am sad that i will be putting it away as the fall season creeps upkarlovonamesti i know i swore off ralph lauren fragrances but my girlfriend wears this and i thought it was a good chance to throw the house a bone ralph is simple sweet and very well made i wouldnt go so far as to call it a good scent but its not bad either the apple opening is quite lucid juicy and green theres an explosion of calone behind it which probably holds the notes of mandarin and magnolia although i sense a white musk underpinning it all once the apple and magnolia subside all i can smell is a slick sweetness its certainly much better than any in the big pony lineup but aside from having a cuteness about it its a minor summer offering from ralph laurenlovefull5this is a great fragrance but i cant really find it here and its really expensivelexgurl i love the scent so much unfortunately it is not easy to find it here in my home town and quite pricykwarnst a lovely scent suitable in my opinion for all ages fresh and clean a sweet note and lots of beautiful flowers the opening is rather sharp and can even feel unpleasant for a moment when the flowers come in the fragrance gets a softer and more feminine character elegant and suitabele for most occasions on my skin the drydown is very soft and creamy the musk is clearly present and i can even detect a hint of leather although that is not mentioned in the list of notes the opening is extremely fresh and therefore the scent is perfect for summer but the evolution in the fragrance is beautiful feminine and elegant and makes this fragrance a great all year rounder the longevity and sillage are both very good kasia si put this perfume in one line with hugo woman and tommy girl but out of the 3 this one is the best for me the other 2 have something annoyingly sweet and chemical and ralph is simply very fresh and very yummy very lovely for summer well done and i admit it as a far from being floral fruity lover personrosenoire my very first fragrance obviously it has a special place in my heart but actually the fragrance itself is very well made im not a huge fan of rl fragrances they dont seem to last on me and theyre a bit on the cool side than i like my scents to be warm ralph is an appley flowery goodness that i find appropriate for every age the opening can be a bit sharp but after 10 minutes or so it becomes so pleasant ralph is incredibly fresh yummy energetic optimistic and for me rls best hit another great side is the lasting power which in my case was all day and i remember it always lingered on my clothes and it draws so many compliments kathrinaaguir i find this one pretty similar to cool water by davidoff its very youthful and extremely fruity just for young girls but i think it is not for women over 35 i do not and wont like it but my sister does and i must tell on her smells like watermelon but what really surprises me is that is a pretty longlasting perfume  she goes to work and gets home late smelling to ralph not with the same intensity but i can detect its scentxxmikixx this will always be one of my summer time favorites its a nice sweet refreshing smell yet still lightmirandaslaysdragons was my summer scent for almost two years i am definitely more into vanillagourmand scents but i love this scent my boyfriend loves it too necabel me encanta este perfume me parece ideal para primavera es dulce pero no empalagoso agradable fresco y totalmente floralfrutal hoy he acabado el frasco y sin duda voy a repetir  i love this perfume it seems perfect for spring it is sweet but not cloying pleasant fresh and fruityfloral completely today i finished the bottle and i will definitely repeat nádia01i am sorry to desagree with most people but for i don´t feel anything about this fragance nothing speciall when i ask some girl what is her favorite fragance they say ralph lauren to me it smells like some cheap perfume its just my opinionblakie44i love this perfume it is the perfect everyday scent it smells very clean but at the same time it also smells fruity and floral i only wear this in the summer because i find that it is too fresh and light for the winter it never gets overpowering or too much it is just like a breath of fresh air i will always have a bottle of this in my collectionmissfrangrant123i tried this at the store today and wowthis is really a summer scent i was a bit disappointed though because it wasnt very original i felt like i had smelt it beforethis may be because many people wear it it is a very fun smell for summer though and reminds me a lot of the beach the weird thing is i smell coconut when i wear it overall i love this scentconacha this is a very common fragrance and once you smell it and wear it you start to notice why i bought it because it was on sale like almost every other bottle i have but one day before i tried it along with four other fragrances and this one susprised me a lot it was the one that lasted the longer in my skin and my skin doesnt keep scent for long it lasted for more than 24 hours i couldnt believe it like everyone says its not original to wear this you can smell it everywhere but its still nice actualy i have recieved a lot of compliments which i thinks is strange being so popular i think its perfectly suitable for every day and for special ocassions too you can wear it in winter or summer i love this especially because i think i found the solution for the longevity problem on my skin guestbubblem3tiene un indiscutible parecido a paris hilton pero a mi me gusta mas la de paris  esta es mas fresca y citrica y la otra dulce y frutal 3servana so it seems like everyone has this perfume i finally smelt it today  i can see the appeal although i do not find it amazing its nice but it smells exactly like my garnier leavein conditioner so if you like that fresh hairproducty smell youll really like this im not knocking it i see the appeal it would be great for summerrola81i adore this ralph stellalucente a classic for young girls oh yes me and ralph have a little history of our own too i used to love this fragrance when i was a teenager now in my twenties we just dont match anymore every time i apply it i feel like im meeting up with a friend that i havent seen in years and i end up realizing that we dont have anything in common anymore sadly thats how i feel about ralph i dont think ill buy a bottle of this fragrance again but nevertheless every time i catch a hint of ralph on someone else it always puts a smile on my face and takes me way back caydesugar thanks for the advice panthere  i went back to the shop today and tried it on my skin and i really like it  although to my nose this fragrance isnt that girly which i like in a scent it smells more like a mens cologne but i still love the smell of itpanthere hi caydesugar a bit of friendly advice always try on ur skin berfore u buy even if something smells fantastic from the bottle it wont always smell so great on the skin its unfortunatly to do with how it mixes with personal individual body chemistry good luck toomsnoopy fruity scent but not feminine enough to be wornit smells like cologne for menmelimelocheap cheap but good good good and very good perfume which make u feel in a fresh mood in summer time and i really love itednafrauthis fragrance will always be a sort of landmark as it set a new template for the fruity florals to come in its time i liked it but i absolutely couldnt wear it it was just too ubiquitous now my tastes have changed and its not my type of scent anymore but eleven years later it is still relatively popular lets hope the same doesnt happen with miss dior cherie a sort of equivalent in too used by everyone too fruity fragrance  but thats for another topic pminnijacheap cheap cheap cheap smelling perfume monos really nice fresh  not overpowering remainds me of cool summer days adorabella this was my sisters signature scent when she was younger so when i smell it im reminded of her thats not a bad thing i love itit smells clean fresh fruity and floral i recently smelled true religion hippie chic and i was immediately reminded of thisexcept rl is much better its an overall pleasant inoffensive scent that is perfect for daytime use in the springsummer miss parfum addict i like it a lot ralph is fresh clean and fruity tought i smell it soapycryspyapple a woman asked me what was smelling like fresh paint when i used it after a shower at the gym  betty pretty ralph is my the best of perfume for the summer when i wear the one i feel fresh and clean yet sexy wynter ralph is very unique and young i cant say ive smelled another perfume like it it exactly captures the scent and feel of summer its fresh fruity floral and all around lovely theres a lot of comparisons between paris hiltons scent and ralph but i find them to be completely different ralph is much much better and more floral whereas theres a kind of soapy note in paris that i dislikeariuna i have paris hilton by paris hilton and i want ralph by rl do they smell alike because i wanna smell different these are smell alike i think vamy69this is a really clean fresh scent perfect for any time and whenever you want a clean uplifting scent i think it is suitable for any age niceallexaro i love this one for everyday wear it feels light yet the fragrance is lasting and everyone noticed it while i used it  i use to use it at courses at university and i find it perfect for that or a regular day out shoppingnanster i spritzed this on at the fragrance counter and have no complaints about the smell fresh a bit fruity but subtly so for me though it was very softtoo soft so that i could barely smell it after an hour i may try it again to be surepyarkaaloothis ones a real masterpiece not in the niche or classic sense of the word but as far as fruity florals go this is unmistakable with great lasting power sillage is also great the scent stays pretty true from beginning to end which i definitely appreciate an explosion of berries but not solely fruit i think the italian mandarin apple leaf  freesia are hard at work to give this a distinct bright  slightly mature fruity smell though it is a fun girly scent its also somewhat aquatic  sporty to me and i picture some kind of juicy water with a crisp floral somewhere in there to balance things out  elevate the fragrance who knew freesia combined with mandarin could create the illusion of berry it is my guess that its these 2 notes especially which do that or perhaps freesia  apple leaf freesias a really neat ingredient  one of my favorite notes all in all a beautiful fragrance sparkling juicy scrumptious  flirtycupcakeprincessponies a few weeks ago i was with my mom out and buy christmas presents and i had to find the perfume i had chosen but then this ralph lauren perfume caught my eye i remember my ex bestfriend had it once and i just had to try it on what a

good mood love itmariantu this is not a nice fragance at all i asked to my mum as a bday present to get me lauren she was confused and got me ralph so saaaaad i dont like this but ill give it a try next summerkraxa this is a perfume that i requested from my sister as a airport purchase when it first came out it absolutely repulsed me smells sharp and nauseaus like fabric softener and induces headache got rid of it asap rachel321i meant to say that i think it smells like fresh laundry which is fine but its not that specialsherapop ralph lauren ralph is a serious déjà senti experience to my nose and not without reason for victorias secret sexy little thing empirically indistinguishableexcept in strengthfrom ralph in a sidebyside test also prominently features green apple osmanthus and iris in a musk base this looks like a case of perfume plagiarism to me ralph came six years before slt however neither fragrance description names a designer so perhaps they are the same and perhaps the multinational conglomerate that owns both companies is also the same on ne sait jamais in any case i am finding that the plagiarized sexy little thing is in fact an improvement because ralph is really quite loud even when very judiciously applied the longevity and strength of sillage too cannot be denied the tad of metallic soapiness that i found in slt is in ralph noticeable enough for me to place both of these in the dislike category as a note to self that i really dont want to add them to my collection in the end i can recommend ralph to those who like sexy little thing and vice versa but ralph lauren deserves all of the creditor the blame carolinealgot another scent i cant stand never tried it on me as i feel bad just smell it from othersguestbetty there is nothing good to say about this a lot of fruits gone bad trown in a mixer the result is a nauseating fragrance that make people wanna leave the roombamboowu i bought this based on a review my neice gave me and though i liked it i thought it was a bit strong i tried it again  a little bit less heavy and i absolutely love it now it begins a little sharp but to me it smooths out to candy apples and softened  after a while  it seems to last several hours it really is remarkable sometimes i spray a little in the evening and the next morning it is still there i found that if it is used lightly my love for this increased greatly my lovely neice was right if your on the unsure side try using it lightly and you might find you love itguestwowgirl i really wanted to like this scent because i adore the bottle and it was described as an airy scentbut when i sampled it it was a disappointment it did nothing for meguestok this smells exactly like a thousands cheaps rexona teens deodorants that you can buy in a supermarket for a really cheap price horrible cheap and ordinary smell badjoanit smells just like summer in a bottlevery refreshing sweet  delicious marki san i smelled this in the store and it smelled almost the same as live luxe by j loits agressive fruity i dont like itdm8mthis is one of my favorite scents for women one best fresh scents out there imo it reminds me of an exgirlfriend i

headache at allalso nice bring to travelingthanksrin xdeven though this perfume is classified as casual and for every day use it is remarkable its peachy and somehow wour scent is truely amazing even if its used in special events it will be one of a kind and memorable my mom brought this bottle when i smelled it i thought its not something special or interesting but once she wore it i knew that its amazingcarolocta it is fruity clean and casual ralph is not one of my favorite perfumes but i enjoy wearing this in the hot summer i think it has a young smell and vibe it is not sexy nor remarkable ralph is just a clean scent for me and i most agree with the other reviews the drydown is not the best part of the fragrance kelly bellyz oh how this brings me back to when i was a teen and in love with this i didnt own it but my bestfriend did and i would use hers whenever i can lol this is such a fun and casual fragrance to wear good for the summer it is sweet but not over the top sweet it is fruity and kind of airy quite clean and refreshing i can smell the mandarin and a bit of apple but lasting power is average and the drydown is boringgladsandwich i used to wear ralph hot before i got this and fortunately i got more compliments on it i can smell the apple in it but when it fades away it gets boring on me my boyfriend and his friends loves it though  pguestrochellesmells like live luxe by jlo and the first paris hilton fragrancemisscareyann i feel like the bottle represents ralph perfectly clear fresh clean and airy it also lasts a long time on

but smells good and actually last for a pretty long timeivy this is one of my all time favorites it is very sweet and feminine soph i have this scent because a friend of mine wears it everyday and i

fresh and its light kinda has an athletic vibe to it but i wouldnt buy it i think it smells similar to a lot of perfumes levanasimple fresh casual its something everyone could wear and its a smell you never get sick or tired of this fragrance is perfect to give as a pressent to younger girlsmoonrubythe ralph range was popular in highschool and almost everyone was either wearing it or talking about it in my experience i find this synthetic and stale and i smelt like a walking chemical spillmack ive personally always loved this fragrance the scent is simply irresistable jmoron every time i wore this atleast one person would ask me if i smoke when i realized it was the perfume i also realized it really does smell a lot like cigarettes not very nicebelladonnasbliss i remember when this first came out it was very unique then it was the 3rd perfume i ever bought then came all the spawn copies by none designers still to this day it is very distinguishable from the rest of the floral fruity bunch easy to pick out and not worn as often is a fresh fragrance with a little sport not that much though was well blended had a time of picking out the distinctive notes apples then it just smells like ralph from high school i wonder if they changed it at all i remember it smelling more sharp and fresh and less like fresh apples actually the more i smell this mini i have the more im sure they down played it a lot since 2001 when i had a new bottle sad because it was a one of a kind now it smells weaker than its old knock offsguesttorichick i love this one to me it smells like fresh citrus

this and i have to say that i did love this perfume so much it reminds me of high school is a fresh fragance full of life its seems that a lot of people is wearing it becuase i can smell it in other people a must have senna its so refreshing perfect for spring or summer hot days i can use it everyday for school for sportsits so lightalexandragreecei was on a flight to new york when i first smelled this perfumethe flight attendant was wearing iti immediately asked her about it and she repliedoh you can smell thiscause i wear it since this morning we had this dialogue at the end of an 11 hour flightimagine thatso as soon as i got to nyc i bought itso its floral and unique as a scent but i have to admit that even though it lasts 4ever i dont like the fact that it has anathletickind of perfume finishingits not too feminineso i think its a modern everyday frangrance which lasts forever and nothing moreprincess45this fragrance smells wonderful its very floral and sweet like candy i had this perfume but my mom left the bottle outside in the sun now it doesnt smell but i keep it in my collections trvevil this perfume is very perfect for summer or hot spring days that happened to be today at first its apples apples apples i wonder if apple leaf smells like apples similar apple is in paris hilton perfume then i can feel the same apple and magnolia first more than hour its very intensive but after couple of hours it becomes less intensive but nice i like it but dont love it in fact i find paris hilton more interesting because it contains woody notes i dont think ralph smells like live by j lo live is more exotic lasting power of ralph i find good it stays long on my wrist the bottle and color matches the perfume because its clean blue for me is something clean usually easy to wearmgirl1090i dont know i find this fragnace really casual and fresh i dont have it yet but i tried couple of times at macys and it smelled very pleasent emeraude i think it smells freshfruity and soft floralnot too sweeti like iti think it smells similar to tommy dreamingsharyssa what a waste of 5950 it smells so synthetic and cheap and lasting power is zero i think paris hilton smells better i dont know why this is so popular i really dont like this onemuffindolphin this smells amazing its fruity but really really light and it doesnt smell artificial at all it smells delicious missk i find this fragrance refreshing hence the reason why i refer to ralph as my sporty perfume it smells a lot like green apple and magnolia i dont usually wear this when i go out this is more of a sitting at home relaxing type of scent its a great perfume to spritz on just after a shower or a run because it smells so fresh and cleanmirrora definite no its the typical cheap blue fragrance that smells like the air freshener of public bathrooms malibu ralph was my favourite scent during high school it was easy to wear everyday fragrance which lasted for the whole school day it was also inoffensive many people would come up to me  ask what i was wearing the only problem i had with ralph was that the floral notes in it were overpowering  i would sometimes suffer from headaches when i wore it i tried it again recently  it is still pleasant to wear  is affordable however i wouldn’t buy it again now as paris hilton for woman is a similar fragrance which isn’t as overpowering  it has the better drydownmarie08this is the perfect fruityfloral scent this was my first real perfume its very bright and reminds me of spring de lizious yessss rockin rio smells a lot like ralph but its a little more fruitier i have them both but love ralph more cuz it was my first fragrance love the only thing is that the toiletspray at my university is some sort of cheap ralphripoff so now i smell toilet when im wearing ralph or rockin riohena ai have no idea why at times it smells a bit like escada rockin rio fruity n sweetchance25now this is my interpretation of clean soft mild floral sort of fruity fruits like melon pineapple apples all have this calming effect i would also say there is a sporty feel to it as well or a casual wear perfume its lovely and longlasting a real head turner due to its simplicity millieqm yuck it makes me sick i had it and had to gave it to a friend because i couldnt stand it too bad for my nose love ralph lauren but this one was a mess sorry not for me at all i like blue instead very much amythyst i got a free sample of this very glad that i didnt pay for it it smells on me very cheap and i cant detect any change in the different notes after wearing it for a couple of hours it has very good staying power i would have to say that if you like strong florals that are hard to pin down then this one is for youtommygirlthe first impression is the last impression and thats the secret of ralph successit opens with some fruitysexysweet and sour notes leading to the heart of spring flowersdelicious and fruitya good choice for young ladiesa bit soapy but not mentionable at allwhen i wear itin every motion i feel the blend of soursweet notes moving and i feel scandeliciousno matter i wear it day  evening or midnightthe affection doesnt changeit matches my skins chemistry in the best way ice bianca my sister had this perfume i love it so much and when she didnt notice i use to snick upand use itwithout her knowing it and we always played the same gamedid you used my perfume she asked knowing that i didbut the answer wasnoocaro23i do not like it at all it gave me headache cheap taliera i bought this perfume because i loved the smell of it on other people never a good policy always try it on your own skin first im glad i only got the 30m l bottle the first hour is yuck it smells cheap and chemically  like toilet cleaner or fragrance tags for cars then its overwhelmingly apple green apple and something light but which is slightly rancid maybe its my chemistry doing it i might give it to my sister for her birthday but after an hour or so it smells moreorless how it should be  sparkling attractive and delicate i think i need a few more days before the final verdict is passedmoonoi always be loved by everyone but me strong and lasting scent make me headache people around me use it some use it too much in this ralph line ralph cool is so much better surreal on others it smells nice but on me like rotten prunes ralph never liked me  dianthus fruity funny not very serious or mystic just to wear on a party disco shopping with friends for me too arifical and quite similar to escada rockin rio feiyt a very summery fragrance but suitable for spring as well the scent is harder to describe very fresh and energetic but not overly sweet it lasts a long time but ive found unfortunately that on me the dry down smells almostsoaplike on others its still fine though although you might find a con to be how many people you can find using this perfumesjanira ahh very nice and fresh it kinda reminds me of one of jennifer lopez fragrances im just not sure which one maybe live or live luxe anyway its one im always reaching for its just hard not to like it althea summer in the bottle i had a big one and loved it everyone was asking what it was many many compliments i wouldnt dare to buy it anymore as i am somewhere else right now and this summer girlie scent
