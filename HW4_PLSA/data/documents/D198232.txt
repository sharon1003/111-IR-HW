walk cycle in this model the head keeps the same level at all times whereas the hip follows a sine curve walking also known as ambulation is one of the main gaits of locomotion among legged animals walking is typically slower than running and other gaits walking is defined by an inverted pendulum gait in which the body vaults over the stiff limb or limbs with each step this applies regardless of

racewalkers at the world cup trials in 1987the word walk is descended from the old english wealcan to roll in humans and other bipeds walking is generally distinguished from running in that only one foot at a time leaves contact with the ground and there is a period of doublesupport in contrast running begins when both feet are off the ground with each step this distinction has the status of a formal requirement in competitive walking events for quadrupedal species there are numerous gaits which may be termed walking or running and distinctions based upon the presence or absence of a suspended phase or the number of feet in contact any time do not yield mechanically correct classification 1 the most effective method to distinguish walking from running is to measure the height of a persons centre of mass using motion capture or a force plate at midstance during walking the centre of mass reaches a maximum height at midstance while during running it is then at a minimum this distinction however only holds true for locomotion over level or approximately level ground for walking up grades above 10 this distinction no longer holds for some individuals definitions based on the percentage of the stride during which a foot is in contact with the ground averaged across all feet of greater than 50 contact corresponds well with identification of inverted pendulum mechanics and are indicative of walking for animals with any number of limbs although this definition is incomplete 1 running humans and animals may have contact periods greater than 50 of a gait cycle when rounding corners running uphill or carrying loads speed is another factor that distinguishes walking from running although walking speeds can vary greatly depending on many factors such as height weight age terrain surface load culture effort and fitness the average human walking speed at crosswalks is about 50 kilometres per hour kmh or about 14 meters per second ms or about 31 miles per hour mph specific studies have found pedestrian walking speeds at crosswalks ranging from 451 kilometres per hour 280 mph to 475 kilometres per hour 295 mph for older individuals and from 532 kilometres per hour 331 mph to 543 kilometres per hour 337 mph for younger individuals 2 3 a brisk walking speed can be around 65 kilometres per hour 40 mph 4 champion racewalkers can average more than 14 kilometres per hour 87 mph over a distance of 20 kilometres 12 mi an average human child achieves independent walking ability at around 11 months old 5health benefits  editmain article physical exercise regular brisk exercise of any kind can improve confidence stamina energy weight control and life expectancy and reduce stress 6 it can also reduce the risk of coronary heart disease strokes diabetes high blood pressure bowel cancer and osteoporosis 6 scientific studies have also shown that walking besides its physical benefits is also beneficial for the mind improving memory skills learning ability concentration and abstract reasoning 6 as well as ameliorating spirits  clarification needed sustained walking sessions for a minimum period of thirty to sixty minutes a day five days a week with the correct walking posture 7 reduce health risks and have various overall health benefits such as reducing the chances of cancer type 2 diabetes heart disease anxiety disorder and depression 8 life expectancy is also increased even for individuals suffering from obesity or high blood pressure walking also improves bone health especially strengthening the hip bone and lowering the harmful lowdensity lipoprotein ldl cholesterol and raising the useful highdensity lipoprotein hdl cholesterol 6 studies have found that walking may also help prevent dementia and alzheimers 9the centers for disease control and prevention s fact sheet on the relationship of walking to mortality among u s adults with diabetes states that those with diabetes who walked for 2 or more hours a week lowered their mortality rate from all causes by 39 per cent walking lengthened the life of people with diabetes regardless of age sex race body mass index length of time since diagnosis and presence of complications or functional limitations 10 it has been suggested that there is a relationship between the speed of walking and health and that the best results are obtained with a speed of more than 25 mph 4 kmh 11governments now recognize the benefits of walking for mental and physical health and are actively encouraging it this growing emphasis on walking has arisen because people walk less nowadays than previously in the uk a department of transport report 12 found that between 199597 and 2005 the average number of walk trips per person fell by 16 from 292 to 245 per year many professionals in local authorities and the nhs are employed to halt this decline by ensuring that the built environment allows people to walk and that there are walking opportunities available to them professionals working to encourage walking come mainly from six sectors health transport environment schools sport and recreation and urban design one programme to encourage walking is the walking the way to health initiative organized by the british walkers association the ramblers which is the largest volunteer led walking scheme in the united kingdom volunteers are trained to lead free health walks from community venues such as libraries and doctors surgeries the scheme has trained over 35000 volunteers and have over 500 schemes operating across the uk with thousands of people walking every week 13 a new organization called walk england launched a web site in june 2008 to provide these professionals with evidence advice and examples of success stories of how to encourage communities to walk more the site has a social networking aspect to allow professionals and the public to ask questions post news and events and communicate with others in their area about walking as well as a walk now option to find out what walks are available in each region similar organizations exist in other countries and recently a walking summit was held in the united states this assembl ed thoughtleaders and influencers from business urban planning and real estate along with physicians and public health officials and others to discuss how to make american cities and communities places where people can and want to walk 14origins  edita walking hamster it is theorized that walking among tetrapods originated underwater with airbreathing fish that could walk underwater giving rise to the plethora of landdwelling life that walk on four or two limbs 15 while terrestrial tetrapods are theorised to have a single origin arthropods and their relatives are thought to have independently evolved walking several times specifically in insects myriapods chelicerates tardigrades onychophorans and crustaceans 16 little skates members of the demersal fish community can propel themselves by pushing off the ocean floor with their pelvic fins using neural mechanisms which evolved as early as 420 million years ago before vertebrates set foot on land 17 18judging from footprints discovered on a former shore in kenya it is thought possible that ancestors of modern humans were walking in ways very similar to the present activity as many as 15 million years ago 19 20variants  editnordic walkers scrambling is a method of ascending a hill or mountain that involves using both hands because of the steepness of the terrain 21 of necessity it will be a slow and careful form of walking and with possibly of occasional brief easy rock climbing some scrambling takes place on narrow exposed ridges where more attention to balance will be required than in normal walking snow shoeing – a snowshoe is footwear for walking over the snow snowshoes work by distributing the weight of the person over a larger area so that the persons foot does not sink completely into the snow a quality called flotation it is often said by snowshoers that if you can walk you can snowshoe this is true in optimal conditions but snowshoeing properly requires some slight adjustments to walking the method of walking is to lift the shoes slightly and slide the inner edges over each other thus avoiding the unnatural and fatiguing straddlegait that would otherwise be necessary a snowshoer must be willing to roll his or her feet slightly as well an exaggerated stride works best when starting out particularly with larger or traditional shoes beach walking is a sport that is based on walk on the sand of the beach beach walking can be developed on compact sand or noncompact sand there are beach walking competitions on noncompact sand and there are world records of beach walking on noncompact sand in multiday distances beach walking has a specific technique of walk nordic walking is a physical activity and a sport which is performed with specially designed walking poles similar to ski poles compared to regular walking nordic walking also called pole walking involves applying force to the poles with each stride nordic walkers use more of their entire body with greater intensity and receive fitness building stimulation not present in normal walking for the chest lats triceps biceps shoulder abdominals spinal and other core muscles that may result in significant increases in heart rate at a given pace 22 nordic walking has been estimated as producing up to a 46 increase in energy consumption compared to walking without poles 23 24pedestrianism is a sport that developed during the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and was a popular spectator sport in the british isles by the end of the 18th century and especially with the growth of the popular press feats of foot travel over great distances similar to a modern ultramarathon gained attention and were labeled pedestrianism interest in the sport and the wagering which accompanied it spread to the united states canada and australia in the 19th century by the end of the 19th century pedestrianism was largely displaced by the rise in modern spectator sports and by controversy involving rules which limited its appeal as a source of wagering and led to its inclusion in the amateur athletics movement pedestrianism was first codified in the last half of the 19th century evolving into what would become racewalking by the mid 19th century competitors were often expected to extend their legs straight at least once in their stride and obey what was called the fair heel and toe rule this rule the source of modern racewalking was a vague commandment that the toe of one foot could not leave the ground before the heel of the next foot touched down this said rules were customary and changed with competition racers were usually allowed to jog in order to fend off cramps and it was distance not code which determined gait for longer races newspaper reports suggest that  trotting  was common in events 25power walking or speed walking is the act of walking with a speed at the upper end of the natural range for walking gait typically 7 to 9 kmh 45 to 55 mph to qualify as power walking as opposed to jogging or running at least one foot must be in contact with the ground at all times see also fitwalking  racewalking is a longdistance athletic event although it is a foot race it is different from running in that one foot must appear to be in contact with the ground at all times stride length is reduced so to achieve competitive speeds racewalkers must attain cadence rates comparable to those achieved by olympic 800meter runners 26 and they must do so for hours at a time since the olympic events are the 20 km 124 mi race walk men and women and 50 km 31 mi race walk men only and 50 mile 805 km events are also held see also pedestrianism above afghan walking the afghan walk is a rhythmic breathing technique synchronized with walking it was born in the 1980s on the basis of the observations made by the frenchman édouard g stiegler during his contacts with afghan caravaners capable of making walks of more than 60 km per day for dozens of days  citation neededbiomechanics  edithuman walking cycle human walking is accomplished with a strategy called the double pendulum during forward motion the leg that leaves the ground swings forward from the hip this sweep is the first pendulum then the leg strikes the ground with the heel and rolls through to the toe in a motion described as an inverted pendulum the motion of the two legs is coordinated so that one foot or the other is always in contact with the ground the process of walking recovers approximately sixty per cent of the energy used due to pendulum dynamics and ground reaction force 27 28walking differs from a running gait in a number of ways the most obvious is that during walking one leg always stays on the ground while the other is swinging in running there is typically a ballistic phase where the runner is airborne with both feet in the air for bipedals another difference concerns the movement of the centre of mass of the body in walking the body vaults over the leg on the ground raising the centre of mass to its highest point as the leg passes the vertical and dropping it to the lowest as the legs are spread apart essentially kinetic energy of forward motion is constantly being traded for a rise in potential energy this is reversed in running where the centre of mass is at its lowest as the leg is vertical this is because the impact of landing from the ballistic phase is absorbed by bending the leg and consequently storing energy in muscles and tendons in running there is a conversion between kinetic potential and elastic energy there is an absolute limit on an individuals speed of walking without special techniques such as those employed in speed walking due to the upwards acceleration of the centre of mass during a stride – if its greater than the acceleration due to gravity the person will become airborne as they vault over the leg on the ground typically however animals switch to a run at a lower speed than this due to energy efficiencies based on the 2d inverted pendulum model of walking there are at least five physical constraints that place fundamental limits on walking like an inverted pendulum 29 these constraints are takeoff constraint sliding constraint fallback constraint steadystate constraint high stepfrequency constraint a leisure activity  editwalking in shilda georgia main article hiking many people enjoy walking as a recreation in the mainly urban modern world and it is one of the best forms of exercise 30 for some walking is a way to enjoy nature and the outdoors and for others the physical sporting and endurance aspect is more important there are a variety of different kinds of walking including bushwalking racewalking beach walking hillwalking volksmarching nordic walking trekking and hiking some people prefer to walk indoors on a treadmill or in a gym and fitness walkers and others may use a pedometer to count their steps hiking is the usual word used in canada the united states and south africa for long vigorous walks similar walks are called tramps in new zealand or hill walking or just walking in australia the uk and the irish republic australians also bushwalk in englishspeaking parts of north america the term walking is used for short walks especially in towns and cities snow shoeing is walking in snow a slightly different gait is required compared with regular walking in terms of tourism the possibilities range from guided walking tours in cities to organized trekking holidays in the himalayas in the uk the term walking tour also refers to a multiday walk or hike undertaken by a group or individual wellorganized systems of trails exist in many other european counties as well as canada united states new zealand and nepal systems of lengthy waymarked walking trails now stretch across europe from norway to turkey portugal to cyprus 31 many also walk the traditional pilgrim routes of which the most famous is el camino de santiago the way of st james numerous walking festivals and other walking events take place each year in many countries the worlds largest multiday walking event is the international four days marches nijmegen in the netherlands the vierdaagse dutch for four day event is an annual walk that has taken place since 1909 it has been based at nijmegen since 1916 depending on age group and category walkers have to walk 30 40 or 50

gauchetière street montreal quebec canada there has been a recent focus among urban planners in some communities to create pedestrianfriendly areas and roads allowing commuting shopping and recreation to be done on foot the concept of walkability has arisen as a measure of the degree to which an area is friendly to walking some communities are at least partially carfree making them particularly supportive of walking and other modes of transportation in the united states the active living network is an example of a concerted effort to develop communities more friendly to walking and other physical activities an example of such efforts to make urban development more pedestrian friendly is the pedestrian village this is a compact pedestrianoriented neighborhood or town with a mixeduse village center that follows the tenets of new pedestrianism 35 36 shareduse lanes for pedestrians and those using bicycles segways wheelchairs and other small rolling conveyances that do not use internal combustion engines generally these lanes are in front of the houses and businesses and streets for motor vehicles are always at the rear some pedestrian villages might be nearly carfree with cars either hidden below the buildings or on the periphery of the village venice italy is essentially a pedestrian village with canals the canal district in venice california on the other hand combines the front lanerear street approach with canals and walkways or just walkways 35 37 38walking is also considered to be a clear example of a sustainable mode of transport especially suited for urban use andor relatively shorter distances nonmotorised transport modes such as walking but also cycling smallwheeled transport skates skateboards push scooters and hand carts or wheelchair travel are often key elements of successfully encouraging clean urban transport 39 a large variety of case studies and good practices from european cities and some worldwide examples that promote and stimulate walking as a means of transportation in cities can be found at eltis europes portal for local transport 40the development of specific rights of way with appropriate infrastructure can promote increased participation and enjoyment of walking examples of types of investment include pedestrian malls and foreshoreways such as oceanways and also river walks the first purposebuilt pedestrian street in europe is the lijnbaan in rotterdam opened in 1953 the first pedestrianised shopping centre in the united kingdom was in stevenage in 1959 a large number of european towns and cities have made part of their centres carfree since the early 1960s these are often accompanied by car parks on the edge of the pedestrianised zone and in the larger cases park and ride schemes

was conducted in order to find the best way to get the amputee children to develop a more symmetrical and fluid walking form like normal able bodied children because of the results of the study which showed that the normal bodied children can withstand a lot more external loading than the amputees researchers are now looking into the manufacturing and design of the prosthetics that these amputees

about 4 miles per hour 64 kmh when walking a horses legs follow this sequence left hind leg left front leg right hind leg right front leg in a regular 1234 beat at the walk the horse will always have one foot raised and the other three feet on the ground save for a brief moment when weight is being transferred from one foot to another a horse moves its head and neck in a slight up and down motion that helps maintain balance 42ideally the advancing rear hoof oversteps the spot where the previously advancing front hoof touched the ground the more the rear hoof oversteps the smoother and more comfortable the walk becomes individual horses and different breeds vary in the smoothness of their walk however a rider will almost always feel some degree of gentle sidetoside motion in the horses hips as each hind leg reaches forward the fastest walks with a fourbeat footfall pattern are actually the lateral forms of ambling gaits such as the running walk singlefoot and similar rapid but smooth intermediate speed gaits if a horse begins to speed up and lose a regular fourbeat cadence to its gait the horse is no longer walking but is beginning to either trot or pace elephants  editan asian elephant walking elephants can move both forwards and backwards but cannot trot jump or gallop they use only two gaits when moving on land the walk and a faster gait similar to running 43 in walking the legs act as pendulums with the hips and shoulders rising and falling while the foot is planted on the ground with no aerial phase the fast gait does not meet all the criteria of running although the elephant uses its legs much like other running animals with the hips and shoulders falling and then rising while the feet are on the ground 44 fastmoving elephants appear to run with their front legs but walk with their hind legs and can reach a top speed of 18 kmh 11 mph 45 at this speed most other quadrupeds are well into a gallop even accounting for leg length walking fish
