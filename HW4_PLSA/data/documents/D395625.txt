science chemistry chem lab q what color does barium chloride burn a quick answer the compound barium chloride burns green at wavelength of 589 nanometers which is in the middle of the visible light spectrum color is produced by heating metal salts such as barium chloride calcium salts or sodium salts continue reading keep learning what is the wavelength of red light what is the wavelength of the photon emitted when a hydrogen atom goes from the second energy level to the first energy level why are lasers red full answer the amount of energy that is released by the burning compound is shown in a particular wavelength which corresponds to a color higher energies burn bluepurple at shorter wavelengths while lower energies burn red which corresponds to longer wavelengths the energy absorbed rearranges the electrons from a ground state to an excited state at this state the light is emitted then the electrons slowly return back down to the lower ground state as stated in chemical of the week learn more about chem lab sources scifunchemwiscedu related questions q what color has the longest wavelength a red is the color on the visible electromagnetic spectrum that has the longest wavelength the wavelength of red on the spectrum is 700 nanometers converse full answer filed under colors q how does a light microscope work a a light microscope uses a focused beam of visible light to magnify objects for observation it works in a similar way as a refracting telescope but with se full answer filed under chem lab q why do chemicals burn different colors a the color of light a chemical burns depends on the energies of the photons which are determined by the energy it takes to move electrons from one orbit to full answer filed under atoms  molecules q what are some uses for flame tests a flame tests help miners geologists chemists and other related professionals identify the presence of chemical elements in a sample using the elementâ€™s em full answer filed under chem lab you may also like q how does a homogenizer work q what color eye shadow goes with grey eyes q what color is peat q what color are safe water markers q what is the melting point of polyethylene q what color is hazel
