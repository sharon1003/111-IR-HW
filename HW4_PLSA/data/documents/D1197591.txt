branch of ulnar artery what is the branch of the radial artery in the wrist superficial branch of radial artery what does the superficial branch of the radial artery anastomose with superficial palmar arch what is the continuation of the radial artery in the hand deep palmar arch and gives most of the supply to it what are the branches of the deep palmar arch palmar metacarpal arteries what do the palmar metacarpal arteries anastomose with common palmar digital arteries what are the branches of the median nerve in the forearm and wrist anterior interosseous nerve ain palmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve recurrent branch of the median nerve what muscles does the anterior interosseous nerve ain innervate radial portion of the flexor digitorum profundus flexor pollicis longus and pronator quadratus what is the path taken by the anterior interosseous nerve ain descends on anterior aspect of the interosseous membrane and passes deep to the pronator quadratus muscles what doe the palmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve innervate skin of the central palm what does the recurrent branch of the median nerve innervate intrinsic muscles of the thumb what does the radial nerve branch into in the cubital fossa deep radialposterior interosseous nerve pin and the superficial sensory nerve what does the deep radial nerve innervate supinator muscle and extensor carpi radialis brevis muscle what are the proximal carpal bones scaphoid lunate triquetrum and pisiform lateralmedial some lovers try positionswhat are the distal carpal bones trapezium trapezoid capitate and hammate lateralmedial that they cant handlewhat is the function of the palmar arches balance stability and mobility increase surface contact of palm position thumb for function what are the 3 palmar arches proximal transverse distal transverse and longitudinal where is the proximal palmar arch carpalmetacarpal joint where is the distal palmar arch metacarpalphalangeal joint what is the carpal tunnel an passageway through the wrist formed by the distal and proximal carpal bones and the flexor retinaculum connecting the medial and distal ends together what travels through the carpal tunnel flexor tendons fds fdp fpl and the median nerve what is guyons tunnel passage way formed by the pisiform hook of the hammate and pisohammate liagment what travels through guyons tunnel ulnar nerve and artery what forms the the radiocarpal joint distal radius and proximal carpals what kind of joint is the radiocarpal joint condyloid what movement takes place at the radiocarpal joint flexionextension and abadduction what forms the midcarpal joint proximal and distal row of carpals what kind of joint is the midcarpal joint complex plane what movement takes place at the midcarpal joint gliding motion between the rows what forms the intercarpal joints individual carpal bones in each row what kind of joint is the intercarpal joint plane joint with minimal movement what joints are required for abadduction and flexionextension of the wrist radiocarpal and midcarpal where does the majority of flexion occur in the wrist radiocarpal joint where does the majority of the extension occur in the wrist midcarpal joint where does the majority of abduction occur in the wrist midcarpal joint where does the majority of adduction occur in the wrist radiocarpal joint which has a greater deviation in the wrist flexion or extension flexion because it is done though the radiocarpal joint which has a greater deviation in the wrist abduction or adduction adduction because it is done through the radiocarpal joint what are the accessory structures of the wrist flexor retinaculum transverse carpal ligaments extensory retinaculum radial and ulnar collateral legaments and articular disc what is the flexor retinaculum transverse carpal ligament forms roof of the carpal tunnel on the palmar surface and functions to prevent bowstringing of the tendons of the extrnsic muscles long flexors as they enter the hand what is the extensor retinaculum covers dorsum surface of the wrist and functions to prevent bowstringing of the tendons of the extrinsic muscles long extensors as they enter the hand what do the radial and ulnar collateral ligaments do provide stability at the wrist by restricting excessive deviate to the other side what is the articular disc of the wrist lies between the distal end of the ulna and proximal carpals and functions to provide a continuous gliding surface across the entire distal face of the 2 forearm bones and cushions the forces transmitted through the ulnocarpal axis what are the posterior muscles acting on the wrist extensor carpi radialis longus extensor carpi radialis brevis extensor carpi ulnaris what are the anterior muscles acting on the wrist flexor carpi radialis flexor carpi ulnaris what is colles fracture distal radius fracture with dorsal displacement of fragment what is the mechanism of injury of colles fracture falling on an outstretched arm most common fracture in adults with 70 being postmenopausal women what is smith fracture distal radius fracture with palmar displacement of fragment what is the mechanism of injury of smith fracture falling on the dorsum of the hand with wrist flexed what is the mechanism of injury of a scaphoid fracture fall on the palm what is the clinical significance of a scaphoid fracture poor blood supply to the proximal scaphoid leads to long recovery period of several months avascular necrosis of the proximal fragment of the scaphoid may occurs and produce degenerative joint disease of the wrist due to this surgical fusion may be needed arthrodesiswhat is lateral epicondylitis inflammation of the periosteum of the lateral epicondyle due to repeated forceful flexion and extension of the wrist what is the palmar aponeurosis a strong welldefined part of the deep fascia of the palm covers the soft tissues and overlies the long flexor tendons what is dupuytrens contracture a benign slowly progressive condition causing contracture of the palmar fascia it has no clear etiology or pathogenesis which muscles cause abduction radial deviation of the wrist extensor carpi radialis longus and flexor carpi radialis which muscles cause adduction ulnar deviation of the wrist extensor carpi ulnaris and flexor carpi ulnaris
