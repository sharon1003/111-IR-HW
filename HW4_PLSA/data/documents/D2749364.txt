definitely less harmful than smoke for all mucosal surfaces absolutely certain of that because it doesnt contain hydrogen cyanide like smoke does hmmmm i think thats a moot point its far more complicated than that  besides inhaling burning plant material is never going to be good for teeth gums lungs etcetc regardless of whether its cannabis or tobacco smoke now for own little horror story ive been smoking both for 21 years and im in my mid 30s ive recently had the last of my natural teeth removed and am presently waiting for the pot holes to heal up so that i can have full mouth dentures aged 35 now over the years i reckon i spent the best part of 15k just to try an keep a full mouth of teeth but i was always fighting a losing battle and i shall explain why aged 18 i had absolutely perfect teeth  as my dentist used to say you could make moulds for dentures from your teeth as they are absolutely perfect size shape spacing colour etc etc so i how did get from perfect to absolutely nothing  bottom line is cannabis not so much the drug itself but the way in which i smoke it from the age of about 18 or when i first started secretly toking in my house behind my parents back the absolute last thing i do before going to bed is to have a good old toot on the bong to send me off for good nights kip and its still the same 17 years later initially i used to have a toke then clean my teeth then go to bed however cleaning my teeth after having that last toke meant going to bed with fresh minth taste in your mouth i guess normal for most people the problem this caused me is that i would wake up in the middle of the night with most maddest munchies you could ever imagine so i used to getup stuff my face quite literally with mainly sugary snacks then go back to bed then wake up in the morning with the most chronic indigestion my god it used to make me feel ill in the mornings so i experimented with not cleaning my teeth after my last toke of the day and have never had problem waking up with the munchies since however this obviously means that i was now cleaning teeth just once a day so thats when everything started going wrong with my teeth as mentioned ive spent thousands trying to save my teeth when the best thing i could have done was brush them at night but could entertain this thought for the reasons explained above additionally i also have extremely sweet tooth which i put down purely to smoking both tobacco  cannabis so ive concluded that smoking anything is bad for your teeth gums heart lungs etcetc also that the way its ingested is also irrelevant doesnt matter whether its spliff bong vapourize or just plain smoking cigarettes its all bad for your gums teeth lungs etc etcsmoooth just sprouted full member177 posts posted february 15 2011vaping is defiantely gonna be better for the gums as its not going to contain all the carcinogens that smoke doesthat is as long as you use the vape properly and get the temp set right otherwise it will start to burn the bud andyoull end up getting some smoke love smoking out of a volcano nothing like a bag in the morningkgbim a secret lemonade drinker lifetime subscriber34953112
