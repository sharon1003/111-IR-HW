venus structure venuss structure feature  of radius inner core 17outer core 30mantle 525crust 5atmosphere 3the inner core venuss inner core is composed of ironnickel although it is hot enough to melt the tremendous pressure on top of it keeps it solid the outer core venuss outer core is also composed of ironnickel but unlike the inner core it is not put under enough pressure to make it a solid the mantle venuss mantle is a thick melted mixture of silicates and relatively small amounts of metallic oxides though venuss mantle is less powerful than earths it still convects causing continental drift the crust venuss crust is made of rock silicates and metals subsurface rock is more plastic than on earth absorbing the energy of continental drift however there are still volcanoes caused by collisions of plates no active ones have been discovered yet and there are fewer than on earth some are higher than mount everest venuss crust has faults formed by the pulling apart of a continental plate it also sports features called ovoids so called because they are very round ovoids can be hundreds of miles in diameter they may be caused by upwellings of lava from the interior the atmosphere although venuss atmosphere is very thin compared to features like its mantle and cores its atmosphere is where all the action happens venuss atmosphere is composed of mostly carbon dioxide with nitrogen argon sulfuric acid and water vapor venuss atmosphere starts 42 miles 68 kilometers above its surface the top cloud layer is thin and hazy it is yellowwhite due to its composition it is composed of droplets of sulfuric acid in which is dissolved some other material iron this sulfuric acid mist constantly rains down into the lower cloud layers winds in the top layer exceed exceed speeds of 220 miles 360 kilometers per hour these winds carry the cloud tops around the planet every 4 days and even venusian temperatures the temperature at the top of the top layer is 44° f 43° c about 34 miles 55 kilometers above venuss surface the temperature is about 59° f 15° c here the top cloud layer ends and the middle one begins winds are going about 110 miles 180 kilometers per hour here and the temperature is much warmer than in the top layer the clouds in this layer contain particles of solid matter with unknown chemical identity these chemicals drift down with the sulfuric acid from above at an altitude of 31 miles 50 kilometers the middle layer ends and the bottom layer begins the temperature at the transition point is 163° f or 73° c winds are going about as fast as in the middle cloud layer the particles from above fall into this cloud layer and heat up at 30 miles 48 kilometers above the surface the clouds fade away the temperature at this altitude is 196° f 91° c the turbulence at the bottom of the triple cloud layer causes lightning to flash the spacecraft that explored venus could see 25 flashes of lightning every second within their range of vision lightning is so frequent that the dark side of venus glows and that thunder is not individual booms but a constant roar here below the clouds there is a haze of fine particles from above the sulfuric acid from the top cloud layer and the mysterious particles from the middle layer it is so hot at this level of the atmosphere that these particles break down chemically into water oxygen and sulfur compounds predominately sulfur dioxide the smaller lighter particles resulting from the breakup float up to the higher clouds where they condense and the cycle starts over again this cycle is venuss equivalent of earths water cycle19 miles 31 kilometers above the surface the haze ends the temperature at this altitude is an amazing 430° f 220° c at 12 miles 20 kilometers from the surface the temperature is 570° f almost 300° c the atmospheric pressure at this altitude is 21 times that on earth at sea level finally at ground level the temperature is 860° f 460° c on average in places it can be up to 900° f 480° c even though the wind rarely goes faster than 2 miles 4 kilometers an hour it pushes with significant force because venuss atmospheric pressure at ground level is 90 times of that on earthabout the pressure one would experience about a half mile almost a kilometer under the ocean history early in its history venus was much like earth it had an atmosphere a lot like ours and might have even had rivers and oceans but because venus was closer to the sun than earth was different chemical processes began to occur the sun slowly boiled away venuss surface water with a heavy water vapor atmosphere the greenhouse effect took hold the temperature rose enough that large amounts of carbon dioxide trapped in the surface rocks were released into the atmosphere with carbon dioxide in the air the greenhouse effect became much more efficient and the temperature shot up it became so hot that some of the water vapor in venuss atmosphere broke up chemically into hydrogen and oxygen simple sulfur compounds freed from the venusian crust joined with with these byproducts chemically to form sulfuric acid the leftover oxygen was trapped in the rocks of venuss crust and the leftover hydrogen eventually escaped into space venus is the third brightest object in the sky behind the sun and the moon sometimes it even casts shadows at night so of course it was known even to ancient astronomers until american mariner and soviet venera spacecraft studied the planet venus it was thought to be a twin of earth venuss thick opaque clouds gave people the opportunity to believe whatever they wanted to believe about the planet it seemed reasonable then that because venuss size mass and density were so close to earths it would resemble earth closely in other aspects as well people imagined venus as a lush garden of eden overflowing with plant and animal life they were very surprised when the readings came back from the mariner spacecraft that venus had such a harsh environment the greenhouse effect almost all of venuss atmosphere is carbon dioxide this carbon dioxide atmosphere covers venus like the glass covering a greenhouse hence the term greenhouse effect highenergy radiation from the sun ultraviolet light for example passes right through venuss carbon dioxide atmosphere this is like when visible light passes through the roof of a greenhouse the radiation proceeds to the ground where it is absorbed and reradiated as infrared energy heat the same happens in a greenhouse the plants absorb the light and reradiate it the new longwave lowenergy light cannot get through the carbon dioxide or the glass it is either absorbed convected and reradiated or reflected immediately the heat accumulates and the environment becomes very hot of course a lot of energy escapes from a greenhouse the temperature inside a greenhouse is very tolerable but on venus the greenhouse effect is very efficient raising venuss temperature to 900° f or 480° c
