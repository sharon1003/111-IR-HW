routinely in commercial industries they share a common structure at least 1 carbon atom and 1 hydrogen atom low molecular weight lipophilicity and volatility and they exist in liquid form at room temperature they may be grouped further into aliphaticchain compounds such as n hexane and as aromatic compounds with a 6carbon ring such as benzene or xylene aliphatics and aromatics may contain a substituted halogen element and may be referred to as halogenated hydrocarbons such as perchloroethylene pce or per trichloroethylene tce and carbon tetrachloride alcohols ketones glycols esters ethers aldehydes and pyridines are substitutions for a hydrogen group organic solvents are useful because they can dissolve oils fats resins rubber and plastics organic solvents arose in the latter half of the 19th century from the coaltar industry their application grew to be wide and diverse in both developed and developing countries the introduction of chlorinated solvents in the 1920s led to reports of toxicity although solvents number in the thousands only a few have been tested for neurotoxicity workers in industries that use these agents may have occupational exposure whereas other individuals may have environmental exposures if they live near industrial installations andor have contact with contaminated water soil air or food drinking water shower water ambient air indoor air and food among other sources are common routes of exposure to environmental toxins inhalation ingestion and dermal absorption are also important mechanisms of toxic exposure  1 2 3 exposures often involve mixtures of solvents some of these incidents may occur deliberately when an individual recreationally inhales paints glues and other products these exposures are described in more detail in the medscape reference article inhalants the occupational safety and health administration osha regulates worker exposure the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh and the american congress of governmental industrial hygienists acgih also publish standards for use in occupational settings in the united states pathophysiology shortterm highlevel exposures such as those frequently reported in case reports can result in acute reversible and irreversible health effects that involve the cns and pns in population studies intermediate and longterm lowlevel exposures have led to reversible and nonreversible subclinical and clinical abnormalities in the cns and pns in some cases these exposures were estimated to be below acceptable levels as designated in regulations for workers neurophysiologic neuropsychological and neuroimaging diagnostic tools have been used to evaluate individuals and groups exposed to organic solvents epidemiology frequency united states in 1987 niosh reported that 98 million workers were exposed to organic solvents in occupational settings however most occupational exposures involved solvent mixtures workers who use these agents include printers paint manufacturers painters microelectronics workers degreasers dry cleaners carpet layers coating workers gluers dye workers carpenters anesthesia personnel petrol filling workers laboratory workers inkers and textile workers others are those who work with polymers pharmaceuticals synthetic fabrics agriculture products refining or in airplane refitting table 1 lists common

adhesives cements fixative for pathologic specimens environmental exposures to organic solvents occur solvents are also present in home products according to niosh 49 million tons of organic solvents were produced in the united states in 1984 contamination affecting community water supplies food additives or household chemicals is an important source of exposure wellwater sampling both in the united states and abroad has revealed quantities of chlorinated hydrocarbons and other solvents health effects secondary to these exposures have been described estimating rates of occupational exposure is difficult because of a variety of factors worker exposures vary even within the same job exposures vary during a workday many routes of absorption are possible personal protective equipment ppe is used inconsistently and solvents are commonly used in various mixtures for environmental exposures similar challenges exist industrial hygienists and riskassessment scientists work to overcome these challenges mortalitymorbidity details of morbidity are available in the history section below age occupational exposures affect persons of working age environmental exposures affect persons of all ages clinical presentation sections organic solvents overview presentation ddx workup treatment medication followup tables references
