specializes in redesigning product delivery systems for fortune 100 companies including controversial clients such as enron to maximize profits mc kinsey’s recommendation to allstate according to berardinelli was to lowball claims so that desperate customers in dire straits would be more likely to accept a settlement offer while allstate continued to make a profit and collect interest on the insurance payment allstate would offer its good hands in the way of a lowball claim and if the customer did not accept to get out boxing gloves 41the book was reviewed by business week magazine 42
