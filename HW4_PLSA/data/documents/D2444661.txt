art philosophy of the study of the nature of art including such concepts as interpretation representation and expression and form it is closely related to aesthetics the philosophical study of beauty and taste distinguishing characteristics the philosophy of art is distinguished from art criticism which is concerned with the analysis and evaluation of particular works of art critical activity may be primarily historical as when a lecture is given on the conventions of the elizabethan theatre in order to explain some of the devices used in shakespeare ’s plays it may be primarily analytical as when a certain passage of poetry is separated into its elements and its meaning or import explained in relation to other passages and other poems in the tradition or it may be primarily evaluative as when reasons are given for saying that the work of art in question is good or bad or better or worse than another one sometimes it is not a single work of art but an entire class of works in a certain style or genre such as pastoral poems or baroque music that is being elucidated and sometimes it is the art of an entire period such as romantic  but in every case the aim of art criticism is to achieve an increased understanding or enjoyment of the work or classes of works of art and its statements are designed to achieve this end the test of the success of art criticism with a given person is has this essay or book of art criticism increased his understanding or enhanced his appreciation of the work of art in question art criticism is particularly helpful and often necessary for works of art that are more than usually difficult so that the average person would be unable adequately to understand or enjoy them if left to himself the task of the philosopher of art is more fundamental than that of the art critic in that the critic’s pronouncements presuppose answers to the questions set by the philosopher of art the critic says that a given work of music is expressive but the philosopher of art asks what is meant by saying that a work of art is expressive and how one determines whether it is in speaking and writing about art the critic presupposes that he is dealing with clear concepts the attainment of which is the task of the philosopher of art the task of the philosopher of art is not to heighten understanding and appreciation of works of art but to provide conceptual foundations for the critic by 1 examining the basic concepts underlying the critic’s activities to enable him to speak and write more intelligibly about the arts and by 2 arriving at true conclusions about art aesthetic value expression and the other concepts that the critic employs upon what does the philosopher of art direct his attention “art” is the ready answer but what is art and what distinguishes it from all other things the theorists who have attempted to answer this question are many and their answers differ greatly but there is one feature that virtually all of them have in common a work of art is a humanmade thing an artifact as distinguished from an object in nature a sunset may be beautiful but it is not a work of art a piece of driftwood may have aesthetic qualities but it is not a work of art since it was not made by a human on the other hand a piece of wood that has been carved to look like driftwood is not an object of nature but of art even though the appearance of the two may be exactly the same this distinction was challenged in the 20th century by artists who declared that objets trouvés “found objects” are works of art since the artist’s perception of them as such makes them so even if the objects were not humanmade and were not modified in any way except by exhibition from their natural state nevertheless according to the simplest and widest definition art is anything that is humanmade within the scope of this definition not only paintings and sculptures but also buildings furniture automobiles cities and garbage dumps are all works of art every change that human activity has wrought upon the face of nature is art be it good or bad beautiful or ugly beneficial or destructive the ordinary usage of the term is clearly less wide in daily life when works of art are spoken of the intention is to denote a much narrower range of objects—namely those responded to aesthetically among the things in this narrower range a distinction although not a precise one is made between fine and useful art fine art consists of those works designed to produce an aesthetic response or that regardless of design function as objects of aesthetic appreciation such as paintings sculptures poems musical compositions—those humanmade things that are enjoyed for their own sake rather than as means to something else useful art has both an aesthetic and a utilitarian dimension automobiles glass tumblers woven baskets desk lamps and a host of other handmade or manufactured objects have a primarily useful function and are made for that purpose but they also have an aesthetic dimension they can be enjoyed as objects of beauty so much so that a person often buys one brand of car rather than another for aesthetic reasons even more than for mechanical reasons of which he may know nothing a borderline case is architecture many buildings are useful objects the aesthetic function of which is marginal and other buildings are primarily objects of beauty the utility of which is incidental or no longer existent greek temples were once places of worship but today their value is entirely aesthetic the test in practice is not how they were intended by their creators but how they function in presentday experience many great works of painting and sculpture for example were created to glorify a deity and not insofar as can be ascertained for an aesthetic purpose to be enjoyed simply in the contemplation of them for their own sake it should be added however that many artists were undoubtedly concerned to satisfy their aesthetic capabilities in the creation of their work since they were highly perfectionistic as artists but in their time there was no such discipline as aesthetics in which they could articulate their goals in any case they chose to create “for the greater glory of god” by producing works that were also worthwhile to contemplate for their own sake this aesthetic sense of the word “art” whether applied to fine art or useful art is the one most employed by the majority of critics and philosophers of art today there are two other senses of “art” however that are still narrower and to avoid confusion their use should be noted 1 sometimes the term “art” is restricted to the visual arts alone or to some of the visual arts but as philosophers of art use the term and as it is used here art is not limited to visual art music and drama and poetry are as much arts as are painting sculpture and architecture 2 sometimes the term “art” is used in a persuasive sense to include only those works considered good art “that’s not art” exclaims the viewer at an art gallery as he examines a painting he dislikes but if the term “art” is to be used without confusion it must be possible for there to be bad art as well as good art the viewer then is not really denying that the work in question is art it is a humanmade object presented to be contemplated for its own sake but only that it is worthwhile the word “art” is also ambiguous in another way it is sometimes used to designate the activity of creating a work of art as in the slogan “art is expression” but it is more often used to designate the product of that process the completed artwork or artifact itself as in the remark “art is a source of great enjoyment to me” there will be occasion later to remark on this ambiguity countless proffered definitions of “art” are not definitions at all but theories about the nature of art that presuppose that the ability to identify certain things in the world as works of art already exists most of them are highly unsatisfactory even as theories “art is an exploration of reality through a sensuous presentation”—but in what way is it an exploration is it always concerned with reality how is music concerned with reality for example “art is a recreation of reality”—but is all art recreation even music it would seem likely that music is the creation of something namely a new set of tonal relationships but not that it is the recreation of anything at all “art is an expression of feeling through a medium”—but is it always an expression  see below art as expression and is it always feeling that is expressed and so on it appears more certain that shakespeare’s king lear is a work of art than that these theories are true all that seems to be required for identifying something as a work of art in the wide sense is that it be not a natural object but something made or transformed by a human being and all that is required for identifying it as art not as good art but as art in the narrower sense is that it function aesthetically in human experience either wholly fine art or in part useful art it is not even necessary as has been shown that it be intended by its creator to function in this way page 1 of 7next page the interpretation of art
