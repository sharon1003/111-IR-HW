blooms taxonomy of educational objectives one of the most widely used ways of organizing levels of expertise is according to blooms taxonomy of educational objectives bloom et al 1994 gronlund 1991 krathwohl et al 1956 blooms taxonomy tables 13 uses a multitiered scale to express the level of expertise required to achieve each measurable student outcome organizing measurable student outcomes in this way will allow us to select appropriate classroom assessment techniques for the course there are three taxonomies which of the three to use for a given measurable student outcome depends upon the original goal to which the measurable student outcome is connected there are knowledgebased goals skillsbased goals and affective goals affective values attitudes and interests accordingly there is a taxonomy for each within each taxonomy levels of expertise are listed in order of increasing complexity measurable student outcomes that require the higher levels of expertise will require more sophisticated classroom assessment techniques the course goal in figure 2student understands proper dental hygieneis an example of a knowledgebased goal it is knowledgebased because it requires that the student learn certain facts and concepts an example of a skillsbased goal for this course might be student flosses teeth properly this is a skillsbased goal because it requires that the student learn how to do something finally an affective goal for this course might be student cares about proper oral hygiene this is an affective goal because it requires that the students values attitudes or interests be affected by the course level of expertise description of level example of measurable student outcome table 1 blooms taxonomy of educational objectives for knowledgebased goals1 knowledge recall or recognition of terms ideas procedure theories etc when is the first day of spring2 comprehension translate interpret extrapolate but not see full implications or transfer to other situations closer to literal translation what does the summer solstice represent3 application apply abstractions general principles or methods to specific concrete situations what would earths seasons be like in specific regions with a different axis tilt4 analysis separation of a complex idea into its constituent parts and an understanding of organization and relationship between the parts includes realizing the distinction between hypothesis and fact as well as between relevant and extraneous variables why are seasons reversed in the southern hemisphere5 synthesis creative mental construction of ideas and concepts from multiple sources to form complex ideas into a new integrated and meaningful pattern subject to given constraints if the longest day of the year is in june why is the northern hemisphere hottest in august6 evaluation to make a judgment of ideas or methods using external evidence or selfselected criteria substantiated by observations or informed rationalizations what would be the important variables for predicting seasons on a newly discovered planet level of expertise description of level example of measurable student outcome table 2 blooms taxonomy of educational objectives for skillsbased goals perception uses sensory cues to guide actions some of the colored samples you see will need dilution before you take their spectra using only observation how will you decide which solutions might need to be diluted set demonstrates a readiness to take action to perform the task or objective describe how you would go about taking the absorbance spectra of a sample of pigments guided response knows steps required to complete the task or objective determine the density of a group of sample metals with regular and irregular shapes mechanism performs task or objective in a somewhat confident proficient and habitual manner using the procedure described below determine the quantity of copper in your unknown ore report its mean value and standard deviation complex overt response performs task or objective in a confident proficient and habitual manner use titration to determine the ka for an unknown weak acid adaptation performs task or objective as above but can also modify actions to account for new or problematic situations you are performing titrations on a series of unknown acids and find a variety of problems with the resulting curves eg only 30 ml of base is required for one acid while 750 ml is required in another what can you do to get valid data for all the unknown acids organization creates new tasks or objectives incorporating learned ones recall your plating and etching experiences with an aluminum substrate choose a different metal substrate and design a process to plate mask and etch so that a pattern of 4 different metals is created level of expertise description of level example of measurable student outcome table 3 blooms taxonomy of educational objectives for affective goals receiving demonstrates a willingness to participate in the activity when im in class i am attentive to the instructor take notes etc i do not read the newspaper instead responding shows interest in the objects phenomena or activity by seeking it out or pursuing it for pleasure i complete my homework and participate in class discussions valuing internalizes an appreciation for values the objectives phenomena or activity i seek out information in popular media related to my class organization begins to compare different values and resolves conflicts between them to form an internally consistent system of values some of the ideas ive learned in my class differ from my previous beliefs how do i resolve this characterization by a value or value complex adopts a longterm value system that is pervasive consistent and predictable ive decided to take my family on a vacation to visit some of the places i learned about in my class to determine the level of expertise required for each measurable student outcome first decide which of these three broad categories knowledgebased skillsbased and affective the corresponding course goal belongs to then using the appropriate blooms taxonomy look over the descriptions of the various levels of expertise determine which description most closely matches that measurable student outcome as can be seen from the examples given in the three tables there are different ways of representing measurable student outcomes eg as statements about students figure 2 as questions to be asked of students tables 1 and 2 or as statements from the students perspective table 3 you may find additional ways of representing measurable student outcomes those listed in figure 2 and in tables 13 are just examples blooms taxonomy is a convenient way to describe the degree to which we want our students to understand and use concepts to demonstrate particular skills and to have their values attitudes and interests affected it is critical that we determine the levels of student expertise that we are expecting our students to achieve because this will determine which classroom assessment techniques are most appropriate for the course though the most common form of classroom assessment used in introductory college coursesmultiple choice testsmight be quite adequate for assessing knowledge and comprehension levels 1 and 2 table 1 this type of assessment often falls short when we want to assess our students knowledge at the higher levels of synthesis and evaluation levels 5 and 64multiplechoice tests also rarely provide information about achievement of skillsbased goals similarly traditional course evaluations a technique commonly used for affective assessment do not generally provide useful information about changes in student values attitudes and interests thus commonly used assessment techniques while perhaps providing a means for assigning grades often do not provide us or our students with useful feedback for determining whether students are attaining our course goals usually this is due to a combination of not having formalized goals to begin with not having translated those goals into outcomes that are measurable and not using assessment techniques capable of measuring expected student outcomes given the levels of expertise required to achieve them using the cia model of course development we can ensure that our curriculum instructional methods and classroom assessment techniques are properly aligned with course goals note that blooms taxonomy need not be applied exclusively after course goals have been defined indeed blooms taxonomy and the words associated with its different categories can help in the goalsdefining process itself thus blooms taxonomy can be used in an iterative fashion to first state and then refine course goals blooms taxonomy can finally be used to identify which classroom assessment techniques are most appropriate for measuring these goals references bloom b s englehart m d furst e j hill w h  krathwohl d r 1956
