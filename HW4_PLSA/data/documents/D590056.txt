likely outcome it took me a long time to discover that all veg or fruit which when cooked have a sweet taste cause me to bloat gassily when i dropped them from my diet altogether for a while then slowly reintroduced as raw only guess what no reaction at all these are called fodmaps and include among many others apples in pies etc carrot corn onion yam and more id suggest you stop all cooked veg for a while and let your system relax and recuperate then start having a tiny bit of only one cooked veg at a time with your meal this means no grains either you will very quickly see what causes the reaction i wd also have loads of trouble with cooked cabbage now i finely chop it salt it a little and wait til the excess liquid seeps out then just eat it raw with olive oil and chopped cilantro and ground pepper or perhaps some other raw salad veg mixed together with it guess what no reactions at all but if i take just 2 teaspoons of any of a long list of fodmap foods i discovered bother me boom all the phenomena return on this site is a great set of lists that you can copypaste and then make notes for yourself on how you react no gas no burps  gone forever just by watching what you eat its the result of sugars accruing in the system that cant be handled by the body httpwwwcassandraforsythecomblogcompletefodmaplistforahappygutview 0 comments add comment1commonsense 4on april 09 2018

the loudest and they also got air stuck in their throat and eventually burp out loudly what specially in public that you got more anxious just burp out la why are you all guys talking about this air

strict gluten free and low sugar for one year but still had the bloating went to a naturopath and she gave me oregano oil capsules after about 3 weeks of those along with a strong probiotic my bloating vanished it was not gradual eitherit literally just was done on that 22nd day amazing i continued the probiotic everyday and tried to keep on eye on my sugarcarb intake it stayed gone for 6 months until i ran out of my probiotic and then about a month after that had a bad sinus infection and broke down and got antibiotics bad no no bloating returned quickly after that did another oregano oil treatment and stayed on my probiotic and it has not returned try the oregano oil to zap the candida overload and then maintain good balance in your gut with a strong probiotic every day i am

about it avoid carbonation and foods that cause gas theres a medical procedure that basically consists of putting a balloon down your throat and blowing it up to stretch out the muscles that are too tight but it has to be redone every year or 2 because the muscles slowly go back to their original position view 0 comments add comment0slr255 70on february 02 2014 at 0759 amsame problem for years i

to sleep it felt like someone was trying to shove a football up out of my stomach and the pain was horrible i found out that too much acid causes the esophageal sphincter to loosen causing heartburn but low stomach acid causes it to tighten i started taking betaine hcl soooooo much better you can read up on how to start with one and add another at every meal the thing is you have to eat it with protein paleo no problem ive gotten up to 22 capsules so far with no warming sensation that signals the last dose was the right one its then supposed to train your stomach to reacquire to ability to make enough acid i spent 20 years trying to burp because of painful trapped gas still not perfect but i have acquired the ability to burp after eating provided i use the supplement and every meal i up the dose it gets better view 0 comments add comment0slr255 70on february 02 2014 at 0759 amsame problem for years i found out that not only did i not have too much acid but all those tumsrolaids

large 0on january 19 2014 at 0220 pmno one has mentioned that this distressing ailment can also be the result of mental tension your gut sphincter might close up in the same way that some peoples hands do when they are under stress you might not think you are under any tension but i bet that in some way you might be i had a very stressful job once and boy did i suffer from the problem then  the first time i had ever known it in my life i hesitate to recommend tranquilliser drugs but i have a horrible feeling that the stress release route a difficult option i know might be the one that offers the most fruitful remedy for this debilitating condition view 0 comments add comment0curious167 0on december 29 2013 at 1034 pmive had the exact same problem all of my life i think i have

burp maybe 1 time a month but it isnt very big and brings no relief i tried the finger down the throat and when i gag i end up swallowing more air than i can expel so that isnt a gear help either about 2 months ago i started taking generic 20mg pepcid twice daily since then i have started burping they arent the huge ones other people can do but it happens often enough that i no longer have that gurgle sound in my throat our as much blasting i dont know if this will work for anyone else but me but i know how crappy this problem is and the box of pills are like 5 bucks so it isnt ahuge loss if it doesnt i cant remember if the burp was immediate or took a few days i hope it helps someoneview 0 comments add comment0tm2 0on august 02 2013 at 0409 pmi have the same problem and its weird

26on february 25 2013 at 0807 amhi thanks for sharing effective post with us bloating is most ordinarily caused by gas in our internal organ surprisingly we have a tendency to manufacture up to four pints of gas daily however it is largely free once we attend the toilet burp or pass wind depending on what you eat what quantity air you swallow and what styles of microorganism youve got in your gut you may produce additional or less gas fiber is vital to your diet salads vegetables cereal etc avoid dairy farm product especially cheese lactaid milk looks to be okay on behalf of me eat little meals or snacks round the bend square measure smart snacks popcorn they have fiber no soda i exploit charcoal to assist gas often however it robs your body of nutrition keep posting

with undigested food some waste material can stick to the wall of intestine and difficult to thrown out from then the stomach problem start like bloating gassy feeling chronic pin etc one good way to cure from such problem is drink plenty of water and eat more fiber fruits which soften the stool view 0 comments add comment0dave35 0on february 16 2013 at 0834 amhi allin the past two years ive had quite a few stomach and esophagus problems which seem to have caused very similar symptoms of air trapped in my stomach i get the sensations of it feeling full bloating pushing up into my throat and making me feel generally sick and kind of anxious first off thanks everyone for this post and comments i will be trying the recommendations now here is the benefit of my experience  my small contribution i have taught myself to burp on demand so i can get some of the stomach air out and releave the bloating i do this by gently tensingsqueezing my stomach muscles just below the stomach in a downward way for some reason this sometimes gets the air out its tricky to explain how to do the downward thing but if you basically thing down it should happen this doesnt always work if the air is really stuck but does sometimes help and may be good to use in combination with the other tips i hope that helps dave view 0 comments add comment0suziestrawberry 0on january 27 2013 at 0703 pmi too physically cant burp the only way i can burp ever is to gag as if im about to be sick not very pleasant as im a lady i have found that nothing works to make me burp all the remedies youve mentioned just make me more bloated and have a huuuuge gagburp instead i hope you find a solution im 24 and currently pregnant it makes heartburn a killer view 0 comments add comment0xarle 5on december 11 2012

261on october 17 2012 at 0906 pmim using betaine too and it helps another remedy i use is to drink a cup of hot water with fresh ginger soon after each meal after that the natural burping starts to prepare the drink use hot water add some grated fresh ginger 12 teaspoons cover the cup with a cloth for 35 minutes no more than that otherwise it gets difficult to drink remove the ginger and drink it hot it helps digesting and so the burping it doesnt make miracles but definitely helps the rest is up to the diet view 1 comment add comment0jess 155on october 17 2012 at 0745 pmtry things that

0149 ami have this issue too but i always thought it was because i was bulimic in my 20s and possibly damaged the valve between my esophagus and stomach i could be wrong but yes its definitely gotten worse as ive aged my main treatment is to avoid getting gas in my stomach in the first place while intestinal gas is in part a byproduct of the bacterial process on your food stomach gas is essentially all swallowed air here are ways that we swallow air and you may know these alreadysipping from strawsslurping hot liquids the slurp draws air in along with the liquid to avoid slurping the liquid must be cool enough that you can place your top lip on it to form a sealdrinking from water bottles the ones with small mouthschewing gum sucking on candies smoking wearing illfitting dentureseating too fast talking while eating and really talking period though a hard one to avoidbeing stressed  a big one for me took me a while to realizesalad  hard to eat without swallowing air i still eat it but i walk around afterwards to try to get a burp out or i sip some warm water or eat dark chocolate to help me burp more on that belowsmoothies  they whip air into a liquid too airy for mecarbonated drinks  no mystery theregiving oral sex for me at least  was that tmi in terms of getting a good burp out some things ive found that help  ive read that chocolate relaxes the esophageal valve which makes it easier to burp i do find i burp after some chocolate im told apple peel has the same effect the pectin i think  sip some warm water  warm water with baking soda in it  walk around  rub your own back and stomach i would love to hear others burp tips because a stuck burp is just beyond uncomfortable view 0 comments add comment0cd 26217on september 18 2012 at 1020 pmdo you still

to this apparently they just dont get it maybe i can help clear things up i have had this issue for as long as i can remember and finally got my stomach scoped last year it was explained to me that you have a sphincter yes i just said sphincter most people have one in their esophagus that enables them to do this whole swallowing air thing that makes no sense to us thats because we are incapable of it as well as pushing it out and controlling the gurgling i describe it as a lava lamp of burps going up and down and up and down it hurts people it makes us feel nauseous and it really really fucking sucks you people are such dicks for saying such stupid closeminded stuff and stupid too because you just keep answering as if the problem doesnt exist grrrr anyway enough with those aholes heres what helps to calm it milk ice cream especially like a flurry or blizzard type thing with like cookie dough for some reason hot chocolate is a big one sometimes and i know it doesnt make sense but eating acidic foods like dill pickles will push the burps down but tums and antacids and all that have no purpose for us think of it as your burp chamber has a broken door it doesnt open or close tight and leaks air all the time view 0 comments add comment1jolean 10on july 16 2013 at 1155 amwho are these people who are making fun of people who cannot burp karma will get you because not being
