networking basics tcp udp tcpip and osi model by stelios antoniou on october 10 2011learn something new take control of your career sign up the transmission control protocolinternet protocol tcpip suite was created by the u s department of defense do d to ensure that communications could survive any conditions and that data integrity wouldnt be compromised under malicious attacks the open systems interconnection basic reference model osi model is an abstract description for network protocol design developed as an effort to standardize networking in this article i will present the differences between the do d and the osi models and then provide details about the do ds version of tcpip i will also describe the protocols used at the various layers of the do d model and provide you with the details of tcp and udp protocols throughout this article you will find useful information concerning the protocol suite of the century tcpip so if youre preparing for your ccent or ccna exams or if youre just interested in networking this is one article you dont want to miss fasten your seat belts and have a good ridetcpip and the osi model comparison lets start by comparing tcpip and the osi models the tcpip model is basically a shorter version of the osi model it consists of four instead of seven layers despite their architectural differences both models have interchangeable transport and network layers and their operation is based upon packetswitched technology the diagram below indicates the differences between the two models application layer the application layer deals with representation encoding and dialog control issues all these issues are combined together and form a single layer in the tcpip model whereas three distinctive layers are defined in the osi model hosttohost hosttohost protocol in the tcpip model provides more or less the same services with its equivalent transport protocol in the osi model its responsibilities include application data segmentation transmission reliability flow and error control internet again internet layer in tcpip model provides the same services as the osis network layer their purpose is to route packets to their destination independent of the path taken network access the network access layer deals with all the physical issues concerning data termination on network media it includes all the concepts of the data link and physical layers of the osi model for both lan and wan media the diagram below shows clearly the way tcpip protocol suite relates to the tcpip model hosttohost layer protocols two protocols transmission control protocol tcp and user datagram protocol udp are defined for transmitting datagrams we will look at the details of both these protocols as well as their interaction with the upper layer transmission control protocol tcptcp is connectionoriented in the sense that prior to transmission end points need to establish a connection first tcp protocol data units are called segments the sending and receiving tcp entities exchange data in the form of segments which consist of a fixed 20byte header followed by a variable size data field tcp is responsible for breaking down a stream of bytes into segments and reconnecting them at the other end retransmitting whatever might be lost and also organizing the segments in the correct order the segment size is restricted by the maximum transfer unit mtu of the underlying link layer technology mtu is generally 1500 bytes which is the maximum payload size of the ethernet the image below shows the tcp segment format the most important fields are explained further on source port and destination port fields together identify the two local end points of the particular connection a port plus its hosts ip address forms a unique end point ports are used to communicate with the upper layer and distinguish different application sessions on the host the sequence number and acknowledgment number fields specify bytes in the byte stream the sequence number is used for segment differentiation and is useful for reordering or retransmitting lost segments the acknowledgment number is set to the next segment expected data offset or tcp header length indicates how many 4byte words are contained in the tcp header the window field indicates how many bytes can be transmitted before an acknowledgment is received the checksum field is used to provide extra reliability and security to the tcp segment the actual user data are included after the end of the header lets have a look at how a tcp segment is captured by ethereal network analyzer the image below shows a requestresponse message sequence carried over tcp notice the fields discussed above source port destination port sequence number acknowledgement number window size and checksum user datagram protocol udpudp protocol consists of fewer fields compared to tcp the reason for that is because certain data types do not require reliable delivery and extra overhead realtime traffic for example needs to be transported in an efficient way without error correction and retransmission mechanisms udp is considered to be a connectionless protocol it leaves reliability to be handled by the application layer all it cares about is fast transmission the udp segment format is presented in the diagram below lets see how a udp segment is captured by ethereal notice the small header size which one should you use choosing the right transport protocol to use depends on the type of data to be transferred for information that needs reliability sequence transmission and data integrity  tcp is the transport protocol to use for data that require realtime transmission with low overhead and less processing  udp is the right choice the following table summarizes the keycharacteristics of each one of these protocols keep them in mind when choosing the transport protocol for your data ready to test your skills in tcpip see how they stack up
