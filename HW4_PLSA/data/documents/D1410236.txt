few days the top nails were slowly peeling off and my nail has been healthier since june 25 2017  1241pmreply flag as offensive this comment improved my health changed my life saved my life anonymous it happened the same to me now but my mom said its common some people have this happening because either something heavy fell on it but for me its just popping of from the back without any reason at first i was a little scared but asked my mom and she said it was common cause it happened to her too but according to her something fell on it but for me it popped without any reason may 30 2017

the bone needed stitches because i busted the toe open and obviously i lost my toenail the shape of my toe hasnt been the same since and i needed a nail bordering procedure done after the nail started coming back ingrown anyway the nail started growing back thick and weird and eventually there was a giant ridge in the nail separating thin normal nail and the thick and gross part the thick part has started breaking away but it is stubbornly hanging on tonight i was able to lift it enough to see nail underneath its totally weird i guess i started growing two nails after my busted nail was removed but the top one eventually stopped and is just stuck to the bottom nail now im hoping itll fall off eventually or grow out enough to trim it away and that maybe it wont happen again november 26 2016

you may be referred to a dermatologist better to be safe and have this checked out especially because you are having pain when you cut the toenail please keep us updated maryann november 8 2016  1000amreply flag as offensive this comment improved my health changed my life saved my life anonymous only i have thick toe nails and found out there is another nail underneath they suggested vicks vapor rub on toes nightly and the top one came off very nicely it grew normal for a long time but then hitting it repeatedly over time caused it to happen again so here i go again same treatment vicks vapor rub and socks at night until it clears up again good luck please look it up june 10 2016  926amreply flag as offensive this comment improved my health changed my life saved my life1anonymous reply to anonymous onlythanks so much this really helped me july 10 2017  344pmreply flag as offensive this comment improved my health changed my life saved my life anonymous this has been a big help my right foot pinky toe has a bit of an overlap of my toenail my mom is always telling me i have to cut it off and that its an infection i tell her every time that i got it when i was little i hit my toe on the refrigerator and my toenail broke i think its my toenail trying to grow back im also embarrassed to get a pedicure because every time i go the ladies always try to pick off the toenail but it doesnt come off they always ask me and i get skeptical to get my toes done or to do them at home thanks again anyway february 7 2016  313pmreply flag as offensive this comment improved my health changed my life saved my life anonymous i just had this thing happen i think a month ago i saw my toenail lifting up and im like wtf so going by my way of let it be and itll go away i left it there until it turned a nasty shade of opaque yellowish white i tried to cut it to where i figured it ended but i still could lift it up warning disgusting content ahead so i used my teeth to rip the whole toenail out strange thing was it didnt hurt but there was a bit of blood only later did i find out that i had another toenail growing under the top one october 12 2015  629amreply flag as offensive this comment improved my health changed my life saved my life anonymous i have this problem and what i have done was cut the nail from the cuticle if it is sticking up from the new nail that is growing in i also used pointy curved tweezers to lift under the nail and cut sooner or later the tweezer hit skin and thats when i stopped i waited a couple weeks and every once in a while i put a bandaid to make sure nothing got inside the nail after a couple weeks i looked at my nail again and a little more grew so i cut what i could off i repeated this process until the top nail is gone hopefully this works for you august 27 2015  1139pmreply flag as offensive this comment improved my health changed my life saved my life1 2 3 4 5 6 7 next  add a comment
