can i start lessons on a keyboard a the simple answer is yes  though we do not recommend it while you can learn basic notes and rhythms on a keyboard you will not be able to develop the proper musculature to play a piano you will also lack the necessary control over loud and soft sounds that pianists call “proper technique” it is like learning to drive a car with a golf cart  the controls may be in the same place but you have none of the same feel nationwide 80 of students who begin on keyboards get frustrated and quit within the first year of piano study q what kind of keyboard is best a in recent years the roland corporation producer of fine handcrafted digital pianos since the 1970s has begun to build models that are affordable on any budget before wasting money on a temporary keyboard that will do nothing to help your student develop as a musician explore the affordable  yet lessons appropriate  roland discount digital pianos q what should my keyboard have on it a portable keyboards come in three basic sizes 61 note 76 note and 88 note if you want the most realistic playing experience you should find an 88note keyboard pianos have 88 keys with fullsized piano keys a gravity hammer action and a sustain pedal most portable keyboards will come with at least 100 different instrument sounds and some drum rhythm options these can be fun for the kids but will

way to tell if your keyboard piano or digital piano has “fullsized” keys is to do the “dollar bill test” simply remove a dollar bill from your wallet and lay it down on one of the white keys lengthwise – parallel to the key the key should run from one end of the dollar bill the end pressed against the felt at the hilt of the key to the end of the ink on the other end of the dollar bill q what does “weighted key” mean a a weighted key action is designed to provide more resistance than the standard “organ touch” portable keyboards keyboards with weighted keys more closely simulate the gravity hammer action of a grand piano and thus are better to learn on new developments in digital piano technology have produced a gravity hammer action that is even more similar to a grand pianos touch these are the ultimate choice for digital piano buyers q what is a sustain pedal a sometimes called the “damper pedal” the sustain pedal is the first pedal on the right of a piano or digital piano and sometimes the only pedal on a keyboard when depressed a pianos sustain pedal lifts the dampers off the strings so they continue to ring typically students begin using this pedal in lessons within the first year of study q what about a digital piano a a digital piano sometimes referred to as a “clavinova” is an acceptable choice for beginning lessons most digital pianos include recording options additional instruments and onboard learning software digital pianos are popular because they allow students to record themselves play using headphones or create their own music …and since they never need tuning they are great for apartments houses with little or no climate control and school labs q how much do digital pianos cost a digital pianos range in price from about 600 to 20000 most firsttime buyers will select a digital piano in the 1500  3500 range it is always better to spend a few extra dollars up front than to start with a poor quality instrument that will not motivate your student q which is better a digital piano or a used piano a that depends on the quality of a used piano and on the interests of the player good quality used pianos that are properly tuned and adjusted are extremely hard to find more often than not preowned pianos have not received the care and maintenance they need bringing them up to par can be costly digital pianos offer more variety headphones and no maintenance fees since they are always in tune thus if a player prefers the sound touch and look of an acoustic piano a good used piano will be ideal if he or she wants to play with background song files record or practice privately with headphones a digital piano might be the best option as with any instrument the most important thing here is to find the right tool to keep the player interested the choice is often highly individual q how much do new pianos cost a pianos range in price as vastly as do cars there are a number of poor quality new pianos today that are very inexpensive however on average a good quality “starter piano” should cost around 3000 then based on size color sound and style preferences your new piano could range between 3000 and 90000 a huge
