the sciences how does sewage treatment work sewage treatment turns out to be a somewhat less nasty business than you probably thought by scott huler on july 5 2010credit Â©i stockphotocomryan scott the guy running the snake down our sewer looks matteroffact our sewage has been backing up right next to the pipe connecting our house to the sewer line running down our street stands a 70yearold willow oak and i worry the trees roots have found their way during the droughty past year into our line he shrugs maybe its tree roots maybe its a collapsed pipe maybe its a yoyo the snake went in only a dozen feet or so and found a clog and now the little claw at the end is spinning once he pulls it out well know better whats going on i leave him to his business though i cast an annoyed glance at the oak sewer pipes fit together simply with a bell joint and tiny root hairs find their way to the nutrientrich flow then grow larger eventually growing large enough to shatter the vitreous clay pipe that forms so many service lines or dislodge a joint if the pipes are cast iron nobody knows what our pipes 70 years old are made of but i fear were about to find out fifteen minutes later hes winding the snake back up writing a bill and exonerating the oak do you have a baby he asks we do do you use those flushable wipes we do dont he says the entire paper industry in recent years has worked to develop more and more flushable items baby wipes moist adult wipes antibacterial bathroom scrubbers diaper liners diapers he shakes his head if it doesnt come apart in your hands dont flush it all it has to do is hold its form for an hour or so and it can find a place to catch a joint a root a pimple on the inside of the pipe one of the little mounds of rust buildup called tubercules then like a snag in a river it starts catching other stuff and youve got yourself a situation either for you or for your whole neighborhood were like a nation of 1yearolds throwing everything in the toilet toilet paper and what comes out of you he says thats what should go in the toilet take the goldfish outside and bury it otherwise the best case is its just going to get caught in a screen at the treatment plant it wont biodegrade on the way down and it might cause trouble and lets not even bring up those garbage disposalswe had had another guy out 6 months before and he excavated enough of a neatly processed carrot that with sufficient patience we could have reconstructed it the sewer person after person tells me is for sewage your favorite pop culture reference to sewage may involve art carney in character as ed norton singing together we stand with shovel in hand to keep things rolling along or maybe its one of those scenes from phantom of the opera or les mis with all kinds of french high drama occurring amid the atmospheric flow i prefer carl spackler in caddyshack cackling while creating plastic explosive animals against a backdrop of sacks of the common golfcourse fertilizer milorganite you scarcely notice it but ill decode that milorganite is short for milwaukee organic nitrog en a soil treatment produced by the city of milwaukees wastewater treatment plant since 1925 and now used on lawns all over the country its the end result of their sewage treatment and they ship thousands of tons of it each year the point isnt so much that what happens to our sewage reaches into every crevice of our culture the point is that once youre managing it instead of wishing it away sewage turns out to be a pretty good thing in the north carolina state archives in raleigh just hanging around atop some cabinets lies an extra set of 4footsquare planning maps made in 1922the first planning documents in raleighs history they make great idletime study locations of fires in buildings one of a series of preliminary zoning studies says one another shows the water distribution system a 16inch and a 14inch line coming from the pumping station down by walnut creek to the city water tower another shows hardsurface paving a fourth demonstrates barriers to street extensions and residential and commercial growth by far my favorite is sewer mains and laterals with thick coloredpencil stripes in brown blue and yellow showing the locations of different sizes of underground sewer pipesstarting from 6inch diameters in neighborhoods like mine to the largest mains back then 24 inches what i love about the map is the outfallsat crabtree creek north of town and walnut creek to the south safely downstream from the pump that brings drinking water to the city the coloredpencil stripes simply stop thats where the sewage goes into the river those days seem almost absurdly quaint now but theyre not so bygone after all in 1940 in some of the largest cities in the united statesboston pittsburgh cincinnati st louis kansas cityevery drop of whatever you flushed down the toilet was dumped untreated into a nearby harbor river or lake new york city in 1940 treated approximately one quarter of its sewage and it reached 100 percent only in 1986 until then had you visited your aunt louise on the upper west side all your business would have flowed directly into the hudson historians estimate that before indoor plumbing became widespread the average person used less than 5 gallons of water per day nowadays a good round and low estimate of american athome water consumption is 100 gallons per day per person some of that gets sprinkled on lawns and a bit washes cars and pets but overall we use that water either for cleaning ourselves and our dishes and clothes in which cases it ends up going down the drain or for drinking in which cases it ends up going down the toilet every day each one of us turns 100 gallons or so of water into sewage thats a lot of sewage requiring a lot of treatmentand very little of it is poop at least now we do treat it though people have been piping sewage for thousands of years actual sewage treatment is barely a century old people had to figure out first that human waste was not just noisome but actually unhealthy and then how it was unhealthy before they could begin figuring out what to do with it once they did they got busy in a hurry you can all but drink most of the water that comes out of western treatment plants and most of the biosolids removed during the process are used to fertilize crops and treat soil the system is not flawlessbiosolids sometimes contaminate water grease clogs cause sewage spills or system failures heavy metals pharmaceuticals and personal care products build up in biosolidsbut overall it works splendidly perhaps the first written sanitation instructions come from the bible which written by and for a nomadic people takes a smallisbeautiful approach deuteronomy urges you to dig a hole and cover that which cometh from thee by about 3000 bc inhabitants of the orkney islands had invented toilets existing stone hut walls from that period have little niches with holes that drained to underground channels the sewer historian jon schladweiler says that by a thousand years later civilizations throughout the ancient mediterranean and middle east were using pipes to transmit both stormwater and human wastewater away from homes and cities and usually into waterways by about 1500 bc the cretan palace of knossos had an actual flush toileta seat a pan and a slave to pour water to sluice what disposablediaper companies call the insult to a drain in the floor cretan techniques for channeling water and wastewater spread throughout greece and by the 5th century bc athenians were piping wastewater and stormwater to a reservoir outside of town and using it to irrigate crops the romans improved on even that after considering romes many accomplishments pliny the elder called the sewers the greatest accomplishment of all the word sewer comes from the latin exaquare to carry away water the constant flow of water coming into the city from the aqueducts supplied public fountains and baths and romans figured out that public bathwater ought to be changed a couple of times a day they built public latrine buildings immediately adjacent to the baths schladweiler says and flushed the latrines by routing the used bathwater under them the majority of human waste though was simply thrown into the streets aqueduct water was used to wash the streets and sweep that waste into the drains because roman sewers lacked ventilation the only egress for sewer gas was those same drains and latrines on the plus side romans also invented portable toilets setting urns by the side of the road near the entrances to the city vendors would rent you what schladweiler calls a modesty cape further the 1stcentury emperor vespasian had workers collect the contents of urinals which he then taxed and sold to fullers tradesmen who cleaned and dyed the romans clothingthey had figured out that the ammonia in urine had cleaning powers after the fall of the empire romans kept throwing filth in the streets but nobody was washing them in rome many sewer pipes fell into disrepair everywhere else people got along without them as they always had at best using latrines unlined pits or cesspits pits lined with perforated masonry that let liquids drain away into the soil while solids piled up for eventual removal and at worst throwing their waste into the streets and leaving it there in the 13th century the french king philip ii paved the streets of paris to reduce the stench with the result that afterward the waste sat on the stones instead of percolating into the soil in the 14th century one of his successors philip vi ordered parisians to sweep in front of their houses and take the refuse to a dump crews of sanitation workers were organized to clean up whatever was left in a return to the technology of the roman empire in 1370 paris opened a series of drainage canals that also carried wastethe biggest was lined with masonry and called the grand egout or great drain by the 16th century one british royal castle had to post signs reminding people not to foul the staircases corridors or closets with urine or other filth when the palace of versailles opened in the 17th century it had lovely splashing fountains but no bathrooms or sewers the world changed in 1842 when the city of hamburg after suffering a terrible fire decided to lay sewer pipes while rebuilding the new pipes vented through house drains and had a mechanism for flushing using tidewater the system was efficient didnt stink and became a worldwide model before the introduction of these sewers typhoid transmitted through water tainted by sewage caused 485 of every 1000 deaths in hamburg after the sewers came into use the number dropped by half immediately thereafter the parisians began turning their 14thcentury sewer system into a wonder of the world building hundreds of miles of huge brick tunnels to carry away stormwater and everything else parisians cared to sluice inside when early american cities such as boston and philadelphia began paving their streets with cobblestones in the 17th century guttersand even some underground sewerswere included among the improvements private citizens built bostons first systems designed like the cloaca maxima and the grand egout to drain cellars and swamps bostonians soon grew weary of the constant repairs those wooden sewer lines required and undertook a sort of publicprivate partnership by issuing construction permits for sewers everyone who wished to connect a drain had to share in the cost and the contracts stipulated requirements about pavement reconstruction philadelphia had a system of culverts and some underground sewers by 1750 and new york city started putting a few sewers underground later in the century human waste though remained mostly a personal matter of cesspits and privies sewers really took off in 1854 with john snows discovery that the london cholera epidemic was caused by sewagetainted drinking water with advances in microbiology people began to understand that human waste carried disease in the form of microbes and increasingly they wanted to protect themselves from their sewage whats more the introduction of reliable water service in the 19th century and the spread of the modern flush toilet the british public health act of 1848 which required every home to have some kind of sanitary arrangement listed water closet as one of the alternatives to an ash pit or privy vastly increased the amount of wastewater households generated cesspits and privies that had already created offensive nuisances now produced vast vilesmelling seepages overwhelmed by the new volume of water and it wasnt just toilets eitherconnections draining sinks and tubs began overwhelming sewer pipes too in 1844 boston tried to slow the tide literally by passing a law requiring a doctors order for every bath as cities grew in size and density during the industrial revolution they all had to build more and better sewers the cholera epidemic wasnt motivation enough for london but the great stink of 1858 when the thames smelled so bad that parliament considered relocating got the city governments attention it built new sewers in the 1850s and 60s to carry waste downstream from central london brooklyn introduced sewers in 1857 and chicago not long after boston still largely building sewers privately had about 100 miles of sewers in 1869 by 1885 that had expanded to 226 miles and new houses were expected to connect to the system both for pump and washbasin waste and for the human waste now going into flush toilets instead of privies every city had its own problems and its own characteristics some of bostons sewers had outfalls dammed by the tide 12 hours of every 24 others built by unscrupulous contractors in land reclamation projects like the back bay sagged and lost their downhill slope causing settling clogs and backups sylvan seattle had pipes made of wooden stavesand faced a tide problem so severe that at certain times of day toilets became foul geysers eventually the city simply rebuilt itself higher than its sewer pipes in chicago the outfalls of the sewers made such a mess of lake michigan that during large rainstorms the plume of tainted water flowed all the way out to the intake for the water system in response engineers built a series of canals and reversed the flow of the chicago river turning it from a drainage into lake michigan into a flow from lake michigan toward the mississippi they also moved the intake farther out into the lake all these solutions merely moved the problem as one historian said in describing bostons covering a brook filled with sewage and routing it to the charles river rather than directly into boston harbor this somewhat lessened the nuisance caused by it or at least transferred it to another locality older cities on the coasts built combined systems channeling both sewage and stormwater whereas newer and smaller cities built separate systemsboth storm drains and systems of much smaller pipes that handled only sewagethus preventing sewage overflows in storms lennox massachusetts built the first such system in 1875 and memphis built one in 1880 since then thats what everybody has built raleigh laid its first sewer pipes in 1890 fayetteville street raleighs main road wasnt paved until 1886 at exactly the same time the first water pipes were being laid where water pipes go sewer pipes soon follow the privies of raleighs population of barely 10000 almost certainly had not yet polluted the soil enough to foul its wells and the new sewer pipes running north to crabtree creek and south to walnut creek would not have discharged more than the streams could absorb a stream running at about 6 cubic feet per second can absorb the waste of about 1000 people so to support 10000 people the two creeks together would have had to flow at around 60 cfs currently on a dry day in a dry month they flow at about 75 cfs now with 2300 miles of pipes all heading roughly southeast to raleighs wastewater treatment plant the sewer collection system turns out to be the only infrastructure stream that follows that natural tree pattern that id expected to find everywhere the leaves are houses connected by 4inch service lines to 6 or 8inch mains that run mostly beneath streets and then to 18 24 or 30inch collectors that start out along streets but head downhill to creek basins leading to larger and larger pipes and finally to the plant i sat down with a friendly gis expert to check it out the gis map easily showed me the path of my own wastewater the 4inch lateral in my yardthe same pipe that flushable wipe cloggedruns into an 8inch main which heads downhill along my street until it crosses the pigeon house branch down by the pool i like to sit by it runs along the pigeon house until it joins a 24inch pvc east of town the path is following rivers by then not roads and thereafter joins larger and larger pipessome made of pvc some of reinforced concrete some of ductile iron eventually this stream hits the dual 72inch reinforced concrete pipes that head directly to the sewer plant though those sometimes separate into three or four pipes for ease of maintenance its simple and especially after the spaghetti tangle of the water lines rather satisfying its much like the stormwater system if every ravine in every drainage basin remained piped and they all came together in one place before entering the neuse to find out what happens in these pipes i talked to raleighs dean of pipage sewer collection superintendent hunter gene stanley were not like new york city stanley says right off some of those you can drive a truck through new york has a combined sewer system that has to be prepared to move the billions of gallons of water that a major storm could dump on the city not just the comparative trickle of sewage the city generates daily combined systems manage overflows with relatively simple mechanical junctions called regulators basically weir dams in pipes or junction boxes a weir is nothing more than a low barrier for steering water when flow is routine the dam routes it through pipes to the treatment plant during large rain events the flow of mixed stormwater and wastewater rises high overtops the weirs and flows directly through outfalls to rivers or lakes such an event is called a cso or combined sewage overflow new york dumps about 40 billion gallons of csos into its rivers and harbors every year but before you draw too much comfort from raleighs system having to convey only sewage the plant treats about 45 million gallons per day that are generated by the 400000 or so customers connected to the system its rated for 60 million gallons and its being expanded to 75 consider this the increase in flow caused by nothing more than rainfall and street flow coming in through manhole vents in lowlying areas can nearly double the flow to the treatment plant really oh yeah oh yeah stanley says a thousand gallons a day per manhole if it rains all day add in leaky joints cracks and holes made by thirsty tree roots and you can have significant water infiltration during rainstorms though catching and correcting the breaks and overflows are an unavoidable part of his job stanley stays focused on preventive maintenance stanley grew up in rural north carolina and has called his preventive maintenance management an ol country boy work systemhe copies pages from the map book of his system and gives them to his crews when the crew has flushed and inspected every line on the map it comes back the department logs its maintenance in feet per day and it likes to reach 300000 feet per month if it can meaning that every pipe in the system gets a looksee once every few years gis keeps the maps updated of course but stanleys system has been working since they were using nothing more than blueprints and asbuilt surveys finding that whats an 8inch pipe on the map is really a 6inch is just part of keeping on top of things thats why you carry differentsize saw blades in your truck stanley says a sewer is a simple thing the pipe needs to drop about half a foot per 100 feet of length a slope of 05 percent which is fast enough to keep everything moving but not so fast that the liquid races away from the solids bigger pipes30 inches or largercan slope even less but they all must flow downhill powered by gravity which is why sewer pipes so commonly crisscross the stormwater drainages raleigh public utilities department director dale crisp calls all the sewers that run in a particular drainage a sewershed which for a while became my favorite new word of course if wastewater pipes followed only natural gullies the mains would eventually have to parallel the river and for many reasons from aesthetics to the catastrophic results of a spill nobody wants that the system generally moves downhill but pipes sometimes need to cross rises so the city has more than 100 lift stations where the contents of pipes are pumped to join other flows or where wastewater from lowlying areas collects in sumps when the water gets high enough it trips a float valve and a pump clicks on and lifts it up a hillkind of like your toilet only this float valve starts the flush instead of stopping it i visited one lift station a 10 by 20foot rectangle of electrical boxes that look like a central airconditioning system behind chainlink fences between two houses controlling an underground sump even when its pumping if you were more than 10 feet away you wouldnt hear it the station has a backup pump and a generator to power it plus a little antenna to send information back and forth to the supervisory control and data acquisition scada system at the treatment plant thats plenty of equipment but just the same if you werent looking for it you wouldnt know it was there a much larger station sits on the trunk line giving a lift to pretty much all of raleighs waste on its way to the plant its underneath a highway onramp and though some people suggested i could find it by following my nose it didnt smell when i went out to visit it stanley hands over a laudatory profile of raleighs sewer maintenance department in a recent issue of municipal sewer and water magazine then hands me off to robert smith a sewer monitoring supervisor and asks him to show me around first things first we walk the yard checking out trucks sewer guys basically do three things they perform maintenance they respond to crises and they tv pipes sending tiny little vehicles with cameras on them up the pipes to check both their condition as part of general maintenance and whether the crews who claim to have recently maintained them have actually done so smith shows off the departments various trucks rodder trucks have a spool of linked rods a sort of long chain that the workers feed into a manhole and then rotate just like someone cleaning roots or a clog out of your drain at home some rodders have cutting blades or spiral grabbing implements to clear roots or debris flushing trucks carry enormous water tanks to feed highpressure hoses with spinning heads on the end workers feed the hose into the system usually past the next manhole and then turn on a pump water pressure starts the head spinning spraying water at thousands of pounds of pressure per square inch back toward the truck as the truck pulls back the hose scouring the pipes along the way standard now is the combination truck which carries tanks of water for flushing and a garbagetrucksize tank for postflush water which the truck vacuums up with a huge tube that hangs from a derrick over the cab like an elephants trunk the driver eventually empties that tank onto a pad in the parking area smith explains water drains off into the sewer system and the cleanedout debristampons bricks gravel roots supposedly flushable materialsgets loaded into a dump truck once a week and sent to the landfill smith marshals those vacuum trucks when raleigh has a sewage overflow too another truck he calls a blockbuster has a water hammera pipe that uses water to rhythmically pound and break up large blockages finally he shows me a sort of soupedup golf cart that provides access to the many parts of the system that because they follow ravines rather than roads are not easily reached by regular trucks but were standing in a parking lot while people are out in the field rodding sewers hey he says you wanna shoot the line you bet our first stop is a highway offramp where two flush trucks and a pickup are parked behind orange cones several men wearing hard hats green mesh vests and rubberpalmed gloves manage a hose coming off a spool on the back of one of the trucks and running to a manhole 20 feet down a steep ravine a hundred yards away two guys stand at another manhole looking out for the spinning head of the water jet which smith says is called a warthog once its past the guys still at the truck turn on the jet and the spool to start reeling it back in over the roar of the truck engine smith explains that on the way out the head sprays as a sort of presoak on the way back its like a broom waterjet cleaning like this is standard for clearing roots grit and especially grease we run into some lines where you think where in the world did all this grease come from it looks like you sprayed foam on that pipe because the bellandspigot joints in sewer pipes provide places for tiny tree roots to enter and because trees got very thirsty during the drought crews commonly run a saw through the line after cleaning just to make sure theyve got everything where the vacuum trucks cant reach a manhole the crew flushes debris downstream to one the truck can reach thats sewer flushing and the sanitation department does it all day long ever since the hamburg sewers first captured tidal water and then released it all at once to flush out debris the basic idea hasnt changed much you use water to flush you use rods or hooks to attack clogs and as ed norton sang you keep things rolling along smith packs us back in his pickup and we drive to a parking lot and a box truck with a picture of a fish on it the three guys in the truck are going to tv a pipe mike is preparing the camera and the screens in the back of the truck while wayne and someone who introduces himself only as the rev open the manhole popping the cover off easily with a metal hook wayne and the rev then retrieve the camera from the truck with six tiny rubber wheels and an inquisitive single eye it looks a bit like the mars rover vehicle only tiny and dangling at the end of a wire when they come back to the manhole wayne and the rev are shocked to find it suddenly filled with sewage this kind of backup indicates a block in the 6inch pipe at the bottom of the manhole though it drains away as fast as it backed up a few moments of observation shows two things the backup comes and goes rhythmically meaning theres a pump station upstream that sends a pulse of wastewater every couple of minutes and the blockage is a bunch of pieces of some solid substance that nobody can identify out come spoonshooked perforated shovels on the end of 12foot handles wayne robert smith and eddie another supervisor who has arrived take turns scooping pushing things back and forth between rushes from the pump and pulling them out with an awkward handoverhand motion that keeps the gunk barely balanced on the edge of the spoon unless you knock the handle against an overhanging tree branch its like using an icedtea spoon to fish olive pits out of a bleach jug at the back of a cupboard and people think its tydbol that keeps their bathrooms clean wayne says the stuff turns out to be congealed grease and pieces of it are sufficiently solidand sufficiently far up the 6inch pipethat they block the progress of the camera every time the rev dangles it down there and tries to get it running the vacuum nozzle can clear the manhole but cant pull grease out of the pipe and it resists everything else theyve got so the crew finally gives up on tving that pipe for the day until they can clean the pipepossibly by using a bucket truck which feeds a cable past the debris and drags a bucket from one manhole to the next pulling before it the kind of grit and large debris flushing just doesnt get or possibly by sending someone down there in the hope that a simple scoop into the pipe will clear the debris sending someone down a manhole though its only about 8 feet deep requires confined spaces training extra supervision and ventilation equipmentsewer gas contains methane and hydrogen sulfide and it has killed workers as recently as 2008 smith shows me video footage from another tving expedition that shows long traverses down shiny pipes half full of dull gray water the color makes sensemuch more of it comes from your washing machine and shower than from your toilet first thing people say is eew smith says they think im walking around in feces but even the wastewater filling up the manhole that day smelled more like runoff than poop though most blockages are caused by grease or roots the talk naturally turns to memorable clogs and i hear about mops golf clubs firewood riprap and even a refrigerator that have had to be pulled out of manholes once a carpet remnant created a block so nasty it took most of a day to clear out if youre on call and someone calls in a spill especially one where the overflow is making its way toward a waterway then its showtime you go running after it like its a russian spy wayne says you chase the spill pulling hose four five six miles first the crew finds the end of the spill in the waterwaywhere the water is still cleanand sets up a block using hay bales which both dam the flow and filter any water that might trickle through a pump immediately starts channeling the polluted water into the nearest downstream manhole and while a crew works on clearing the clog itself other crews chase the spill hosing down the sides and bottom of the stream you can tell when untreated wastewater has hit a stream smith says by the powderylooking buildup it leaves it looks like gray dust in the water coating the rocks and sticks the hoses clear the scum off the bottom and stir up the mud that muddy water acts like a glue to that stuffit piggybacks on the mud then you pump it out at the end of the spill after we go through that creek looks like nothing ever hit it its pretty neat one day i pulled over on a main highway to watch a sewer crew fix a leaky pipe using whats called curedinplace pipe a long liner impregnated with resin is pushed into a pipe by water then they pump steam through the pipe to harden the resin and prestothe pipe is though slightly narrower all but new the crew runs an auxiliary pipe while they fix the leaky one workers can find leaks by stopping up pipes with sandbags pumping smoke down a manhole and then seeing where the smoke starts creeping out of the ground clearly people have thought about this stuff a lot it gets in your blood said a senior engineer and inspector named dave who managed a construction site near my house i had stopped by a sewer truck to watch a couple of guys hose out a pipe which they followed to a manhole at the backyard boundary of a few properties i dont like the looks of that one had said when spooning out grit from the hole he unearthed pieces of clay pipe rather than dig on several peoples private property the city decided to abandon the line running between the houses and reroute the flow to the end of the street where it could join a larger main and head downhill but since the flow had to go downhill the engineers had to get wastewater to flow away from the manhole in a different direction that meant simply digging a deeper trench in the direction they wanted it to go they had to do the same thing on the line that received the new flow so they were digging on two streets for a few weeks and i occasionally stopped by i watched them carefully lower new green pvc pipes and check the slope they use a laser to measure with a sort of bullseye target at the end the red dot right in the center means the pipe has the right slope we used to run string lines length by length dave told me this makes it easier a lot easier they lay pipe on a bed of gravel supporting it with rocks and pieces of brick to maintain the slope unlike water pipe which under pressure can just be laid in a trench and buried any pipe below 12 feet has to be ductile iron to support the weight of the earth on top same with any pipe that crosses a creekbed hangs under a bridge or does anything but lie directly on the earth even though sewer pipes start out low and have to keep going lower in a city with no subway system theres not much other infrastructure in the way 12 feet is fairly deep for raleigh the neuse river wastewater treatment plant southeast of raleigh discharges most of the 40plus million gallons of water it treats every day in a state bordering on potable spread over 300 acres and surrounded by 1200 acres of farm fields for application of biosolids the plant is big enough that to see it you have to tool around in a van you cant walk it like you can the water treatment plant miles upstream superintendent t j lynch started my tour with a drive to the headworks where screens and vortex filters remove the floating junk and grit from the outflow of the twin 72inch trunks flowing in from the sewer system the floating stuff is more obvious but lynch emphasizes the basins that settle out grit in a process heavy on pumps and pipes grit is anathema think about sand he says its abrasive it will literally wear out your equipment they fill three dumpsters a day with grit and the debris caught by screening all of which goes to the landfill remarkably though the air has a certain tang it doesnt stink ninetyninepointnine percent of it is just water lynch says weve just got to get that 01 percent out outside the headworks lynch points to a concrete basin almost the exact size and shape of a baseball field sloping downward from the outfield to a low point at home plate a 32milliongallon equalization tank the sewer system does not have water towers or storage tanks to accommodate regular fluctuations in wastewater volume flow peaks at breakfast time and again just after midnight so it stores water in the equalization tank during periods of high flow and especially storms lynch says its not uncommon for us during a heavy rain to see our flow double the equalization tank gives lynch a place to put that excess flow when the flow slows down again he uses four enormous screw pumps to push the water to the top of the slope on which the plant is builtthe rest of the way through the plant gravity does the work he shows off the pumps proudly theyre called vertical turbine solidshandling pumps but he notes that they use technology roughly unchanged since the time of archimedes turning screws to lift water from the headworks the water flows to primary clarifierstanks through which the wastewater flows extremely slowly not unlike the settlement basins at the water plant and with the same goal allowing solids to settle to the bottom creating a primary sludge blanket though here grease and oil also float to the top scrapers make a circuit along the surface scooping grease into a small flume then cycling to the bottom where they shepherd the sludge to its own pumps water cleanliness is measured by biochemical oxygen demand bodthe amount of oxygen the bacteria in the water use to remove its organic impurities the lower the bod the smaller the next basins can be and the lower the plants operating costs this is a crucial point given how much energy the next step takes that step is what lynch calls the absolute heart and soul of his plant the activated sludge process so after a few hours in the clarification tank the water flows into aeration basins six concrete pools of several million gallons apiece the bottoms of which are crisscrossed by air nozzles these enormous tanks of what looks like boiling brown sewage are just what you imagine when you think sewage treatment but its not boiling whats happening is aeration which provides oxygen in the presence of which bacteria love to eat poop we are bug farmers lynch says bacteria in the basins multiply rapidly like the starter for sourdough bread the wastewater provides the food the nozzles provide the oxygen and the bacteria feel like theyre on a cruise nothing but breathing eating and reproducing with free food all day long this process removes all the harmful chemicals from the waterexcept nitrates which feed algae in rivers these algae propagate wildly and then die and the decomposition sucks up all the oxygen in the river killing the fish so now were going into the same tanks and we put walls in there and we have different zones where we stimulate the bacteria to do different things that remove nitrogen after about a day of that the water spends 2 days flowing very slowly through secondary clarification basins a dozen large circular tanks each the size of an aboveground swimming pool its very quiet lynch says the bacteria settle down and create what we call the sludge blanket which sinks to the bottom and is pumped out the water trickles out through vnotch weirs around the top of the tank by which point it has a barely yellowish tinge and no odor whatsoever well get to the next stage of water filtration but whats more interesting at this point is what happens to the sludge most of it becomes rasreturn activated sludgeand rejoins new wastewater in the aeration basins providing the starter for a whole new treatment reaction bacteria can go around the cycle half a dozen times lynch says but eventually they become waswaste activated sludge in the was stream the bacteria go to four big covered tanks called aerobic sludge digesters in which instead of wastewater nutrients they eat each other we climbed up to the top of one of the basins and looked through a porthole inside you could almost hear the screaming okay not really its just a tank of sludge if its good sludge its got that nice brown colorits oxygenated and it dont smell bad up here lynch says if its black somethings out of whackit probably needs more oxygen aerobic digestion lynch says is actually inefficientit costs money since the plant has to pump in oxygen anaerobic digestion to which the plant hopes to switch is the opposite it generates methane which the plant can use to generate electricity to operate its pumps and blowers the waste heat from the generators can even help provide the heat the anaerobic digesters need to keep the bugs at optimum eatingeachother temperature there are plants now that generate their entire power needs from that methane he says they pull no energy from the grid from the digesters we drive to the dewatering buildingjust as at the water treatment plant the wastewater plant uses belt presses to squeeze the water out of the last bugeatbug stage of the sludge enormous screw conveyors grind big pieces of the dewatered stuff along like the mixers in an industrial bakery lynch hands me a piece of what they call cake it has no odor at all and feels a lot like inchthick rubber the kind used under playground equipment polymers are introduced to help coagulation and add to the rubbery feel dont forget to wash your hands lynch says we leave the sludge and return to the water primary treatment is mechanicalsettling secondary treatment is biochemicalactivated sludge digestion tertiary treatment combines mechanical and photochemical the water flows to a dozen deep sand filters which remove the remaining fine particles the final hurdle the water clears is ultraviolet treatment we walk over to a small low concrete building in front of which lynch pulls up a flat piece of aluminum to reveal a 4 or 5footwide channel of water flowing smoothly past banks of greenglowing uv lamps they look much like fluorescent lights though they have a selfwiping mechanism to keep them clean it doesnt kill pathogens he says of the light it just scrambles their rna sterilizes em he mentions in passing an open concrete channel between the filters and the uv treatment in which tilapia swim it keeps the duckweed down he says once fish are swimming in your treated sewage youve got to feel like youre getting the job done out behind the uv building we finally reach the finished product the effluent flowing out in strong wide arcs into a canal from a dozen uv channels the water seems to have a greenish tinge but when lynch fills a little water bottle and holds it up it looks utterly clear then we drive down toward the end of the line where the effluent enters the neuse river there in a tiny green glade at the bottom of the hill the river bends into a cove near the bank of which a few surface bubbles give away the presence of the underground pipe lynch says if you didnt know where the pipe was you could follow shad upstream to find it the waters warm and highly oxygenated so the fish love it lynch says the river is the natural place for the water anyhow every drop of raleigh water comes from the neuse watershed and ought to return there all were doing he says is what a river would do that is rivers are naturally selfcleaning and the neuse would absorb waste given time and distance waste on the ground would be dispersed by rain and the water would be filtered through the earth entering the groundwater system clean matter that made it to the stream would become waterlogged and sink on the rocky bottom bacteria live he says that feed off the nutrients in waste what happens in our plant is the exact same thing that happens in a stream thats exactly where the process came from weve just concentrated it lynch says it might take the river a couple hundred miles to accomplish what we do in a couple days weve been talking about sewage treatment for 2 hoursabout dewatered cake and grit screens and activated sludge and uv filtersand suddenly i understand what the river does is exactly what a sewage plant does and until around world war i most people didnt really think plants were needed at all it was understood that watercourses were to some degree selfcleaning that the solution to pollution is dilution but as populations increased especially downstream dilution stopped offering much of a solution chicagoans felt great about their famous flowreversal of the chicago river sending their sewage into the mississippi instead of into their own water supply of lake michigan predictably the people of st louis were not as delighted their expression of dissatisfaction eventually landed them in front of the supreme court raleigh itself was sued in the late 1940s by downstream neighbor smithfield smithfield won and in 1956 raleighs first sewage treatment plant opened treating 12 million gallons per day the current plant replaced it in 1977 its expanded since and now its expanding again raleighs sewage treatment will be limited not by space but by nitrogen in 1995 the state of north carolina set limits on nitrogen based on totals for that year raleighs plant released 13 million pounds of nitrogen into the neuse in 1995 and its current limit is 49 percent of that total or 676496 pounds in 2007 it released 233061 pounds its lowest total ever still the statemandated limit will keep dropping and raleighs capacity to treat its sewage will probably finally reach its limit in pounds of nitrogen rather than in millions of gallons per day modern sewage treatment is a boon of course but it creates a new problem if you treat sewage so effectively that by the time water leaves the plant its almost drinkable then what do you do with all the sludge you cleaned out of it people have been fertilizing with their sewage since the ancient athenians but modern americans seem to mistrust the process as recently as 2006 when waterstarved san diego considered a watersaving measure to reintroduce effluent from its sewage plant into its reservoirfrom which of course the citys water would still be treated before usethe uniontribune opined your golden retriever may drink water out of the toilet with no ill effects but that doesnt mean humans should do the same the practice would have made the reservoir no different than the mississippi or the neuse or any other source of water into which the effluent of cities upstream has been poured water managers like to spout the trueenoughfordiscussion statistic that by the time londoners drink water from the thames its been through seven sets of kidneys upstream others repeat the same chestnut about new orleans and the mississippi two years later san diegos mayor claimed the reuse measure was a waste of money and vetoed it the city council overturned his veto but its clear even in the parched southwest people are frightened of wastewater reuse in 2008 when raleigh introduced a plan to save water by reusing effluent from the neuse plantby piping it only to largescale users such as universities business campuses and country clubs and only for irrigationsome politicians resisted they claimed to object to subsidizing largescale users through lower rates for the reuse water fortunately enough people remembered the drought the system was built using pipes foresightedly laid almost a decade earlier given that people feel that resistant to highly treated water what on earth to do with all this sludge new york used to dump its sludge far out in the ocean a practice that didnt represent a huge improvement over dumping raw sewage until that was outlawed in 1992 after which the city started shipping sludge by train to a texas landfill plenty of cities still landfill their sludge raleigh chooses to follow the example of milwaukee more than 90 percent of its sludge is beneficially reused as biosolids nationwide about 50 percent of sludge is reused some of raleighs muck is thickened on gravity belt presses and applied directly to fields as class b biosolids according to the epa this use requires a buffer between fields and the public and they cant be used on crops for human consumption some of this was overapplied to the raleigh farmland surrounding the plant in recent years a series of poor practices resulted in groundwater contamination near the plant so the practice was stopped though the plant currently has the highest certification level of the national biosolids partnership the nbp is a nonprofit comprising three national groups two represent the sewage treatment industry which may not be the most objective source for biosolids practice assessment and the third is the environmental protection agency which probably is some primary sludge is dewatered and sold to a composting company which treats it and sells it to agricultural products companies as safer more highly treated class a biosolids the rest is mixed with lime which raises the temperature high enough to pasteurize it and sold to farms institutions and the public as raleigh plus raleighs own version of milorganite maybe ill use some on my lawn nobody has any statistics on
