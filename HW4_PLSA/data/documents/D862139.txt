until one does your scalp produces a lot more faster skin cells and oil than the other skin on your body the dead outer skin is always fluffing off the oil and especially dead skin feed a zoo of microorganisms when these guys are too prolific they can start to munch away at living skin too they produce waste products which irritate your skin this causes your skin to try to rid it by producing and blowing off even more skin possibly also producing more oil which actually just feeds the bugs more regular cleaning of the scalp to remove the excess dead skin and oil and microbes will help but dont be too harsh with your skin because this will make the problem worse it it gets too dry the outer layer of dead skin and oil helps seal the living skin acting like a barrier to the microbes antibiotics can also make it worse because you need a good coating of harmless microbes to prevent more harmful ones from getting established everybodys skinoil combo is different to one degree or another and everyone has their own unique zoology of microbes i havent seen any such products yet for the scalp but we already have bowel probiotics and fecal transplants being performed dentists are
