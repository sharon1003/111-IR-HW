december 26 1977charlie chaplin dead at 88 made the film an art form by bosley crowtherharlie chaplin the poignant little tramp with the cane and comic walk who almost singlehandedly elevated the novelty entertainment medium of motion pictures into art died peacefully yesterday at his home in switzerland he was 88 years old sir charles  he was knighted by queen elizabeth in 1975  died at 4 a m a few hours before his familys traditional christmas celebration was to begin his wife oona daughter of the playwright eugene oneill and seven of their children were at the bedside when the comedian died a daughter the actress geraldine chaplin was in madrid making a film but left immediately to join her family at the chaplin home at corsiersurvevey a village near the eastern tip of the lake of geneva all the presents were under the tree lady chaplin told a caller adding charlie gave so much happiness and although he had been ill for a long time it is so sad that he should have passed away on christmas day he died of old age said dr henri perrier the chaplin family physician his death was peaceful and calm a source close to the family said sir charles had been given oxygen because of breathing trouble in recent days in a statement lady chaplin said the funeral would be private and restricted to the immediate family a family spokesman said the funeral might be held in england but that burial would probably be in switzerland sir charless home since his selfimposed exile from the united states in 1952 sir charles had been in failing health for many years he was confined to a wheelchair and his speech hearing and sight were impaired during the last year he left his secluded 20room villa only for an occasional drive into vevey with his wife local people caught an occasional glimpse of the famous actor waiting in his blueandsilver rolls royce while his wife 35 year his junior purchased english newspapers and magazines which she read to him later his last public appearance took place last fall when he attended a circus performance in vevey he wore a soft hat pulled down over his forehead and thicklensed glasses that hid most of his face he shook hands with one of the clowns at the end of the performance no motion picture actor so captured and enthralled the world as did charles spencer chaplin a london ragamuffin who became an immortal artist for his deft and effective humanization of mans tragicomic conflicts with fate in more than 80 movies from 1914 to 1967 he either portrayed or elaborated he was a writer and director as well as an actor the theme of the little fellow capriciously knocked about by life but not so utterly battered that he did not pick himself up in the hope that the next encounter would turn out better his harassed but gallant everyman was the little tramp part clown part social outcast part philosopher he was forever seeking romance but his feet wont let him chaplin once explained indicating that romance connoted not so much courtship as the fulfillment of fancy stumble chaplins everyman might but he always managed to maintain his dignity and selfrespect moreover he sometimes felled a goliath through superb agility a little bit of luck and a touch of pluck there was pathos to the little tramp yet he really did not want to be pitied the essence of chaplins humor was satire sometimes subtle as in the kid and the gold rush sometimes acerbic as in the great dictator and monsieur verdoux the human race i prefer to think of as the underworld of the gods he said when the gods go slumming they visit the earth and what they saw mostly was uncelestial folly in ridiculing that folly chaplin displayed a basic affection for the human race he was serious and funny at the same time and it was this blend of attitudes that elevated his comedy beyond film slapstick into the realm of artistry rebounding from adversity a serious theme in the gold rush for example is mans inhumanity to man the comedy arises from the heros adversity illustrated by his boiling and eating of his shoe with the Ã©clat of a gourmet the element of contrast exemplified by that scene was at the root of chaplins comedy this sense of comedy tickled the fancy of millions in the united states for half a century despite some notoriety that came to chaplin through marital and political misadventures the little tramp the comedy character that lifted its creator to enduring fame was neatly accoutered in baggy trousers outsize shoes an undersize derby redolent of decayed gentility a frayed short cutaway and a sport bamboo cane a jet black mustache completed the costume what made it all fit together was that it complemented chaplins slight stature he was 5 feet 4 inches tall  and his slimness  he weight about 130 in his prime years although chaplin often suggested that the costume was a studied contrivance the fact seems to be that it was arrived at by accident in 1914 when he was breaking into films with mack sennett sennett famous for his keystone kops and other comic shorts sent chaplin to venice calif to make a bit of film eventually called kid auto races at venice he was told to wear something funny and he assembled on a grabbag basis from other members of the company pants belonging to fatty arbuckle size 14 shoes each placed on the wrong foot a tight coat a colleagues derby a prop cane and a false mustache that he cut down to fit his face the splayed shuffle was a touch made up on the spur of the moment with a few exceptions chaplin used the costume for about 25 years and it was his symbol for a lifetime the artistry with which it was employed of course evolved so that the little tramp of modern times was a far more complex character than that in kid auto races at venice the explanation for this was the meticulousness with which chaplin studied the structure of comedy desiring to make audiences laugh he analyzed the ingredients of his approach to comedy and each scene that went into the whole desperately seriousall my pictures are built around the idea of getting me into trouble and so giving me the chance to be desperately serious in my attempt to appear as a normal little gentleman he wrote early in his hollywood career adding that is why no matter how desperate the predicament is i am always very much in earnest about clutching my cane straightening by derby hat and fixing my tie even though i have just landed on my head one of chaplins basic routines had to do with dignity even funnier than the man who has been made ridiculous is the man who having had something funny happen to him refuses to admit that anything out of the way has happened and attempts to maintain his dignity he wrote in 1918 he continuedi am so sure of this point that i not only try to get myself into embarrassing situations but i also incriminate the other characters in the picture when i do this i always aim for economy of means by that i mean that when one incident can get two big separate laughs it is much better than two individual incidents achieved artistic controlin the adventurer i accomplished this by first placing myself on a balcony eating ice cream with a girl on the floor directly underneath the balcony i put a stout dignified welldressed woman at a table then while eating the ice cream i let a piece drop off my spoon slip through my baggy trousers and drop from the balcony onto this womans neck the first laugh came at my embarrassment over my own predicament the second and the much greater one came when the ice cream landed on the womans neck and she shrieked and started to dance around only one incident had been used but it had got two people into trouble and had also got two big laughs simple as this tricks seems there were two real points of human nature involved in it one was the delight the average person takes in seeing wealth and luxury in trouble the other was the tendency of the human being to experience within himself the emotions he sees on the stage or screen in his early days in hollywood chaplin had little to say about how his movies were constructed or filmed later though he achieved artistic control and he took infinite pains in perfecting each scene often shooting hundreds of feet of film for a few minutes of final screen action with only a rudimentary idea in his head he concocted the story as he went along theodore huff wrote in the literature of cinema some pictures changed completely in the course of production he improvised a scene or a series of gags then discussed the results the next day in the projection room a bit might be used or all of it might be reshot or the whole project might be scrapped and some other idea substituted    in city lights the meeting of the blind flower girl and the tramp took months before the variation that satisfied chaplin was reached a train of possibilities some of chaplins best comic situations resulted from his keeneyed observation of life around him i watch people inside a theater to see when they laugh i watch them everywhere to get material which they can laugh at he explained i was passing a firehouse one day he went on and heard a fire alarm ring i watched the men sliding down a pole climbing onto the engine and rushing off to a fire at once a train of comic possibilities occurred to me i saw myself sleeping in bed oblivious to the clanging of the fire bell this point would have universal appeal because everyone likes to sleep i saw myself sliding down the pole playing tricks with the fire horses rescuing my heroine falling off the fire engine as it turned a corner and many other points along the same lines i stored these points away in my mind and some time later when i made the fireman i used every one of them another time i went up and down a moving staircase in a department store i got to thinking how this could be utilized for a picture and i finally made it the basis for the floorwalker watching a prize fight suggested the champion in which i the small man knocked out a big bruiser by having a horseshoe concealed in my glove added to chaplins talent for perceiving the comic potential in everyday occurrences was his skill at using contrast contrast spells interest he once remarked if i am being chased by a policeman i always make the policeman seem heavy and clumsy while by crawling through his legs i appear light and acrobatic if i am being treated harshly it is always a big man who is doing it so that by the contrast between the big and the little i get the sympathy of the audience and always i try to contrast my seriousness of manner with the ridiculousness of the incident entering motion pictures in what was virtually the mediums infancy before the advent of featurelength films and of course sound chaplin was obliged to rely on situational comedy and on pantomime the use of mute gestures and facial expressions to convey motion transcending linguistic barriers this form of body language permitted the actor to be readily understood by peoples everywhere affection and adulationi am known in parts of the world by people who have never heard of jesus christ chaplin said matteroffactly early in his career indeed after only two years on the screen he was unquestionably the top figure in the motion picture industry according to mr huff audience demand for his pictures was phenomenal for example one new york theater played his films continuously from 1914 to 1923 stopping only because the building burned down by 1917 worldrenowned performers visited his studios ignace paderewski leopold godowsky nellie melba harry lauder when the nijinsky ballet played los angeles its dancers spotted chaplin in the audience and halted the show for a half hour while they embraced him his popularity at the box office won him a 1million contract  a stupendous sum in 1917  for eight pictures over 18 months some notion of the adulation of the actor may be inferred from the response to his bond tours in world war i crowds of 30000 in new york 65000 in washington 40000 in new orleans going to europe in 1921  the tramp shoulder arms and other of his classics had of course preceded him chaplin was mobbed in london and paris the latter city declared a public holiday for the premiere of the kid few men in this century in any field attained his stature with the public charlie charlot his first name in any language bespoke affection amounting to idolatry at the same time chaplin widened his intellectual and social world meeting and becoming friendly with max eastman the radical writer upton sinclair the socialist novelist james m barrie the british playwright h g wells the british writer waldo frank the novelist and critic georges carpentier the boxer and st john irvine the british dramatist throughout his life he enjoyed the shuttlecock of wits with bright and learned men and women with his success he was taken up by society figures mrs w k vanderbilt elsie de wolfe princess xenia of greece and hundreds of others although chaplin was not generally accounted vain he was impressed as the latter portion of my autobiography attests written after his forced absence from the united states and in perhaps an understandable mood of irritation the book concludes with accounts of his reception in europe after 1952 by socially and governmentally prestigious people in whose attentions he basked other comic actors of the silent or earlysound era buster keaton harry langdon harold lloyd and w c fields also enjoyed acclaim and their pictures were often revived but none with the possible exceptions of fields created a genre even the marx brothers in the opinion of many critics could not rival chaplin in creativity and fertility one explanation was that chaplins command of pictures after 1917 was complete he was the author star producer director and chief cutter moreover as huffs book notedhe himself played every character in every one of his pictures to show the actors men and women exactly how he wanted them to do a character or a scene and he accompanied each actors miming with a running commentary of suggestions criticism or encouragement in one film the great dictator he served as hairdresser in the belief that he could do a better job than a professional coiffeur of arranging paulette goddards hair to resemble a scrubwomans this impulse to perfectionism costly in terms of time and film exposed caused chaplin many moments of anxiety and selfdoubt his usual solution was to spend a couple of days in bed working through his problem exuberance from confidence over all however chaplin possessed an egotism that did not admit of defeat you have to believe in yourself thats the secret he once advised his son charles jr i had that exuberance that comes from utter confidence in yourself even as a london waif i thought of myself as the greatest actor in the world he recalled born april 16 1889 in south london charles spencer chaplin was the son of a vaudevillian and a music hall soubrette whose stage name was lily harley by an earlier union chaplins mother hannah had a son sydney four years the actors senior sydney was to become his halfbrothers business manager the elder chaplin was a heavy drinker i was hardly aware of a father and do not remember him living with us chaplin wrote the couple separated shortly after he was born and for a time mrs chaplin was able to support herself but her voice lost its quality and it was owing to her vocal condition that at the age of 5 i made my first appearance on the stage i remember standing in the wings when mothers voice cracked and went into a whisper her son recalled the audience began to laugh and sing falsetto and to make catcalls it was all vague and i did not quite understand what was going on but the noise increased until mother was obliged to walk off the stage when she came into the wings she was very upset and argued with the stage manager who having seen me perform before mothers friends said something about letting me go on in her place captivated his audienceand in the turmoil i remember him leading me by the hand and after a few explanatory words to the audience leaving me on the stage alone and before a glare of footlights and faces in the smoke i started to sing accompanied by the orchestra which fiddled about until it found my key the lad captivated his audience especially when in all innocence i imitated mothers voice cracking and he was greeted by laughter and cheers and applause very shortly however mrs chaplins fortunes dwindles and she and the two children were obliged to enter the lambeth workhouse then the boys were dispatched to an orphanage outside london although we were well looked after it was a forlorn existence chaplin wrote of those years the institution practiced flogging and at the age of 7 he received a severe caning moreover for suspected ringworm his head was shaved and iodined and he was put in an isolation ward sydney went off to sea for a while and young charles passed through a succession of workhouses meantime mrs chaplin was committed briefly as insane when she was released the small family again lived in penury relieved slightly when charles joined a troupe of clog dancers he never forgot his days of poverty and the struggle for the necessities of life nor when he was wealthy and famous did he neglect his mother seeing to it that she was well cared for in her eventual emotional breakdown finally he took her to california where she died clog dancing lasted only briefly followed by weeks and months of catchascatchcan existence i was newsvender printer toymaker doctors boy etc but during these occupational digressions i never lost sight of my ultimate aim to become an actor chaplin recalled so between jobs i would polish my shoes brush my clothes put on a clean collar and make periodic calls at a theatrical agency at 12 his persistence was rewarded and he received a small stage part then toured the provinces as billy in william gillettes sherlock holmes later he played the part with mr gillette in london receiving favorable notices an awkward age followed however in which he received several burlesque bookings then came a substantial run in caseys court circus in which he impersonated a patentmedicine faker switch to pantomime in this engagement according to the huff biography chaplin decided to become a comedian he also learned the unimportance of the spoken word once while playing in the channel islands mr huff wrote he found that his jokes were not getting over because the natives knew little english he resorted to pantomime and got the desired laughs his success landed him a job with the fred karno company with karno he learned the hard way traveling all over britain and going twice to america according to john montgomery a writer on films the repertory was varied there were sketches about drunks thieves family relations billiards champions boxers turkish baths policemen singers who prepared to sing but somehow never started conjurors who spoiled their own tricks and pianists who lost the music    a wide various of subjects mixed with a little honest vulgarity the karno troupe was chaplins polishing school for it taught him the rich lessons of his trade by which the actor makes an audience laugh in 1913 mack sennett then the producer of short film comedies for an insatiable public signed the actor for 150 a week i hated to leave the troupe he recalled how did i know that pictures were going to be a successful medium for pantomime suppose i didnt make good nevertheless he joined sennett in los angeles and made his debut in making a living a onereeler that appeared in 1914 in those early sennett comedies there was no scenario we get an idea then follow the natural sequence of events until it leads up to a chase which is the essence of our comedy sennett explained chaplin changed that by adopting an identifiable character  the little tramp  which allowed the public to single him out from other comedians35 sennett films in his year with sennett chaplin played in 35 films including tillies punctured romance a sixreeler that also starred marie dressler and mabel normand it was the screens first featurelength comedy and it is occasionally shown today in various cutup versions others of the keystone or sennett films have been mutilated or rearranged according to the huff book which notes rarely does one come across an unmutilated keystone original the originals of these films were shown around the world and they inspired such songs as when the moon shines bright on charlie chaplin the renown they brought to chaplin enabled him to shift to the essanay company for the then grand sum of 1250 a week for essanay he made 14 films in 1915 including the tramp his first generally recognized classic and the first in which he introduced a note of pathos in the picture chaplin a tramp saves a farmers daughter played by edna purviance from a robber gang for which he is rewarded with a job on the farm routing the gang again he is shot in the leg and nursed by the daughter the tramps happiness is unbounded until the girls sweetheart arrives realizing his fate the tramp scribbles a farewell and departs in the fadeout chaplins back is to the camera he walks dejectedly down a long road then he pauses shrugs his shoulders flips his heels and continues jauntily toward the horizon several variations on this theme were used in later chaplin films notably in limelight after his essanay period chaplin went to the mutual company for 670000 a year he was 26 three years out of vaudeville and perhaps the worlds highest paid performer the sudden advent of wealth had little immediate effect on its lifestyle when he signed his mutual contract he remarked well ive got this much if they never give me another cent guess ill go and buy a whole dozen ties he was living at the time in a small hotel room and he kept away from hollywood parties preferring to roam at might through los angeless poorer quarters shortly however he moved to larger quarters hired a secretary bought a locomobile and acquired toraichi kono a combination valet bodyguard and chauffeur kono as he was generally called remained with the actor for about 20 years serving as the keeper of his privacy fortune in the millions in time chaplin grew passionately attached to money although he was not a tightwad neither was he a conspicuous spender save on his own comfort in the end his fortune was in the millions and he insisted toward the close of his life that he had been actuated all along by money i went into the business for money and the art grew out of it he said if people are disillusioned by that remark i cant help it its the truth however those who were close to chaplin in his early film years were impressed by his painstaking search for artistry in doing the tworeel the immigrant in 1917 for instance he shot 90000 feet of film to obtain the 1809 feet of the finished picture his dozen mutual films were all tworeelers they included some ranked among his best the floorwalker the fireman the vagabond and easy street the negatives were not preserved and the worn and duplicated prints that are sometimes shown at chaplin festivals according to critics bear only slight relationship to the quality of the original films his own producer when the mutual contract was up chaplin went to first national for 1million for eight pictures over 18 months for the first time he was his own producer in his own studio actually he made nine pictures over five years and these included some of his greatest achievements a dogs life shoulder arms and the kid sparing of caricature a dogs life derives its humor from the parallels between a dogs existence and that of a vagabond shoulder arms is everyman at war and according to jean cocteau it moves like a drumroll for the kid chaplin employed jackie coogan a 5yearold with mischievous brown eyes hailed as a picture with a smile  perhaps a tear the movie was a chapter out of chaplins own slum life it contains little horseplay and much emotional intensity coogans tears were real induced by the sad stories chaplin spun for him at necessary moments marriages and divorces during the preparation of the kid for release chaplin was embroiled in the first of several marital and extramarital episodes that were to plague him goodlooking and attractive to women he was involved in a score or more of alliances many with glamorous actresses but these were usually discreetly handled not so with his first two marriages in 1918 when the actor was 29 he abruptly married 16yearold mildred harris they were divorced two years later in a fanfare of publicity four years afterward he married lolita mc murry also 16 whose stage name was lita grey she was ensconced in her husbands 40room mansion from which chaplin soon fled two children charles jr and sydney were born of the union which ended in 1927 after a sensational divorce case in the course of which chaplin pictures were barred in some states at the urging of womens clubs the actors third wife was pauline levy a chorus girl whose film name was paulette goddard the two met in 1931 when miss goddard was 20 and according to chaplin were married in 1936 they were divorced in 1942 without public fuss meantime in 1941 the actor met joan berry a 21yearold aspiring actress known as joan barry she later charged that he was the father of her daughter and chaplin was once again the subject of lurid headlines he was indicted for allegedly taking miss barry across state lines for immoral purposes but this charge was dropped and he was acquitted of three related accusations miss barry however filed a paternity suit in which blood tests demonstrated that chaplin was not her childs father nonetheless a jury found against him and he was ordered to support the infant in the midst of these troubles in 1943 chaplin then 54 married 18yearold oona oneill the playwrights daughter over her fathers vigorous objections their marriage proved happy and lasting and it produced eight children chaplins later films were made for united artists a company he founded in 1919 with three hollywood friends mary pickford douglas fairbanks sr and david wark griffith chaplins initial picture for this concern was a woman of paris a comedy of manners that he produced and directed without starring in it considered a milestone in screen history for its influence on movie style it was based in part on the life of peggy hopkins joyce briefly chaplins mistress and it stressed social sophistication in it adolphe menjou made his debut as a suave philanderer the gold rush  the picture i want to be remembered by chaplin said  came out in 1925 and it once again confirmed his hold on the public it has been frequently revived and much analyzed less successful with the critics was the circus which opened in 1928 it seemed to lack the feeling of the gold rush and its comedy twists were short on flair its shortcomings however appeared less evident in revivals starting work on city lights in 1928 the actor faced a crisis in the advent of talkies he was fearful that spoken dialogue would impair the character of the tramp cause difficulties in his reliance on pantomime and cut into foreign sales moreover many of chaplins effects had been achieved by undercranking the camera a feat impossible at the set speed of a motordrive sound camera after some thought chaplin decided to defy the new technology and city lights was produced as a silent picture with a musical score the story of the blind flower girl played by virginia cherrill used more than 800000 feet of film over two years the tragicomedy was an enormous triumph when it opened in 1931 and outgrossed many slick sound films in revivals over the last 40 years many critics rank city lights as among chaplins greatest creations reputation as radical the pictures appeal was one factor in chaplins conquering tour of europe and the orient a whirl of meetings with statesmen writers artists and celebrities returning to hollywood he embarked upon modern times a satire on mass production which at the time gave the actor a reputation as a radical it the picture started from an abstract idea an impulse to say something about the way life is being standardized and channelized men turned into machines and the way i felt about it he said of his witty social parable the little tramp disappeared with modern times and with the great dictator chaplin joined the soundpicture ranks a ferocious ridicule of hitler and mussolini the film has grown in stature over the years as its political implications have been according to critics more fully realized i want to see the return of decency and kindness chaplin said at the time im just a human being who wants to see this country a real democracy    despite the great dictator the nineteenforties were difficult years for chaplin his private life provided a headline festival for the tabloid press he was vexed by income tax trouble his wartime speeches calling for a western second front to crush hitler irked many conservatives and monsieur verdoux did poorly at the box office this fugue of troubles was intensified by the advent of the cold war the actor came under fire for introducing henry a wallace at a rally and for protesting the deportation of hanns eisler the composer and a onetime communist westbrook pegler the columnist denounced him and representative john e rankin a rightwing legislator from mississippi demanded his deportation chaplins life is detrimental to the moral fabric of america mr rankin asserted urging that he be kept off the american screen and his loathsome pictures be kept from the eyes of american youth finally in 1952 the actor a british subject was virtually exiled by the united states while he was sailing to britain on vacation the attorney general announced that he could not reenter the country unless he could prove his moral worth piqued chaplin spent the rest of his life in europe settling on a 38acre estate at vevey switzerland a special academy award in 1972 however amends of a sort were made to chaplin he visited the united states to receive a special oscar from the motion picture academy and to accept accolades in new york by this time the oncebubbling actor had aged into senility he could do little more than bow and smile in response to expressions of affection for him and his art meantime critical opinion vindicated chaplins belief that verdoux was a brilliant picture its satire of a business and warminded world was more appreciated in the context of opinion in the 1960s and 70s than it had been in the late 40s apart from limelight chaplins final films the king in new york and a countess from hong kong were accounted by many critics as lesser works in his declining years chaplin looked back with happiness on his early days in the movies at keystone and essanay i was able to try anything in those days he said i was free
