maxing on squats and deadlifts every dayby greg nuckols  102612tags squat deadlift a heavy squat workout can leave you sore for days in the hamstrings quads lower back and glutes along with a few other muscles you never even knew you had its so rough that the very thought of squatting twice per week makes your stomach turn and squatting three times a week or more thats just insanity i guess someone forgot to tell that to the bulgarians what is the bulgarian method the bulgarian method is a high intensity high frequency system that was used by the dominant bulgarian weightlifting team under coach ivan abadjiev and has since been popularized on our soil by strength coach john broz bret contreras wrote about the bulgarian method and broz here so check that article out first if you havent done so already now lets narrow in on exactly how to use this system for powerlifting while addressing some misinformation along the way what did the bulgarian method do for me first some context im an avid lifter whose had my fair share of injuries in a relatively short time as a powerlifter my first competition was about 6 years ago my training was hindered by knee problems from my first days in the gym it took less than 18 months to tear my quadratus lumborum from that point forward my training probably included as many injuries as prs retearing my ql severe shoulder impingement worsening tendonitis in my knees nerve problems with my elbow – all before i was 18my best total was 1438 at 220 pounds and i couldnt see it improving much from there i certainly didnt sound like the ideal candidate for a system that supposedly puts a lifter at an insane risk of injury a program thats impossible for a drugfree lifter my training partners thought i was crazy when i started maxing on squats and bench every day the rosiest prediction i got was mere atrophy and strength loss while injury was the more common forecast and the result a nearly unbroken string of prs leading up to a 1714pound drugfree total at 220 and not a single major injury tightness and occasional aches sure but my knee pain cleared up my shoulder pain dissipated and my back held up fantastically none of this is meant to toot my own horn but to show you that if this system works for me it can probably work for you too common misinformation about the bulgarian method im not the type to sugarcoat things this form of training is very difficult both mentally and physically however people should not equate difficult with impossible yes there are some significant risks inherent to the bulgarian method that dont apply to other programs to the same degree there are also some prerequisites you must meet before the risk to reward ratio tips in your favor however dismissing the entire system as impossible simply because its demanding is unwise and in my opinion shows a great lack of faith in the abilities of motivated people lets look at some things that people say about the bulgarian method and separate the truth from the myths1 – maxes every day will inevitably lead to injuries many fear that youll destroy your tendons by squatting or benching heavy on a daily basis this couldnt be further from the truth research shows that tendon size and strength increases with chronic repeated loading as long as your mechanics are such that youre not damaging your tendons each session theyll strengthen and thicken just like your muscles granted the risk of injury would be significantly higher were you performing true maxes that would make louie simmons proud but maxes in the bulgarian method are quite different here the daily max is a weight that you can move without mental arousal no death metal and ammonia and without any aberration from perfect form perfect form is imperative though if your squat or bench technique puts undue stress on any of your soft tissues youll progressively increase the damage youre inflicting rather than the benefits youre reaping for someone with good form however the risk of injury is probably lower than it would be on other programs because you never give an allout effort in my case daily squatting fixed the knee pain that i had dealt with for almost 10 years and i sustained no injuries while doing daily maxes and even reversed some nagging tendon issues2 – youll undoubtedly experience overtraining and adrenal burnout this is a common objection to the bulgarian method that fails to take into account how the body responds to chronic stressors due to habituation of the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal response to stress the body releases fewer stress hormones in response to stressors that its experienced regularly before this has been documented in activities far more stressful than powerlifting such as parachuting if you psych yourself up for your maxes every day youll have a greater risk of burnout but if you approach each lift calmly as you should your hormonal response will probably adapt to the frequent squatting3 – you wont be able to gain muscle the bulgarian method runs counter to most commonly accepted bodybuilding wisdom so i can understand the skepticism squatting and benching heavy every day is drastically different from working a muscle group once or twice a week which ensures at least 72 hours for recovery however higher frequency hypertrophy training has grown in popularity as of late thanks in part to chad waterburys and christian thibaudeaus programs here on t nation the reason that the bulgarian method works for size as well as strength is based on the same principle since you dont push as close to exhaustion you can recover quicker and stress your muscle more frequently eliciting more growth cycles you usually end a workout by doing a single with a weight you could likely grind out for a triple so youre never pushing your muscles beyond what they can recover from in 24 hours more growth cycles  more mass4 – you cant recover on this system without steroids i saved the most controversial for last sure some lifters that have used the bulgarian system likely were on steroids but that doesnt mean you have to be in my experience a drugfree lifter can handle it just fine provided they choose their loads correctly lets looks at some research that may explain how a natural lifter can thrive on such a system in short training frequently helps to optimize your natural hormone production allowing you to gain strength faster and recover from greater loads we know that intense exercise increases testosterone levels but this increase is often written off because the effect is transient and hormone levels return to baseline in a matter of hours however this transient increase begins to seem a lot more significant when we look at the broader picture training not only increases serum testosterone levels but also the number of androgen receptors in the muscles this means that your body can make better use of the testosterone that its producing the effects of transient increases in testosterone may be more important than wed previously thought even when resting hormonal levels remain the same a study found that a greater hormonal response to training elicited a greater increase in strength even with resting testosterone levels remaining unchanged on top of that hard lifting over time can actually increase your serum testosterone levels a two year study on weightlifters demonstrated a nearly 27 increasethe more often you train the more often you see the beneficial spike in testosterone levels and increase in production of androgen receptors frequent heavy training may not level the playing field between enhanced and natural lifters but it does optimize your endogenous hormone production for gaining size and strength the program squat and bench to a heavy single a minimum of four days per week deadlift 7075 of your max for 310 singles once or twice per week do some targeted external rotation work if you have shoulder problems thats all it is however here are some tips to optimize things training maxes are not true maxes they tend to be ≈9095 of your true 1rm if you get psyched up for a set youre doing it wrong sleep 8 hours per night at a minimum if you dont sleep you wont recover its all right or even advisable to rotate between squat variations but keep things pretty vanilla stick with the high bar squat low bar squat or front squat for 95 of your training set a daily minimum for each lift the minimum weight you must lift each time you enter the gym 85 of your max is a good starting point some days you wont feel good when you hit the gym but youll feel better the next day for having worked up to a moderately heavy weight youll get to a point that you dont get sore anymore thats perfectly fine so dont be alarmed if it happens take prs when they come but dont push for them too hard youll eventually be hitting your current 1rm for nonpsyched training maxes which is pretty cool just dont lose your cool and start pushing to the point that a pr attempt today will impact your training tomorrow eat this one should be obvious but if youre new to the bulgarian method dont use it while eating to lose fat dont deadlift enough to impact recovery training your squat with such a high frequency will improve your deadlift pulling once or twice per week is plenty and never pull enough weight or volume that slows bar speed dont even think about trying this program unless youve been training at least 3 years and have near perfect form4 days per week is a minimum seven is preferable i usually trained at least 6 days per week if you cant make it to the gym at least 4 days per week your training frequency cant be high enough to resemble the bulgarian system work fast but not so fast that it impacts strength if you find yourself needing to rest more than a couple of minutes between sets youre probably about to lift a weight thats too heavy myofascial release before training especially if you have a desk job or the mobility of a picnic table why it works the answer to this question is both physiological and psychological more training sessions means more growth cycles and more transient spikes in testosterone production but it runs deeper than that the most important aspect of the bulgarian method is practice it treats lifting as a skill just like any other sports skill if you want to get better at anything you practice it more often whether its shooting a basketball or hitting a baseball or throwing darts the more you practice a skill the more efficient the motor pattern associated with that skill becomes powerlifting is no different except that a loaded barbell is heavier than other sporting implements who wants to make 90 of their free throws or practices by shooting basketballs once per week until theyre unable to lift their arms yet thats exactly what people do when they want to improve their squat the more you practice the more you improve muscle recruitment firing rate and inter and intramuscular coordination it makes you approach powerlifting as a mechanic trying to finetune an engine trying to get every last bit of horsepower out of the machine hes working with thats the real beauty and elegance of the bulgarian method it allows you to get every last bit of strength out of your current musculature while providing a fantastic system for hypertrophy specific to the needs of powerlifting the other advantage of the bulgarian method is mental the most important skill you gain from daily maxes is the ability to define your own limits there will be days especially early on that you feel terrible youll be sore your warmups will feel slow and youll find a creak in your knee that was never there before – and before you know it youve flown past your daily minimum and youre thinking about adding 5 or 10 pounds to yesterdays top weight another benefit is confidence under heavy weight youll get to a point that weights dont feel heavy on your shoulders or in your hands anymore theres no more nervousness no more secondguessing yourself – theres only you a loaded barbell and a task for which you already know the outcome finally theres a certain calmness and humility that only comes with having an acute knowledge of your own capacities when you handle heavy weights all the time you know precisely how strong you are you know when to check your ego and you know better than most your own ability to persevere the verdict the bulgarian method is a system that lifters with awesome form and at least 3 years of experience should consider its not the beallendall of training routines but it has unique benefits and the potential to deliver fantastic strength gains the bulgarian method worked well for me so i can testify that you dont need to be on steroids to thrive on it and that its not an instant recipe for injuries but above all i want you to reconsider your ideas about human capabilities both in terms of outcomes and the ability to overcome significant training stress if a tiny nation with a smaller population than new york city can win olympic gold in weightlifting while american men havent taken home a single medal
