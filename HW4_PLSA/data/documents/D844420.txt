graphic designprinciples of design graphic designnavigation search some of the most commonly acknowledged principles of design are alignment balance contrast proximity repetition and white space these are all elements of graphic design composition additionally compositions are evaluated based on the use of and the successes or failures of harmony emphasis gestalt pattern movement rhythm proportion

design  editgraphic design are definitions rules and considerations of design applied to the visual medium for communication by the use of visual objects that may include words lights graphs and shapes to pass information to the viewer graphic design can be used for advertising or just for entertainment intended for the mind from clarification or expansion of information via visual aids to the arousal of emotional and aesthetic feelings in an artistic way it may be a contributor to many other forms of art and craft for example the elaboration of typefaces used in print and media the order and flow of presentation of a cartoon to the creation of road signs or even emoji graphic design considerations influence all visual aspects of our technological society and is an intrinsic part the shared human culture alignment  editalignment is the act of keeping design objects in line not only vertically or horizontally but across any linear plane alignment also be done respectively ie one design element is positioned with respect a another element within same frame balance  editdesigns in balance or equilibrium have their parts arrangement planned keeping a coherent visual pattern color shape space balance is a concept based on human perception and the complex nature of the human senses of weight and proportion humans can evaluate these visual elements in several situations to find a sense of balance a design composition does not have to be symmetrical or linear to be considered balanced the balance is global to all elements even the absence of content in this context perfectly symmetrical and linear compositions are not necessarily balanced and so asymmetrical or radial distributions of text and graphic elements can achieve balance in a composition contrast  editdistinguishing by comparingcreating differences some ways of creating contrast among elements in the design include using contrasting colors sizes shapes locations or relationships for text contrast is achieved by mixing serif and sansserif on the page by using very different type styles or by using type in surprising or unusual ways another way to describe contrast is to say a small object next to a large object will look smaller as contrast in size diminishes monotony is approached emphasis  editmaking a specific element stand out or draw attention to the eye emphasis can be achieved in graphic design by placing elements on the page in positions where the eye is naturally drawn by using other principles such as contrast repetition or movement bold and italic type provides emphasis for text graphic elements gain emphasis through size visual weight color complexity uniqueness placement on the page and other features gestalt  editsometimes considered a distinct principle of design gestalt is the concept that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts gestalt is a concept from psychology where theorists note the propensity of humans to conceptually group things together to make a meaningful whole when viewing designs humans apply this principle unconsciously by seeing connections and relationships among and between the elements in the design the overall perception of gestalt in a design is created through harmony unity balance proportion proximity and other visual cues designers can use this principle to create visual connections and relationships that clarify and strengthen the overall feel and meaning of the design harmony  editas with music graphical elements can be said to be working in harmony  the individual parts come together as visually compelling and a meaningful whole disharmony can also be used just as it is in musical compositions to enhance the emotional complexity to challenge the viewer and to give a contrast within the overall composition movement  editmovement is creating an instability making motion to blur the image movement can be achieved by using graphic elements that direct the eye in a certain direction such as arrows that point the way overtly or a series of lines or dots that get progressively larger or smaller creating a more subtle sense of movement movement can be accomplished simply by using a photograph or clip art of something moving  a runner  as opposed to something stationary  a person standing proportion  editthis indicates the relative visual size width and weight of a particular graphical elements in a design composition proximity  editcloseness or distance of individual design elements close proximity indicates a connection proximity means grouping elements together so that you guide the viewerreader to different parts of the message repetition  editrepeating a sequence having it occur more than a few times in design repetition creates visual consistency in page designs such as using the same style of headlines the same style of initial capitals or repeating the same basic layout from one page to another excessive repetition monotony may lead to boredom and uninteresting compositions if one cannot avoid excessive repetitions for any reason do not forget to add some visual breaks and white spaces where eyes can rest for a while rhythm  edita strong regular repeated pattern of movement or sound successful designs have an effective ebb and flow text and graphics should seem to be paced and patterned spacing is an effective application of this principle second human beings are more comfortable with variation in general psychologically most any serious lack in variation of anything a solid a line a sound a situation can become very boring adding a little variation at nonspecific intervals every now and again gives most any design an interesting appeal as long as it is not overdone in setting type rhythm can be created or disrupted compare the gibberish strings as erav mono ewone zenao oro remuna oravanam and githol urtym reislyt quadirit notice how the latter seems to be more organic and readable than the former this is resultant of two things one the eye more easily follows abnormalities and variation like an ocular foothold toonarrow columns result in overhyphenation images that interrupt a passage of text can break the rhythm for the reader and they could disturb the visual appearance of the page the definition of rhythm is the suggestion of motion through the use of various elements unity  editunity creates a feeling of wholeness unity is usually achieved when the parts complement each other in a way where they have something in common unity can be achieved by use of the same color or different tints of it or using a similar graphic style for illustrations white space  editareas of a design void of text or graphics white space includes margins gutters space between lines of type leading offset of text from images text wraps and any other part of the page that is empty white space is also analogous to negative space where positive space is defined as images blocks of text and other graphical elements in graphic design the white space or negative space is considered an important element of the overall design it is used  and evaluated  based on the same criteria as the rest of the elements in the design white space can add to or detract from the balance unity harmony rhythm and overall success of a design white space can give emphasis contrast and movement it can be used for repetition and pattern and work within various relationships with other elements of the positive and negative spaces in the design category book graphic design
