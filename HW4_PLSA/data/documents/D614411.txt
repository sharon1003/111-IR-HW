chemistry stack exchange is a question and answer site for scientists academics teachers and students join them it only takes a minute sign up heres how it works anybody can ask a question anybody can answer the best answers are voted up and rise to the top why does reduction always accompany oxidation and vice versaup vote1down votefavorite weve all learnt that the reduction always accompanies oxidation and vice versa why is this so why is it not possible that a species releases an electron and the electron just floats around is this related to the stability of a free electronredoxshare improve this questionasked may 17 15 at 1424binary geek778 6 24asker123 so there are highly unfavourbale cases where this happens can you provide an example – binary geek may 17 15 at 1616my bad there are no highly unfavorable cases even then there must be an outside cause – asker123 may 17 15 at 1633add a comment1 answer active oldest votesup vote2down vote if something is to be reduced then there must be a reducing agent present also if something is oxidized then there must be an oxidizing agent present you must have a reducing agent or oxidizing agent present in order for a redox reaction to take place an element cant just dislocate its electrons there must be an outside force present in order to do thatshare improve this answeredited may 17 15 at 1644ringo175k 5 51 94answered may 17 15 at 1632asker1231922 2 12 38lets say i supply a lot of heat to a sodium atom why cant the electron be ejected and remain as such without reducing any of the species present in the environment – binary geek may 17 15 at 17001the outside force in this situation is heat of course this can happen but however i doubt that the electrons will just remain present in the environment for long theoretically yes it is possible – asker123 may 17 15 at 1705is there any example you can provide where electrons remain present in the environment for long theroretical or experimental – binary geek may 18 15 at 209add a comment your answer sign up or log in sign up using google sign up using facebook sign up using email and password post as a guest name email by posting your answer you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service not the answer youre looking for browse other questions tagged redox or ask your own questionasked2 years 10 months agoviewed753 timesactive2 years 10 months ago related2 reduction and oxidation  alternate definitions12 is a highly oxidized element more electropositive than a lesser oxidized counterpart1 why do na no3  al  na oh yield ammonia0 redox oxidation and reduction1 confusions about oxidation and reduction0 reduction of copper oxide by hydrogen1 is oxidation always thermodynamically favorable3 reduction of oxides by carbon0 oxidation  reduction ionic half reaction hot network questions has deadshot ever unwillingly missed why we cant create a hardlink form device file in other than dev directory could a corporeal patronus be a swarm why did the soviet union name their strongest bomb tsar bomba why do pokemon evolve how do streaming services earn money what accent did the actors use in black panther how do you deal with someone whos pushing you without explaining yourself not quite roman ternary how do i get emails about core update c method chaining for email how should i respond to a supervisoreditor who thinks my technical writing is too conversational is there a name for mock criticism what are the actions one can do against chesscom players who stop moving when they are in an objectively losing position and refuse to resign how did people wash dishes before dish detergent how can a file have been created in 1641 is the language of the economist artificially complex remove ✅  ✈  ♛ and other such emojisimagessigns from java string how can i say i am an outstanding leader without sounding arrogant digits in their lanes how should fledgling planet colonies deal with supply crews suffering from barophobia fear of gravity which two numbers complete this number sequence how do i prevent colleagues from making fun of the length of my passwordecho hello 0   filetxt doesnt write to filetxtquestion feed
