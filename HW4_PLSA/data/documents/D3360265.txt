lending club risks and costs people keep asking me for my thoughts on lending club i finally capitulated last week and read the prospectus and accompanying supplementsdisclosures my thoughts are as follows highrisk highyield lending isn’t new investors have had access to such investments for the last few decades they’re called junk bonds in fact it may be illuminating to compare lending club notes to just such an investment let’s use i shares high yield corporate bond etf  hyg  admittedly lending club notes may offer some feelgood value or entertainment value not offered by lending to businesses i however find it just as fun to lend to a business as to a person so for this comparison i’ll assume such value is zero that may not be the case for you fees  expenses from page 4 of the lending club prospectus“prior to making any payments on a note we will deduct a service charge equal to 100 of that payment amount… the service charge will reduce the effective yield on your notes below their stated interest rate”so for example if a note had an 8 yield and every payment was received on time you’d earn a 7 rate of return the annual expense ratio for i shares high yield corporate bond etf is 050 half that of lending club notes advantage i shares high yield corporate bond etf diversification with the etf you’re immediately diversified among several different borrowers with lending club notes you have to do it manually in other words diversifying a portfolio of lending club notes requires a more time and b more money than diversifying a portfolio of highyield bonds advantage i shares high yield corporate bond etf liquidity lending club notes can be sold on their note trading platform operated by foliofn when selling lending club notes you name an asking price and hope to get it when selling an etf you have that same nameyourpriceandhopetogetit option or you can simply place a market sell order and know that your shares will be sold almost immediately and that you’ll get a price very close to the price of the last trade advantage i can’t be absolutely certain because i don’t have any data about sales of lending club notes but i think we can safely say that it’s either a tie or a win for the etf liquidation costs foliofn charges a fee equal to 1 of the price of the sale of lending club notes etfs can be traded at your brokerage firm of choice the commission will depend upon that brokerage firm’s commission structure advantage it depends upon your brokerage firm and upon how much you’re selling for example if you use trade king 495 commissiontrade and you’re liquidating less than 495 worth of the investment lending club notes win if you’re liquidating more than 495 i shares high yield corporate bond etf wins companyspecific risk sipc insurance if the brokerage firm where you buy and hold your etfs goes bankrupt you’ll be covered by sipc insurance up to 50000 per investor in contrast per page 20 of the lending club prospectus“if we were to become insolvent or bankrupt an event of default would occur under the terms of the notes and you may lose your investment”also on page 20“we have not been profitable since our inception and we may not become profitable”in short in addition to the borrowerspecific risk you’re taking on companyspecific risk specifically the risk of a startup company that has yet to show a profit advantage i shares high yield corporate bond etf default risk unfortunately when lending club provides default data they tend to include every loan that has been issued for 45 days or more as you can imagine most loans haven’t defaulted by just 15 days after the due date of the first payment in order to make a meaningful comparison we’d need data on loans that have gone fullterm thankfully lending club does allow you to download a good deal of data regarding their past loan performance that’s where you can find facts like these as of 1222010 of loans more than 30 months old 1163 of loaned principle is either in default or has been completely charged off of loans between 27 and 30 months old 1571 of loaned principle is either in default or has been completely charged off of loans between 24 and 37 months old 1849 of loaned principle is either in default or has been completely charged off on the other hand as bad as those default rates appear they should be accompanied by a few caveats they occurred during a significant economic downturnthe sample size in terms of time covered is quite small and the default rates for lending club’s highestrated notes are much lower advantage neither there still isn’t enough data to say either way interest rate risk according to morningstar the average effective duration of bonds included in i shares high yield corporate bond etf is 425 years they don’t list the average maturity but by definition it must be longer than 425 years the maturity of every lending club note is 3 years advantage lending club due to their shorter maturity the market value of a lending club note should fluctuate less dramatically than the market value of i shares high yield corporate bond etf as a result of changes in market interest rates summary to be clear the above comparison is very backofthenapkin because of their high overall default rates i’ve compared lending club notes to junk bonds however a more meaningful method would be to compare each grade of lending club notes to a different bond etf the idea would be to match up each grade of notes with an etf that invests in bonds with similar historical default rates unfortunately as i mentioned above sufficient data does not yet exist for such a comparison to be made as it stands right now i’d categorize lending club notes as shortterm highrisk debt that’s difficult to diversify and that carries somewhat higher expenses than i’d like entertainmentfeelgood value aside i don’t see much purpose for lending club notes in most portfolios of course a few years from now the data
