henri lefebvre the right to the city and the new metropolitan mainstreamchristian schmid the phrase “the right to the city” has been making a comeback as a rallying cry in recent years in cities of the north and the south alike it is used by urban social movements by political alliances by international organizations and also at academic conferences a closer look reveals however that its usage varies considerably it often serves just as a kind of conceptional umbrella for all types of political and social demands that generally address the problems arising in urban areas today see also mayer this volume marcuse this volume the renaissance of the slogan is remarkable as it hearkens back to the late 1960s a specific moment in the history of urbanization at the time it was coined by french philosopher henri lefebvre in response to the urban crisis of that period however the situation then was quite different from the one today the resurgence of this rallying cry therefore raises some important questions are we experiencing a new urban crisis what are its specific traits andcharacteristics what distinguishes it from earlier phases of urbanization in order to clarify these questions it is useful to return to the original conception of the term and explore its potential meanings for urbanization today contents  showstruggles for the city edit the crisis of the city edit lefebvre’s concept of the “right to the city” is based on his investigation of urbanization in france during the 1960s stanek 2011 like most of the western industrialized nations france was marked by the ascent of fordism and the expansion of the keynesian welfare state this development was accompanied by massive migration from rural to urban areas and a fundamental change in spatial structures functionalist urban planning led to a massive restructuring of inner city areas the margins of the cities were dominated by mass productionof social housing as well as by an extensive proliferation of singlefamily detached housing units these urban transformations also entailed a fundamental modernization of everyday life contemporary critics conceptualized this specific aspect of urbanization as a “crisis of the city”1 for lefebvre this crisis consisted primarily of a tendency towards the homogenization of lifestyles and an engineering and colonization of daily life in middleclass suburbs and in workingclass housing estates analogous conditions prevailed—the monotony of the labor process the order of functionalized and bureaucratized cities and the normative constraints of the modernized urban everyday life lefebvre 1996 1968 the right to the city edit the “crisis of the city” was also an important departure point for the manifold social movements of the late 1960s they were not only aimed against western imperialism and the vietnam war or against various forms of discrimination and marginalization they were also directed against alienation in daily life against the modernization of cities and the destruction of their specific qualities and against exclusion from urban life they were struggles for a different city lefebvre regarded these events especially those of may 1968 in paris as parallels to those of the paris commune of 1871 programmatically he demanded a “right to the city” the right not to be displaced into a space produced for the specific purpose of discrimination in these difficult conditions at the heart of a society which cannot completely oppose them and yet obstructs them rights which define civilization … find their way these rights which are not well recognized progressively become customary before being inscribed into formalized codes they would change reality if they entered into social practice right to work to training and education to health housing leisure to life among these rights in the making features the right to the city not to the ancient city but to urban life to renewed centrality to places of encounter and exchange to life rhythms and time uses enabling the full and complete usage of these moments and places etc lefebvre 1996 1968 178 thus lefebvre’s concern was not to propose a new comprehensive slogan demanding the right to the basic needs it was about something more—a specific urban quality which had hitherto been neglected in public debate access to the resources of the city for all segments of the population and the possibility of experimenting with and realizing alternative ways of life2struggles for the city edit demands for a new and renewed urban life were raised repeatedly during subsequent years in many places and in multiple forms for many of these urban actions urban movements and also urban revolts documentation is fragmentary their history has yet to be written3 in these struggles different demands and frontlines can be identified see also mayer this volume4in many places mainly young people protested against the lack of urban life and demanded fulfillment of the “urban promise” that cities were constantly offering and yet constantly breaking the promise of liberty opportunities for encounter urban culture and appropriation of public space these struggles entailed efforts to create alternative cultural venues and community centers as well as squatting resistance to largescale projects and struggles against the diverse forms of gentrification in the late 1970s and early 1980s many cities in italy western germany the netherlands and even switzerland experienced urban revolts they were expressions of a palpable lack of urban lifestyles the focus was on alternative culture but also on the struggle for public life for tolerance and for openness many other urban moments could be mentioned in this context such as the battles against gentrification in manhattan’s lower east side in the mid 1980s the toronto metropolitan strike of 1996 or the uprisings that flared up in athens in 2008 in recent years moreover there have been increasing instances of urban movements in major east asian cities such as hong kong beijing and seoul quite different strategies of contestation were adopted in struggles to enhance the participation of less privileged and socially disadvantaged groups especially in the neglected innercity districts and suburbs of the west which in some cases developed into “territorial traps” there were many waves of struggle against social exclusion there has been a long history of resurging revolts and clashes in the french banlieues especially in and around paris other countries also experienced uprisings in neglected neighborhoods such as in1981 in london’s brixton district mainly populated by an africancaribbean community or in 1992 in south central la to mention only two examples even longer is the list of urban struggles in the exploding megacities of the global south in particular these include social movements in informal settlements and shantytowns against displacement and neighborhood destruction as well as often successful struggles for improved living conditions and infrastructure in latin america during the 1980s and 1990s urban movements were formed that have in some cases become significant political forces including at the national level for instance major urban social movements developed in mexico city after the devastating earthquake of 1985 or in são paulo during the same period despite the many differences there are obvious similarities among these urban struggles they can be understood in the most general sense as struggles against social exclusion and marginalization and they articulate a demand forcentrality for access to the material and immaterial resources of a city in this sense they address the spatial dialectics of center and periphery and of appropriation and domination complete urbanization and the specificity of the urban edit urban social movements edit against the background of these manifold urban struggles the crucial question is how the urban dialectic can be conceptualized in paris in the early 1970s manuel castells and his colleagues developed the concept of “urban social movements”5 however this concept encompasses only a small segment of urban reality and it mainly takes into account those movements that are oriented towards “collective consumption” see mayer this volume this reflects a very narrow conception of the city as a unit for the daily reproduction of labor power and a narrow political perspective that is focused mainly on organized forms of protest and ignores many spontaneous actions and revolts conversely lefebvre’s reflections were based on a far more open and radical notion of the urban6 he did not however develop a final definitive theory of the urban but embarked on a quest that continued to produce new insights into the phenomenon of urbanization therefore the excavation of isolated passages from his work cannot fully represent the fluidity and openness of his reflections their significance often only unfolds in the context of his complete works tellingly lefebvre’s first major statement of his emergent urban ideas and concepts entitled le droit à la ville the right to the city was presented in the “mythical” year 1968 lefebvre 19961968 only two years later however he subjected this first approach to a fundamental review and extension in another major book la revolution urbaine the urban revolution lefebvre 20031970 the main critique in this latter work concerns precisely the notion of the “city” itself his search for the urban had led lefebvre to a radical shift in his perspective from the analysis of a form the city to a process—urbanization complete urbanization edit the point of departure of this new understanding of the urban is lefebvre’s famous thesis of the complete urbanization of society this thesis states that contemporary social reality can no longer be grasped with the categories “city” and “countryside” but must be analyzed in terms of an emerging urban society the epistemological shift involved here cannot be overestimated lefebvre’s theory constitutes a radical break with the traditional western conception of the city the classic definitions of this notion were based on the assumption that the city is a clearly identifiable unit that provides the environment for a distinctively “urban” way of life for instance simmel 19961903 regarded the city as a cultural form and postulated a nexus between urban morphology and the social organization of coexistence similarly wirth 1938 famously defined the city as a “way of life” built upon three specific material factors of coexistence size density and heterogeneity against these definitions lefebvre’s thesis of complete urbanization points towards a longterm conception of urban transformation as friedrich engels in the condition of the working class in england 2009 1844 had already recognized the industrial revolution marked the beginning of a massive migration from rural areas to the cities in conjunction with the spatial concentration of factories and workers under industrial capitalism lefebvre proceeds to conceptualize the process of industrialization in a general sense as the extension of the industrial logic to society as a whole industrialization and urbanization he states form a highly complex and conflictual unit industrialization supplies the conditions and means of urbanization while urbanization results from the spread of industrial production across the entire globe from this point of view lefebvre derives his understanding of urbanization as a reshaping and colonization of rural areas by an urban fabric as well as a fundamental transformation of historic cities the crucial consequence of this transformation is the dissolution of the city itself for lefebvre the city can no longer be understood as an object or as a definable unit it is instead a historical category that is disappearing as urbanization progresses this also means however that the term “city” itself becomes problematic the concept of the city no longer corresponds to a social object … however the city has a historical existence that is impossible to ignore small and midsize cities will be around for some time an image or representation of the city can perpetuate itself survive its conditions inspire an ideology and urbanist projects in other words the ‘real’ sociological ‘object’ is an image and an ideology lefebvre 2003 57the question thus arises as to how the urban can still be theoretically grasped under conditions in which society as a whole has been urbanized lefebvre’s inquiry into this question yields three core concepts mediation centrality and difference see also schmid 2005 kipfer et al 2008 the urban level mediation in a first approximation lefebvre identifies the urban as a specific level or order of social reality it is an intermediary and mediating level situated between two others—on the one hand the private level the proximate order everyday life and dwelling on the other hand the global level the distant order the world market the state knowledge institutions and ideologies this intermediate level has a decisive function it serves as a relay and as mediation connecting the global and the private levels in urbanized society however the urban level is in danger of being whittled away between the global and the private levels on the one hand industrialization and the logic of the global market produce a universal rationale shaped by technology and thus a tendency towards homogenization the unique traits of the place and its location thus seem to disappear on the other hand space is parceled out and submitted to a corporate individual logic in this attack from “above” and “below” the city is threatened with attrition the result is the dissolution of urban units which disintegrate into countless disconnected fragments leading in turn to the proliferation of overflowing apparently indistinguishable urban landscapes thus the complete urbanization of society tends to eliminate the urban level of mediation however it is only in the most extreme thesis of the disappearance of the city that the importance of the urban becomes visible for lefebvre in this context he suggests the city must be seen as a social resource it constitutes an essential device for the organization of society it brings together diverse elements of society and thus it becomes productive the urban form centrality edit these considerations enable lefebvre to arrive at a new definition of the city—the city as a center in this sense the city creates a condition in which heterogeneous elements no longer exist in isolation as a place of encounter communication and information the city is also a place in which constraints and normality are dissolved and are joined by the elements of the playful and unpredictable the urban is defined as the place where people walk around find themselves standing before and inside piles of objects experience the intertwining of the threads of their activities until they become unrecognizable entangle situations in such a way that they engender unexpected situations lefebvre 2003 39for lefebvre the space–time vector converges to zero in urban space every point can become a focal point that attracts all a privileged place upon which everything converges the city is thus the virtual nullification the negation of distances in time and space “the cancellation of distance haunts the occupants of urban space it is their dream theirsymbolized imaginary represented in a multiplicity of ways” lefebvre 2003 39 centrality therefore does not refer to a concrete geographic situation but to a pure form its logic represents the synchronicity of objects and people that can be assembled around a given point what is it that comes together in urban space centrality as a form does not entail a concrete content but merely defines the possibility of an encounter it constitutes itself both as an act of thought and as a social act mentally it is the synchronicity of events of perceptions and of the elements of a whole socially it amounts to the convergence and combination of goods and activities centrality can thus also be understood as a totality of differences urban space–time difference edit this leads to the third marker of the urban—the city is a place of difference differences are points of active connection and should be clearly distinguished from particularities that remain isolated from one another particularities are derived from nature location and natural resources they are bound to local conditions and are thus derived from rural society they are isolated external and can easily revert into antagonisms however in the course of history such particularities come into mutual contact out of their confrontation arises a mutual “understanding” and thus difference the instant of confrontation is always a decisive one transformed by the confrontation the elements no longer assert themselves in isolation from one another instead they can only present and represent themselves in and through their interactions this gives rise to the concept of difference the concept emerges not just from logical thought but along a variety of paths—the trajectories of history and of multiple dramas in everyday life therefore the specific quality of urban space arises from the simultaneous presence of very different worlds and valuesystems of ethnic cultural and social groups activities and knowledge urban space creates the possibility of bringing together these different elements and making them productive at the same time however they have a constant tendency to separate themselves from one another the decisive question therefore is how these differences are experienced and lived in actual everyday life as kipfer 2008 reminds us there is an important distinction between minimal and maximal difference minimal or induced difference tends towards formal identity which fragments everyday life and pushes social groups into the periphery maximal or produced difference implies a fundamental social transformation the concept of difference as defined by lefebvre must therefore be clearly distinguished from other postmodern definitions for lefebvre difference is a multidimensional concept that arises from gaps in the fabric of everyday life and from political struggles it must be understood as an active element the urban as concrete utopia edit lefebvre’s notion of the urban thus differs fundamentally from the classic conceptionsin urban theory criteria such as size density or heterogeneity as once defined by wirth can hardly be applied to analyze the reality of the contemporary city thus the size of a city can no longer be determined unambiguously and the significance of that criterion is quite limited – smaller cities can also attain a high degree of urbanity the density of a city has practically no bearing on the quality of everyday life either and finally heterogeneity is a necessary but not a sufficient condition of urban life rather the decisive question is whether productive differences arise between the heterogeneous elements therefore the essence of the city is determined not by size density or heterogeneity but by the quality of active everyday processes of interaction in a lefebvrian framework the city can thus be defined as a place where differences encounter acknowledge and explore one another and affirm or cancel out one another distances in space and time are replaced with opposites contrasts and superimpositions and with the coexistence of multiple realities lefebvre’s positive conception of the urban as differential space–time should be understood as referring to a concrete utopia stanek 2011 it points towards a possibility a promise not an already achieved reality it must constantly be produced and reproduced lefebvre 2003 38 this also means however that the term “city” itself becomes problematic accordingly lefebvre himself amended the term “the right to the city” with other terms “the right to centrality” lefebvre 2003 194 “the right to difference” lefebvre 1991 64 and finally “the right to space” lefebvre 1978 317 the production of urban space edit as has become clear lefebvre opened up a new pathway towards defining the urban in la révolution urbaine first of all it constitutes the level of mediation between the global and the private secondly its form is centrality assembly encounter and interaction finally the urban is characterized by difference it is a place where differences come together and generate something new this leads to the question of how these different aspects are related to each other and how they are socially produced it gives rise to a new radical shift in analytical perspective it requires a more general term and a more general theory—the term “space” and the theory of production of space which lefebvre elaborated in la production de l’espace the production of space in 1974 lefebvre 1991 this theory rests on the assumption that the production of space can be split analytically into three dialectically linked dimensions or processes these dimensions – which lefebvre also refers to as “formants” or “moments” in the production of space – are defined in duplicate the first is the triad of “spatial practices” “representations of space” and “spaces of representation” the second is the “perceived” “conceived” and “lived” space this duplicate string of terms points to a twofold approach to space a phenomenological approach on the one hand and a linguistic or semiotic approach on the other schmid 2005 2008 2010 urban practice edit space has first of all a perceptible component that can be grasped with the five senses it relates directly to the materiality of the elements that constitute a space spatial practice combines these elements into a spatial order an order of synchronicity urban space is therefore a place of material interaction and of physical encounter this practical aspect of mediation centrality and difference can be seen as the superimposition and interlacing of networks of production and of communication channels as a combination of social networks in everyday life as places of encounter and exchange that are amenable to surprises and innovations this means that urban space can be empirically observed what is happening in the streets who is present who encounters whom what resources are available and who has access to them primarily what is meant here is the physical presence of people in urban space very often in urban research only the residents of an urban area are considered but urban space also includes those who work there visitors street vendors and diverse types of places shops restaurants meeting places and venues for cultural and social exchange set the stage for urban life these may be permanent facilities or ephemeral occasions—events or celebrations that create opportunities and chances for interaction opportunities for social interaction are however unequally distributed across urban space in certain places urban resources are concentrated while in other areas they are thinly scattered and diffuse the question of access to these resources is immediately linked to their distribution the struggle for the right to remain within urban space has always been among the central questions provoked by urban revitalization programs gentrification or projects for slum improvement due to the huge expansion of urban areas today though this issue is no longer confined to the traditional urban core areas the classic model of urbanity based on the examples of metropolises such as berlin paris or chicago has long been overtaken by worldwide urbanization processes in the overflowing cityscapes of the north and the south manifold new forms of centrality have evolved while these new urban configurations have long been discussed soja 1996 sieverts 2002 such discussions have yet to shed concrete light on the particular question of what new forms of urbanity are emerging and evolving in these areas in order to make some progress in this direction it would be necessary to demarcate new definitions of “urbanity” or “urban quality” based on the effects of interaction processes in urban space for the mere presence of different social groups and networks is not sufficient for the emergence of an urban culture what matters rather is the way they interact and the quality of these interaction processes differences must always be understood dynamically is the outcome an open exchange or are differences curtailed and domesticated such questions also pertain to the immaterial conditions of communication—the rules and norms governing urban spaces this brings us to the second moment in the production of urban space—the conception of space the definition of the urban edit as lefebvre noted a space cannot be perceived without having first been conceived in the mind a conceived space is therefore a depiction that reflects and defines a space and thus also represents it the combination of individual elements into a whole that is subsequently regarded as space requires a mental effort constructions or conceptions of space are supported by social conventions that define which elements are related to one another and which ones are excluded—conventions that are not immutable but often contested and which are negotiated in discursive political practice this is a social production process that is connected to the production of knowledge and power structures in a broader sense the representations of space also include social rules and ethics our conception of the “city” therefore depends on society’s definition of the urban and thus on the idea of the city the design the map the concept or the scientific theory that attempts to define and demarcate the urban as a representation of space the urban initially remains undefined in an urbanized world since the city no longer forms a distinct social or economic unit or a discrete mode of production or way of life there are many ways of defining and demarcating a city such definitions of the city always contain mechanisms of inclusion and exclusion and thus become battlegrounds for a variety of strategies and interests all kinds of political and economic actors urban specialists and intellectuals intervene in this field and urban movements may also have considerable impact these definitions do not mark the end point they immediately translate into political questions for they are directly connected to rules and norms that define who and what is admissible or prohibited and what is included or excluded in urban space often implicit distinctions and invisible boundaries play important roles here that are hidden to the outside observer thus if the “right to the city” is once again demanded today the question immediately arises as to which “city” this right refers to does the demand relate to old or inherited conceptions and images is it a demand to reconstitute the “classic” city or are new forms of the urban being sought the urban experience edit the third dimension in the production of space is what lefebvre calls “spaces of representation” these are spaces that signify “something” they refer not to space itself but to a third other aspect—for instance a divine power logos the state or the male or female principle this dimension of the production of space refers to the process of signification which is expressed in material symbolism the production of significance imparts symbolic meaning to spaces and thus turns them into spaces of representation this aspect of space is encountered or experienced by people in their everyday life which is why lefebvre also calls it “espace vécu” a space that is lived or experienced a lived practical experience cannot be fully grasped by theoretical analysis “something” always remains an ineffable residue that defies analysis and that can only be expressed by artistic means the city is thus always also a concrete practical experience a place of its residents who use it and appropriate it in their everyday practices the nature of a “city” is something that its inhabitants learn from infancy—and something they combine with their memories these worlds of experience and processes of socialization also give rise to implicit value systems whether a city is perceived as a refuge of civilization or as a dangerous and unpredictable place is due mainly to such experiences it is therefore crucial in this context which experiences are inscribed in space and in the collective consciousness such experiences contain both collective and individual aspects they include positive and negative values theymay be banal and commonplace or spectacular and farreaching struggles for the city themselves are constitutive elements of such urban experiences they facilitate concrete processes of appropriation and the recognition that urban spaces can be used in different ways than were previously envisaged thus urban “moments” such as may 1968 in paris are crucial reference points whose effects persist many years later influencing contemporary debates and urban practices in distinctive ways urbanization and urbanity edit the theory of production of space therefore includes at core a threedimensional production process—first material production second the production of knowledge third the production of meaning these three dimensions of the production of space form a contradictory dialectic unity the determination is a threefold one space is only produced through the interaction among all three elements space is the result of production processes that take place in time this basic presupposition leads to a dynamic conception of urban space as being constantly produced and reproduced urban qualities do not appear automatically as the result of urbanization urbanization lays the groundwork for generating urban situations but the latter are created only as the result of multiple actions this also implies a constant struggle over the content of the urban concrete “lived” urbanity is the outcome of continuous conflicts and contestations “the city” is not a general category but a concrete historical one that is perpetuallyl being renewed and redefined – both in theory and in practice from this point of view the “right to the city” may be redefined as the “right to urban space” – that is as the right to participate at the transformation of space and to control investment into space lefebvre 1978 317 the new metropolitan mainstream and the commodification editof the urban edit the rediscovery of the urban edit based on the theoretical reflections sketched above it is possible to decipher some key aspects of global urbanization during the last few decades indeed the history of recent urban struggles reveals a remarkable set of trends while urbanization has accelerated and generalized there is also strong albeit diffuse evidence in many places that urban spaces are being reclaimed this process has been shaped and advanced in manifold ways urban social movements have resisted the transformation and modernization of their cities fought againstcommercialization and displacement and demanded old and new forms of urbanity mixed districts in the city centers street life and public spaces at the same time they have created many kinds of concrete urban spaces and alternative oppositional everyday practices often based on cultural ethnic or sexual differences during the course of the 1970s and 1980s these “urban values” were increasingly embraced by broader social strata this marked the beginning of a long history of a “rediscovery of the urban” a trend which is sometimes also labeled an “urban renaissance” porter and shaw 2008 this rediscovery of the urban was also closely intertwined with the dynamics of globalization which has been closely associated with new forms of centrality and agglomeration7 two aspects are essential here on the one hand centrality plays a key role for global economic control and command functions and for certain forms of innovation especially those that require a wide variety and multiplicity of inputs for the development and creation of complex products on the other hand metropolitan centers became privileged spaces for the new urban elites that had formed under the neoliberal development model sassen 1996 scott 1998 the “other side” of centrality was now revealed—the resurgence of the city as a center of decision making and control long before the proliferation of scholarly interest in “global cities” and “world cities” lefebvre had already predicted the consolidation of new forms of global centrality despite countervailing forces … the centre continues effectively to concentrate wealth means of action knowledge information and ‘culture’ in short everything these capacities and powers are crowned by the supreme power by the ability to concentrate all powers in the power of decision lefebvre 1992 332–3at the same time the metropolitan centers are becoming highgrade consumer products and indeed manage to survive due to their simultaneous role as places of consumption and as consumable places the urban cores are thus turned into citadels of power while their population becomes an elite lefebvre 1996 73 lefebvre 2003 79 lefebvre’s clearsighted analysis sketched a development whose full effects are only today becoming widespread—the global city model has now become generalized as “metropolitan” values cultures and lifestyles are widely accepted and sought after a corresponding set of urban strategies and policies have come to form the new general guidelines of urban development—the metropolitan has become mainstream the new metropolitan mainstream edit the term “new metropolitan mainstream” was developed to decipher a broad range of phenomena that have recently emerged in cities around the world8 initially this mainstream is articulated as a norm that defines what is to be regarded as urban or metropolitan while also presenting certain standards and processes for urban planning and design richard florida’s theses on the “creative class” 2005 which have had a significant ideological impact in urbanpolicy in cities around the world only mark the tip of the iceberg in this regard see peck 2005 as well as krätke’s chapter in this volume these and other relatively banal ideas about how to ignite urban “growth” have been diffused among municipal governments and city councils around the world the promotion of “soft” location factors of “quality of life” for elites and of a prestigious blend of cultural amenities and offerings for luxury consumption is today part of the standard policy repertoire for attracting capital investment and highlyqualified workers accordingly many contemporary cities both in the global north and in the global south have been equipped with skyscrapers flagship projects and “star” architecture the “standard metropolitan architecture” is becoming the new fuel of global urbanization in this context a remarkable shift in the role models for the “urban future” has occurred today “new” metropolises such as dubai shanghai or singapore are much more likely to be seen as exemplars for the future of urban development than the “old” western metropolises such as paris or new york roy 2010 the consequences of these local development strategies for local populations are obvious the longstanding debates on gentrification and the vociferous criticism of urban regeneration and urban revitalization projects do not need to be revisited here see slater this volume smith 2002 porter and shaw 2009 nevertheless it should be pointed out that processes of gentrification and displacement have spread tremendously in recent years while also becoming more differentiated first private and public strategies are increasingly intertwined with urban policies now actively promoting gentrification and the attendant displacement of marginalized populations second many of these strategies are actually proposed and implemented by leftwing and liberal political coalitions closely linked to this development are the manifold processes by which selected segments of erstwhile oppositional milieus are integrated and coopted into the new metropolitan mainstream third the various forms of urban upgrading are also now increasingly spreading on a global scale into the cities of the south into suburban areas and even into smaller cities fourth these trends also entail a significant rescaling of urban development processes of gentrification and displacement are no longer limited to individual neighborhoods rather entire intraurban areas and even large parts of metropolitan regions are upgraded and transformed into zones of reproduction for metropolitan elites a massive increase of land and real estate prices and the accompanying housing crisis have already imposed heavyrestrictions on access to these areas for less privileged parts of the population in the current debate such strategies and policies are often equated with neoliberalism indeed cities and metropolitan regions have become places of strategic importance for neoliberal policies and key institutional arenas in and through which neoliberalism is itself evolving brenner and theodore 2002 leitner et al 2007 nevertheless we must remember that such processes should be regarded as elements of longterm tendencies in capitalist urbanization urbanization leads not only to the dissolution of historic forms of the city and to urban sprawl but also to the formation of new centralities centrality is always ambivalent in this context since on the one hand it creates possibilities for unexpected encounters while conversely it is also susceptible to economic exploitation this ambivalence brings us to yet another process—the commodification of urban life the commodification of the urban edit this development of course is not a new one the city has long been the place where the market has installed itself and flourished and it also constitutes the privileged arena in which the world of commodities unfolds—as walter benjamin 1995 analyzed so brilliantly for the lateninteenth century metropolis of paris what is new however is the systematic economic exploitation of urban space the city itself urban life becomes a commodity this process can be described as the commodification of the urban kipfer and schmid 2004kipfer et al 2008 as lefebvre noted this strategy goes far beyond simply selling space bit by bit space itself and not only the land and real estate becomes exchange value as a consequence urban space becomes the very general object of production and hence of the formation of surplus value the deployment of the world of commodities now affects not only objects but their containers it is no longer limited to content to objects in space more recently space itself has begun to be bought and sold not the earth the soil but social space produced as such with this purpose this finality so to speak lefebvre 2003 154the commodification of the urban has not yet been grasped adequately in all of its dimensions and implications this process encompasses not only the sale of parcels of land and the reservation of exclusive locations for certain population groups at stake more generally is the process by which urban space as such is exploited the entire space is sold—including the people living in it as well as the social resources and the economic effects produced by them urban life itself is implicated in the economic process of valorization and is thereby transformed this means that the qualities of urban space—difference encounter creativity – become part of the economic logic and of systematic exploitation of productivity gains such processes have long been visible in the occupation and control of public space by private actors—shopping malls entertainment centers or private railway and metro stations constitute quasipublic spaces that are controlled by private interests their raison d’être consists exclusively in generating added value accordingly they are designed to channel urban life into commercially exploitable avenues and to prioritize marketoriented and consumptionoriented practices these forms of economic domination are today beginning to spread across entire urban areas in the process the people residents and visitors alike are reduced to mere “extras” in the great urban spectacle appropriation and domination edit at a general level the question of center and periphery is thus transformed into the antagonism between productive and nonproductive ways of consuming space between capitalist “consumers” and collective “users” the contradiction between exchange value and use value when transferred to space thus becomes the contradiction between capitalist domination and the selfdetermined appropriation of space lefebvre 1992 356 359 this implies the question of both economic and political control this aspect of control is ultimately decisive in the privatization of public space and in the creation of manifold forms of privately controlled space from demarcated and segregated districts to gated communities access to the urban arena with its opportunities and possibilities is controlled and economically exploited thus certain social groups succeed in reserving urban spaces for themselves and limiting access for others it is often forgotten that these spaces do not exist in isolation but are part of a concrete historical and geographic context and positioned strategically within their respective urban regions thus the entirety of urban life is transformed eick et al 2007 centralization and peripheralization edit another aspect of centralization must be mentioned in this context—displacement and exclusion from centrality the dialectics of center and periphery must today be reconsidered it has long ceased to be determined in geographic terms and neither does it always follow the logistical principles that are the basis of transportation infrastructure veltz 1996 rather centrality today implies the availability of manifold possibilities and access to social resources conversely peripheralization stands for dispersion demarcation and exclusionfrom urban life this was already problematized in the debates on world cities and global cities in the 1980s and 1990s – it inspired the metaphor of “citadel and ghetto” friedmann and wolff 1982 the “dialectics of centrality and marginality” sassen 1996 and also the concept of the “quartered city” marcuse 1989 today this dialectics is articulated in a new form insofar as the less controlled relatively noncommercialized interstitial spaces within the metropolitan cores are now almost completely disappearing from a general point of view this is a manifestation of the fundamental contradiction within the dialectic of the urban on the one hand the social potential of urban space lies precisely in its capacity to facilitate contacts and mutual interaction between the various parts of society on the other hand access to urban resources is increasingly controlled and appropriated by global metropolitan elites this not only limits access to urban space but also imposes limits on its social productivity in this process urban space loses some of its essential elements but especially its most important characteristic—the possibility of unexpected unplanned encounters and interactions the urban as concrete utopia edit theory and practice edit in contemporary society the urban always remains ambiguous as it is determined by a twofold dialectical movement between centralization and peripheralization on the one hand and between appropriation and domination on the other this theoretical determination must be translated into concrete terms theory is a construction that should not be confused with reality while theory follows the laws of logic practice is determined by the development of society in everyday life therefore the relationship between theory and practice is always complex and contradictionary see brenner this volume and marcuse this volume as lefebvre stated succinctly theory must be steeped in practice in order to become effective in practical terms this means that theoretical analysis must be confronted with practice doing so is always a social act and an intervention in social reality and thus also a confrontation an exchange and an encounter where theory itself is transformed as lefebvre indicates the point of departure of critical social theory should always be everyday life the banal the ordinary changing everyday life this is the real revolution everyday life is today marked by urbanization and we must therefore study its potential with complete urbanization the city is becoming virtually omnipresent and any point has the potential to become central and be transformed into a place of encounter difference and innovation this means viewing urbanization from a different point of view urbanization creates the possibility of an urban society but it must be realized there is no automatism involved this is precisely the historic lesson that lefebvre is communicating the right to the city today edit forty years ago lefebvre observed the rise of a new problematique and introduced the slogan “the right to the city” obviously the situation today is no longer the same and we are living in a completely different urban world nevertheless it is precisely in this situation that this call is heard anew in the “global west” as well as in the “global south” in this context the call for a right to the city also acquires new importance and a new content three tendencies are particularly noticeable here first the focus today is once again on basic needs such as access to shelter food clean water health and education this is due largely to the massive urbanization of the global south but also due to increasing levels of socioeconomic polarization in major parts of the world as the dramatic example of the destruction of new orleans has shown there are situations in which the fulfillment of even the most basic needs is no longer guaranteed in this context the notion of the right to the city acquires a new significance second the call for a right to the city also represents a response to the withdrawal of the national state from many areas of social life significant tasks are today delegated to the regional or local levels this has not only imparted new importance to the local but has also caused increased fragmentation segregation and inequality the various alliances that have coalesced around the rallying cry of the right to the city demand—and through their practice in fact constitute—a new unity in the splintered and fragmented urban regions third such alliances also today facilitate the formation of new collective moments even if many alliances appear at first glance to be pursuing a rather pragmatic course see mayer this volume they contain the potential to reframe the urban question to discover new selfdetermined definitions of the urban in the sprawling urban landscapes and to open up possibilities for conceiving and living different forms of urban life over a decade ago john friedmann 1993 139 stated in his text the right to the city that “a city can truly be called a city only when its streets belong to the people” more recently david harvey’s influential text with the same title defined the right to the city as the right to control the urbanization process and to institute new modes of urbanization harvey 2008 40 although he was writing in an earlier moment lefebvre’s analysis actually went one step further by postulating a generalized form of selfmanagement autogestion généralisée as the basis and expression of that right lefebvre 2003 150 ultimately this means the rearticulation in a radically new context of the longstanding demand for the right to selfdetermination—a right that is indispensible for the creation of a different society possible urban worlds edit today the world is being jolted by a major economic crisis many of the issues identified by lefebvre have apparently been relegated to the background nevertheless it should be clear that even under these new conditions the right to the city must include more than merely the right to exist and to satisfy basic needs this “more” this additional aspect is precisely what defines urban society the urban is a constant reinvention it may assume very diverse formsand the purpose here is not to propose yet another range of normative models this however implies viewing the contemporary urban crisis as an opportunity to imagine alternatives and to create new possible urban worlds9thus the same old issues are at stake albeit in a new context what is a city and what does urban living mean who is to determine the urban future lefebvre opened up a new pathway towards understanding urbanization in his analysis urban society is not an already achieved reality but a potential an open horizon the quality of this analysis is that it transcends mere criticisms of urbanization and proceeds to explore its inherent possibilities and potentials however they can only be realized through a fundamental social transformation—an urban revolution the grand theoretical and practical project that lefebvre envisioned consists of exploring possible pathways towards an urban world where unity no longer positions itself in opposition to difference where the homogenous no longer battles the heterogeneous and where assembly encounter and interaction replace—though not without conflicts—the struggle of individual urban elements that have been turned into antinomies by segregation such an urban space would constitute the social basis for a transformation in everyday life that is open for manifold possibilities—for a radically different world translated by christopher findlay notes edit1 compare eg jacobs 1961 or the polemical critiques of urbanism published in internationale situationiste2 for a discussion of lefebvre’s conception of the right to the city see also purcell 2002gilbert and dikeç 2008 and schmid 20103 until recently there have been relatively few books dealing with urban social movements—see for example mayer et al 1978 castells 1983 inura 1998 hamel et al2000 leitner et al 20074 for the following paragraphs see maggio 1998 schmid 1998

the urban and of urban strugglecan be understood as representing two competing approaches whereas castells followeda form of structural marxism derived from the work of louis althusser lefebvre developeda heterodox and open critical theory inspired by many sources especially by the german dialectics of hegel marx and nietzsche and by french phenomenology see schmid 20107 in this context it is interesting to note that mainstream economic analysis has longneglected this aspect of urban development it was not until the late 1990s that neoclassicaleconomics rediscovered space and centrality
