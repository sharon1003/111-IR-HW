in 1815 the newly established autonomous congress poland de facto belonging to the russian empire found itself without a university at all as vilnius was incorporated into russia the first to be established in congress poland were the law school and the medical school in 1816 tsar alexander i permitted the polish authorities to create a university comprising five departments law and administration medicine philosophy theology and art and humanities the university soon grew to 800 students and 50 professors after most of the students and professors took part in the november 1830 uprising the university was closed down 12 after the crimean war russia entered a brief period of liberalization and the permission was given to create a polish medical and surgical academy  akademia medykochirurgiczna in warsaw in 1862 departments of law and administration philology and history and mathematics and physics were opened the newly established academy gained importance and was soon renamed the main school  szkoła główna  however after the january 1863 uprising the liberal period ended and all polishlanguage schools were closed down again during its short existence the main school educated over 3000 students many of whom became part of the backbone of the polish intelligentsia 13main university campus faculty of physics the main school was replaced with a russianlanguage imperial university of warsaw its purpose was to provide education for the russian military garrison of warsaw the majority of students up to 70 out of an average of 1500 to 2000 students were poles the tsarist authorities believed that the russian university would become a perfect way to russify polish society and spent a significant sum on building a new university campus however various underground organizations soon started to grow and the students became their leaders in warsaw most notable of these groups the supporters of polish revival and the socialists joined the ranks of the 1905 revolution afterwards a boycott of russian educational facilities was proclaimed and the number of polish students dropped to below 10 most of the students who wanted to continue their education left for galicia and western europe 14after the fall of the january uprising 1863–1864 the tsarist authorities decided to convert the main school into a russianlanguage university which functioned under the name of imperial university for 46 years there were two times when the question of moving the university into russia was considered during the 1905–1907 revolution such a proposal was made by some of the professors in the face of a boycott of the university by polish students talks on that subject were conducted with a number of russian cities including voronezh and saratov the russian government finally decided to keep a university in warsaw but as a result of the boycott the university was russian not only in the sense of the language used but also of the nationality of its professors and students 14for the second time the question emerged during the first world war when the military and political situation forced the russian authorities to evacuate beginning from the autumn of 1915 there were two universities of warsaw one polish in warsaw and another russian in rostovondon which functioned until 1917 on 5 may 1917 the russian provisional government decided to close the university of warsaw the decision took effect on 1 july 1917 on the same day the university of the don was inaugurated 15during world war i warsaw was seized by germany in 1915 in order to win the poles for their case and secure the polish area behind the front lines the governments of germany and austriahungary allowed for a certain liberalization of life in poland in accordance with the concept of mitteleuropa german military authorities permitted several polish social and educational societies to be recreated one of these was university of warsaw the polish language was reintroduced and the professors were allowed to return to work in order not to let the polish patriotic movement out of control the number of lecturers was kept low usually not more than 50 but there were no limits on the number of students until 1918 their number rose from a mere 1000 to over 4500 16second polish republic  edituniversity observatory after poland regained its independence in 1918 the university of warsaw began to grow very quickly it was reformed all the important posts the rector senate deans and councils became democratically elected and the state spent considerable amounts of money to modernize and equip it many professors returned from exile and cooperated in the effort by the late 1920s the level of education in warsaw had reached that of western europe 17by the beginning of the 1930s the university of warsaw had become the largest university in poland with over 250 lecturers and 10000 students however the financial problems of the newly reborn state did not allow for free education and students had to pay a tuition fee for their studies an average monthly salary for a year also the number of scholarships was very limited and only approximately 3 of students were able to get one despite these economic problems the university of warsaw grew rapidly new departments were opened and the main campus was expanded 17 after the death of józef piłsudski the senate of the university of warsaw changed its name to józef piłsudski university of warsaw  uniwersytet warszawski im józefa piłsudskiego  the sanacja government proceeded to limit the autonomy of the universities professors and students remained divided for the rest of the 1930s as the system of segregated seating for jewish students known as ghetto benches was implemented customarily not institutionally which should be noted comparable to the era of the civil rights movement in the united states  citation neededworld war ii  editfor more details on this period see underground education in poland during world war iiuniversity main gate july 1944 when campus served as german military barracks after the polish defensive war of 1939 the german authorities of the general government closed all the institutions of higher education in poland the equipment and most of the laboratories were taken to germany and divided amongst the german universities while the main campus of the university of warsaw was turned into military barracks 18german racial theories assumed that no education of poles was needed and the whole nation was to be turned into uneducated serfs of the german race education in polish was banned and punished with death however many professors organized the socalled secret university of warsaw  tajny uniwersytet warszawski  the lectures were held in small groups in private apartments and the attendants were constantly risking discovery and death however the net of underground faculties spread rapidly and by 1944 there were more than 300 lecturers and 3500 students at various courses  citation neededmany students took part in the warsaw uprising as soldiers of the armia krajowa and szare szeregi the germanheld campus of the university was turned into a fortified area with bunkers and machine gun nests it was located close to the buildings occupied by the german garrison of warsaw heavy fights for the campus started on the first day of the uprising but the partisans were not able to break through the gates several assaults were bloodily repelled and the campus remained in german hands until the end of the fights during the uprising and the occupation 63 professors were killed either during fights or as an effect of german policy of extermination of polish intelligentsia the university lost 60 of its buildings during the fighting in 1944 a large part of the collection of priceless works of art and books donated to the university was either destroyed or transported to germany never to return in the peoples republic  editkazimierz palace the university rectorate after world war ii it was not clear whether the university would be restored or whether warsaw itself would be rebuilt however many professors who had survived the war returned and began organizing the university from scratch in december 1945 lectures resumed for almost 4000 students in the ruins of the campus and the buildings were gradually rebuilt until the late 1940s the university remained relatively independent however soon the communist authorities started to impose political controls and the period of stalinism started many professors were arrested by the urząd bezpieczeństwa secret police the books were censored and ideological criteria in employment of new lecturers and admission of students were introduced on the other hand education in poland became free of charge and the number of young people to receive the state scholarships reached 60 of all the students after władysław gomułka s rise to power in 1956 a brief period of liberalization ensued though communist ideology still played a major role in most faculties especially in such faculties as history law economics and political science international cooperation was resumed and the level of education rose 19by mid1960s the government started to suppress freedom of thought which led to increasing unrest among the students a political struggle within the communist party prompted zenon kliszko to ban the production of dziady by mickiewicz at the polish theatre leading to 1968 polish political crisis coupled with antizionist and antidemocratic campaign and the outbreak of student demonstrations in warsaw which were brutally crushed – not by police but by the ormo reserve militia squads of plainclothed workers 20 as a result a large number of students and professors were expelled from the university nonetheless the university remained the centre of free thought and education what professors could not say during lectures they expressed during informal meetings with their students many of them became leaders and prominent members of the solidarity movement and other societies of the democratic opposition which led to the collapse of communism the scientists working at the university of warsaw were also among the most prominent printers of books forbidden by censorship 21campus  editthis section does not cite any
