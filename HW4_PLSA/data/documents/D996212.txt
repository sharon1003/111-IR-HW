riots where umass officials had been called in 47 after the red sox won the world series in 2013 an estimated 3000 students gathered in the outdoor space around south west residence hall in response to the situation umass police officials were called in police accounts state that some students participated in disruptive behavior knocking over trash bins and climbing trees rubber bullets and tear gas were dispersed into the crowds according to wggb 48 14 people were arrested for failing to disperse and 1 for disorderly conduct whether or not the use of police force was necessary is still a controversial topic among students the administration and umass and amherst police department a similar situation had occurred after the patriots lost the super bowl in 2012 officials donning riot gear used smoke grenades to disperse the crowds luckily there were no injuries riots like these are not unheard of within the umass community and go as far back as 1986 the majority of the events are categorized as seemingly peaceful by many students stating that they consist mainly of students standing around chanting and singing there is also still debate among umass students as to whether or not the term “riot” applies to a lot of the occurrences since they seldom involve violence or aggressive behavior from the vast majority of students present nevertheless each event is met with police interference due to a fear of the unsafe environments that large unattended crowds could create in the past there has been friction between members of the student body and the umass police department around their methods of crowd control students have been displeased with what they see as unnecessary force according to mass live 49 other riots include one in 2007 after the boston red sox lost in the 2008 playoffs another when they lost in the world series run in 2006 one after umass’ football team lost in the division iaa football championship in 2006 one after the red sox world series victory in 2004 another after the red sox lost during the 2003 playoffs one after the patriots first super bowl victory over st louis in 2001 and another in 1986 after the red sox world series loss the majority of these riots have been nonviolent on the side of the students except for the 1986 riot in which an argument between hundreds of students intensified into racial altercations where a black student was attacked by 1520 white students and beaten unconscious according to archives from the republican videos and visual accounts of most of these events can be found online in the wake of these events students have worked and are continuously working to start open dialogues with the administration and police department about campus safety the right to gather police force and better

has determined that it will no longer admit iranian national students to specific programs in the college of engineering ie chemical engineering electrical  computer engineering mechanical  industrial engineering and in the college of natural sciences ie physics chemistry microbiology and polymer science  engineering effective february 1 2015 58 the university claims that this announcement was posted because a graduate student entered iran for a project and was later denied a visa this event along with urging from legal advisers contributed to the belief that such incidents inhibited their ability to give iranian students a full program of education and research for iranian students and thus justified changing their admissions policies the ensuing criticism on and off campus as well as wide media publicity changed the minds of school officials as a result umass made a statement on february 18 committing to once again allowing iranian students to apply to the aforementioned graduate programs 59 on the same day an official in the u s department of state stated in an interview that u s laws and regulations do not prevent iranian people from traveling to the united states or studying in engineering program of any u s academic institutions 60 umass amherst replaced the ban with a policy aimed at designing specific curricula for admitted iranian nationals based on their needs while less controversial this policy has still generated backlash with one student saying this university that’s supposed to be so openminded forcing him to sign a document saying he won’t go
