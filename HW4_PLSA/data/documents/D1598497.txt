recognized see list 2synonyms apis mellifica linnaeus 1761the western honey bee or european honey bee  apis mellifera is the most common of the 7–12 species of honey bee worldwide 2 3 the genus name apis is latin for bee and mellifera is the latin for honeybearing referring to the species production of honey for the winter like all honey bees the western honey bee is eusocial creating colonies with a single fertile female or queen many sterile females or workers and small proportion of fertile males or drones individual colonies can house tens of thousands of bees colony activities are organized by complex communication between individuals through both pheromones and the dance language the western honey bee was one of the first domesticated insects and it is the primary species maintained by beekeepers to this day for both its honey production and pollination activities with human assistance the western honey bee now occupies every continent except antarctica because of its wide cultivation this species is the single most important pollinator for agriculture globally honey bees are threatened by pests and diseases especially the varroa mite and colony collapse disorder western honey bees are an important model organism in scientific studies particularly in the fields of social evolution learning and memory they are also used in studies of pesticide toxicity to

life cycle colony life cycle  edita bee swarm bees are nonaggressive in this state since they have no hive to protect unlike most other bee species honey bees have perennial colonies which persist year after year because of this high degree of sociality and permanence honey bee colonies can be considered superorganisms meaning that reproduction of the colony rather than individual bees is the biologically significant unit honey bee colonies reproduce through a process called  swarming  in most climates western honey bees swarm in the spring and early summer when there is an abundance of blooming flowers from which to collect nectar and pollen in response to these favorable conditions the hive creates one to two dozen new queens just as the pupal stages of these daughter queens are nearly complete the old queen and approximately twothirds of the adult workers leave the colony in a swarm traveling some distance to find a new location suitable for building a hive eg a hollow tree trunk in the old colony the daughter queens often start piping just prior to emerging as adults 8 and when the daughter queens eventually emerge they fight each other until only one remains the survivor then become the new queen if one of the sisters emerges before the others she may kill her siblings while they are still pupae before they have a chance to emerge as adults once she has dispatched her rivals the new queen the only fertile female lays all the eggs for the old colony which her mother has left virgin females are able to lay eggs which develop into males a trait shared with wasps bees and ants because of haplodiploidy  however she requires a mate to produce female offspring which comprise 90 or more of bees in the colony at any given time thus the new queen goes on one or more nuptial flights each time mating with 1–17 drones 9 once she has finished mating usually within two weeks of emerging she remains in the hive laying eggs throughout the rest of the growing season the colony produces many workers who gather pollen and nectar to prepare for winter the average population of a healthy hive in midsummer may be as high as 40000 to 80000 bees nectar from flowers is processed by worker bees who evaporate it until the moisture content is low enough to discourage mold transforming it into honey which can then be capped over with wax and stored almost indefinitely in the temperate climates to which western honey bees are adapted the bees gather in their hive to wait out the winter during which the queen may stop laying during this time activity is slow and the colony consumes its stores of honey for energy to stay warm in mid to late winter the queen starts laying again in preparation for spring this is probably triggered by day length  depending on the subspecies new queens and thus swarms may be produced every year or less frequently depending on local environmental conditions individual bee life cycle  editlarvae  left and eggs  rightlike other insects that undergo complete metamorphosis the western honey bee has four distinct life stages egg larva pupa and adult the complex social structure of honey bee hives means that all of these life stages occur simultaneously throughout much of the year the queen deposits a single egg into each cell prepared by worker bees the egg hatches into a legless eyeless larva fed by nurse bees worker bees who maintain the interior of the colony after about a week the larva is sealed in its cell by the nurse bees and begins its pupal stage after another week it emerges as an adult bee it is common for defined regions of the comb to be filled with young bees also called  brood  while others are filled with pollen and honey stores worker bees secrete the wax used to build the hive clean maintain and guard it raise the young and forage for nectar and pollen and the nature of the workers role varies with age for the first ten days of their lives worker bees clean the hive and feed the larvae after this they begin building comb cells on days 16 through 20 workers receive nectar and pollen from older workers and store it after the 20th day a worker leaves the hive and spends the remainder of its life as a forager although worker bees are usually infertile females when some subspecies are stressed they may lay fertile eggs since workers are not fully sexually developed they do not mate with drones and thus can only produce haploid male offspring queens and workers have a modified ovipositor a stinger with which they defend the hive unlike bees of any other genus and the queens of their own species the stinger of worker honey bees is barbed contrary to popular belief a bee does not always die soon after stinging this misconception is based on the fact that a bee will usually die after stinging a human or other mammal the stinger and its venom sac with musculature and a ganglion allowing them to continue delivering venom after they are detached are designed to pull free of the body when they lodge this apparatus including barbs on the stinger is thought to have evolved in response to predation by vertebrates since the barbs do not function and the stinger apparatus does not detach unless the stinger is embedded in elastic material the barbs do not always catch so a bee may occasionally pull its stinger free and fly off unharmed or sting again although the average lifespan of a queen in most subspecies is three to five years reports from the germaneuropean black bee subspecies previously used for beekeeping indicate that a queen can live up to eight years 10 because a queens store of sperm is depleted near the end of her life she begins laying more unfertilized eggs for this reason beekeepers often replace queens every year or two the lifespan of workers varies considerably over the year in regions with long winters workers born in spring and summer will work hard living only a few weeks but those born in autumn will remain inside for several months as the colony clusters on average during the year about one percent of a colonys worker bees die naturally per day 11 except for the queen all of a colonys workers are replaced about every four months social caste  editbehavioral and physiological differences between castes and subcastes arise from phenotypic plasticity which relies on gene expression rather than heritable genotypic differences 12 13queens  editmain article queen bee the queen bee is a fertile female who unlike workers which are genetically also female has a fully developed reproductive tract she is larger than her workers and has a characteristic rounder longer abdomen a female egg can become either a queen or a worker bee workers and queens are both fed royal jelly which is high in protein and low in flavanoids during the first three days of their larval stage workers are then switched to a diet of mixed pollen and nectar often called bee bread while queens will continue to receive royal jelly in the absence of flavanoids and the presence of a highprotein diet queen bees develop a healthy reproductive tract 14 —a task necessary for maintaining a colony of tens of thousands of daughterworkers periodically the colony determines that a new queen is needed there are three general causes the hive is filled with honey leaving little room for new eggs this will trigger a swarm where the old queen will take about half the worker bees to found a new colony and leave the new queen with the other half of the workers to continue the old one the old queen begins to fail which is thought to be demonstrated by a decrease in queen pheromones throughout the hive this is known as supersedure and at the end of the supersedure the old queen is generally killed the old queen dies suddenly a situation known as emergency supersedure the worker bees find several eggs or larvae of the appropriate age range and attempt to develop them into queens emergency supersedure can generally be recognized because new queen cells are built out from comb cells instead of hanging from the bottom of a frame regardless of the trigger workers develop the larvae into queens by continuing to feed them royal jelly peanutlike queen brood cells extend outward from the brood comb queens are not raised in the typical horizontal brood cells of the honeycomb a queen cell is larger and oriented vertically if workers sense that an old queen is weakening they produce emergency cells known as supersedure cells made from cells with eggs or young larvae and which protrude from the comb when the queen finishes her larval feeding and pupates she moves into a headdownward position and later chews her way out of the cell at pupation workers cap seal the cell the queen asserts control over the worker bees by releasing a complex suite of pheromones known as queen scent after several days of orientation in and around the hive the young queen flies to a drone congregation point – a site near a clearing and generally about 30 feet 91 m above the ground – where drones from different hives congregate they detect the presence of a queen in their congregation area by her smell find her by sight and mate with her in midair drones can be induced to mate with dummy queens with the queen pheromone a queen will mate multiple times and may leave to mate several days in a row weather permitting until her spermatheca is full the queen lays all the eggs in a healthy colony the number and pace of egglaying is controlled by weather resource availability and specific racial characteristics queens generally begin to slow egglaying in the early fall and may stop during the winter egglaying generally resumes in late winter when the days lengthen peaking in the spring at the height of the season the queen may lay over 2500 eggs per day more than her body mass she fertilizes each egg with stored sperm from the spermatheca as it is laid in a workersized cell eggs laid in dronesized larger cells are left unfertilized these unfertilized eggs with half as many genes as queen or worker eggs develop into drones workers  editworkers are sterile females produced by the queen that develop from fertilized diploid eggs workers are essential for social structure and proper colony functioning they carry out the main tasks of the colony because the queen is occupied with only reproducing these females will raise their sister workers and future queens that eventually leave the nest to start their own colony they also forage and return to the nest with nectar and pollen to feed the young drones  editdevelopment of a drone pupa pupae of drones main article drone beedrones are the colonys male bees since they do not have ovipositors they do not have stingers drone honey bees do not forage for nectar or pollen the primary purpose of a drone is to fertilize a new queen many drones will mate with a given queen in flight each will die immediately after mating since the process of insemination requires a lethally convulsive effort drone honey bees are haploid single unpaired chromosomes in their genetic structure and are descended only from their mother the queen in temperate regions drones are generally expelled from the hive before winter dying of cold and starvation since they cannot forage produce honey or care for themselves there has been research into the role a mellifera drones play in thermoregulation within the hive given their larger size 15x drones may play a significant role drones are typically located near the center of hive clusters for unclear reasons it is postulated that it is to maintain sperm viability which drops off at cooler temperatures another possible explanation is that a more central location allows drones to contribute to warmth since at temperatures below 25 °c their ability to contribute declines 15queenworker conflict  editmain article worker policing when a fertile female worker produces drones a conflict arises between her interests and those of the queen the worker shares half her genes with the drone and onequarter with her brothers favouring her offspring over those of the queen the queen shares half her genes with her sons and onequarter with the sons of fertile female workers 16 this pits the worker against the queen and other workers who try to maximize their reproductive fitness by rearing the offspring most related to them this relationship leads to a phenomenon known as worker policing in these rare situations other worker bees in the hive who are genetically more related to the queens sons than those of the fertile workers will patrol the hive and remove workerlaid eggs another form of workerbased policing is aggression toward fertile females 17 some studies have suggested a queen pheromone which may help workers distinguish worker and queenlaid eggs but others indicate egg viability as the key factor in eliciting the behavior 18 19 worker policing is an example of forced altruism where the benefits of worker reproduction are minimized and that of rearing the queens offspring maximized in very rare instances workers subvert the policing mechanisms of the hive laying eggs which are removed at a lower rate by other workers this is known as anarchic syndrome anarchic workers can activate their ovaries at a higher rate and contribute a greater proportion of males to the hive although an increase in the number of drones would decrease the overall productivity of the hive the reproductive fitness of the drones mother would increase anarchic syndrome is an example of selection working in opposite directions at the individual and group levels for the stability of the hive 20under ordinary circumstances the death or removal of a queen increases reproduction in workers and a significant proportion of workers will have active ovaries in the absence of a queen the workers of the hive produce a last batch of drones before the hive eventually collapses although during this period worker policing is usually absent in certain groups of bees it continues 21according to the strategy of kin selection worker policing is not favored if a queen does not mate multiple times workers would be related by threequarters of their genes and the difference in relationship between sons of the queen and those of the other workers would decrease the benefit of policing is negated and policing is less favored experiments confirming this hypothesis have shown a correlation between higher mating rates and increased rates of worker policing in many species of social hymenoptera 22behavior  editthermoregulation  editforaging honey bee the honey bee needs an internal body temperature of 35 °c 95 °f to fly this temperature is maintained in the nest to develop the brood and is the optimal temperature for the creation of wax the temperature on the periphery of the cluster varies with outside air temperature and the winter cluster s internal temperature may be as low as 20–22 °c 68–72 °f honey bees can forage over a 30 °c 86 °f airtemperature range because of behavioral and physiological mechanisms for regulating the temperature of their flight muscles from low to high air temperatures the mechanisms are shivering before flight and stopping flight for additional shivering passive bodytemperature regulation based on work and evaporative cooling from regurgitated honeysac contents body temperatures differ depending on caste and expected foraging rewards 23the optimal air temperature for foraging is 22–25 °c 72–77 °f during flight the bees relatively large flight muscles create heat which must dissipate the honey bee uses evaporative cooling to release heat through its mouth under hot conditions heat from the thorax is dissipated through the head the bee regurgitates a droplet of warm internal fluid — a honeycrop droplet – which reduces the temperature of its head by 10 °c 18 °f 24below 7–10 °c 45–50 °f bees are immobile and above 38 °c 100 °f their activity slows honey bees can tolerate temperatures up to 50 °c 122 °f for short periods communication  editmain article bee learning and communication a large honeybee swarm on a fallen tree trunk honeybee behavior has been extensively studied since bees are widespread and familiar karl von frisch who received the 1973 nobel prize in physiology or medicine for his study of honeybee communication noticed that bees communicate with dance through these dances bees communicate information regarding the distance the situation and the direction of a food source by the dances of the returning honey bee worker bee on the vertical comb of the hive 25 honey bees direct other bees to food sources with the round dance and the waggle dance although the round dance tells other foragers that food is within 50 metres 160 ft of the hive it provides insufficient information about direction the waggle dance which may be vertical or horizontal provides more detail about the distance and direction of a food source foragers are also thought to rely on their olfactory sense to help locate a food source after they are directed by the dances unlike a mellifera apis florea do not change the precision of the waggle dance to indicate the type of site that is set as a new goal 26 therefore apis mellifera bees are better at conveying information than its closely related species and this further supports the notion that a mellifera honeybees are more evolved than apis florea 27another means of communication is the shaking signal also known as the jerking dance vibration dance or vibration signal although the shaking signal is most common in worker communication it also appears in reproductive swarming a worker bee vibrates its body dorsoventrally while holding another bee with its front legs jacobus biesmeijer who examined shaking signals in a foragers life and the conditions leading to its performance found that experienced foragers executed 921 percent of observed shaking signals and 64 percent of these signals were made after the discovery of a food source about 71 percent of shaking signals occurred before the first five successful foraging flights of the day other communication signals such as the waggle dance were performed more often after the first five successes biesmeijer demonstrated that most shakers are foragers and the shaking signal is most often executed by foraging bees on preforaging bees concluding that it is a transfer message for several activities or activity levels sometimes the signal increases activity as when active bees shake inactive ones at other times such as the end of the day the signal is an inhibitory mechanism however the shaking signal is preferentially directed towards inactive bees all three forms of communication among honey bees are effective in foraging and task management pheromones  editmain article honey bee pheromones pheromones substances involved in chemical communication are essential to honeybee survival honey bees rely on pheromones for nearly all behaviors including mating alarm defense orientation kin and colony recognition food production and integrating colony activities 28 29domestication  edita honey hunter in a cave painting at cuevas de la araña spain c 8000–6000 bcbee hieroglyph from the tomb complex of senusret i d 1926 bcfurther information domestication the honey bee is one of the few invertebrate animals to have been domesticated humans collected wild honey in the palaeolithic or mesolithic periods with evidence from rock art from france and spain around 8000 years old bees were likely first domesticated in ancient egypt where tomb paintings depict beekeeping europeans brought bees to north america in 1622 30 31beekeepers have selected bees for several desirable features 30the ability of a colony to survive periods with little food 30the ability of a colony to survive cold weather 30resistance to disease 30increased honeyproduction 30reduced aggressiveness 30reduced tendency to swarm 30reduced nestbuilding 30easy pacification with smoke 30these modifications along with artificial change of location have improved bees from the point of view of the beekeeper and simultaneously made them more dependent on beekeepers for their survival in europe coldweather survival was likely selected for consciously or not while in africa selection probably favoured the ability to survive heat drought and heavy rain 30authors do not agree on whether this degree of artificial selection constitutes genuine domestication in 1603 john guillim wrote the bee i may well reckon a domestik insect being so pliable to the benefit of the keeper 32 more recently many biologists working on pollination take the domesticated status of honey bees for granted 33 34 for example rachael winfree and colleagues write we used crop pollination as a model system and investigated whether the loss of a domesticated pollinator the honey bee could be compensated for by native wild bee species 35 similarly brian dennis and william kemp write although the domestication of the honey bee is closely connected to the evolution of foodbased socioeconomic systems in many cultures throughout the world in current economic terms and in the u s alone the estimated wholesale value of honey more than 317 million dollars in 2013 pales in comparison to aggregate estimated annual value of pollination services variously valued at 11–15 billion 36on the other hand p r oxley and b p oldroyd 2010 consider the domestication of bees at best partial 37 oldroyd observes that the lack of full domestication is somewhat surprising given that people have kept bees for at least 7000 years instead beekeepers have found ways to manage bees using hives while the bees remain largely unchanged from their wild cousins 38 leslie bailey and b v ball in their book honey bee pathology call honey bees feral insects in contrast to the silkworm  bombyx mori which they call the only insect that has been domesticated and refer to the popular belief among many biologists as well as beekeepers that bees are domesticated they argue that honey bees are able to survive without mans help and in fact require to be left at liberty to survive they argue further that even if bees could be raised away from the wild they would still have to fly freely to gather nectar and pollinate plants therefore they argue beekeeping is the exploitation of colonies of a wild insect with little more than the provision of a weatherproof cavity for them to nest in 39 pilar de la rua and colleagues likewise argue that honey bees are not fully domesticated since endemic subspeciesspecific genetic footprints can still be identified in europe and africa making conservation of wildbee diversity important they further argue that the difficulty of controlling drones for mating is a serious handicap and a sign that domestication is not complete in particular as extensive gene flow usually occurs between wildferal and managed honeybee populations 40beekeeping  editmain article beekeeping this section needs additional citations for verification march 2017

44 honey is a biological mixture of inverted sugars primarily glucose and fructose it has antibacterial and antifungal properties honey from the western honey bee along with the bee tetragonisca angustula has specific antibacterial activity towards an infection causing bacteria staphylococcus aureus 45 honey will not rot or ferment when stored under normal conditions however it will crystallize over time although crystallized honey is acceptable for human use bees can only use liquid honey and will remove and discard crystallized honey from the hive honey bee with tongue partially extended bees produce honey by collecting nectar a clear liquid consisting of nearly 80 percent water and complex sugars the collecting bees store the nectar in a second stomach and return to the hive where worker bees remove the nectar the worker bees digest the raw nectar for about 30 minutes using enzymes to break down the complex sugars into simpler ones raw honey is then spread in

honey bee colonies in a number of regions the european honey bee is the third insect after the fruit fly and the mosquito to have its genome mapped according to scientists who analyzed its genetic code the honey bee originated in africa and spread to europe in two ancient migrations 4 scientists have found that genes related to smell outnumber those for taste and the european honey bee has fewer genes regulating immunity than the fruit fly and the mosquito 55 the genome sequence also revealed that several groups of genes particularly those related to circadian rhythm resembled those of vertebrates more than other insects another significant finding from the honey bee genome study was that honey bee was the first insect to be discovered with a functional dna methylation system because functional key enzymes dna methyltransferase 1 and 3 were identified in the genome dna methylation is one of the important mechanisms in epigenetics to study gene expression and regulation without changing the dna sequence but modifications on the dna 56 dna methylation later was identified to play an important role in gene regulation and gene alternative splicing 57 the genome is
