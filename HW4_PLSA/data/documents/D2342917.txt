games  recreation amusement parks six flags kids ticket ages what is the age range for the six flags kids tickets i have a couple free kids tickets that i got from a friend but am not sure they will work with my group i have a 16 yr old 14 yr old and 13 yr old in our group will the tickets work for them follow 3 answers answers relevance rating newest oldest best answer six flags ticket prices dont go by age but rather by height yes children under 2 years old are free but after that the price of a ticket is determined by whether or not the child is over 48 inchesif they are shorter than that then they can use a junior admission which is what im assuming youve got unfortunately that is more than likely too short even for a 13 year old so if you do indeed have the junior admission tickets and not some other special kind then you wont be able to use them with your groupwhoserloser · 1 decade ago0 0 comment askers ratingticket vary from park to park but for magic mountain ticket prices at the park  general admission 5999  child admission under 48 2999  2  under free you can go to wwwsixflagscom and find out the full detailsviperej · 1 decade ago0 0 commentno they wont work because you hav to be under 12justin l · 1 decade ago0 0 comment maybe you would like to learn more about one of these want to build a free website find moving container services time for a caribbean cruise try online nursing courses
