no refrigeration meals july 13 2011 by carolyn shearlock four days of great meals for a trip without refrigeration and only a twoburner camp stove — with a little planning you can eat surprisingly wellwhile i’ve gone without refrigeration or even a cooler for four months on two different occasions it was only after a number of shorter trial runs where i refined my techniques and recipes success on shorter trips convinced us that we could do longer trips to give you some ideas of meals and how i use the most perishable items first here are our actual meals from a 4day trip breakfasts cold cereal with milk or soy milk juice and coffee other options oatmeal – add some dried fruit and nuts if desired fried boiled or scrambled eggs precooked bacon toast or bagels peanut butter or jam optionalyogurt with dried fruit nuts andor granola storing veggies without refrigeration quick referencehaving a wide variety of fresh veggies really makes meals better many vegetables will last a surprising length of time without even a cooler — weeks to a month or more i made a cheat sheet for storing 12 veggies without refrigeration — a onepage set of reminders on how to store various things and how long they’ll last it’s really just the tip of the iceberg as far as storing food without refrigeration goes but it’s a great starting point yep it’s free lunches couscous salad – couscous onion cucumber green pepper tomato oil vinegar salt pepper and a touch of sugar i make it pretty much the same way i do pasta or rice salad — couscous just cooks a lot faster individual cups of applesauce ham salad wraps – a can of ham diced onion a sliced tomato some napa cabbage and some mayonnaise all wrapped in tortillas tortillas are a good alternative to bread for “sandwiches” as they don’t get squashed and they’re far less likely to mold oranges vegetable salad a la que tal – can of green beans some extra pasta that i cooked for dinner the night before small can of corn drained onion tomato dried fruit marinated artichoke hearts use the oil from the jar instead of adding oil dash of sugar and balsamic vinegar snack lunch – a small jar of peanut butter and box of wheat thins a bag of nuts a bag of dried fruit one of carrots also good with the peanut butter and a little bag of olives dinners tacos and a tossed salad – use a can of roast beef and drainrinse the gravy off shred the meat and heat it up with spices or a packet of taco seasoning serve with tortillas salsa diced onion green pepper and sour cream made from nonrefrigerated ingredients note you won’t need a full batch of sour cream so reserve some for the tacos and use the rest with your favorite dip mix to make an appetizer tossed salad with tomatoes cucumbers red onion black olives and a vinaigrette dressing chicken apricots  almonds over couscous – a can of chicken breast dried apricots whole almonds a little flour honey and cinnamon plus the couscous drain liquid from the chicken breast into a pan and mix in about 2 teaspoons of flour a dash of cinnamon and a generous spoonful of honey bring it all to a boil and add the apricots simmer five minutes then turn the burner off and add chicken and almonds mixing very gently let sit 3 to 5 minutes to warm through while this is cooking make couscous according to package directions serve chicken mixture over couscous optional extra panroasted veggies – use a tablespoon of oil or butter and saute a bunch of mixed vegetables with a dash of salt and pepper or mrs dash our favorite veggies depend on what looks good at the market but will often include zucchini or summer squash onion quarters baby carrots and mushrooms special treat chocolateoatmeal nobake cookies pasta supreme – saute a can of shrimp or ham onion chunks and a drained can of mushrooms or fresh if you have them with some garlic and italian seasoning add a small jar of sundried tomatoes in olive oil and a small drained can of sliced black olives at the same time cook pasta toss it all together and serve chili corn bread and coleslaw – make the chili with one can each of drained roast beef kidney beans and diced tomatoes plus some diced onions and green peppers and a variety of spices make corn bread from a box mix coleslaw made from chopped cabbage a can of pineapple tidbits a handful of peanuts and mayonnaise share 661 pin 1088k email1094kfiled under food  cooking tagged with meal planning no refrigeration
