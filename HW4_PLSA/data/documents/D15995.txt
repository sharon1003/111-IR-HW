color vs colour  the great spelling battle by ruecian  september 5 2007 53 comments its been asked innumerable times whats the deal with using colour in some places of this site and color in others to us it is the same idea and the same love were sharing just with different ways of spelling it but for those who want more of an explanation here is some history of the word and why we use both spellings share this post tweet the history of word the origin of the word colour is in middle english developed into modern english in 16th century which actually borrows from anglonorman french in this case colour has many definitions and uses about nine and then a tonne of little bullets somewhere between colonisation revolution and the industrial revolution the english language had no central regulation samuel johnsons dictionary of the english language 1755 is the source of most of the current british spellings but american english became somewhat simplified in spelling during the times between this books publication and noah webster and his an american dictionary of the english language of 1828 webster was a large part in changing the spelling of the language because of his philosophies and strong nationalism what wouldve been seen then as the correct spellings have been listed as variants and still are today so the unstressed our favour flavour colour savour became or favor flavor color savor the few re endings in british spelling centre metre litre manoeuvre became er center meter liter maneuver and ce defence offence pretence became se defense offense pretense because of wide usage in both countries and acceptance onto the pedastal of dictionaries both spellings are accepted today though it seems that when in rome follows and canada got caught in the middle of it all using mostly british spellings with some american leaking in tung or tounge ruf or rough batl or battle in 1878 a committee of american philologists began preparing a list of proposed new spellings and two years later the philological society of england joined in the work in 1883 a joint manifesto was issued recommending various general simplifications among those enlisted in the movement were charles darwin lord tennyson sir john lubbock and sir j a h murray in 1886 the american philological association issued independently a list of recommendations affecting about 3500 words and falling under ten headings practically all of the changes proposed had been put forward 80 years before by webster and some of them had entered into unquestioned american usage in the meantime e g the deletion of the u from the our words the substitution of er for re at the end of words and the reduction of traveller to traveler the trouble with the others was that they were either too uncouth to be adopted without a long struggle or likely to cause errors in pronunciation to the first class belonged tung for tounge ruf for rough batl for battle and abuv for above and to the second such forms as cach for catch and troble for trouble then in 1906 came the organization of the simplified spelling board with an endowment of 15000 a year from andrew carnegie and a formidable list of members and collaborators including henry bradley f i furnivall c h grandgent w w skeat t r lounsbury and f a march the board at once issued a list of 300 revised spellings new and old and in august 1906 president roosevelt ordered their adoption by the government printing office h l mencken 1880â€“1956 the american language 1921 us cartoon from 1906 about roosevelts simplified spelling technologies influence on spelling the internet is an international experience but a large number of the biggest internet companies are american google microsoft yahoo aol these top search engines dont treat the different spelling of color as the same word ie a search for color wont give you a site with the word spelled with a u a search for colour wont give you sites with the american spelling when we first created colourlovers we used the british spelling throughout the site but overtime we realized we were being penalized by the search engines so we switched over to using the american spelling since we have an international audience of members and writers they use their preferred spelling of the words so we loosely switch between the two as we build out our language feature to allow colourlovers to be read in german french japanese etc weve playfully been considering having american and british options because people seem to be so heated in their preference of the spelling a google search for colour does not return a did you mean result one color got caught in the fight out of all our color names one got caught up in the americanbritish spelling wars grey became the established british spelling in the 20th century and is but a minor variant in american english according to dictionaries canadians tend to prefer grey some suggest that american writers tend to assign wistful positive connotations to grey as in a grey fog hung over the skyline whereas gray often carries connotations of drabness a gray gloomy day color colour couleur colore how do you say it
