online articket bcnpurchase5 online and skip the line barcelona night card purchase entrance to clubs weather and temperature in july the climate in july is certainly perfect for any tourist who is particularly interested in spending time on the beach in good weather and in spite of not being the month in which the highest temperatures are recorded which is august it’s not far off and it does statistically have the lowest rainfall of the year which is of course an advantage you would have very bad luck if you were to come to barcelona in july and experience bad weather as the temperatures can soar on many days in july it’s advisable to visit places that are indoors and benefit from air conditioning in the hottest part of the day and this advice is especially recommended for those who aren’t used to the heat with very few exceptions the museums the smallest of shops and all public transport  metro buses tram train and taxis are air conditioned so spending time in any of these places will help you to overcome these hottest hours of the day climate statistics for july average maximum temperature 277ºc average minimum temperature 184ºc average overall temperature 229ºc average rainfall 198mm sunrise 0621 1st july – 0645 31st july sunset 2129 1st july – 2110 31st july advice advantages and drawbacks advice a day trip as we’ve said for if you’re visiting in august if you’re in barcelona for a few days in july we encourage you to plan a day trip to one of the most beautiful towns on the costa brava in the girona region we especially recommend calella de palafrugell begur tossa de mar and cadaqués all of which have beaches and coves where you will be able to enjoy a wonderful day on the beach another town that we suggest visiting is peratallada constructed in stone which doesn’t have a beach so we’d recommend heading there towards the end of the day to have a wander round the town and a drink outside one of the bars for everyone else we simply suggest that you enjoy everything that barcelona has to offer in summer and there’s plenty to enjoy and then if you like what you see you can always return at another time of year which will allow you to see another side to barcelona advantages everything that comes with the start of summer enjoying the sun barcelona’s beaches and some of the most beautiful coastal towns of catalunya as well as the most lively night life or to put it another way barcelona in its purest state drawbacks everything that the start of summer brings with it the huge amount of tourists that descend on the city attracted by everything it has to offer during the month of july mean that restaurants bars and cafés will be much busier and there will be bigger queues to see the most famous museums and sights in spite of this we still think the drawbacks are small when weighed up with everything that barcelona has to offer its visitors in july other months in barcelona barcelona in january barcelona in february barcelona
