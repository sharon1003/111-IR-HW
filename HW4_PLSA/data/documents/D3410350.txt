lessons at two trees stables in bridgehampton still despite the generally high cost of housing the towns and villages on the eastern end of long island offer a variety of secondhome options for many different kinds of fortunes and many different personalities long island is the largest island on the east coast stretching about 120 miles from new york city at its eastern end the island diverges into two arms called the north and south forks the north is known for its vineyards and quiet villages while the south is home to the hamptons which are divided into two main townships southampton and east hampton and several independently governed incorporated villages within those towns including confusingly southampton village and east hampton village while some hamptons towns or villages have more desirability than others sagaponack is hot right now and east hampton village is a perennial star home costs are also determined by whether they are north or south of route 27 the main artery of the south fork south of the highway is more coveted because it is closest to the ocean westhampton for most new yorkers the hamptons begin at westhampton and westhampton beach they offer a relatively short commute from new york about two hours mainly on big highways or the long island rail road plus great beaches and a thriving commercial center this area also attracts group rentals and daytrippers who don’t want to spend their entire weekend battling the traffic on route 27 for those looking to buy according to connie walsh of corcoran realty in westhampton beach you could easily pay 1 million for “a twobedroom shack”quogue the next stop east has an oldfashioned smalltown feel with a mix of traditional shingled estate homes and humble 1950’s ranch houses it’s quiet and familyoriented and group shares are frowned upon by locals the town has the tiniest of villages — just a liquor store a coffee shop and an inn “it’s become the little east hampton or sagaponack of west of the canal” said ms walsh adding that a new home on the waterfront could garner as much as 15 million “but it’s nothing compared to out east what would be 10 million here would be 22 million in southampton”those looking for a bargain — a bargain in hamptonsspeak correlates to under 1 million — will probably do better in east quogue the houses are smaller but many have their own boat slips hampton bays is a bigger town but has small homes and smaller prices threebedroom homes start just under 1 million southampton southampton has long been one of the social centers of long island founded in the 17th century by english colonists southampton was established as a fishing village today some of the architecture reflects its origins main street is wide and treelined at the center of a quaint but fashionable village filled with restaurants art galleries clothing boutiques and homefurnishing shops including a branch of saks fifth avenue wooden benches dot the sidewalk providing spots to sip coffee while people watching for famous folk a mix of old money industry and media power brokers and newer hollywood personalities southampton’s highprofile restaurants and nightclubs serve as a playground to this second home population both the billionaire george soros and henry kravis the financier have homes in the area just as exclusive are the town’s private golf courses which include the shinnecock hills golf club threetime host to the u s open the national golf links of america and the soontoopen sebonack golf club where membership by invitation only is in the 600000 range housing prices as always depend on location pat petrillo of sotheby’s international real estate cited a recent transaction in the southampton estate section where a house on 18 acres with a pool and tennis court was sold for 14 million “about five years ago you would have expected to buy oceanfront for that” she said in the nearby village of water mill richard gere paid 27 million for his home in 2001 and now just the ground it’s on could be worth as much “you can’t touch land in water mill for under a million dollars” said huck esposito of blue bay realty “and that’s raw land” houses he added are in the multimilliondollar range bridgehampton painted with bucolic views this former whaling and farming village is ripe with farm stands and fresh produce markets it’s also home to one of the south fork’s few wineries channing daughters just to the west of the main village lies bridgehampton commons which provides retail staples like the gap banana republic kmart and also the king kullen supermarket“a lot of people love the openness of bridgehampton” said rylan jacka a broker with prudential douglas elliman who recently moved there from east hampton “the sky seems to open up there its not as woodsy you just get these amazing summer sunsets with magenta skies and tractors driving on the streets”thanks to a surge of modernism in the 1980’s there’s a mix of architectural styles land south of the highway starts at 4 million an acre according to mr jacka a house on that land could cost up to 20 million sagaponack formerly known for its agricultural bent and potato fields the recently incorporated village of sagaponack has in the last few years started to sprout some of the highest prices in the hamptons “the price of property has gone to about 25 million an acre in sagaponack” said rich gherardi owner of sand dollar development “the houses are selling for between 7 and 8 million” recently forbes magazine named sagaponack the most expensive zip code in the country in 2005 the median home sale price was 2787500 the style of the highpriced houses mr gherardi added is traditional with cedarwood shingled mansions weatherworn to silver gray offset by white trim and topped with high gables despite the lack of an actual central village or perhaps because of it wealthy home buyers are attracted to this exclusive enclave with just a few streets and large parcels of land it offers seclusion privacy and oceanfront views inland homes are in the 2 million range “the waterfront is so out of reach for a lot of people so they’ve drifted north into the farmlands like sagaponack and wainscott” said huck esposito of the hamptons realty group “they’re all multimillion dollar homes in there for the most part they’re houses in the potato fields they look terrific and people get big dollars for them”sag harbor to the north on gardiners bay lies sag harbor a port town with proportionally more yearround residents because of its full roster of restaurants shopping and services a whaling village historically sag harbor still has that feel and the smaller properties and centuryold houses in the village which start at about 15 million reflect that new england maritime heritage east hampton village second home to many families and with few house shares this is to many people the heart of the hamptons the town that has some of the island’s oldest and most beautiful houses the village is roughly divided into three parts the estate area south of the highway and north of the highway “in the east hampton lanes you’re looking at 5 million just to get a teardown” said rylan jacka of prudential douglas elliman “the range goes from a million and a half to three million north of the highway and starting at three million south of the highway” at hamptons realty group georgia ellis told of an older estate home on the ocean that recently went for 11 million but even at that price it needed to be gutted and redone locals and tourists alike angle to get into nick  toni’s an 18 yearold restaurant that regularly feeds celebrities leif hope just opened his eponymous restaurant at the site of the old laundry locals will recognize him as the organizer of the annual artists  writers softball game a charity event that in the past has brought out the likes of alec baldwin the actor and former new york city mayor rudy giuliani even those who would never live in the hamptons can easily spend a day shopping in the town which has several highend shops such as tiffany  co cynthia rowley and gucci one of the only remaining momandpop operations is blue train tobacco owned by dennis and donna doherty “i have clientele from the billionaire to the bluecollar guy” said mr dennis “the cigar brings them all together”springs farmland stretches across the landscape and houses that are two and three hundred years old lend a historic feel jackson pollock and lee krasner used to live here their house and studio are now a museum artists are still drawn to this area for its beauty and because of its slightly outoftheway location and bayonly waterfront springs is more affordable than the rest of east hampton inland htun han of garnham  han real estate in amagansett estimated 650000 for a threebedroom house on a halfacre lot on the bay though the price tag shoots up to 3 to 5 million amagansett a destination for young families amagansett has a relaxed village feel exemplified by the farmer’s market where so many residents go in the morning for coffee and a muffin and later in the day for ingredients for grilling a perfect dinner “its one of the few places in the hamptons where you can walk to the village center and the ocean” said mr jacka “in most places you have to compromise one or the other”the convenience costs south of the highway mr jacka approximates that homes start at 2 million and go up to 15 million on the north side the cheapest is 900000 homes in the lanes area are among the most sought after ms ellis of hampton realty group said some smaller twobedroom homes from the 1960’s still exist but that people are paying more than a million to knock them down and rebuild in 2000 jerry seinfeld bought billy joel ’s house for 32 million “its worth twice that today” said ms esposito “so i guess its all relative”montauk montauk is for those who seek a familyfriendly atmosphere without the pretentiousness of the rest of the hamptons “it’s laidback” said nick  toni’s owner mark smith who has lived in montauk yearround for the past 15 years “it doesn’t even have a traffic light”it offers unparalleled water views with the ocean and gardiners bay meeting right at the tip the montauk lighthouse the oldest in new york state and fourth oldest in the country stands guard here whale watching and sports fishing are popular anglers have set 30 world records in montauk in nearly as many years for catching large tuna bass marlin and sharks fishermen aren’t the only ones on the waves surfers congregate at montauk’s ditch plains every morning “it runs the gamut from kids to guys who are in their 60’s and 70’s and have been surfing for 40 years” said tom naro head of the surfrider foundation long island chapter “its a hearty yearround group with a lot of neoprene”the architecture is more varied than east hampton mixing traditional styles with some contemporary and postmodern houses “its the last untouched part of the hamptons where things are still available at fairly reasonable prices” said tony ciero of brown harris stevens real estate “i mean they’re not cheap by any stretch of the imagination but a lot better than buying in east hampton or amagansett”depending on the view he estimated that a condo at montauk manor could go for 289000 to 350000 while a fivebedroom inland home on an acre of property could fetch over a million on the market at the high end is a 5000squarefoot postmodern oceanfront home for 35 million the andy warhol estate 57 acres with five homes on the water is listed at 40 million shelter island shelter island is a secluded retreat situated between the north and south fork reachable by ferry from either fork the island’s rolling hills and miles of beaches are home to around 2000 permanent residents architecture styles vary from greek revival and colonial to modern and farmhouse the majority of homes have oneacre lots with pools central air conditioning and three to five bedrooms “most of your waterfronts are 2 million and up with several in the 5 to 8 million range” said janalyn travismesser who has lived on the island for 20 years she is manager of griffing and collins real estate which currently lists interior homes in the 15 to 2 million range ms travismesser noted that the cheapest house currently on the market is 495000 the most expensive is 35 million north fork in the 1970’s and 1980’s the north fork was more of a retirement area but ever since the arrival of its first vineyard in 1973 the region has drawn more attention and more buyers today there are 26 wineries open to the public on the north fork the lifestyle and open stretches of farms orchards and marshland add to the allure “what differentiates the north fork is the open space here” said sally heitel manager of century 21 agawam albertsons greenport office “it’s a more laidback lifestyle and mindset it’s not the kind of party atmosphere as on the south fork” it also doesn’t have the same prices greenport is the bustling bright spot of the north fork art galleries shops restaurants and a new marina provide activities for the throngs of daytrippers that arrive in the summer main street has many old captain’s houses relics of greenport’s whaling past and all of the abodes are generally close together homes sell in the 500000 to 550000 range with prices going up to 2 million the charming town of orient at the eastern tip of the fork doesn’t have a village to speak of but its feeling of being set apart is what makes it attractive “it’s only ten minutes from greenport but the trip is so scenic and peaceful it seems a lot farther” said kristen rishe who was born and raised there and also works with century 21 on average houses sell for 600000 going back west the key towns are east marion southold peconic cutehogue mattituck jamesport and aquebogue there are some newer homes in these areas they command between 500000 and 600000 and the buyers tend to be from other parts of long island on the waterfront prices increase and reach the 2 million mark
