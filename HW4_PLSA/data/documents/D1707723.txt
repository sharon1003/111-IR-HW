cohesion and musical skills were regarded as valuable clan property in lieu of physical combat battles between rival clans frequently took the form of music and dance contests contests could involve the whole community or consist of matches between individuals competitors drew upon their knowledge of song to empower themselves with offensive and defensive magic through song powerful deities were called on for strength and disparaging insults were traded competitions could put the dancers into an ecstatic state in which the power of the spirits would seem to work through the performers these states were marked by labored breathing trembling and occasional screaming and performers generally fainted after the spiritual power had left them the colonial government and christian missionaries found the dances and their associated spiritual beliefs to be irreligious unhealthy and unproductive as a result restrictions were placed on dance activities a shift occurred to competitions based on the artistic skills of the dancers and musicians harmonies became more widely used in the music as church hymn singing became a greater part of the culture kiribati is a collection of islands in
