science  mathematics physics what is the difference between physics and engineering physics i am a high school senior and am doing well in school i had plan to major in physics when i go into college but now i have been informed that there is physics and engineering physics majors what is the difference between the two do they go with different careers do the majors take different classes follow 7 answers answers relevance rating newest oldest best answer i have an engineering physics degree the only difference between the 2 as far as classes went was that i took engineering courses in a field of my choice in place of technical elective classes like foreign language and free electives in engineering physics at least where i went you take all the same stuff as physics with the exception of foreign language and you take engineering classes as kind of a minor as an important side note its hard to get a job with a just a bachelors degree in either field but you might be able to talk your self into some engineering jobs with the engineering physics degree my advice would be if you are going to get a masters or a ph d go with the straight physics degree but if you need to make a living after your first degree and you are smart enough to get a physics degree then find something you like where there is a demand for it at the bachelors level and apply yourself to that ps the first year of many degrees are the same calculus physics chemistry so if you are trying to narrow it down between like physics engineering physics or something in engineering then you can just pick 1 and figure out what you like the first year and then make a switch without really loosing any time the best way is to get the actual class requirements for each major and compare them pc doctor · 1 decade ago1 0 comment also engineering physics i think you need to maintain a higher gpa like a 36 and above well thats how it is in my university but as far as careers i dont know they are different classes once you get in the higher level courses too like the other person said more specifics are requirediheartcharlie · 1 decade ago0 0 comment the difference between science and engineering can be thought of like this the scientist will theorize and test that theory in reproducible laboratory conditions many grants will have to be written to finance this experimentation which may one day lead to a breakthrough discovery the engineer needs to design this thing such that it can be brought to market at the important price point of 999 have it done by fridayszydkids · 1 decade ago2 0 comment physics is the study of earths natural laws where as engineering physics is the application of earths natural laws as applied to whatever is being engineered also engineering physics is a cheap way to sound like youre actually putting in the work of a true physicist whilst actually only having to be concerned with half the classes disgruntled physics majordunc · 1 decade ago0 2 comment physics is a fundamental science that deals with the concepts of the laws and principles that govern the unverse while engineering physics deals with the application of such concepts  · 1 decade ago0 0 comment physic is a broader and more general field enginerring physic is more specific a more narrow definition et · 1 decade ago0 0 commentphysics is a pure science subject whereas engineering physics is anapplied sciencethat is physics as applied in engineeringraj · 1 decade ago0 0 comment maybe you would like to learn more about one of these rheumatoid arthritis symptoms need home equity loan options try online nursing courses earn your mba online
