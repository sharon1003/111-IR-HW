visit our frequently asked questions about html5 video000  259easy xpin old russia level 410 start the cosmodrome patrol summon the sparrow and take the left path to reach the forgotten shores enter the shipwreck area straight forward from the entrance jump onto the deck and kill the enemies then go to the back of the ship and jump onto the crate to reach the platform above where you can jump onto the landing around the smokestack while standing on the smokestack a group of enemies will spawn below use grenades rockets and special abilities to quickly kill them once they have all been defeated simply climb back up onto the smokestack to make the enemies spawn again repeat this process as many times as desired if you are below level 10 you should gain levels with approximately 1020 minutes of farming xp using this method during the sword of crota mission level 714 you will get a powerful sword weapon that kills all enemies except the swarm princes with one hit in the last room of the dungeon grab the sword and kill all enemies with it until only the third and final swarm prince remains let it kill you to start back at the beginning to fight all the enemies again repeat this process as many times as desired make sure to not kill the final swarm prince or else you will not be able to use this method any longer killing the swarm princes yield good xp and killing each wave of enemies is very easy with the sword easy glimmer disassemble gear you are no longer using at the inventory menu to remove the item from your inventory and be rewarded with some glimmer and materials to earn extra glimmer in combat use the proper consumable item for the enemies you are fighting they are dropped randomly by defeated enemies and increase glimmer drops from enemies for 10 minutes for example use ether seeds while defeating fallen enemies select patrol on earth once you spawn go a short distance to the left to see a small shack with an entrance that leads to an underground area go right at the bottom of the stairs and enter the fist room on the right there will be three hive majors that appear once you enter the room use a black wax idol consumable item they will continue to occasionally drop from the defeated hive majors kill the three hive majors then run back up the stairs and kill the three enemies that appear outside to the left at the top of the stairs then go back to the same area and kill the three hive majors again repeat this process as many times as desired you can earn approximately 125 glimmer every 30 seconds note this method works best during the ingame daytime occasionally the three hive majors will not respawn when this happens you can leave the area for a few minutes kill some other enemies and return you can also return to orbit then return to the same area and they will appear again additionally you can earn some blue and purple engrams using this method once you reach level 4 start the the warmind mission and proceed to the end of the mission where your ghost interacts with the warmind before interacting with the objective use an ether seed to increase the amount of glimmer you will earn waves of hive enemies will appear kill them until the large final boss appears let one of the final enemies kill you then try to leave a different hive enemy alive so you can kill the boss instead to get better rewards each time there is no penalty for dying and you will spawn back at the checkpoint let the last enemy kill you then keep repeating as many times as desired once the ether seed effect ends after 10 minutes use another one use this method to get approximately 1000 glimmer every 10 minutes easy legendary and rare engrams start the dark beyond moon mission at any level and proceed to the temple cutscene where the large hive door opens after the three seals disintegrate a checkpoint will then be triggered and a large swarm of hive thrall and knight will come out from the other side of the door kill the thrall but do not kill the knight the knight has a higher chance of dropping engrams but defeating it will trigger a new checkpoint instead use grenades or class abilities to kill all the thrall then let the knight kill you you will respawn along with all the enemies repeat this process as many times as desired the thrall will drop engrams and gear and they will occasionally produce a legendary drop try collecting as many legendary engrams as possible rare engrams are useful for finding gear to break down and earn extra materials to help you unlock perks on legendary gear earning lots of engrams will also increase your cryptarch level giving you access to better engrams daily since your inventory will quickly fill up make sure to dismantle unwanted gear between killing the thrall this method will also earn a lot of glimmer and is a good way to unlock motes of light and strange coins to use with the special exotic vendor xur agent of the nine in the tower easy vanguard

approximately 7000 glimmer and one exotic shard material xûr appears somewhere in the tower at 900 am gmtutc on fridays and leaves at 900 am gmtutc on sundays since xûrs inventory changes every week he will only upgrade specific exotics each week he will offer different options to upgrade multiple exotics every week to obtain exotic shard materials either break down an exotic weapon to get an exotic shard or purchase an exotic shard from xûr for seven strange coins note upgrading an exotic weapon will reset all purchased perks for that weapon refilling ammo for free once your primary

following rarity levels basic uncommon rare legendary and exotic any gear above basic will often have perks you can purchase once a certain xp level has been reached like gaining levels weapons and armor will eventually unlock new upgrade options xp is shared between equipped gear and your level thus gaining 500 xp toward your next level will also gain 500 xp toward ranking up an equipped weapon or piece of armor however weapons and armor usually require much less xp to rank up compared to leveling up before using the following method make sure the gear you want to upgrade has abilities attached to it while hovering over a weapon or armor piece grayed out abilities will appear below the regular stats if there are abilities you can upgrade press y to view the upgrades that are

pad is activated vex will begin spawning and assaulting the three plates if an enemy gets inside the circle you will begin to lose spire building progress a good way to defend all three pads at once is to have three teams with two players each have one player stay inside the circle while the other player defends it the minotaurs are the biggest challenge save heavy weapons and overcharge

animation to complete your weapon is considered reloaded the moment the ammo counter increases for almost all weapons this corresponds to when the sound effect and the animation of the magazine being inserted into the weapon happens you can sprint one step switch weapons twice quickly or throw a grenade to cancel the rest of the reload animation and still have a fully reloaded weapon defeating devil walkers wait until a devil walkers legs begin glowing after it lands then shoot each leg to stun it and a glowing weak point will appear on its neck make sure to switch legs after stunning it each time after a leg is destroyed it cannot be broken again rocket launchers and sniper rifles work best on the devil walkers weak points defeating goblins shooting a goblin in its head will not kill it and will only stun it briefly and then cause it to charge at you aim for the glowing white core in its chest instead note they often crouch to shield their weak spot with their heads defeating hydras hydras have a semicircular shield that rotates around them to bypass it have a player on either side constantly shooting at the yellow glowing weak spot on the lower portion of its head defeating sekrion nexus mind kill the vex enemies around a sekrion before engaging it like other hydra the sekrion has a rotating indestructible shield when the shield is facing you move clockwise in the opposite rotation of the shield to get a lineofsight on the sekrion or focus on taking out the vex have all players on the same half of the area and space them far enough apart so the sekrions weapons cannot do splash damage to multiple players however remain close enough so that three players will have a clear line of fire on the sekrions head when the sekrion targets a player have him or her take cover while the other players shoot at its head it is important to maintain constant fire at the sekrions head defeating sepiks primes aim at a sepiks primes eye at close range to inflict critical damage note its eye is immune to critical damage from fusion rifles defeating valus taaurc spread the fireteam out to avoid splash damage from valus missiles get on high ground to target valus head easier wait until valus completes his entrance animation which happens when he is done firing his gun wildly when valus moves from one end of the room to the other avoid attacking him since there will be a series of incoming missiles use the large boxes on the upper balconies as cover from his gun and missiles but be aware of the phalanxes that spawn from the sides halo reference play
