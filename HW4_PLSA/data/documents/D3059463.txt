workouts determine your body type work with what youve got to get the body you wantby michelle basta boubion cptprevious story the benefits of glutamine next story lettuce rolls with peanut sauce share tweet print comments are you tall and slender short and curvy or somewhere in between no matter what type of build you were born with we have a training program thats right for you did you ever wonder if with the same time commitment and coaching you could achieve success similar to that of basketball sensation lisa leslie or fitness superstars susie curry and kelly ryan take away all those factors that give them a competitive edge and theyre just like you and me right well of course not lisa is gifted with towering height and susie and kelly have inherited genes that make them capable of tumbling a backflip or two or three genetics you can be blessed with damn good ones or be damned by them in the gym you see some lucky souls who do little more than lift a few weights every couple of days and build a tight toned physique on the other hand some lessfortunate folks have made working out almost a religion    and are looking as though theyre considering a change in faith even though all successful athletes have to work very hard to achieve their greatness most  if not all  start off ahead of the pack thanks to a very generous gene pool well you can continue to lament your bad luck after of course you tell mom that youd have preferred she marry someone like say michael jordan or even arnold or you can buckle down and make the best of what youve got every woman has a genetic blueprint that dictates what type of body she has but dont be fooled into believing that what you see in the mirror cant be manipulated and molded into something more by carefully dialing in certain training variables based on your bodytype you can enhance your workout program and speed your progress in the gym the bottom line is that an overweight woman who wants to drop significant bodyfat and still build muscle shouldnt be doing the same type of resistancetraining program as one whos stickthin and looking to fill out her frame bodytypes can roughly be divided into three basic categories ectomorph endomorph and mesomorph an ectomorph is naturally lean with a fast metabolism while this bodytype tends not to gain fat easily muscle is also hard to come by an endomorph on the other hand tends to gain weight rapidly and has a tough time losing bodyfat other characteristics typically include a large bone structure and a slower metabolism lastly a mesomorph has a relatively easy time building muscle and keeping bodyfat to a desirable level a person with this bodytype sometimes makes looking good look almost effortless the skinny chick the ectomorph while a lot of women might say they wouldnt mind being in this situation the truth is that those who have difficulty gaining  and maintaining  weight dont like to constantly hear about how skinny they are i get sick of it complains my sister sherri who drops weight quickly particularly if she skips a few workouts she struggles to put on muscle training diligently and eating several times a day after years of subscribing to the philosophy that if a little is good more must be better she finally listened to me when i told her she was overtraining ectomorphs simply cant be in the gym six days a week training each bodypart twice the best way for an ectomorph to build and shape her muscles is to lift heavy and train each bodypart once a week getting plenty of rest between workouts and refrain from doing too many exercises and sets per bodypart if really pressed id have to say that i fall in the ectomesomorph category admits fitness icon minna lessig who believes that every woman is actually a combination of all three bodytypes to some degree i say this because my musculature is prominent yet lean when i was a fitness competitor what worked for me was lifting heavy weights for low reps i chose compound exercises that helped put overall size on my body ifbb pro lovena stamatioutuley agrees that staying in the lowrep range is a good idea and suggests cutting the intensity and frequency of your cardio to speed progress you dont want to burn that muscle youre building she notes lift heavy weight and rest longer between sets ectomorph bodytype workout the ectomorph is typically thin with low levels of muscle as well as bodyfat if your metabolism is fast and you have trouble putting on weight use this program to muscle up start with a 510minute warmup and light stretching of muscle groups to be worked that day beginners should do two sets of each exercise others can do three sets complete 610 reps increasing the weight and decreasing reps called pyramiding with each set lift weights heavy enough to reach nearfailure within the prescribed rep range rest 13 minutes between sets depending on the bodypart being trained take more time for larger muscle groups like legs and back train each bodypart only once a week and never train a muscle group if its still sore from a previous workout change some part of your workout every week to add variety be it the exercise or exercise order or some other advanced training technique such as forced reps or negatives just dont overdo it get plenty of rest between workouts do three days of cardio per week for 30 minutes at a moderate intensity 6075 of your maximal heart rate limit vigorous activities outside of training sessions that burn lots of calories or reduce your cardio sessions check with your doctor before starting an exercise program especially if you have a health condition the muscular maiden the mesomorph so far ive suggested that mesomorphs have an advantage but that doesnt mean they have it easy a woman with this bodytype still has to work for that great physique albeit not to the degree that the other two bodytypes would for a similar look a training split of 35 days moderate reps and a variety of compound and singlejoint exercises should do the trick im a true meso although id say that isnt typical of all fitness competitors explains lovena i work out four days a week with a 34day split but i change it up all the time for best results mesomorphs should do high reps for legs 1520 and 812 for the other bodyparts and do up to four days of cardio varying the intensity each time she states one problem that some naturally muscular women face is a lack of direction in their workouts seemingly whatever they do brings about some sort of change however the need for a wellthoughtout program is vital you have to look at your body and see where you want to put the curves says lovena you have to stress your body properly to create positive change know how you want your body to look and work out with that in mind what works for me today coincides with my goal to have a body thats healthy full of energy and strong yet flexible notes minna i dont keep track of numbers but rather go by how my body feels this isnt to say that i dont have consistency yet my body awareness is so sharp that i work with mindmuscle unison rather than look at how many sets and reps i did of an exercise last week 1 2
