talking about words there is one very special use of quotation marks which it is useful to know about we use quotation marks when we are talking about words in this special use all varieties of english normally use only single quotes and not double quotes though some americans use double quotes even here this is another advantage of using double quotes for ordinary purposes since this special use can then be readily distinguished consider the following examples men are physically stronger than womenmen is an irregular plural in the first example we are using the word men in the ordinary way to refer to male human beings in the second however we are doing something very different we are not talking about any human beings at all but instead we are talking about the word men placing quotes around the word we are talking about makes this clear of course you are only likely to need this device when you are writing about language but then you should certainly use it if you think im being unnecessarily finicky take a look at a sample of the sort of thing i frequently find myself trying to read when marking my students essaysa typical young speaker in reading has done not did and usually also does for do and dos for does im sure youll agree this is a whole lot easier to read with some suitable quotation marks a typical young speaker in reading has done not did and usually also does for do and dos for does failure to make this useful orthographic distinction can in rare cases lead to absurdity the word processor came into use around 1910 the word processor came into use around 1910 if what you mean is the second writing the first will create momentary havoc in your readers mind the second statement is true the first is wrong by about 70 years here we have a particularly clear example of the way in which good punctuation works in speech the phrases the word processor and the word processor sound quite different because they are stressed differently in writing the stress difference is lost and punctuation must step in to do the job printed books usually use italics for citing words rather than quotation marks if you are using a keyboard which can produce italics you can use italics in this way and indeed this practice is preferable to the use of quotes in one circumstance though italics are not possible when we are providing brief translations or glosses as they are called for foreign words heres an example the english word thermometer is derived from the greek words thermos heat and metron measure this example shows the standard way of mentioning foreign words the foreign word is put into italics and an english translation if provided follows in single quotes with no other punctuation observe that neither a comma nor anything else separates the foreign word from the gloss you can even do this with english words the words stationary not moving and stationery writing materials should be carefully distinguished in this case it is clearly necessary to use italics for citing english words reserving the single quotes for the glosses summary of quotation marks put quotation marks single or double around the exact words of a direct quotation inside a quotation use a suspension to mark omitted material and square brackets to mark inserted material use quotation marks to distance yourself from a word or phrase or to show that you are using it ironically place single quotation marks around a word or phrase which you are talking about copyright Â© larry trask 1997maintained by the department of informatics university of sussex
