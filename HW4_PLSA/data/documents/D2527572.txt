structure of a protein the threedimensional structure that results from a regular pattern of hydrogen bonds between the nh and the co components of amino acids what is the tertiary structure of a protein the three dimensional structure that results from bonds between the r groups of amino acids what is the highest level of structure that an individual protein can attain tertiary structure what is quartenary structure of a protein the structure that results when one or more polypeptide chain bond together to form a single macromolecule what is the final threedimensional structure of a protein determined by the amino acid sequence of a protein what is the linkage that joins amino acids in a protein called a peptide bond or an amide bond where exactly do peptide bonds form between the alpha carboxyl group of one amino acid and the alpha amino group of another amino acid what is the formation of a dipeptide from two amino acids accompanied by the loss of a water molecule what does the equilibrium of this reaction lie on the side of under most conditions hydrolysis rather than synthesis hence the biosynthesis of peptide bonds requires what an input of free energy why are peptide bonds quite stable kinetically because the rate of hydrolysis is extremely slow what is each amino acid within a polypeptide chain known as a residue do polypeptide chains have directionality yes why because its ends are different how there is an alphaamino group at one end and an alphacarboxyl group at the other by convention which end is taken to be the beginning of a polypeptide chain the amino end what are the two main components of a polypeptide chain 1 main chainbackbonerepeating part 2 side chainsvariable part what is the polypeptide bond rich in hydrogenbonding potential why because each residue contains a carbonyl group co and an amino group nh group the carbonyl group is a good hydrogenbond acceptor the amino group is a good hydrogenbond donor what is the largest protein titin how many amino acids does it consist of almost 27000what is its role in the body serves as a scaffold for the assembly of the contractile proteins of muscle what are peptides made of small numbers of amino acids known as oligopeptides or simply peptides in some proteins the linear polypeptide chain is covalently crosslinked what are the most common links disulfide bonds can form between cysteine residues in the same polypeptide chain or they can link two separate chains together what are disulfide bonds formed by the oxidation of a pair of cysteine residues what is the resulting unit of two linked cysteins known as cyst ine are nondisulfide crosslinks derived from other side chains ever present in proteins rarely work on what hormone shoed that a protein has a precisely defined amino acid sequence insulin list four reasons why knowing amino acid sequences is important 1 they determine the threedimensional structures of proteins 2 knowledge of the sequence of a protein is essential to elucidating its mechanism of action 3 sequence determination is a component of molecular pathology 4 the sequence of a protein reveals much about its evolutionary history describe the shape of a peptide bond peptide bonds are essentially planar thus for a pair of amino acids linked by a peptide bond how many atoms lie in the same plane six list these six 1 alpha carbon atom and co group of the first amino acid 3 atoms total 2 nh group and the alpha carbon atom of the second amino acid 3 atoms totalwhat else is significant about the peptide bond it has considerable doublebond character why owing to resonance structures the electrons resonate between a pure single bond and a pure double bond what does this partial doublebond character prevent rotation about the peptide bond are peptide bonds charged no what does this allow for amino acids to form tightly packed globular structures that would otherwise be inhibited by charge repulsion what two configurations are possible for a planar peptide bond 1 trans configuration 2 cis configuration describe the location of the alpha carbon atoms in the trans configuration the two alpha carbon atoms are on opposite sides of the peptide bond describe the location of the alpha carbon atoms in the cis configuration the two alpha carbon atoms are on the same side of the peptide bond are most peptide bonds in proteins cis or trans trans why there are steric clashes between r groups in the cis configuration are the bonds between the amino group and the alphacarbon atom and the carbonyl group and the alphacarbon atom single or double bonds pure single bonds what does the freedom of rotation that results allow for allows for proteins to fold in many different ways what can the rotations about these bonds be specified by torsion angles what is the angle of rotation about the bond between the nitrogen atom and the alpha carbon atom called phi φwhat is the angle of rotation about the bond between the carbonyl carbon atom and the alpha carbon atom called psi ψdoes a clockwise rotation about either bond as viewed toward the alphacarbon atom correspond to a positive or negative value positive value what do the φ and ψ values determine the path of the polypeptide chain are all combinations of φ and ψ possible no why not due to steric clashes between atoms what is steric exclusion the fact that two atoms cannot be in the same palce at the same time what does steric exclusion restrict the number of possible peptide conformations thus this makes it a powerful organizing principle what four regularly folded segments comprise a proteins secondary structure 1 alpha helix 2 beta pleated sheet 3 turns 4 loops what are alpha helices beta pleated sheets turns and loops formed by a regular pattern of hydrogen bonds between the peptide nh and co groups describe an alpha helix rodlike tightly coiled side chains extend outward in a helical array what are alpha helices stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the nh and co groups of the main chain the co group of each amino acid forma a hydrogen with which nh group the nh group of the amino acid that is situated four residues ahead in the sequence within alpha helices do a large number or a small number of functional groups participate in hydrogen bonding a large number of groups except for amino acids near the ends of an alpha helix all the mainchain co and nh groups are hydrogen bonded how is each residue related to the next one by a risetranslation of 15 angstroms this gives how many amino acid residues per turn of helix 36 amino acid residues thus amino acids spaced  and  apart in the sequence are spatially quite close to each other thus amino acids spaced three and four apart in the sequence are spatially quite close to each other what is the pitch of an alpha helix the length of one complete turn along the helix axis how do you calculate the pitch of an alpha helix pitch  translation 15 a x residues per turn 36  54 awhat does screw sense refer to the direction in which a helical structure rotates with respect to its axis what are the two types of screw sense 1 righthanded 2 lefthanded how can you identify a righthanded screw sense if viewed down the axis of a helix the chain turns in a clockwise direction how can you identify a lefthanded screw sense if viewed down the axis of a helix the chain turns in a counterclockwise direction are righthanded or lefthanded helices more energetically favorable right handed helices why because there are fewer steric clashes between the side chains and the backbone as a result essentially all alpha helices in proteins are righthanded can all amino acids be readily accommodated in an alpha helix no what two main types of amino acids dont like to form alpha helices 1 amino acids that possess side chains with branching at the betacarbon atom 2 amino acids that possess side chains with hydrogen bond donors or acceptors in close proximity to the main chain where they compete for mainchain nh and co groups which amino acids possess side chains with branching at the betacarbon atom 1 valine 2 threonine 3 isoleucine which amino acids possess side chains with hydrogen bond donors or acceptors 1 serine 2 aspartate 3 asparagine why is proline a helix breaker 1 it lacks an nh group 2 its ring structure prevents it from assuming the φ to fit into an alpha helix describe how the alpha helical content of proteins ranges widely from none to almost 100what percentage of all soluble proteins are composed of alpha helices connected by loops and turns about 25single helices are usually how long less than 45 angstroms what is a beta pleated sheet composed of two or more polypeptide chains called b strands a beta strand is almost fully  rather than being tightly coiled as in the alpha helix a beta strand is almost fully extended rather than being tightly coiled as in the alpha helix what is the distance between adjacent amino acids along a beta strand approximately 35 angstroms what is the distance between adjacent amino acids along an alpha helix approximately 15 angstoms how is a beta sheet formed by linking two or more beta strands lying next to one another through hydrogen bonds describe the two directions in which adjacent chains in a beta sheet can run 1 in opposite directionsantiparallel 2 in the same directionparallel how many strands can come together in a beta sheet typically 4 or 5 as many as 10 or more beta sheets can be purely  purely  or  beta sheets can be purely parallel purely antiparallel or mixed beta sheets can be mostly  but some adopt a  shape beta sheets can be mostly flat but some adopt a twisted shape what structural elements are used to accomplish reversals in the direction of polypeptide chains reverse turns and loops in what part of proteins do turns and loops lie on the surfaces loops and turns exposed to an aqueous environment are usually composed of amino acids with what type of r groups hydrophilic r groups what are two common types of fibrous proteins 1 alphakeratin 2 collagen what is alpha keratin a component of wool and hair what does it consist of two right handed alphahelices intertwined to form a lefthanded superhelix called a coiled coilalpha keratin is a member of a superfamily of proteins referred to as coiledcoil proteins name three types of interactions that help to cross link the two helices within alphakeratin 1 van der waals forces 2 ionic interactions 3 disulfide bonds what is the most abundant mammalian protein collagen where is collagen found within the human body skin bone tendon cartilage and teeth describe the structural composition of collagine contains three helical polypeptide chains each nearly 1000 residues long what amino acid appears at every third residue glycine what threeresidue patter recurs frequently glycineprolineproline what are absent in this type of helix hydrogen bonds within each peptide chain how then are the helices stabilized by steric repulsion of the pyrrolidine rings of the proline residues describe how the three helices interact with each other three strands wind around each other to form a superhelical cable how is the cable stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the strands what groups do the hydrogen bonds form between the peptide nh groups of glycine residues and the co groups of residues on the other chains the inside of the triplestranded cable is very  the inside of the triplestranded cable is very crowded how does this explain why glycine has to be present at every third position on each strand the only residue that can fit in an interior position is glycine the replacement of glycine by other amino acids leads to what disease osteogenesis imperfectabrittle bone disease what does this replacement lead to delayed and improper folding of collagen what does the accumulation fo defective collagen result in cell death what is hydroxyproline modified version of proline with a hydroxyl group replacing a hydrogen atom in the pyrrolidine ring why is hydroxyproline so crucial in the body it is essential for stabilizing collagen why is vitamin c required for the formation of stable collagen fibers because it assists in the formation of hydroxyproline from proline specifically it is required for the continued activity of prolyl hydroxylase which synthesizes hydroxyproline what does lessstable collagen result in scurvy describe how prolyl hydroxylase is activated fe2 sits on prolyl hydroxylase fe2 activates o2 prolyl hydroxylase catalyzes the coversion of hydroxyproline what happens when fe2 is oxidized loses electrons to form fe3 prolyl hydroxylase becomes inactivated how is the enzyme made active again vitamin c reduces gives electrons to fe3thus vitamin cascorbate serves as an antioxidant what does tertiary structure refer to the spatial arrangement of amino acid residues that are far apart in the sequence and to the pattern of disulfide bonds what is this

transactions within the cell globular proteins what is the role of myoglobin in the body facilitates the diffusion of oxygen from the blood to the mitochondria where is myoglobin predominantly found in heart and skeletal msucle what does the capacity of myoglobin to bind oxygen depend upon the presence of ironbinding heme groups about 70 of the main chain of myoglobin forms what type of structures alpha helices 8 in totalwhy is myoglobin asymmetric due to the complex folding of its main chain what type of residues does the interior of myoglobin consist of almost entirely of nonpolar residues what are the only polar residues on the interior two histidine residues why are they present in that location they play critical roles in binding both heme and oxygen what does the outside of myoglobin consist of both nonpolar and polar residues in an aqueous environment such as the interior of the cell protein folding is driven by the hydrophobic effect what is the hydrophobic effect the strong tendency of hydrophobic residues to avoid contact with water what environment does an unpaired nh or co group fo the main chain prefer water vs a non polar environmentwhat is the only way to bury a segment of the main chain in a hydrophobic environment to pair all the nh and co groups by hydrogen bonding how is this pairing neatly accomplished in an alpha helix or a beta sheet why does the set of 20 amino acids differ so much in size and shape they provide a palette of shapes that can fit together tightly to fill the interior of a protein neatly and thereby maximize van der waals interactions some proteins that span biological membranes are the exceptions that prove the rule why because they have the reverse distribution of hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids provide an example porins are found on the outer membranes some bacteria porins are covered on the outside largely by hydrophobic residues that interact with the hydrophobic environment of the cell membrane in contrast the center of the protein contains many charged and polar amino acids that surround a waterfilled channel running through the middle of the protein list two types of motifssupersecondary
