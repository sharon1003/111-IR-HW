gunters chain 79200 inmetric si units 2011680 mm gunters chain or the surveyors chain also known as gunter’s measurement or surveyor’s measurement is a distance measuring device used for land survey it was designed and introduced in 1620 by english clergyman and mathematician edmund gunter 1581–1626 long before the development of the theodolite and other more sophisticated equipment enabling plots of land to be accurately surveyed and plotted for legal and commercial purposes gunter developed an actual measuring chain of 100 links these the chain and the link have become units of their own contents  hide 1 description2 method3 unit of length4 similar measuring chains5 see also6 references7 external links description  editthe 66foot 20117 m chain is divided into 100 links usually marked off into groups of 10 by brass rings or tags which simplify intermediate measurement each link is thus 792 inches long a quarter chain or 25 links is known as a rod or pole ten chains make up a furlong and 80 chains equal a statute mile gunters chain reconciled two seemingly incompatible systems the traditional english land measurements based on the number four and the newly introduced system of decimals based on the number 10 since an acre measured 10 square chains in gunters system the entire process of land measurement could be computed in decimalised chains and links and then converted to acres by dividing the results by 10 1method  editthe method of surveying a field or other parcel of land with gunters chain is to first determine corners and other significant locations and then to measure the distance between them taking two points at a time the surveyor is assisted by a chainman a ranging rod usually a prominently coloured wooden pole is placed in the ground at the destination point starting at the originating point the chain is laid out towards the ranging rod and the surveyor then directs the chainman to make the chain perfectly straight and pointing directly at the ranging rod a pin is put in the ground at the forward end of the chain and the chain is moved forward so that its hind end is at that point and the chain is extended again towards the destination point this process is called ranging or in the us chaining it is repeated until the destination rod is reached when the surveyor notes how many full lengths chains have been laid and he can then directly read how many links onehundredth parts of the chain are in the distance being measured the whole process is repeated for all the other pairs of points required and it is a simple matter to make a scale diagram of the plot of land the process is surprisingly accurate and requires only very low technology surveying with a chain is simple if the land is level and continuous—it is not physically practicable to range across large depressions or significant waterways for example on sloping land the chain was to be leveled by raising one end as needed so that undulations did not increase the apparent length of the side or the area of the tract 2unit of length  editmain article chain unitalthough gunters chain was later superseded by the steel tape a form of tape measure  its legacy was a new unit of length called the chain which measured 66 feet or 100 links  3 this unit still exists as a location identifier on british railways as well as in some areas of america in the united states for example public lands survey plats are published in the chain unit to maintain the consistency of a twohundredyearold database in the midwest of the us it is not uncommon to encounter deeds with references to chains poles or rod units especially in farming country minor roads surveyed in australia and new zealand were in the 19th and early 20th centuries customarily one chain wide 4in some places other lengths have been used for example 8928 inches approximately 0227 m in scotland and 1008 inches approximately 0256 m in ireland  citation neededthe length of a cricket pitch is

03048 m long the original of such chains was that constructed to very high precision for the measurement of the baselines of the anglofrench survey 1784–1790 and the principal triangulation of great
