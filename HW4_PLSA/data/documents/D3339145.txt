algerian pirates in 1619 he left the navy to sail with a merchant fleet to the mediterranean but in 1621 he fell once more into the hands of pirates set free after a year he became a lieutenant in the dutch navy in 1621 the twelve years’ truce between the netherlands and spain expired and it became necessary to prepare the fleet for war in 1624 tromp received his first commission as a captain and five years later he commanded the flagship against pirates from ostend in 1634 he again left the navy but in 1636 he returned and was soon appointed lieutenant admiral of holland at that time the highest post in the navy under the stadholder who was also the admiral general of the republic in february 1639 he defeated a fleet of dunkirk privateers he then met a large spanish armada that was transporting some 13000 spanish recruits to flanders commanded by adm antonio de oquendo and several other experienced captains the fleet consisted of 45 warships and 30 merchantmen hired as troopships when tromp spotted the armada off beachy head on sept 15 1639 he had only 13 vessels at his command his other detachments were cruising in the strait of dover and off dunkirk five more dutch ships arrived the next day and the dutch captains decided to give battle after six hours of fighting the armada—overcrowded with recruits who accounted for an extremely high number of casualties—withdrew to repair damages the next day no action could take place for lack of wind but the dutch were reinforced by a zeeland squadron and in the early morning of september 18 tromp attacked the spaniards in the strait of dover in the afternoon oquendo withdrew into the neutral roadstead of the downs tromp after taking in fresh supplies of gunpowder at calais soon followed him there only to be separated from him by an english squadron under the command of sir john penington by october 10 the dutch fleet was strong enough to challenge the spaniards and on october 21 tromp attacked oquendo and penington’s efforts at protection were of little avail in the battle of the downs the armada was completely defeated suffering severe losses in both ships and manpower tromp was knighted by louis xiii in 1640 and by charles i in 1642 when he visited dover to escort queen henrietta maria and princess mary to holland by 1640 thanks to his share of prize money tromp valued his assets at 90000 guilders at a time when ordinary seamen under his command made 10 guilders a month tromp’s main task during the next years was action against the dunkirk pirates who continued to attack the dutch merchant fleet in 1646 tromp helped the french capture dunkirk after which the order of st michael was conferred upon him after the peace of munster in 1648 which concluded the eighty years’ war the activities of the dutch navy diminished until in 1651 growing privateering between scandinavia and gibraltar made it necessary to reinforce the neglected fleet and to protect maritime trade relations with england became increasingly strained after the navigation act 1651 which was passed to restrict dutch trade with british possessions while much resentment was also caused by the english claim to sovereignty over the seas a skirmish with adm robert blake off dover in may 1652 resulted in the first anglodutch war which marked a crisis in the rivalry between england and the netherlands as carriers of world trade although tromp was unable to stir the english admirals to action later in the year—for which he was censured by the dutch authorities who even kept him from his command for some months—he defeated blake off dungeness in december but the english fleet was superior to the dutch tromp was unable to continue his successes and lost the threeday battle between portland and calais march 1653 as well as the battle of gabbard in june tromp was killed in the battle off terheijde near scheveningen learn more in these related articles netherlands war with spain
