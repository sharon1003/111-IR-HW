polonium210 basic facts and questions the investigation of the polonium poisoning case in united kingdom has brought attention to the radioactive material polonium210 po210 as a possible public health concern the united kingdoms health protection agency has information about po210 and this event on its web site the world health organizations department of public health and environment has prepared the following information about polonium210 basic facts about polonium210po210 is a naturally occurring radioactive material it is found in very low concentrations in the environment as a part of the uranium decay chain and can be derived from leadcontaining wastes from uranium vanadium and radium refining operations  however not in significant quantities it may be also produced artificially which requires fairly sophisticated equipment used in the nuclear industry po210 emits alpha particles and is 5000 times more radioactive than radium the halflife of po210 is 138 days alpha radiation delivers a large amount of energy to living cells and can cause considerable damage and cell death alpha particles lose most of their energy on impact and cannot move further into matter hence alpha radiation does not penetrate through surfaces eg paper human skin or clothes po210 is used in some industrial applications such as static eliminators which are devices designed to eliminate static electricity in processes such as rolling paper manufacturing sheet plastics and spinning synthetic fibers it is also used in nuclear weapons production as a power supply in small satellites and in the oil industry health risk of po210po210 represents a radiation hazard only if taken into the body – by inhalation ingestion or getting into a wound this “internal contamination” can cause irradiation of internal organs which can result in serious medical symptoms or death the toxicity of po210 is much higher than that of cyanides for example nevertheless it does not represent a risk to human health as long as it remains outside the body most traces of it can be eliminated through careful handwashing and showering or washing machine and dishwasher cycles people who come into contact with a person contaminated by po210 will not be exposed to radiation irradiated simply by being in the proximity of this person unless they ingest or inhale bodily fluids of the contaminated person for the general public normal hygiene measures such as thorough washing of hands and washing of fruitvegetables before consumption are sufficient for more information about contamination and irradiation exposure see the fact sheet radiological contamination and radiation exposure prepared by the us center for disease control what should you do if you have concerns about possible exposure related to the london incident if you were visiting london during early november 2006 and think you might have had contact with persons or locations involved in the polonium incident see httpwwwhpaorguk send email requesting information to the u k health protection agency at overseasadvicehpaorguk if you have concerns about your health contact your physician sources uk health protection agency usa center for disease control who international agency for research on cancer who international health regulations who ionizing radiation for more information please contact ionizingradiationwhoint
