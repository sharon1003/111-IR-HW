plotting data from arduino technology arduino by akellyirl follow576746314posted oct 24 2013arduino doesnt have much in terms of debug and analysis capability built in so it can be very useful to have a facility to plot data thats sent from arduino over the serial port there are several ways to do that including processing python  matplotlib etc but none of these methods work effectively with very little setup and offer expected features such as zoom scroll write to file save setup etc i want to show you how to produce the kinds of plots illustrated in my frequency detection instructable the software i used to produce those plots is bridge control panel its released as a part of cypress semiconductors psoc programming utilities by the way if you like this instructable you might also like to read my blog covering various projects and tutorialsadd tip ask question comment download step 1 bridge control panel download and install the bridge control panel you need to write the arduino data over the serial port one byte at a time for an int data type that would look as follows rx8 h43 1key1 0key1 serial print c serial write data8 serial write data0xffwe signal that were sending a data byte then send each byte of the int the syntax for the bridge command is shown in the comment and in the picture of the bridge window notice we have successfully connected to arduino on com6 the command to read data is rx8 h43 1key1 0key1 rx8 is the read command h43 means the next valid byte is c in ascii then the high byte of key1 then the low byte of key1 chart  variable settings panel is illustrated in the picture in here you need to tell bridge key1 is typeint  signed the tick means this is in use if you have made any mistakes here the command in the editor window will show the errors in blue finally you need to setup the comms protocol in tools  protocol configuration f7 make sure the baud rate matches the one specified in arduino to capture data press repeat in the window add tip ask question comment download step 2 plots thats it enjoy making great plots and enjoy a useful debugging tool you can also save data for further processing by matlab or excel etc add tip ask

0key1 1key2 0key2remember to select key 2 as active in chart  variable settings and set that data as having the appropriate formatting in arduino serialprint cserialwrite data18serialwrite

srosas5reply i just checked that the software is still available under that link christian ray d 12 months ago replysir how to connect arduino to the bridge controlvitold73 1 year ago reply hello im using following adafruit sketch to read and plot the data from themocouple based on max 31855 device using bridge control panel i did receive plot set x axis as a time and y axis as temperature readings but instead of temperature readings i getting triangle waveform with amplitude vary from 30 to 7710 see attached images  values represented in bridge control panel table capture looks okay to me it is possible to adjust y axis temperature readings scale to get scaled temperature readings  or there is something wrong in my data readings  source h and cpp files  httpsgithubcomadafruitadafruitmax31856thank youinclude spih include adafruitmax31855h int max so  5 int max cs  6 int max sck  7 int abc create a max31855 reference and tell it what pin does what adafruitmax31855 k tc max sck max cs max so void setup   serialbegin 9600  the max31855 needs a little time to stabilize delay 500  void loop   serialprint c   serialprintln k tcread celsius  abc int

httpsgithubcomoverdrivrtelemetry i was tired of reinventing the wheel for serial so i figured out why not make something clean once and for all well tested etc the arduino library is highlevel allows to write any kind of data string numbers arrays and is super easy to use for pc side i wrote a commandline interface a terminal where you type commands where once connected you can open as many plot as you want just using a command selecting the received data by their label each data you send is attached to a label you can also write variables from the terminal display a list of received data log everything etc this is just scratching the surface there are many goodies in this library and the list is growing every day marknonny 2 years ago reply i also am having trouble getting bridge control panel to show output i want to use it to draw graphs i have read the complete help documentation that comes with it i have a cypress psoc based device connected to windows com5 and i know it is streaming my data with a header of c followed by binary bytes which i can verify in tera term of other serial emulator i have set the serial parameters are the same as yours rx8 1152008n1 bridge reports syntax ok and connected i have the variables chart variables as your example but nothing shows when i hit repeat or first highlight the command and hit repeat1 to get a real basic hex dump of the serial port in bridge control shouldnt i be able to use a command like rx8 0key1 and set the chart variable key1 to byte could you possible post a step by step procedure for a simple hex dump with bridge control panel2 can you explain why only the repeat and to file are enabled but not send 3 does the software on the device have to wait to receive a command from bridge or can it just be streaming out the data4 is it possible in rx8 mode to send a command to the device to initiate the stream5 your example does not show any incoming data in the results window in my attempts i saw some lines of hex values there 3 times but cannot consistently get any claudio m3 2 years ago reply im using this sketch to read thermistor data httpplaygroundarduinocccomponent libthermist but ive
