november 8 2015format paperback verified purchase this is a very complete book of the hundred years war for as brief a book as it is however i have found that the book is much more useful in its role as a reference after my initial reading of the book the maps and the chronologies that are in many if not all of the books of the essential histories series published by the osprey publishing company make these books excellent reference materials as a person reads other books on the same or related subject matter read more comment one person found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no

yes no report abuse yoda40 out of 5 stars for its length surprisingly good and highly recommendedjune 1 2017format paperback verified purchase any review of this book would have to start out by stating that it is part of osprey publishing’s “essential histories” as such it is very short at only 93 or so pages of text in addition of these 93 pages very crudely a third consist of illustration of one type or another ie maps contemporaneous tapestries and paintings photos of battlefields etc another few pages are dedicated as is common to this series to “portraits of civilians” hence the book’s formats limits the narrative of the war to very roughly about 45 or so pages of text considering the length of the war and its complexity one would consider the book just because of the limits imposed on it by its format to be of limited value after all wars that were much shorter and less complicated in nature had many volumes of “essential histories” books dedicated to them for example the us civil war has 4 volumes in this series dedicated to it and the first second and napoleonic wars about 5 each this reviewer upon reading the book was pleasantly surprised to see that the book did a pretty good job 45star rating in this reviewer’s opinion one of the reasons for this high rating is the author’s extreme knowledge of the time she is a professor of history specializing in the period and has written quite a few books on the periods including a fulllength book on the topic “the hundred years war” highly recommended for those who desire a more indepth narrative she provides the reader with a very good and succinct narrative on the war this includes not only a narrative of the war itself but also to the factors behind it as well as to implicitly the factors that lead to french victory ie france’s larger economic base and adoption of a professional armed force as well as adoption of gunpowder it should be emphasized however that this narrative and analysis is extremely bareboned not surprising considering the limitations imposed by the too short length of the series it is part of nevertheless it hits all the essential and most important factors of the war on the head highly recommended for someone who is a novice and desires to get up to speed in the 2 or so hours it takes to read this book for those interested in more details this reviewer highly recommends two other books for the knowledgeable of history of this period anne curry’s book mentioned above “the hundred years war” is highly recommended for those who less knowledgeable ie laymen this reviewer highly recommends desmond seward’s “the hundred years war the english in france 13371453” for those interested in more details on the latter book please see my review on it – probably a bit too lengthy but should give the potential reader enough information to help them determine whether or not it is worth purchasing seward’s book is one of the most widely read on the subject this reviewer also recommends david nicoles the fall of english france 1449–53  this is part of ospreys campaign series and as a result covers the conflict during this time purely from a military perspective but it provides a very good history of the military campaigns that ended the war this reviewer has written a review of that too for anyone interested read more comment 2 people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no report abuse r a forczyk50 out of 5 stars a tour de force january 26 2003format paperback if you think of the hundred years war epic english victories like crecy poitiers and agincourt would probably come to mind however despite these impressive military triumphs the fact is that the french ultimately won the series of wars that stretched out over a 116year period anne curry an english expert on the hundred years war brings her considerable knowledge of the subject to bear in ospreys essential histories volume 19 quite simply this volume is a tour de force in that the author presents a complex subject with insight and depth unlike some of the other volumes in this series the hundred years war 13371453 represents a real research effort and not just a condensation of other sources this is one of the best volumes that osprey published in 2002 as usual the hundred years war 13371453 begins in standard osprey format with a short introduction a chronology a background to the war and the opposing sides and how the war began the narrative of the war itself is 38 pages in length final sections are portrait of a soldier one french and two english the cruel nature of the war attacks on civilians raids on england portrait of a civilian the remarkable female poet and historian christine de pizan how the war ended and conclusions the author has provided a substantial bibliography as well as genealogical tables for both the french and english nobility there are a total of ten maps english lands in gascony campaigns in northern france in 1340 campaigns in the north in 13411359 the campaign of 1346 the campaigns of the black prince the second phase of the war the agincourt campaign campaigns of 14151428 english garrisons in normandy and the defeat of the english in this volume and they add great value the hundred years war was unusual for its protracted nature although this was frequently interrupted by truces the english who began the war with modest objectives and expanded them when fortune favored their cause crushed one french army after another in the early phases of the war much of french fell under english control by 1415 and it appeared that the french monarchy was in eclipse anne curry does a wonderful job detailing how the french gradually turned the war around beginning with the incredible campaigns of joan of arc the french were not the complete blockheads that recurrent defeats would suggest but were capable of learning from past mistakes during the 1430s the french monarchy oversaw the creation of the first standing army in europe since the romans the french were also quick to adopt and efficiently organize artillery which was used to help smash english armies at formigny and castillon battles that are all but forgotten but which helped to decide the war the author also does a splendid job detailing the war finances and economies of both sides french revenue grew tenfold during the course of the war as the french monarchy organized a robust tax system however the english fought the war on an economic shoestring and their revenues declined as the war dragged on indeed the english often conquered land that was devastated and incapable of producing revenue for some time in the end the english lacked the money to sustain large armies in france and they were eventually overwhelmed the author rightly calls this war a defining moment in european history where large standing armies become possible and royal authority was forced to construct more complex fiscal structures than had existed under parochial feudalism read more comment 50 people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no report abuse douglas e libert50 out of 5 stars another good osprey publication june 20 2008format paperback this is a great concise 90 page overview of the hundred years war lots of pictures and maps the war is broken up into 4 different phases showing how it changed from the first to the last phases with the english finally pushed out if the french could take any consolationthe wars of the roses broke out in 1450 as a direct result of the hundred years wars unfortunately however the french had their own civil war which also came about from the hundred years warbut at least the major english armies were tied to their own islands the only good it seems that came about was the final extinguishing of continental land claims by english kings these claims were in existence since the time of william the conqueror and even before instead of using war outright as policy to keep an influence on the continentthe english will now use diplomacy and politics to maintain a continental influence war comes only when the other 2 fail at any rate england will refuse to be isolated and continental ties are the lifeline this is a well researched pamphlet style booka superb general overview read more comment 3 people found this helpful was this review
