transpired when one of the bullets stabilized at 114 hit them i have read accounts of bullets entering the calf and exiting the neck guess what ensued between the two points thats right massive tissue damage the death was so painful and so gruesome the cong would rather run away than face a squad of us marines finest fightin force walkin equipped with the black rifle then mc namara idiot in latin decided to test it in coldweather locales like the arctic the bullet would not stabilize in the cold thin dry air twist had to be tightened to 112 when they did that the bullets sort o zipped right

originally posted by monty fauctually i think that is an urban myth as far as i know mattel was never a defense contractor yep just urban legend but a lot of guys still think its fact because its repeated so often it got started when the troops first received the m16 with all its plastic and the relatively small cartridge both of which were quite unconventional at the time to them these guns looked like toys compared to what had been used up until then so the joke was that now the army was taking away the m14 and supplying them with toy weapons made by mattel the morgan and tucker book rumors debunked the myth of the plastic parts back as far as 1987 share share this post on digg delicious technorati twitter last edited by oldred 12262012 at 0311 am  17 12262012 0526 amsandog

airborne arctic infantry stationed at ft wainwright alaska in the 1970s in mid winter we dealt with temperatures from 20 during the day to 40 or 50 at night a few times i recall temps as low as 65 degrees we all knew we had only a few battalions in all of alaska where right across the bering strait the commies had several divisions we slept better at night knowing there was the deterrent of our submarines and of icbms pointed at them the 114 twist was barely stabilizing the 55 gr bullet even in the tropics hence the tumbling effect it was found that in sub zero weather the rifles could barely hold a group onto a pie plate at 100 meters it would not have been too practical for the army to issue lighter bullets or faster twist just to troops in cold climates so everyone got the 112 twist besides in the summer temps could get into the 90s so not always cold there i was an armorer in one of the rifle companies i had 200 plus m16s in the racks and a few car15s dont know why they werent called car16s as its been almost 40 years ago i cant remember all the subcontractors but westinghouse and gm come to mind there were a handful of colts in the racks the fit and finish seemed much better on the colts so i assigned one to myself it was very accurate around 1 14 at 100 but my eyes were good back then now i need an acog or some other optic with magnification to do that well i currently have 2 armalites and am happy with their quality share share this post on digg delicious technorati twitter 18 12262012 0551 amrocket surgeon beartooth regular join date dec 2012location
