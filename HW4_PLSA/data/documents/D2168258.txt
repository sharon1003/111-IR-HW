from wikipedia the free encyclopedianavigation search speed limit sign on a singlecarriageway road indicating a speed limit of 50 mph 80 kmhroad speed limits in the united kingdom are used to define the maximum legal speed which may be variable for vehicles using public roads in the uk and are one of the measures available to attempt to control traffic speeds the speed limit in each location is indicated on a nearby traffic sign or by the presence of street lighting signs show speed limits in miles per hour mph or use the national speed limit nsl symbol the national speed limit is 70 mph 112 kmh on motorways 70 mph 112 kmh on dual carriageways 60 mph 96 kmh on single carriageways and generally 30 mph 48 kmh in areas with street lighting  restricted roads  these limits may be changed by road signs and apply to cars motorcycles carderived vans up to 2 tonnes maximum laden weight mlw and to motorhomes or motor caravans not more than 305 tonnes maximum unladen weight other classes of vehicles are subject to lower limits on some roads 1speed limits in the uk are used to define maximum desirable traffic speeds for the purposes of road safety to reduce the number of road casualties  to reduce negative environmental impacts of traffic to increase fuel use efficiency and to satisfy local community wishes enforcement of uk road speed limits was traditionally done using police speed traps set up and operated by the police who now increasingly use speed guns automated invehicle systems and automated roadside traffic cameras some vehicle categories have various lower maximum limits

limits may also be used outside schools  citation neededminimum speed limits  editrarely minimum speed limits are used such as through the mersey tunnels to maintain free flow and safe passage through otherwise hazardous or enclosed areas 7 circular blue signs with white numbers indicate the start of these limits and similar signs with a red diagonal line indicate their end 8 contrary to popular belief there is no minimum speed limit on motorways although certain classes of slow vehicles as well as those of any class that cannot maintain 25 mph on the level whilst unladen are prohibited on safety grounds and drivers are expected to not cause unnecessary obstruction by driving unusually slowly justification  editaccording to the government speed limits are used to help achieve appropriate traffic speeds for safety and environmental and accessibility reasons 9 the department for transport state that speed limits play a fundamental role in the effective management of traffic speeds in relation to the safety of both drivers and all other road users 10safety  editsee also reported road casualties great britain and road traffic safety the 30 mph 48 kmh speed limit in builtup areas was introduced in 1930 in response to high casualty levels 11 the 70 mph 112 kmh limit on previously unrestricted roads was introduced in 1965 following a number of serious motorway accidents in fog earlier the same year 12the department for transport believes that effective speed management involves many components but that speed limits play a fundamental role and are a key source of information to road users particularly as an indicator of the nature and risks posed by that road to both themselves and other motorised and nonmotorised road users 10the parliamentary select committee for transport safety published a report entitled the ending the scandal of complacency in 2007 which highlighted how casualty levels rise with increasing speed and recommended reducing speed limits on streets with high pedestrian populations and on dangerous rural roads the report highlights that when two cars crash at 60 mph a driver there is a 90 chance of death which falls to 65 at 50 mph while recommending 20 mph speed zones the committee noted that these zones should not rely on heavyhanded enforcement measures 13the world health organisation published a report in 2004 highlighting that a total of 22 of all injury mortality worldwide were from road traffic injuries in 2002 n 3 and that the speed of vehicles was at the core of the problem n 4 road incidents are said to be the leading cause of deaths among children 10 – 19 years of age 260000 children die a year 10 million are injured 14in 2008 14 of collisions reported to the police had a speed related contributory factor either exceeding the speed limit or travelling too fast for conditions reported rising to 24 for fatal accidents and 25 of all road deaths n 5 exceeding the speed limit was reported as a contributory factor in 5 of collisions and 14 of fatal collisions travelling too fast for conditions but within the prevailing speed limit was recorded as one of the contributory factors in a further 8 of all collisions and 9 of all fatal 9 of all serious and 8 of all slight accidents n 6the uk government publishes reported road casualties great britain rrcgb each year based on road traffic casualties data stats19 reported to the police which has been collected since 1949 and with additional data going back to 1926 15 the highest number of road fatalities recorded in a single year in gb was 9196 in 1941 n 7 the highest number of fatalities during peacetime was 7985 for 1966 n 8 following the introduction of the national 70 mph speed limit in 1965 and the year before the legal drink drive limit and the associated breathalyzer laws were introduced the 2009 edition also summarised the characteristics of speed related fatal collisions as typically occurring on unclassified rural 60 mph speed limit roads the driver being a male under the age of 30 with the collision types being headon lost control or cornering and the cause being loss of control whilst cornering or overtaking and the contributory factors being excess or inappropriate speed loss of control aggressive careless or reckless behaviour or in a hurry n 9environmental and accessibility  editspeed limits are also used where reduced vehicle speeds are desired to help reduce vehicle emissions and traffic noise and to improve the accessibility conditions for more vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and cyclists and to reduce the perceived traffic risk for local people 16during the 1973 oil crisis a temporary maximum national speed limit of 50 mph 80 kmh was introduced on all roads including motorways to reduce fuel consumption which was later progressively raised on motorways to 70 mph and dual carriageways to 60 mph before a final change to single and dual carriageway nonmotorway roads that produced the current nsl situation 17effectiveness  editparliament estimates that most drivers and pedestrians think speeds are generally too high but 95 of all drivers admit to exceeding speed limits 18 df t guidance makes it clear that setting speed limits in isolation or setting ones that are unrealistically low may be ineffective and lead to disrespect for the speed limit 19 bath and north east somerset council say that speed limits on their own do not necessarily reduce traffic speeds and should be supported by enforcement to target irresponsible drivers or traffic calming 1620 mph speed limits and zones  editthe department for transport encourages the use of either 20 mph speed limits or 20 mph speed limit zones in urban situations where vulnerable road users are at particular risk 20in 1998 the trl reported 21 that signed 20 mph 32 kmh speed limits only reduced traffic speeds by about 1 mph and delivered no discernible reduction in accident numbers but that 20 mph zones achieved average speed reductions of 10 mph with child pedestrian accident reductions of 70 and child cyclist accident reductions of 48 22 the report noted that the cost of wide area traffic calming was prohibitive20 mph speed limits  edit20 mph speed limits are based on signage alone and are used where 85th percentile speeds are already below 24 mph 20a report published in 2010 by the department for transport regarding portsmouth city council s 20 mph 32 kmh speed limit on 410 km 250 mi of the citys 438 km 272 mi of roads found a small 13 mph reduction in traffic speed and a small 8 increase in the number of serious accidents – neither of which were statistically significant – and a 21 reduction in the number of accidents there was a 6 increase in the numbers killed or seriously injured ksi – also not statistically significant due to the small numbers involved – and a 22 reduction in the total number of road casualties 2320 mph zones  editroad sign used to mark the start of a 20 mph zone in places where 20 mph speeds are desired but where excessive speeds 85th percentile speed of 24 mph or above occur 20 mph zones are recommended these have to use traffic calming measures to reduce speeds to below 20 mph 24in 1992 david hardingprice a parish councillor in barrowuponhumber proposed a 20 mph speed limit outside the local school this was rejected by the council by august 2002 kingston upon hull had introduced 112 20mph zones and 190 km of roads subject to a 20 mph limit covering 26 of the citys streets which they described as contributing to dramatic reductions in road casualties total collisions were reduced by 56 collisions involving death and serious injury were reduced by 90 collisions involving child casualties were reduced by 64 all pedestrian collisions were reduced by 54 and total child pedestrian collisions reduced by 74 25a report published in 2008 estimated that following the introduction of 20 mph zones in london a reduction of casualties by 45 and ksi by 57 occurred 26shared space  editresearch carried out for the department for transport to provide supporting evidence for local transport note 111 on shared space showed that in all of the ten shared space sites that were studied that although they all had speed limits of 30 mph that the average speeds on them was around 20 mph 27the introduction of the 70 mph speed limit  editin 1966 at the end of the 4month trial of a blanket 70 mph 113 kmh speed limit on previously unrestricted roads and motorways speed checks on the m6 in cheshire suggested that although cars were actually being driven about 10 mph 16 kmh faster they were still usually travelling at speeds below the new limit the crash rate was lower on the m6 in staffordshire the better weather was noted too and continued to fall on the m5 in worcestershire as it had before the new limit was imposed and there was no change in the crash rate on the m6 in cheshire or on the m1 in

in 1861 1865 and 1878 the 1861 act introduced a 10 mph 16 kmh limit powered passenger vehicles were then termed light locomotives the 1865  red flag act  reduced the speed limit to 4 mph 6 kmh in the country and 2 mph 3 kmh in towns and required a man with a red flag or lantern to walk 60 yards 50 m ahead of each vehicle and warn horse riders and horse drawn traffic of the approach of a selfpropelled machine the 1878 act removed the need for the flag 33 and reduced the distance of the escort to 20 yards 20 m 34following intense advocacy by motor vehicle enthusiasts including harry j lawson of the daimler company the most restrictive parts of the acts were lifted by the locomotives on highways act 1896 35 which raised the speed limit to 14 mph 23 kmh and removed the need for the escort 36 a celebratory run from london to brighton was held soon after the act was passed and has been commemorated each year since 1927 by the london to brighton veteran car run 3630 mph 48 kmh repeater sign as used to remind drivers of the speed limit on a road without street lighting on builtup roads with street lighting the lights themselves serve as the 30 mph reminder and repeater signs are prohibited the speed limit for motor cars was raised to 20 mph 32 kmh by the motor car act 1903 which stood until 1 january 1931 when all speed limits for cars and motorcycles were abolished under the road traffic act 1930 37 lord buckmaster s opinion at the time was that the speed limit was removed because the existing speed limit was so universally disobeyed that its maintenance brought the law into contempt 38 between 1930 and 1935 the number of annual road fatalities dropped from 7305 to 6502 n 8 the same act also introduced a 30 mph 48 kmh speed limits for uk coach services uk bus services and most hgvs 39 buses were not necessarily fitted with speedometers at this stage 40a road traffic speedometer bill was debated in 1933 relating only to vehicles to which current speed limits applied 41the road traffic act 1934 created by leslie horebelisha the then minister of transport introduced a speed limit of 30 mph 48 kmh in builtup areas for cars and motorcycles which came into effect on 18 march 1935 42 the definition of a builtup area was based on the presence of street lighting 43 which had previously been mandated by the public health act 1875 44 the reintroduction of a speed limit for cars was in response to concern at increased road casualties 11 the number of fatalities had increased to 7343 deaths half of the deaths were pedestrians and of threequarters of these occurred in builtup areas 45 between 1935 and 1940 the number of annual road fatalities increased from 6502 to 8609 n 8speedometers were made compulsory for new cars in 1937 46 47world war ii  edita 20 mph 32 kmh nighttime speed limit for builtup areas was introduced in 1940 as an attempt to halt the increase in the number of road casualties occurring during the world war ii blackouts 48 following the introduction of blackouts fatalities rose on speedlimited roads from 289 in march 1939 to 325 in march 1940 49 for october 1940 the total number of deaths during daylight when the speed limit didnt apply fell in relation to those for october 1939 from 511 to 462 whereas the figures for the blackout hours when the speed limit did apply rose from 501 to 684 50 the highest number of

traffic act 1956 the speed limit introduced on a trial basis in 1935 had relied on being renewed by parliament each year 51 the maximum speed limit for goods vehicles was raised from 20 mph 32 kmh to 30 mph 48 kmh in 1957 52in addition around 1958 some 30 mph roads had the limit raised to 40 mph to improve transit times an early example being on croydon road in mitcham surrey saving it was estimated 33 seconds in journey time across mitcham common 53following a series of serious motorway multiple crashes in the fog in 1965 tom fraser the then minister of transport following consultations in early november with the police and with the national road safety advisory council nrsac concluded that the crashes were caused by vehicles travelling too fast for the prevailing conditions the nrsac advised that a 20 mph 32 kmh motorway speed limit should be imposed on motorway stretches affected by fog and that a general speed limit of 70 mph 113 kmh should be experimentally applied for the winter months 54on 25 november 1965 the government announced that a temporary 30 mph 48 kmh speed limit would be applied to sections of motorway there were 350 miles 560 km of it at that time affected by fog ice or snow and that a general maximum speed limit of 70 mph 113 kmh would be applied to all otherwise unrestricted roads including motorways for a trial period of four months starting just before christmas 12 the fourmonth trial 70 mph 113 kmh speed limit on 100000 miles 160000 km of previously unrestricted roads and motorways was introduced at noon on 22 december 1965 55 also on that day the power for the police to apply advisory speed limits of 30 mph 48 kmh to motorways affected by bad weather was also introduced the advisory limit was activated by the use of flashing amber lights placed at 1 mile 16 km intervals along the motorways 55in april 1966 barbara castle the new minister of transport decided to extend the experimental 70 mph 113 kmh limit for a further two months to allow the road research laboratory rrl time to collect data as there was still no conclusive evidence of its effectiveness 56 in may 1966 barbara castle extended the experimental period by a further fifteen months to 3 september 1967 as the case is not proven but there were signs of crash rate reduction 57in july 1966 the speed limit for public service vehicles notably buses was raised from 40 mph 64 kmh to 50 mph 80 kmh 58 during 1966 the highest number of fatalities during peacetime at 7985 deaths was recorded n 8in july 1967 castle announced that 70 mph 113 kmh was to become the permanent maximum speed limit for all roads and motorways she had accepted rrl evidence that the speed limit had reduced the number of casualties on motorways she ruled out minimum speed limits for motorways which would also reduce the danger of slow traffic as being too difficult to enforce and likely to increase congestion off the motorways the two major motoring organisations at the time the automobile association and the r a c welcomed the maximum speed limits for allpurpose roads but the r a c would have preferred more flexibility for motorways the royal society for the prevention of accidents suggested that a lower speed limit would be more appropriate for allpurpose roads and the pedestrians association for road safety condemned the new limits as being too high preferring 60 mph 97 kmh limits for all roads 59 castles decision and acceptance of the rrl research at face value was controversial peter walker s motion in parliament to annul the speed limit on motorways was negatived 601973 oil crisis  editdue to the 1973 oil crisis a temporary maximum national speed limit of 50 mph 80 kmh for all roads including motorways was introduced on 8 december 1973 17 the 70 mph 113 kmh limit was restored on motorways in march 1974 and on all other roads on 8 may 1974 61as an initiative to reduce energy consumption the national speed limits for otherwise unrestricted singlecarriageway and dualcarriageway roads were temporarily reduced to 50 mph 80 kmh and 60 mph 97 kmh respectively motorway speed limits were left unchanged at 70 mph 113 kmh from 14 december 1974 62 in november 1976 the temporary speed limits were extended at least until the end of may 1977 63 in april 1977 the government announced that the national speed limits for singlecarriageway roads was to be increased to 60 mph 97 kmh and that the 70 mph 113 kmh speed limit was to be restored on dualcarriageways on 1 june 1977 64 651977–present  edita speed limiter

90 kmh in 1994 n 1 it was made easier for local authorities to introduce a 20 mph 32 kmh limit in 1999 69in march 2009 the government consulted on reducing speed limits on rural roads on which 52 of fatalities had occurred in the previous year to 50 mph it explained that crashes were more likely on rural parts of the road network upon most of which the national speed limit of 60 mph applies the conservative opposition party and the aa were both opposed the president of the aa said that speed limits that are too low can result in a greater number of accidents and that a blanket reduction of speed limits would not make roads safer given that many accidents on rural roads involved only one car 70in february 2010 the department for transport undertook a consultation to set a 65 mph speed limit for all buses minibuses and coaches with more than eight passenger seats 71 72 these proposals were not taken up in april 2015 the speed limit for heavy goods vehicles over 75 tonnes was
