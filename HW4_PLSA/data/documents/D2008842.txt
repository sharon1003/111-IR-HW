the richter and mercalli scales the strength of an earthquake is usually measured on one of two scales the modified mercalli scale and the richter scale the mercalli scale is a rather arbitrary set of definitions based upon what people in the area feel and their observations of damage to buildings around them these scales are important to business and property owners in earthquake affected areas several of them use various forms of facility maintenance software to record intesity levels and make other notes if an earthquake does occur the scale goes from 1 to 12  i to xii or using the descriptive titles of the levels from instrumental to catastrophic modified mercalli scale intensity verbal description magnitude witness observations i instrumental 1 to 2 detected only by seismographs ii feeble 2 to 3 noticed only by sensitive people iii slight 3 to 4 resembling vibrations caused by heavy traffic iv moderate 4 felt by people walking rocking of free standing objects v rather strong 4 to 5 sleepers awakened and bells ring vi strong 5 to 6 trees sway some damage from overturning and falling object vii very strong 6 general alarm cracking of walls viii destructive 6 to 7 chimneys fall and there is some damage to buildings ix ruinous 7 ground begins to crack houses begin to collapse and pipes break x disasterous 7 to 8ground badly cracked and many buildings are destroyed there are some landslides xivery disasterous8few buildings remain standing bridges and railways destroyedwater gas electricity and telephones out of action xii catastrophic8 or greater total destruction objects are thrown into the airmuch heavingshaking and distortion of the ground whilst this scale is fine if you happen to experience an earthquake in an inhabited area of a developed country it is of no use whatsoever in the middle of a desert or in any other place without trees houses and railways descriptions such as resembling vibrations caused by heavy traffic depend very much upon the observer having felt heavy traffic in the past even then what one person in a small town considers to be heavy will most certainly differ from what a person living adjacent to a major urban road system would describe as heavy clearly this scale has advantages but something else is required if we are to be able to compare the magnitude of earthquakes wherever they occur the intensity scale differs from the richter magnitude scale in that the effects of any one earthquake vary greatly from place to place so there may be many intensity values eg  iv vii measured for the same earthquake each earthquake on the other hand should have only one magnitude although the various methods of calculating it may give slightly different values eg  45 46  the richter scale is designed to allow easier comparison of earthquake magnitudes regardless of the location c f richter was a geologist living and working in california u s a an area subjected to hundreds of quakes every year he took the existing mercalli scale and tried to add a scientific scale based on accurate measurements that could be recorded by seismographs  instruments used to measure vibration regardless of their global location by measuring the speed or acceleration of the ground when it suddenly moves he devised a scale that reflects the magnitude of the shock the richter scale for earthquake measurements is logarithmic this means that each whole number step represents a tenfold increase in measured amplitude thus a magnitude 7 earthquake is 10 times larger than a 6 100 times larger than a magnitude 5 and 1000 times as large as a 4 magnitude this is an open ended scale since it is based on measurements not descriptions an earthquake detected only by very sensitive people registers as 35 on his scale whilst the worst earthquake ever recorded reached 89 on the richter scale when trying to understand the forces of an earthquake it can help to concentrate just upon the up and down movements gravity is a force pulling things down towards the earth this accelerates objects at 98 ms 2 to make something such as a tin can jump up into the air requires a shock wave to hit it from underneath travelling faster than 98ms 2 this roughly corresponds to 11 very disastrous on the mercalli scale and 81 or above on the richter scale in everyday terms the tin can must be hit by a force that is greater than that which you would experience if you drove your car into a solid wall at 35 khp 22 mph richter scale richter scale approximate acceleration approximate mercalli equivalent35  1 cms 2 i3525 cms 2ii42 iii45 10 cms 2 iv48 25 cms 2 v54 50 cms 2 vi61 100 cms 2 vii65250 cms 2viii69 ix73 500 cms 2 x81 750 cms 2 xi 81 980 cms 2 xiiwe value your ideas and suggestions please contact the maintainer of this site this site can be found at httpwwwgeographysitecouk last modified on march 26 2013Â© geography site
