wrist it is situated between the hand and forearm on the thumb side of the wrist also called the lateral or radial side it forms the radial border of the carpal tunnel the scaphoid bone is the largest bone of the proximal row of wrist bones its long axis being from above downward lateralward and forward it is approximately the size and shape of a medium cashew contents  hide 1 structure11 bone12

the proximal and distal rows of carpal bones it is located on the radial side of the wrist and articulates with the radius lunate trapezoid trapezium and capitate 1 176 over 80 of the bone is covered in articular cartilage 2bone  editthe palmar surface of the scaphoid is concave and forming a tubercle giving attachment to the transverse carpal ligament the proximal surface is triangular smooth and convex and articulates with the radius and adjacent carpal bones namely the lunate capitate trapezium and trapezioid 2 the lateral surface is narrow and gives attachment to the radial collateral ligament the medial surface has two facets a flattened semilunar facet articulating with the lunate bone and an inferior concave facet articulating alongside the lunate with the head of the capitate bone 3the dorsal surface of the bone is narrow with a groove running the length of the bone and allowing ligaments to attach and the surface facing the fingers anatomically inferior is smooth and convex also triangular and divided into two parts by a slight ridge 3blood supply  editit receives its blood supply primarily from lateral and distal branches of the radial artery via palmar and dorsal branches these provide an abundant supply to middle and distal bone but neglects the proximal portion which relies on retrograde flow 1 189 the dorsal branch supplies the majority of the middle and distal portions with the palmar branch supplying only the distal third of the bone 2variation  editthe dorsal blood supply particularly of the proximal portion is highly variable 1 189 sometimes the fibers of the abductor pollicis brevis emerge from the tubercle 3in animals  editin reptiles birds and amphibians this bone is instead commonly referred to as the radiale because of its articulation with the radius function  editthe carpal bones function as a unit to provide a bony superstructure for the hand 4 708 the scaphoid is also involved in movement of the wrist 1 6 it along with the lunate articulates with the radius and ulna to form the major bones involved in movement of the wrist 4 the scaphoid serves as a link between the two rows of carpal bones with wrist movement the scaphoid may flex from its position in the same plane as the forearm to perpendicular 1 176–177clinical significance  editfracture  editmain article scaphoid fracture scaphoid fracture before and after operation fractures of the scaphoid are the most common of the carpal bone injuries because of its connections with the two rows of carpal bones 1 177the scaphoid can be slow to heal because of the limited circulation to the bone fractures of the scaphoid must be recognized and treated quickly as prompt treatment by immobilization or surgical fixation increases the likelihood of the bone healing in anatomic alignment thus avoiding malunion or nonunion delays may compromise healing failure of the fracture to heal nonunion will lead to posttraumatic osteoarthritis of the carpus 1 189 one reason for this is because of the tenuous blood supply to the proximal segment 2 even rapidly immobilized fractures may require surgical treatment including use of a headless compression screw such as the herbert screw to bind the two halves together healing of the fracture with a nonanatomic deformity frequently a volar flexed humpback can also lead to posttraumatic arthritis nonunions can result in loss of blood supply to the proximal pole which can result in avascular necrosis of the proximal segment other diseases  edita condition called scapholunate instability can occur when the scapholunate ligament connecting the scaphoid to the lunate bone and other surrounding ligaments are disrupted in this state the distance between the scaphoid and lunate bones is increased 1 180there is a rare disease of this bone called preisers disease palpation  editthe scaphoid can be palpated at the base of the anatomical snuff box it can also be palpated in the volar palmar handwrist its position is the intersections of the long axes of the four fingers while in a fist or the base of the thenar eminence when palpated in this position the bone will be felt to slide forward during radial deviation wrist abduction and flexion clicking of the scaphoid or no anterior translation can indicate scapholunate instability etymology  editthe etymology of the scaphoid bone  greek σκαφοειδές is derived from the greek skaphos which means a boat and the greek eidos which means kind 5 the name refers to the shape of the bone supposedly reminiscent of a boat in older literature about human anatomy 3 the scaphoid is referred to as the navicular bone of the hand this time from the latin word “navis”  boat since there is also a bone in a similar position in the foot which is called the navicular additional images  editscaphoid bone of the left hand shown in red animation scaphoid bone of the left hand close up animation scaphoid bone scaphoid shown in yellow left hand
