muscle energy systems atp adenosine triphosphate is a complex chemical compound formed with the energy released from food and stored in all cells particularly muscles when our brain sends signals to our muscles to contract energy stored in the form of atp is converted into the energy to drive the movement of the muscles every muscle cell has a small amount of atp floating around which can be used readily however this is used off very quickly and must constantly be replenished in order for the atp levels to be maintained the muscle relies on aerobic and anaerobic respiration anaerobic respiration anaerobic replensihment of atp can occur by the breakdown of creatine phosphate cp which is stored in the muscles like atp or by a process known as glycolysis creatine phosphate is the main supplier of energy for the formation of atp as it is broken down to create creatine and pi it releases energy in order to rapidly replenish atp there is a sufficient enough supply of cp inside our muscles to support maximal effort for up to 10 seconds without this system explosive fast movements could not be performed glycolysis is another anaerobic route in which atp can be produced carbohydrate is broken down from the carbohydrate stores inside the muscle in the form of â€œglycogenâ€ glycolysis cannot produce atp as quickly as the breakdown of cp but is still considerably quicker than aerobic ways of creating atp unfortunatley glycolysis is not the most efficient way of producing atp and leads to a byproduct named â€œlactic acidâ€ created from incomplete carbohydrate breakdown which interferes with muscle performance however glycolysis is a very important process when oxygen availability is limited and when the energy demands are greater than the energy which can be produced through anaerobic metabolism aerobic respiration during exercise our muscles are in constant need of energy in the prescence of oxygen carbohdrates fats and proteins can be broken down in order to generate atp the aerobic energy production occurs inside the muscle fibers in a place called the â€œmitochondriaâ€ the mitochondria converts energy stored as fat and carbohydrates into atpthe carbohydrate needed for use during aerobic metabolism can come from 3 places glycogen supplies inside the muscle the breakdown of liver glycogen which gets to working muscle through the bloodstream the absorbtion of glucose from food in the intestines which gets to working muscle through the bloodstream aerobic respiration can also use fatty acids from fat reserves in muscle and the body to produce atp because the majority of fat is stored inside adipose tissue its not readily available for fuelling muscles and must be broken down into fatty acids and then transported to the muscle via the bloodstream only inside the mitochondria can fatty acids be used for atp synthesis this is not a very fast process and can only be used during low intensity exercise when carbohydrate stores are low the body can also use protein for atp production every protein is made up of amino acids all the essential amino acids must be present in order for the body to repair damaged muscles during exercise when glycogen stores in the muscles and liver become depleated muscle proteins are broken down into amino acids and released into the blood the amino acids are then transported to the liver where they are converted into glucose through a process known as â€œgluconeogenesisâ€ the glucose is then released back into the bloodstream and can be used as a fuel source for the muscle references dicksonparnell b e and a zeichner effects of a shortterm exercise program on caloric consumption health psychol 4437448 1985john ivy  robert portman the future of sports nutrition nutrient timing 21520gillette c a r c bullough and c l melby postexercise energy expenditure in response to acute aerobic or resistive exercise int j sports nutr 4347360 1994karlsson j lactate and phosphagen concentrations in the working muscle of man  165 1971— ste  934 am november 8 2006
