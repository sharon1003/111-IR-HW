what is an erv energy recovery and how does it work maintaining indoor air quality is vital to the health and wellbeing of a building’s occupants an energy recovery ventilator erv allows fresh air into a building while retaining preconditioned heating or cooling let me better explain let’s assume you have a 4 ton unit  click here to understand and interpret hvac tonnage  and are required by code to introduce 25 fresh outside air in this case 400 cfm into your building with a standard economizer you draw 400 cfm of outside air then proportionately remove the same quantity of air using a barometric relief or power exhaust if the outside temperature is 0ºf and the indoor air temperature is 70ºf your hvac unit must heat the mixture of outside air  building’s return air to maintain a building temperature of 70ºf coincidentally 400 cfm of preconditioned 70ºf air was forced out your building to meet the fresh outdoor air code what if you could recover that energy an erv is designed to do just that recover preconditioned air before it is removed from the building how does an erv work illustration 1hypothetically speaking… two airstreams travel in opposite directions one at the temperature of 0ºf and the other at 70°f most would assume each air stream would balance out to the average of 35ºf each the airstreams actually switch temperatures the 70°f becomes 0ºf and the 0ºf becomes 70°f this is the core theory behind energy recovery aka — air exchange an erv operates on the basis of this airtoair exchange theory a spinning wheel or stationary core device utilizes the counterflow of air to remove the stale air from inside a building while retaining air temperature however an erv wheel or core cannot produce a 100 theoretical energy recovery result therefore they are rated to return a percentage ofeffectiveness certified by ahri depending upon your environmental conditions these percentages will vary under differentenvironmental conditions and are usually defined as summer and winter conditions illustration 2 displays an erv wheel offering an 80 energy recovery result 14ºf ÷ 70°f  08 — equivalent to 80 this 80 recovery introduces a mild 56ºf to mix with the indoor air instead of 0ºf illustration 2other erv products exist for the sake of simplicity this article will only address desiccant wheel and core theory replaces an economizer an economizer will meet code by introducing and mixing the return air from the building with the outside air and in most cases contains a barometric relief to remove the preconditioned air however it performs the operation at a higher energy cost to the building owner how by removing conditioned air and forcing the hvac unit to recondition fresh outside air when free cooling isn’t available free cooling occurs during cooling mode when the outside temperature  humidity is ideal the economizer will shut off the compressor while allowing the hvac supply fan to draw in cooler outside air at the approximate temperature that the hvac unit would produce  supply mechanically into the building an erv has an additional advantage over economizers by extending the free cooling range a properly configured erv will allow you to utilize free cooling using lower outdoor temperature setpoints due to the advantage of temperature recovery removes humidity erv unit ratings are based upon cfm and offer two types of energy recovery sensible and latent sensible recovery is a temperature recovery as described above latent recovery involves the environmental factor of humidity downsizing your hvac unit an erv is designed to transfer sensible only or sensible  latent combined latent allows the removal of outside air humidity before it reaches your hvac unit it will literally redirect a large percentage of the outdoor humidity by transferring it to the opposing airstream — out of the building allowing the hvac to operate with a reduced load this reduction allows an engineer to downsize the tonnage of a hvac unit at the design stage why because an erv changes the environmental conditions same applies with the sensible factor the hvac unit is no longer contending with 0ºf on that cold day illustrated above or high humidity and temperature in july instead the hvac unit is confronted with more year round moderate conditions therefore the hvac unit can now be downsized because the overall load conditions have changed many more factors  applications energy recovery is very complex many other factors not noted in this article come in to play and for the sake of simplicity are not noted here facilities from natatoriums to animal shelters to hospitals have very strict indoor air qualities each one necessitates a specific design requirement pairing the proper erv design specification to the job is critical ashrae standards 621 and 622 – offers standards for ventilation and indoor air quality ashrea standard 901 energy standard for buildings except lowrise residential buildings the micro metl
