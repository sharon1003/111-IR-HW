deck joist sizing and spacing joists are the repeated structural members that are used to build a deck frame the minimum size joist to be used in deck construction is not a standalone consideration and is related to the number of footings and beams that will be installed in general terms joists spaced 16 inches on center can span 15 times in feet their depth in inches a 2x8 up to 12 feet 2x10 to 15 feet and 2x12 to 18 feet the larger the deck the larger the joists in typical deck construction with a ledger on one side of the joist and beam on the other the size of the joists is driven by the size of the deck based on the general maximum spans mentioned above joist spacing oc 12 16 24species size allowable span southern pine 2x6 911 90 772x8 131 1110 982x10 162 140 1152x12 180 166 136douglas firlarchhemfirsprucepinefir2x6 98 84 6102x8 128 111 912x10 158 137 1112x12 180 159 1210redwoodwestern cedarspoderosa pine red pine2x6 810 80 6102x8 118 107 882x10 1411 130 1072x12 175 151 124for conventional guard rail post installation bolted to the side of the framing larger framing will provide for more strength in the rails for upper level decks 2x10 is recommended as the minimum size to use for strong guard post connections 2x6 joists should only be used on groundlevel decks that do not require and will not provide for any guards similar to guards if stairs are to be hung from the side of an upperlevel deck 2x10 as a minimum is recommended as it will exceed the depth of the first step joist hangers are used to attach the ends of joists to the face of a beam or a ledger board if you identify a crown in the board you should always install it upwards the crown will eventually settle after completing construction and should stiffen in the proper position after drying the layout term for joists is “on center” which is the center to center measurement from one joist to the next most decks use 16 on center spacing for joists most decking is not strong enough to support longer spans than 16 some builders reduce joist spacing to 12 on center to strengthen the deck frame or to increase maximum allowable joist spans before building a composite deck always read the installation instructions from the manufacturer paying special attention to the required joist spacing most composite decking materials require 16 on center spacing for straight decking and 12 on center joist spacing for 45 degree angle diagonal decking also many composite decking materials require 12 or even 10 on center stair stringers spacing to support composite stair treads if you are reinstalling composite decking over an existing frame you may need to install new intermediate joists or stair stringers to meet the installation requirements laying out the first joist position on an angle using a scrap piece of wood as a guide to locate the first joist in the situation of an angled corner use a sharpie or construction pencil to mark your joists marking joist locations at 16 on center spacing on the header with a marker toe nailing a joist to the rim joist installing a joist over a beam make sure the top of the joist is flush with the header toe nailing will fail in 75 mile per hour winds use hurricane clips in high wind areas use a chisel to notch beams to create a level frame notching a joist over a beam this joist was 14 higher than all the others you can notch out a section of the joist or add shims to a narrow joist to even out the top of the deck frame always fill all the nail holes for deck harware using a palmnailer or hammer to install a joist hangers with 112 teco nails to the ledger board inspect the board and trim off the rougher edge measuring the 2x10 pressure treated joist length to prepare for cutting use a speed square to square off your joists lift with your kneesinstalling 2x10 pressure treated joists at 16 on center be sure to install the joists crown side up you can use a pneumatic palm nailer installing a simpson strong tie h25z hurricane tie for every joist to beam connection next article deck joist cantilever rules and limits comments  questions add new comment
