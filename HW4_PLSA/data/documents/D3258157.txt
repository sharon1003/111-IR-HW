contesting a will on grounds of mental capacity for a will to be valid the person making the will the testator must have testamentary capacity people often refer to this as “being of sound mind” mental disability can give rise to mental incapacity but if someone is mentally ill it does not necessarily follow that they will automatically lack testamentary capacity and be unable to execute a valid will it is becoming increasingly common for wills to be contested on grounds of mental incapacity one very common situation is where the testator is suffering from alzheimer’s disease alzheimer’s and other age related illnesses are on the increase as the number of people suffering from the condition grows so does the number of contested will cases however the presence of alzheimer’s or similar degenerative conditions does not automatically mean that the person lacks mental capacity and that contesting their will is likely to be plain sailing each case must be considered on its own facts in most contested will cases involving mental incapacity issues some form of medical evidence will be required when preparing a will for an elderly or unwell person solicitors should take the precaution of obtaining a note from a doctor or gp to confirm that the testator has testamentary capacity this is sometimes referred to as “the golden rule” however the golden rule is not always followed so when a dispute subsequently arises the parties and their lawyers have to obtain evidence of the testator’s likely state of mind when the will was executed if it can be proved that the testator lacked mental capacity when the will was made then it is likely that a court will declare it invalid in which case any earlier will would be operative or if there is no earlier will the intestacy rules will apply contesting a will on grounds of undue influence allegations of undue influence are common in contested will claims testators should be free to make their will in whatever way they wish if a testator is compelled or coerced into executing a will then that will is likely to be declared invalid should the will be contested or challenged when wills are contested on this basis solicitors refer to it as undue influence however contesting a will on the basis of undue influence is not easy the courts require clear evidence of actual coercion it is not sufficient to merely show that the testator was put under moral pressure for instance or that a friend or family member deliberately set out to ingratiate themselves – however cynical and distasteful

of undue influence and think you will be able to obtain sufficient evidence to support the allegation then give us a call contesting a will on the grounds that it fails to make adequate financial provision unlike other countries people in the uk are free to leave their estate to whoever they wish however this can result in close family members or people who were dependent on the deceased suffering severe financial hardship to remedy these iniquities the inheritance provision for family and dependants act was passed in 1975 the act was intended to provide protection to people who had been financially dependent on the deceased where the will or the intestacy rules had not made adequate provision the inheritance act or the 75 act as lawyers sometimes call it can assist children spouses cohabitees and civil partners the ipfda can also assist anyone who was being financially supported by the deceased eg by living in a home which was owned by them under the 75 act dependants can ask the court to make financial provision for them regardless of what the deceased might have said in their will or what the intestacy rules state the court will take into account the needs and resources of the claimant as well as those of any beneficiaries other factors which the court will consider are age the length of any marriage and the parties’ conduct anyone thinking about contesting a will or intestacy by making an inheritance act claim will need to act fast very strict time limits apply and court proceedings must be commenced within six months of a grant of representation being made if you are already out of time however do not despair the court does have discretion to allow late inheritance act claims but it is vital to act quickly once you become aware of your right to make an inheritance claim contesting a will on grounds of lack of knowledge and approval wills can be contested on the basis that the testator did not know or approve the contents of the will knowledge and approval is generally presumed where the will has been properly executed and the maker of the will had full testamentary capacity nevertheless there are certain circumstances where there would be cause to believe that the testator did not know and approve the contents of the will contested will claims can arise for example where a beneficiary has taken an active role in the preparation of the will and there are concerns that the testator did not have the required level of knowledge and approval of the terms of the will he executed contesting a will on grounds of invalid procedure procedural irregularity is an allegation often made by people when contesting wills a will is not valid if it fails to comply with the requirements of the wills act 1837 the law is very

must be witnessed by two independent witnesses we have seen an increasing number of challenges being made where wills have been home made complying with the formalities of the wills act can be a
