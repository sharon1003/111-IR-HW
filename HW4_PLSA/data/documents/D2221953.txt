pagan holidayssection ten of biblical holy days compiled by richard c nickels distributed by giving  sharing po box 100 neck city mo 64849introduction section ten of biblical holy days covers the subject of holidays which are commonly observed but not derived from the bible encyclopedias and newspapers regularly report the pagan origins of many of these popular holidays yet the majority still continue to observe them the bible however condemns following pagan traditions the pagan holidays even if they have been dressed up by the catholic church to seem to be christian stand in contradiction to the almightys holy days commanded in the bible the messiah said that the majority would worship him in vain teaching for doctrines the commandments of men christmas easter halloween valentines day new years day and other holidays of pagan origin are to be carefully avoided by all those who seek to follow the bible let us observe the bible holy days not the holidays of man thus saith the lord learn not the way of the heathen and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven for the heathen are dismayed at them for the customs of the people are vain    jeremiah 1023 take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following them    and that thou enquire not after their gods saying how did these nations serve their gods even so will i do likewise thou shalt not do so unto the lord thy god for every abomination to the lord which he hateth have they done to their gods    what thing soever i command you observe to do it thou shalt not add thereto nor diminish from it deuteronomy 123032 but in vain they do worship me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men matthew 159 should a christian observe this worlds holidays have you ever stopped to consider the holidays observed by man in the united states canada and around the world many days other than gods holy days are observed  more or less depending on location three lists of holidays follow these are labeled for convenience as political special and religious political martin luther kings birthday lincolns birthday washingtons birthday may 1 armed forces day victoria day flag day canada day independence day labor day columbus day thanksgiving day  canada veterans day thanksgiving day special birthdays mothers day fathers day memorial day religious new years day epiphany candlemas valentines day st patricks day lent easter halloween hanukkah immaculate conception not all of the holidays are shown in fact there is nearly one holiday for every day of the year  not all are observed in every locality to the list of special days might be added ground hog day and april fools day one should determine the basis for these days before becoming involved there may be disagreement over the classification i have chosen some may say that memorial day and hanukkah should be classified as political our concern is not the classification but rather should the day be observed the original intent of many holidays has been lost changed or perverted political holidays note that there are more political days than religious days perhaps this shows our present inclinations to worship men rather than god many of these days are forced on us by the political system offices banks and schools are closed the patriotic origins are all but forgotten many have turned into just another day to go fishing or watch a favorite game on tv we should consider the fourth command also  the overlooked part  six days shall you labor     many sins result from idleness does god frown upon observance of political days certain national days were observed in old testament times see esther 92632 purim zechariah 819 special national fast days and john 1022 feast of dedication  now known as hanukkah these days had nothing to do with gods holy day plan they were important to gods people because of miraculous occurrences these days have significance to the jews but are of little or no importance to called and converted christians they are like our independence day and thanksgiving the days honoring individuals especially those who founded the country need to be carefully considered they border on violation of the first command if carried to the extreme for those who know the truth of the beginning of the blessings bestowed on the united states british commonwealth countries and western europe the real beginning of our heritage goes back to abrahams obedience for proof of this read the united states and britain in prophecy by herbert w armstrong the other political days need to be looked at in the light of the first and second commandments when you observe them are you putting another god or idol in place of the true god or are you putting a day that stands for godless atheism or humanism  may 1  in place of gods plan according to pastor peter peters writing in patriot review baal worship in america may day and the may pole the most important holiday in russia is may day the may pole and may day come from the worship of astarte and sacred pole ashera do you violate the intent of the sixth command when observing the militarily oriented days memorial day mothers and fathers day what about the special days honoring the memory of our loved ones on memorial day could turn into ancestor worship such as practiced in china remember the first commandment  thou shalt have no other gods before me exodus 203 if done in the context of the fifth command honor thy father and thy mother      exodus 2012 then it is a different matter as for mothers and fathers day havent they been grossly over commercialized again in the context of the fifth command such days could be justified however adoration such as that given to mary should not be done in recent years no sabbathkeeping church appears to have taken a stand on these days recently raymond c cole of the church of god the eternal stated that he had strong doubts about mothers day however because herbert armstrong continued to observe this day because we should do something for our mothers the worldwide church of god never took a stand on this issue perhaps mr coles concern is this quote from the american book of days by douglas the custom of holding a festival in honor of motherhood is very old it dates back in the western world to the times of the ancient greeks who worshipped cybele the mother of gods and honored her with rites in woods and caves the custom was introduced into rome from greece about 250 b c and on the ides of march the festival of hilaria in honor of cybele was begun and continued for three days but these celebrations were entirely different from that in honor of the human mothers on the second sunday in may birthdays should you observe your own birthday or attend birthday parties whose birthday would be the most important christs yet the bible nowhere gives the date of his birth most bible commentators recognize that the bible hints at a fall not winter birth for christ yet many believe they honor him in december if the saviors birthday was important dont you think god would have revealed the exact day of this most important birth note what job 33 says let the day perish wherein i was born     the other biblical references to birthdays are not favorable see genesis 40 where pharaoh celebrates his birthday by hanging his chief baker in matthew 14610 we find herod beheading john the baptist on herods birthday many believe that jobs children were apparently celebrating a birthday when calamity befell them job 1419 a good brief history of birthday observance is happy birthday what is the verdict by chuck w henry you may write him for a free copy at 3624 s 16 ft smith ar 72901 he quotes horoscope from the world book encyclopedia horoscope    is a chart that shows the influences the stars supposedly have on a person because of their positions at the time of his birth     astrologers also use positions of the stars a t the time they cast the horoscope to predict the persons future the word horoscope comes from the greek horoskopos meaning the one who observes the hour     further lets hear what the world book  childcraft international on holidays and birthdays has to say on this subject   for thousands of years people all over the world have thought of a birthday as a very special day long ago people believed that on a birthday a person could be helped by good spirits or hurt by evil spirits so when a person had a birthday friends and relatives gathered to protect him or her and thats how birthday parties began the idea of putting candles on birthday cakes goes back to ancient greece the greeks worshipped many gods and goddesses among them was one called artemis    the goddess of the moon the greeks celebrated her birthday once each month by bringing special cakes to her temple the cakes were round like a full moon and because the moon glows with light the cakes were decorated with lighted candles he also shows the pagan origins of spankings noisemakers and other birthday customs quoting kenneth c herrman should christians celebrate birthdays from the december 1959 plain truth magazine the jews in christs day knew gods law forbids celebrating birthdays josephus the jewish historian of the first century declares nay indeed the law does not permit us to make festivals at the birth of our children      against apion book ii 26 a still greater deterrent to annual birthday observance is the insertion of a 13th month in the 3rd 6th 8th 11th 14th17th and 19th years of a 19year cycle imagine the confusion of attempting to schedule birthday partiessolomon tells us it is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting for that is the end of all men and the living will lay it to his heart ecclesiastes 72 god is telling us that it is better to visit those grieving from a recent death rather than with those celebrating or partying birthdays religious holidays note gods commands in jeremiah 102 thus saith the lord learn not the way of the heathen     also deuteronomy 189     you shalt not learn to do after the abominations of those nations and also read deuteronomy 123031 god is warned that his people israel have a natural inclination to be like the heathen and worship like they do ezekiel 2032 if any religious holidays are pagan in origin these three scriptures alone are enough to cause us great concern to keep this paper within a reasonable length not all of the proof available on each day will be covered the reader should he want more conclusive evidence of what follows is urged to secure copies of the writings quoted or research the subject completely we are commanded to     prove all things     i thessalonians 521 new years day january 1when does gods year begin exodus 122 says this month shall be unto you beginning of months it shall be the first month of the year to you the name is abib or nisan and corresponds to march or april note that the context is passover time  in the spring of our roman calendar year see also exodus 2315 3418 deuteronomy 161 and esther 37 genesis 114 says the sun and moon would be the signs of the calendar division one rotation of the earth  1 day one rotation of the moon around the earth  1 month one rotation of the earth around the sun  1 year see our article in this series how does gods calendar work you can determine that the new moon begins each month by comparing psalms 813 and i chronicles 2331 with numbers 1010 2811 291 and leviticus 2324 writing for the radio church of god kenneth c hermann in gods sacred calendar 19623 says rather than follow the godgiven principles the roman calendar begins a new year in the dead of winter its day in the middle of the night and its months without reference to the moon    god made his calendar known to israel when he brought them out of egypt     our notion has gone back to observing the very calendar which our ancestors used during their slavery in egypt but isnt our calendar of christian origin doesnt it have the approval of almost all christian sects history answers our roman calendar is not christian in origin it descends directly from the egyptians who originated the 12 month year 365 day system     from journal of calendar reform september 1953 footnote p 128 further study brings one to the realization that the entire roman calendar is of pagan origin with the single exception of the sevendayweek feature     what happens on new years eve drunken orgies kissing other mens wives contrary to the 7th command and if a person is religious perhaps he goes to watch night services watching for what the celebration begins after dark and reaches its intensity at midnight gods day begins at sunset  not midnight see genesis 15 8 13 19 23 31 read also leviticus 227 and 155 which show that sundown commences the new day new years day is not celebrated at the right time of day or at the right time of year to be in agreement with gods calendar some historians even say that april fools day used to be new years day  all fools day from encyclopedia of religion this would make it closer to the true first day of the year which is in march or april yet there are more important reasons to avoid this celebration it is known that new years day dates from pagan babylonia 2000 years before christ the new years festivities that had originated in babylon found their way to greece and finally to rome the romans called it saturnalia    a time of revellings drinking bouts orgies  finally ending in human sacrificethe first day of the saturnalia shifted during the lifetime of rome    it began around the middle of december    and continued until january first in its midst was december twentyfifth the day as the romans calculated when the sun was at its lowest ebb     e w counts 4000 years of christmas page 28    caesar    instituted the new years festival on january first     he transferred to the first of january saturnalia from the truth about new years by william h ellis  ambassador college reprint 830 he goes on to show that the new years babe is dionysus or bacchus  the greek god of wine  and that the whitehaired old man father time is in reality the greek god cronos the silent reaper anciently reaped little children in horrible episodes of mythical cannibalism this greek rite of human sacrifice was adopted by ancient rome where human sacrifice was practiced at least until 300 a d there is nothing in gods word even remotely connected with this type holiday with beginnings so completely foreign to gods instructions julius caesar gave us january 1 as new years day the ancient roman calendar was lunar and began in march in 46 b c julius caesar asked the astronomer sosigenes to review the calendar and suggest ways for improving it acting on sosigenes suggestions caesar ordered the romans to disregard the moon for calculating their calendars and instituted twelve nonlunar months of 31 and 30 days except for february which had 29 days and 30 days every fourth year he moved the beginning of the year to january 1 the romans renamed quintilis to honor julius caesar giving us july the next month sextilis was renamed august to honor the emperor augustus caesar augustus moved a day from february to august to make august as long as july says the world book encyclopediain ancient rome the first day of the year was given over to honoring janus the god of gates and doors and of beginnings and endings the month of january was named after this god janus had two faces and looked both ahead and backward on the first day of the year the roman people looked back to what had happened during the past year and thought of what the coming year might bring romans gave one another presents on new years day many persons brought gifts to the roman emperor and wished him good fortune at first the gifts were simply branches of bay and palm trees but later more expensive presents were given catholics followed the julian calendar although for hundreds of years they observed the beginning of the year on march 25 which was then spring equinox and not on january 1 as julius caesar had instituted however january 1 became a catholic holiday in 487 a d when it was declared the feast of circumcision january 1 is 8 days after december 24 the world book encyclopedia article new years day says at first parties were not allowed on this day because the pagans had followed that custom this was gradually changed and celebrations could be held again slight errors in the julian calendar pushed january 1 and the times of the equinoxes ahead a little bit over the centuries pope gregory xiii in 1582 upon advice of astronomers dropped 10 days from october of that year the day that would have been october 5 1582 became october 15 restoring the next equinox to its proper date to correct the julian calendars regular errors the pope decreed that february would have an extra day 29 instead of 28 days in centuries that could be divided by 400 such as 1600 and 2000 but not in other century years such as 1700 1800 and 1900 catholics who had followed the julian calendar now followed the adjusted julian calendar called the gregorian calendar pope gregory returned to observance of january 1 as the beginning of the year not until 1752 did protestant england and america switch from a march 25 to a january 1 new year among the pagan customs of new years day continued today is the tradition of making noise with firecrackers andor gunshots at the beginning of the new year from ancient babylon india china russia and siam new years noisemaking was believed to frighten away evil spirits new years resolutions comes from the ancient roman custom of cleaning out ones chimney on new years day to bring good luck and a fresh start epiphany january 6 or twelfth night three kings day this day according to comptons encyclopedia commemorates the showing of christ to the magi the biblical justification if any would be the story found in matthew 2 this observance must be based on a december 25 birth we have already said that the bible nowhere indicates the exact date of christs birth but the indications are that it was in the fall the encyclopedia of religion ties this day to   the sunday following the octave of christmas     it was originally either a feast of christs baptism in the jordan or of his birth at bethlehem     the date may have at first been observed as a feast of the baptism of christ among the second century basilidian gnostics in the fourth century it was certainly a feast of the nativity of christ     part of the gnostics belief is that this day is the day when the phantoms entered christ at his baptism to literally believe this is to say that some spirit being angel or demon possessed christ and that he is not christ but some other being it is probably a perversion of the baptism of the holy spirit which occurred for christ after baptism as an example for us and which occurs for true believers after the laying on of hands immediately following baptism candlemas  february 2 valentines day february 14festival of the blessed virgin mary bvmforty days after december 24 is february 2 the catholic holiday of candlemas because the feast commemorates the purification of the bvm and the presentation of christ in the temple which took place according to luke 22239 forty days after his birth as the jewish law required  leviticus 1214   oxford dictionary of the christian church this day must relate to the pagan celebrations of valentines day and christmas for there is no biblical command to keep it one of the major means used by the catholic church for conversion of the pagan masses was to take pagan holidays and attach christian meaning to them baronius states that it was instituted by pope gelasius 492496 a d as a check to the heathen festival of the lupercalia  encyclopedia of religion  ethics  the transference of the festival from 14th to 2nd february was due to the institution of the festival of christmas qv on december 25 this day honors the nimrod of genesis 1089 eventually god caused shem to kill this despot for his evil antigod ways other names for nimrod was pan baal lupercus and santus or santa meaning saint hence saint valentines day the heart bal in babylonian became a symbol of nimrod he was the original valentine it is said women lusted after him why was february 14th chosen let dr herman l hoeh explain in st valentines day     reprint 240 ambassador collegethe romans called the festival the lupercalia the custom of exchanging valentines and all the other traditions in honor of lupercus  the deified herohunter of rome  was also linked anciently with the pagan practice of teenagers going steady it usually led to fornication today the custom of going steady is thought very modern it isnt it is merely are birth of an old custom handed down from the roman festival of the lupercalia celebrated in the month of february     thats the admission of the encyclopedia americana article st valentines day    nimrod    was said to have been born at the winter solstice    on january 6     later    on december 25 and is now called christmas     it was the custom    for the mother of a male child to present herself for purification on the fortieth day after the day of birth     forty days from the original day of january 6 is february 15 the celebration started the evening before this is how valentines day came to be observed on the 14th of february on that day nimrods mother semiramis was supposedly purified and made the first appearance as the mother and child the encyclopedia britannica indicates that nimrod was also called cupid which means desire later on semiramis married this cupid  her own son nimrod nimrod is the desire of women found in daniel 1137 can you find these practices approved of in the bible i corinthians 618 answers part of the valentines and new years activities  flee fornication     the seventh command as expanded by christ in matthew 52728 should cause us to avoid many of the customs involved in this worldly holiday st patricks day march 17this day is in honor of the patron saint of ireland  the man who introduced catholic christianity to that country perhaps this day would be better included with political observances for it has no real religious significance and certainly no biblical justification for any other than the irish those who observe it nowadays do so with an abundance of alcohol and wearing green easter and related holidayscomptons encyclopedia defines the easter related religious festivals as mardi gras french fat tuesday in many catholic countries lent is proceeded by a carnival season     elaborate pageants often close this season on shrove tuesday  the day before the beginning of lent ash wednesday  first day of lent    from the practice    of putting ashes on the foreheads of the faithful    to remind them that man is but dust and that he must do penance lent  period of forty days not including sundays ending with easter observed in memory of the 40 days fast of christ in the desert lent is nothing more than a continuation of a fast begun in babylon over 4000 years ago ezekiel 81314 says he said also unto me turn thee yet again and thou shalt see greater abominations that they do then he brought me to the door of the lords house which was toward the north and behold there sat women weeping for tammuz quoting herman l hoeh in where did god command you to observe lent radio church of god  1957 142 they wept for tammuz the false messiah of the pagans that weeping preceded the pagan festival in honor of the supposed resurrection of tammuz fasting was joined with weeping for a period of forty days before the festival in honor of tammuz the period of weeping and semifasting fell during the springtime that is why the word lent means spring lent is a continuation of the pagan springtime custom of abstaining from certain foods just prior to celebrating a fake resurrection and god calls lent an abominationpassion sunday  second sunday before easter palm sunday  sunday before easter     celebrates the triumphant entry of christ into jerusalem holy week begins on this day the problem with this day is that it really occurred on a thursday proof of this is found on pages 160163 of a harmony of the gospels in modern english first edition by fred coulter maundy thursday  thursday before easter     is in memory of the last supper of christ with his disciples the truth is that the last supper was on a tuesday evening good friday  friday before easter     commemorates the crucifixion the crucifixion really occurred on a wednesday as shown in other writings easter  first sunday after the first full moon after the vernal equinox ascension day  forty days after easter always the sixth thursday after easter this day celebrates the withdrawal of christ into heaven witnessed by the apostles  mark 1619 luke 2451 acts 19   oxford dictionary of the christian church article ascension of christ the this was kept from the later years of the 4th cent but is nowhere commanded in the bible whitsunday pentecost  fifty days after easter whitmonday  the day after whitsunday trinity sunday  sunday after whitsunday corpus christi  thursday after trinity sunday is a festival of the roman catholic church in honor of the eucharist     as early as augustines time     after the council of constance 141418 the popes took occasion by the amplification of indulgences to stimulate the zeal of the faithful still further     corpus christi from religious encyclopedia some confusion exists over the beginning of this day but it was not observed by the early church these days are all false  not commanded by god  some with their roots in pagan antiquitythe resurrection was not on sunday nor the crucifixion on friday therefore these celebrations connected with easter are not of god mardi gras is just plain debauchery seminude women creating lust too much alcohol and revelry all directed to pleasing the flesh just a few weeks before the most serious event in gods holy day season then 40 days of semifasting to supposedly put one back into the mood for a false crucifixion and a false resurrection god instructs us to live righteously yeararound the encyclopedia of religion  ethics says joseph addison in the year 1684 or 1685 took part in another shrovetide custom at lichfield grammar school it was a custom practiced at christmas and shrovetide and links the bacchanalian customs of shrovetide with the saturnalian license of christmas like the rest this celebration of pagans has been given christian meaning as a pacifier of the masses easter only appears once in the king james version in acts 124 as a mistranslation it should read passover you can verify this yourself in your concordance the word easter comes from astarte  a title for beltis queen of heaven or istarte astarte was the consort of baal the sun god refer back to valentines day to see who baal was it is readily apparent that astarte was none other than baals mother semiramisby now the reader should be realizing that all of this worlds religious holidays have a pagan origin halloween or allhallows hallowmas or all saints day evidently the druids celebrated this day in honor of samhain lord of the dead this samhain is also known as saman or satan this celebration began long before christs time later on the catholic church picked this day to honor all of the various saints as there were not enough days for each one to have a separate day hence the name all saints day originally this day was to teach the false doctrine of the immortality of the soul in early germany there was a custom of praying to the dead on this date this custom became the belief that those dead who had not quite made it could be helped to a higher heaven by the prayers of the living in other words once dead you really were not dead but waiting to be perfected before you could reach the final heaven and see the beatific vision of course this is contrary to the biblical teaching that the dead are really dead awaiting one of the three resurrections the trick or treat practice of today comes from an old custom of buying off the demons so that they would not curse your next years crop for further proof of the pagan background of this day see halloween through twenty centuries the book of halloween or halloween where did it come from ambassador college reprint 160 immaculate conception december 8god did not record marys birthday  it is therefore impossible to know the exact date of her conception the idea that mary was immaculately conceived is nothing but a figment of mens perverse reasoning see the oxford dictionary of christian church article immaculate conception of the bvm for proof hanukkah feast of lights near winter solstice december 21the new century dictionary says the feast of the dedication a jewish festival commemorating the dedication of the new altar on the occasion of the purifying of the temple at jerusalem after its pollution by antiochus epiphanes    beginning of the 25th day of the month kesleve and lasting for eight days mostly in december called also festival of lights from the lights burned specially during this period note that this is the day mentioned in john 1022 christs presence on that day neither signifies approval nor disapproval however the encyclopedia of religion says according to some historians the origin of the festival is to be found in pagan festivals of light in midwinter the prayers for hanukkah refer only to the victory but in practice the kindling of the lights is the main feature of the festival     it is nowadays customary for hanukkah presents to be given to children this practice if found in none of the early sources and seems certain to have been introduced to offset the giving of christmas presents at this season of year the meaning of this feast as originally observed seems to have been replaced by the pagan practices associated with christmas note the similarities  8 days the octave of saturnalia festival of light rebirth of the sun and gift giving christmas  december 25as alluded to earlier this day does not really honor christs birth the real origins are the birth of nimrod baal since christs time the roman church converted a pagan holiday into a christian holiday  just like they did all of the other holidays it was a deliberate attempt to get away from gods holy days which were called jewish days note the clever transference the real new years day became april fools day the passover christs death on a wednesday became good friday unleavened bread became holy week and the resurrection  not even commanded to be observed  became easter a day originally observed in honor of nimrod and semiramis then christs birth another day without biblical justification became christmas  a day originally observed in honor of the birth of nimrod the original mother and child was not mary and christ but rather semiramis and nimrod many centuries before christs birth this day was not celebrated by the early church not observed in the christian community until the 4th century and made official by the roman church in the 5th century to be celebrated on the day of the old roman feast of the birth of sol     per the encyclopedia americana christmas relates back to the pagan brumalia december 25 after the saturnalia december 1724 or the octave and celebrates the shortest days of the year and the rebirth of the sun for a full explanation see the plain truth about christmas from ambassador college which shows the pagan origins of santa claus mistletoe the christmas tree but note jeremiah 1026  holly wreath and yule log if you are concerned about the giftgiving at this time of year just stop and think who the wise men gave their gifts to it was not to each other it is customary to give gifts when coming into the presence of a ruler conclusion now to directly answer our title question should a christian observe this worlds holidays political holidays are not directly prohibited in the bible depending on their nature there is evidence that some of these type of days were observed special holidays depending on how they are observed can be either bad or good there are none of this worlds religious holidays that a true christian should observe he should rather observe gods holy days as outlined in leviticus 23 deuteronomy 16 ezekiel 2012 20 exodus 3113 and 341823 if you are keeping this worlds holidays god is talking to you in deuteronomy 123031 mark 77 9 13 hosea 211 13 revelation 221819 and matthew 159 come out of her my people that
