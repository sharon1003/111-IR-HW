overview of pancreatic stenting and its complications authors marc f catalano md facg facp fasge agaf vivek kaul md facg section editor douglas a howell md fasge facg deputy editor kristen m robson md mba facgintroductionpancreatic endotherapy has been increasingly used for the treatment of a variety of pancreatic disorders including chronic pancreatitis idiopathic acute recurrent pancreatitis pancreatic duct leaks or disruptions drainage of pseudocysts and the prevention of pancreatitis following endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ercp one of the most common types of pancreatic endotherapy is pancreatic stenting stenting of the main pancreatic duct has been used to relieve ductal obstruction often in the setting of refractory pain from strictures stones or papillary stenosis in addition stenting of the minor papilla has been used in the treatment of symptomatic pancreas divisum secondary to a stenotic minor papilla  1  the indications efficacy and complications related to pancreatic stents will be reviewed here the role of pancreatic stents to prevent ercpinduced pancreatitis is discussed in detail separately see prophylactic pancreatic stents to prevent ercpinduced pancreatitis when do you use them  instruments and techniquesa variety of guidewires dilators and stents are available the choice of instruments will depend upon the clinical setting guidewires — guidewires vary in diameter 0018 0021 0025 and 0035 and length and may be hydrophilic straight have a j tip or a loop tip they are available with various radiopaque markings to minimize fluoroscopy time some guidewires are tefloncoated which provides the greatest stability for stent placement and accessory exchanges electrically insulated wires can be left in place during sphincterotomy glidewire and roadrunner are special wires used for difficult cannulation and access at ercp dilators — two types of dilators are most commonly used balloon dilators and dilating catheters balloon dilators are inflation devices housed on a catheter which are used to deliver a specific pressure to a strictured or stenosed area they are available in several diameters and lengths an inflation device is required to pressurize the balloon at a controlled rate to continue reading this article you must log in with your personal hospital or group practice subscription subscribe log in
