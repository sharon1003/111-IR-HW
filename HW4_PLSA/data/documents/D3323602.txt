took over most of africa in the late 1800s by 1914 all of africa was under white rule except for ethiopia and liberia white rule in most places lasted till the 1960s the european powers that took part britain france portugal germany belgium italy spain as late as 1880 most of africa was still free in tropical africa europeans controlled parts of the coast and sent some missionaries inland but that was pretty much it parts to the north were under french and turkish rule parts to the south were settled by the dutch who became afrikaners until the late 1800s malaria and distance made white rule across most of africa next to impossible but then came steamships 1802 railways 1811 quinine 1850 machine guns the gatling gun in 1861 and particularly the maxim in 1884 and undersea telegraph cables 1866 in the late 1870s belgium and portugal began to make moves in africa other countries fearing they would lose out joined in so began the scramble the rules for the scramble were laid down at the berlin conference 18841885 in effect those who controlled a part of the coast could move inland and take over that bit of africa without fear of having to fight other european countries those who did not use their right would lose it this came during a long peace in europe that was huge it meant that while africans were busy fighting each other the europeans were not africans at that time did not even think of themselves as “africans” that came later as a side effect of white rule weapons in 1890 europeans agreed not to sell arms to africans that was huge too africans had nothing that could fight off machine guns the only guns they had in large numbers were mostly just muskets which take six times longer to load and shoot than even a rifle armies even apart from weapons most african armies were neither large nor welltrained africa did not have standing or professional armies like europe did europe’s greater wealth also meant it could field larger armies – partly made up of african mercenaries so in the course of the 1880s and 1890s europeans took over almost all of africa churchill took part in it as a young british soldier in sudan he wrote about it in “the river war” 1899 even the white countries in southern africa lost their independence they were defeated by the british in the boer wars 18801881 18991902 only ethiopia successfully defended itself defeating italy at the battle of adowa 1896 liberia lost land to france and britain but held on to independence it was in effect under american protection until at least the 1960s many europeans regarded their rule of africa as good welcomed even by the africans themselves after all whites brought peace and things like railways roads lamps bicycles ploughs new foods and city life what is freedom compared to that

responseson wednesday may 11th 2011 at 181824sailorscout1986you missed out holland and germany i think it’s fair to say that europe still thinks of that time as good the only reason they left was because it wasn’t economically viable for them anymore i often wonder what africa would be like now if the scramble had not happened liked by 1 personon wednesday may 11th 2011 at 183842the cynic interesting post you should do another about what colonial life was like under european rule economics work exploitation administration religion colonial development education and interesting events

blankhttpsabagondwordpresscom20110203anopenlettertokingleopoldiilikeon thursday may 12th 2011 at 033919sam well finland did not because it had been colonized by the swedes for 800 years and passed on the russian empire in 1809 we got our independence in 1917 what happened in africa was pretty much what had happened in americas before with one exception in africa the people were too many to be wiped out and cultural history was too long and rich to be pushed into reservations the trigger might have been the quinine after that the malaria was no longer such an absolute terror which it had been before knowledge of other tropical deseases and their treatments also lowered the psychological barrier i saw a documentary of a finnish skipper who ran a river boat in kongo during the worst times of king leopold forgot the name of the guy his diary was the bases of the doc at first the guy was affraid of everything then he developed almost a crush to the tropics then he became resentful and hated the whole continent what was interesting was that from the beginning he was abhorred by the behaviour of the belgians towards the locals that went on during his whole stay in kongo some decade or more at first he protested then he tried to rationalise it then he just closed his eyes and tried to not to see the atrocities of course the belgians paid his salary so…if i remember correctly he left the place and moved back to finland and then eventually to us not sure if i remember this right likeon thursday may 12th 2011 at 041917redman1000a lot of this lead to ww1 likeon thursday may 12th 2011 at 051629sailorscout1986oh my bad i read an article in the economist about ‘the new colonialists’ it was about china taking an interest in africa and was trying to imply that they are taking advantage of african countries in reality the chinese are not taking anything without payment unlike the europeans before the chinese have brought a lot of scummy business practices over there like building hospitals that begin to fall apart in months wtf but nevertheless it was interesting for the magazine to paint such a negative picture on what is essentially mutual business it’s like the world perceives africans as babies and i hate that likeon thursday may 12th 2011 at 070751king proudchocolategirl no i believe that it was indeed nzinga who’s territory at the time of

it’s about the rwandan massacreit shows what happens when you sit around and wait for others to do something when the others have no vested interest america had no gain from stopping this massacre so they did nothing maybe the same thing could be said about white supremacy in america we live in a sad world likeon thursday may 12th 2011 at 170743tyrone abagond history is the most hated subject in school yet it’s the most important the history lesson that you gave to all of us will never see the light of day in the public school system in this country black people are discouraged from knowing their history and we see the results of brainwashing and miseducation amongst the masses of black people on this planet abagond encourage everybody to pass along the knowledge tyrone zen aquarius likeon friday may 13th 2011 at 011540tyrone abagond it’s amazing how the tables have been turned the europeans invaded africa for economic reasons and now the same is being done to europe irony despite all the evil that has been done to “momma africa” for the past 500 years she will be victorious and prosperous indeedtyrone free aquarius httpwwwtheafricachannelcom likeon friday may 13th 2011 at 124959victoria tyrone said “black people are discouraged from knowing their history…”not only that but knowing black history and literature is optional in the us everyone is required to know who came to america and established the first colonies that is the standard everyone is required to read the famous works of not only american authors but british as well yet the people who lived and died to build our economy are but a paragraph in a textbook and singsong tales about inventions and accomplishments in the month of february no one is actually required to know who they were and how they lived what their lives were like what traditions they were forced to leave behind how people from so many different countries pushed together on a ship became like family and merged their cultures and learned to communicate in each other’s languages in a final effort to still feel connected to something no that stuff ends up being optional information wp think it’s for bp to know but paul revere who doesn’t know about him likeon friday may 13th 2011 at 230717tariq no no no it was not weapons that were used to take over africa what it was was white people coming in there acting all nice and throwing the africans off just like they do now look at how ww patronize bm and look at the divide and conquer going on now between bm and bw they send in those missionaries remember in avatar the white folks act all nice and friendly showing everybody the bible while the scouts are surveying the land for the resources then they get violent when the people figure out whats going on and ask for payment for the items they are taking out of the country thats when white folks start shooting likeon saturday may 14th 2011 at 013917mochasister tariq you are so right about the divide and conquer that is going on between black men and black women there is so much hatred and anger between us it makes me want to cry likeon monday may 16th 2011 at 110036deeplease have an article about black people and indie rocklikeon saturday may 21st 2011 at 074046awryguy if you want an elegant and disturbing view of how the european colonists saw themselves i suggest you read joseph conrad’s “heart of darkness” it’s the story of a man employed to travel up the congo river and retrieve a rogue ivory trader but it’s really the story of colonization and the dark side of human nature to me the most striking passage is when marlow sees a french warship firing blindly into the jungle at natives it can’t even be sure are there conrad wrote it in 1889 and if it seems familiar that’s because it was the inspiration for “apocalypse now” likeon saturday may 21st 2011 at 160855awryguybulanikgirl the book is a lot more complex than wikipedia would have you believe joseph conrad was writing a pyschological drama turning on one man’s reaction to the horrors of colonialism while steamboating up the congo river he was basing that on the time that he actually witnessed the horrors of colonialism while steamboating up the congo river in the novel it’s not just the africans who are dehumanized – the few europeans he meets wind up being sadistic bullies or batshit crazy or both so to your points1 every character in the book is a metaphorical extension of the darkness and danger or the jungle entering the jungle itself is a metaphor for unleashing the dark side of human nature conrad was arguing that the socalled “civilizing project” of colonization was a farce because you can’t drag someone out of the jungle by entering it yourself hence the hopeless mission to retrieve kurtz 2 i think if you actually read the book you’ll find a sympathy for oppressed africa that was well outside the norm for its time remember he actually captained a steamboat up the congo river to see things for himself – and this was in the 19th century everyone emerges from the society they live in and if joseph conrad lived today he’d probably be a freelance journalist reporting on civil war in the congo rather than judge his worldview as ugly and racist thought it was condescending i think a generous person can look at conrad and see a guy who saw oppression and wanted it to stop we need more authors like him today likeon sunday may 22nd 2011 at 001022awryguybulanikgirl sorry about the unkind conclusion but it looked a lot like you’d just jumped to the “controversy” section of the wikipedia page and grabbed the main points my mistake likeon sunday may 22nd 2011 at 220239dahoman xquoting the cynic interesting post you should do another about what colonial life was like under european rule economics work exploitation administration religion colonial development education and interesting events etc … decolonization and neocolonialism also sound like interesting topics…i second this the living conditions of africans under colonization and the struggles which led to independence especially deserve to be better known  the cynic regarding colonial life try and google afrique 50 by rené vautier it’s a short documentary that was made in the former french colonies during the decade preceding the independence it was banned by french colonial authorities because the realities it described went against the propaganda of the time the french version of the movie is easily available on the net but you should look for the english version i would provide a link but unfortunately i’m currently experiencing some connection issues which prevent me from viewing movies online there are also articles by historians dealing on the subject this one for instancehttpwwwwebguineenetbibliothequehistoirejscanaleeoahcolonialsystgncolonsysthtml it specifically covers the case of guinea but i believe it gives a good idea of what colonization actually was regardless of the nationality of the colonizer and the place they chose to “civilize” likeon wednesday june 1st 2011 at 070712hannu lagain not having read the whole thread i personally think that the berlin conference is one of the biggest crimes against humanity there’s a germsn tv documentary i saw about the politics and dispute between the european countries greedely fighting ovet the spoils of africa how little they cared of people’s lives the different tribes and nations of idigenous people… it is simply disgusting and apalling the longlasting european image of lazy africans is largely based on the fact that belgians basically starved africans to death meaning that they didn’t give them enough food to be able to work…labour was cheap those days…one worker died but was easily replaced by another slave of another village human life was expendable profit was the only thing that mattered civilization was just an excuse for a continentwide exploitation likeon friday june 3rd

was this what happened in ireland especialy scotland and even wales was shockingly similar to what happened in africa though on a much smaller scaleit was as if a dragon got the taste for human meat and then saw a town – and proceeded to eat everyone it found in an orgy of debauchery other places the canary islands south america north america funyn how the oppressed often become oppressors scots and irish benefitted from and helped build the empire that then conquered africa but they had been among europe’s most beknighted colonized people for several centuries oddly memory is longer than lives the scots in a bar were nostalgic for a time that hasn’t been relevant in the living memory of their great grandparents’ grandparents africa was in the wrong place at the wrong time the celts managed to eke out of it maybe the people of africa will i spent a few months in botswana a decade ago it was pretty impressive they seem to have eked out likeon thursday november 21st 2013 at
