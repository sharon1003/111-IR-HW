been used in buildings for daylighting and ventilation many studies have even shown that health comfort and productivity are improved due to wellventilated indoor environments and access to natural light however windows also represent a major source of unwanted heat loss discomfort and condensation problems in 1990 alone the energy used to offset unwanted heat losses and gains through windows in residential and commercial buildings cost the united states 20 billion onefourth of all the energy used for space heating and cooling in recent years windows have undergone a technological revolution highperformance energyefficient window and glazing systems are now available that can dramatically cut energy consumption and pollution sources they have lower heat loss less air leakage and warmer window surfaces that improve comfort and minimize condensation these highperformance windows feature double or triple glazing specialized transparent coatings insulating gas sandwiched between panes and improved frames all of these features reduce heat transfer thereby cutting the energy lost through windows this resource page covers basic concepts for specifying window and glazing systems particularly energyefficient windows description window systems are comprised of glass panes structural frames spacers and sealants in recent years the variety of glass types coatings and frames available for use in window systems has increased dramatically as has the opportunity to finetune and optimize window selection on a projectbyproject basis factors affecting window performance image courtesy of energy user news careful specification of window and glazing systems is essential to the energy efficiency and comfort of all buildings in residential skinload dominated structures such as housing optimum window design and glazing specification can reduce energy consumption from 10–50 below accepted practice in most climates in internalload dominated commercial industrial and institutional buildings properly specified fenestration systems have the potential to reduce lighting and hvac costs 10–40 window and glazing choices should be considered holistically once the design team and owner agree on the design problem window and glazing options can be evaluated issues to consider include heat gains and losses visual requirements privacy glare viewshading and sun control thermal comfort condensation control ultraviolet control acoustic control color effects daylighting energy requirements ultimately the optimum choice of window and glazing systems will depend on many factors including the building use type the local climate utility rates and building orientation a specifying windows and glazings to fully specify a window system it is necessary to specify the following characteristics window uvalue window solar heat gain coefficient shgc or shading coefficient scglass visible transmittance t visglassfor specific aesthetic and performance objectives the specifier may also wish to specify tints colors and coatings uvalue uvalue indicates the rate of heat flow due to conduction convection and radiation through a window as a result of a temperature difference between the inside and outside the higher the ufactor the more heat is transferred lost through the window in winter the units of uvalue are btus per hour per square foot per °f btuhr · ft² · °fufactors usually range from a high of 13 for a typical aluminum frame single glazed window to a low of around 02 for a multipaned highperformance window with lowemissivity coatings and insulated frames a window with a ufactor of 06 will lose twice as much heat under the same conditions as one with a ufactor of 03 total or net window ufactors can be considerably higher than the centerofglass ufactors solar heat gain coefficient shgcshgc indicates how much of the suns energy striking the window is transmitted through the window as heat as the shgc increases the solar gain potential through a given window increases the shgc is a ratio between 0 and 1 shgc  0 means none of the incident solar gain is transmitted through the window as heat and shgc  1 means all of the incident solar energy is transmitted through the window as heat a window with a shgc of 06 will admit twice as much solar heat gain as one with a shgc of 03 typically windows with low shgc values are desirable in buildings with high airconditioning loads while windows with high shgc values are desirable in buildings where passive solar heating is needed the term shgc is relatively new and is intended to replace the term shading coefficient sc while the terms are related the shading coefficient of glass is defined as the ratio of the solar heat gain through a given glazing as compared to that of clear 18 inch single pane glass solar radiation courtesy of efficient windows collaborative heat flow courtesy of efficient windows collaborative visible transmittance tvisglasst visglass indicates the percentage of the visible portion of the solar spectrum that is transmitted through a given glass product sunlight is an electromagnetic form of energy exchange between the sun and the earth it is composed of a range of electromagnetic wavelengths generally categorized as ultraviolet uv visible and infrared ir referred to collectively as the solar spectrum the short uv wavelengths are largely invisible to the naked eye but are responsible for fabric fading and skin damage visible light is made up of those wavelengths detectable by the human eye this light contains about 47 of the energy in sunlight longer ir wavelengths are also invisible and contain about 46 of the energy in sunlight for a given glazing system the term coolness index k e  also called efficacy factor is the ratio of the t visglass to the shading coefficient sc tints color and coatings the properties of a given glass can be altered by tinting or by applying various coatings or films to the glass glass tints are generally the result of colorants added to the glass during production some tints are also produced by adhering colored films to the glass following production tints are usually selected for aesthetic purposes some tints also help reduce solar gains coatings usually in the form of metal oxides can also be applied to glass during production some of these coatings called lowemissivity or lowe help reduce radiant heat transfer between panes of glass by blocking some or all of the ir wavelengths these coatings can dramatically lower the window ufactor care should be taken in specifying tints and coatings as their application can dramatically impact window heat loss and heat gain misspecification can result in the exact opposite of the desired performance from a performance perspective specifying window ufactor shgc and glass visible transmittance t visglass means there is no need to specify tints and coatings there are far more glazings available for buildings today than there were even a few years ago some recommendations for specifying windows and glazings include in general cases specify low ufactors  040 for residential applications even lower values may be desired in extreme heating climates when specifying windows performance take care to specify whole product performance values for ufactor and shgc use of glassonly ufactors should be avoided as they can be 10 to 40 better than the whole product value in climates with significant air conditioning loads specify windows with low shgc values  040 in general high  70 glass visible transmittance is desired especially for daylighting applications for commercial buildings in conjunction with daylighting strategies analyze the tradeoffs between standard glazing and high coolness index also called spectrally selective glass spectrally selective glass has a relatively high visible transmittance and a relatively low shgc in general low shgc windows should be considered for east and westfacing glazing as a means of controlling solar heat gain and increasing occupant comfort for large commercial and industrial structures specify low shgc windows on the east south and west facades shgc for northfacing windows is not critical for most latitudes in the continental united states for buildings where passive solar heating energy is desired southfacing windows with high shgc values coupled with low ufactors should be specified select windows with comfort in mind the proper specification of windows can result in higher mean radiant temperature mrt in winter and lower mrt in summer improving occupant comfort and

properly specified for your application always consider glare control especially in commercial and industrial applications limiting contrast ratios and providing visual comfort in the field of view is critical particularly in daylighting applications avoid condensation problems condensation occurs when the glass surface temperature falls below the dew point of the room air it can damage window and wall elements and obstruct views historic buildings often require special window detailing the desire to achieve historical accuracy can sometimes conflict with the desire to provide energy efficiency
