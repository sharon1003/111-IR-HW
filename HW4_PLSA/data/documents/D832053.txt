species who should be concerned with speciation testing what are the obstacles to adapting speciation testing what is speciation speciation is defined by the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac as ‘the distribution of an element amongst defined chemical species in a system’ chemical species include isotopic composition oxidation or electronic states and molecular structures speciation analysis refers to the analytical process of identifying andor measuring the amounts of one or more individual chemical species present in a sample elemental oxidation states z element

chemical species elemental and chemical species are considered to be vital in many fields of health and science human nutrition and health can be influenced by the absence or presence of specific chemical species such as selenium arsenic iron and mercury in human nutrition the varied forms of iron can have different amounts of biological activity a number of iron supplements comprise of these biologically available forms of iron such as ferrous fumarate instead of more biologically inert forms such as ferrous oxide selenium species are associated with the treatment of disease studies have demonstrated the value of organoselenium compounds in the treatment of tumor growth and the scavenging of free radicals ferrous fumarate toxicity plays a role in the significance of speciation and the need to measure elemental species some species of heavy metals can be extremely toxic to animals and humans for instance organic mercury compounds are more toxic than inorganic mercury compounds the reverse condition is true in the case of the heavy metal arsenic whose organic forms mma dma arsenobetaine and arsenocholine are much less toxic than the inorganic forms aresine arsenite and arsenate a median lethal dose ld 50 of arsenobetaine is more than 10000 mgkg while the ld 50 of arsine is only mgkg ppm arsenic species toxicity arsenic species ld 50 mgkgarsenite as iii 14arsenate as v

in human health conventionally chromium in the form of trivalent chromium or cr iii has been considered to be a dietary supplement however recent studies now contend that it may not play as significant a role in human health to guarantee supplementation however another form of chromium has been found to have a definite negative impact on human health hexavalent chromium or cr vi is potentially carcinogenic and has an oral toxicity between 50 and 150 µgkg chromium oxidation states oxidation states of chromium2 na 2 cr co 51 na 2 cr 2 co 100 cr 2 c 6 h 6 21 k 3 cr cn 5 no2 cr cl

by an organism that species becomes more biologically available and thus potentially toxic the potential of a chemical species to cross biological barriers that is bloodbrain cell membranes and intestines increases toxicity finally toxicity is affected if a chemical species can go through modification accumulation or excretion from biological systems who should be concerned with speciation testing as more data is gathered regarding the toxicity of chemical species it becomes increasingly vital to target the forms of specific elements and chemicals with the highest potential toxicity many fields of chemistry and science are now becoming involved in determining the need for speciation in their testing methods environmental laboratories are moving away from testing total mercury and total chromium levels in favor of testing for the more dangerous cr vi and organomercury species nutraceutical and pharmaceutical industries are establishing guidelines for the limitation of inorganic arsenic and mercury species under the new usp 232 2232 and ich guidelines what are the obstacles to adapting speciation testing almost 40 years ago the potential for detecting individual chemical and elemental species started despite the value of determining individual chemical species there are a number of obstacles to be resolved prior to widely implementing the methods for speciation related stories analysis of heavy metal contamination of red pepper spices and hot sauce lead levels in nutraceutical hemp products a guide to pesticide solubility sample collection and preservation is one of the first obstacles it is essential for the chemical species to be preserved or testing must take place insitu for accurate results chemical species can alter states with oxidation or reduction reactions in response to environmental factors preservatives microbial activity time or container interactions common sample preparation techniques include the addition of chemical compounds which can bring about reactions and change the p h of the samples which then enables the change in state of target elements natural processes such as temperature changes microbial activity time and chemical volatility can cause the chemical species to change states finally the actual collection vessel will be able to contribute to contamination or facilitate absorption of chemicals into or from the materials of the container and thus change the distribution of the chemical species in the sample after a sample is collected a process of sample preparation or treatment starts to prepare the sample for analytical testing the sample preparation methods can also be responsible for variations in the distribution of the chemical species extraction processes can introduce oxidizers and heat to the sample it is possible to see this effect when there is methylation of mercury from sediments during an extraction process some chemical compounds need to be derivatized before analysis but these derivatization steps can modify the chemical state of the sample one example refers to the formation of methyl and ethylmercury in a reaction between the sodium tetranpropyl borate derivatization agent and inorganic mercury some type of chemical or instrumental analysis for determining identification and quantitation of target chemicals is considered to be the next step of an analysis procedure there are a number of different methods for the separation of samples into their component states or species these methods usually couple a chromatographic or separation process to an ionization or electromagnetic process then to a spectrometry process the most common separation processes are liquid chromatography lc capillary electrophoresis ce and gas chromatography gc these separation techniques permit each state or species to be measured as a single peak or unit in time this is followed by ionizing the samples or subjecting them to a magnetic field or charge by an inductively coupled plasma icp or electrospray ionization process esi prior to detection using a measurement and detection system such as atomic or optical emission spectroscopy aes or oes or mass spectrometry ms separation processes lcicpms the fastest growing technology for speciation analysis uses a liquid chromatography system coupled to an icpms this technology which commenced in the 1980s has experienced slow growth over the past few decades only to explode into the analytical world within the last 15 years in 2000 there were just under 300 academic articles citing the lcicpms technique by the end of 2014 there were more than 1200 articles citing the use of lcicpms lcicpms articles cited despite the improvements in speciation analysis the techniques themselves still pose some challenges to incorporating speciation analysis into routine laboratory testing cost is often considered to be the first hurdle the costs associated with a hyphenated system combine all the costs of each individual system and then increase the costs of operation and training there are a number of technical challenges for each type of system which can increase the complexity of obtaining precise speciation results for instance separation and chromatographic techniques are dependent upon the separation and resolution of all the components it is possible to challenge these techniques by coeluting compounds and loss of species or compounds to unseparated areas of the analysis many times it is essential for the column yield of these techniques to be checked by mass balance of the total elemental concentration distribution changes can also be caused by these chromatography techniques in hplc some species of arsenic and antimony can change through the oxygen present in mobile phases to other states in gc phenyl mercury salts can transform to diphenyl mercury two of the final obstacles are in regard to reference materials and regulations it has only been within the last few years that the techniques of speciation analysis have started to appear in methodologies and regulations presently most of the regulations are merely concerned with cr vi and organotin compounds newer regulations such as the usp 232 ich and usp 2232 are incorporating analyzes for arsenic and mercury species these regulations are in a state of development and flux and it will be some time before the final methods are implemented after these regulations and methods are finalized it will then be a challenge to discover standards and reference materials for all of the different elemental and chemical species covered under the directives the true value of a reference or standard material will be the homogeneity accuracy and stability of its stated chemical species distribution arsenic
