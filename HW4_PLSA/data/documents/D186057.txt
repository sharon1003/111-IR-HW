nextit is possible to figure out how far away a lightning strike is with some simple math sound travels through air at  the speed of sound  officially the speed of sound is 3313 meters per second 1087 feet per second in dry air at 0 degrees celsius 32 degrees fahrenheit at a temperature like 28 degrees c 82 degrees f the speed is 346 meters per second as you can see the speed of sound changes depending on the temperature and the humidity but if you want a round number then something like 350 meters per second and 1200 feet per second are reasonable numbers to use so sound travels 1 kilometer in roughly 3 seconds and 1 mile in roughly 5 seconds when you see the flash of a lightning bolt you can start counting seconds and then divide to see how far away the lightning struck if it takes 10 seconds for the thunder to roll in the lightning struck about 2 miles or 3 kilometers away for more information on lightning and related topics check out the links on the next page brain stuff how can you figure out how far away lightning struck check out this podcast from how stuff works to learn how to gauge the distance of a lightning strike with a simple equation000313share subscribe
