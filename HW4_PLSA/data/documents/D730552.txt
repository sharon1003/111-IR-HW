astronomers have discovered the largest object in the universe in fact its so big it might challenge a key principle of cosmology predicted by none other than einstein himself the object is a group of quasars from that four billion light years across together they form the largest structure in the universe researchers at the university of central lancashire reported in the journal of the royal astronomical society the quasar structure is more than 1600 times as big as our galaxy the milky way its also roughly 24 sextillion miles or the length of 3240 sextillion london buses it has been known for more than 20 years that quasars  the nuclei of galaxies from the early history of the universe  tend to gather together in clumps but this cluster  the large quasar group  is far bigger than any previously discovered it is so massive that it might prove tricky for the cosmological principle established by einstein that on very large scales the universe looks the same no matter where you observe it from the royal astronomical society explains to give some sense of scale our galaxy the milky way is separated from its nearest neighbour the andromeda galaxy by about 075 megaparsecs mpc or 25 million lightyears whole clusters of galaxies can be 23 mpc across but lqgs can be 200 mpc or more across based on the cosmological principle and the modern theory of cosmology calculations suggest that astrophysicists should not be able to find a structure larger than 370 mpc the lqg is about 1200 mpc across  or four times larger than it should be dr roger clowes who led the study saidwhile it is difficult to fathom the scale of this lqg we can say quite definitely it is the largest structure ever seen in the entire universe this is hugely exciting â€“ not least because it runs counter to our current understanding of the scale of the universe even travelling at the speed of light it would take 4 billion years to cross this is significant not just because of its size but also because it challenges the cosmological principle which has been widely accepted since einstein our team has been looking at similar cases which add further weight to this challenge and we will be continuing to investigate these fascinating phenomena suggest a correction michael rundle huffington post ukmorespace news quasar news albert einstien space universe
