deadline for tax year 2016 traditional ira and roth ira contributions received between january 1 and the tax filing deadline may be attributed to tax year 2016 written instructions indicating attribution to the previous tax year must accompany the contribution or else the contribution will be attributed to the current tax year the federal tax filing deadline for tax year 2016 is april 18 2017 ira checks that are received after april 18 2017 but on or before april 22 2017 must be accompanied with proof that the check was postmarked to the agentfinancial professional on or before april 18 2017 proof should be a copy or fax of the envelope with the postmark or statement of proof of delivery by the usps or courier service ie ups or federal express not the actual envelope otherwise the contribution will be attributed to the current tax year all tax year contributions received after april 22 2017 will be coded with the 2017 tax year new contracts must be issued on or before april 18 2017 for a contribution to be attributed to the 2016 tax year even if a contribution is made with accompanying attribution instructions prior to the tax filing deadline all sep ira contributions are coded for the current calendar year no exceptions if my contract is owned by a trust and is not subject to 72 u why was the form 1099r coded with a 1 in box 7 when im over 59 entity owned contracts ie trusts are not subject to 72 u will always use distribution code 1 as there is no date of birth for an entity except in the case of a grantor trust distributions from a grantor trust are reported based on the grantors date of birth dob and it will be coded as a 1 for an early distribution or as a 7 for normal distribution based on the grantors dob why wasnt my form 1099r coded as a disability payment the withdrawal form did not indicate disability you can file irs form 5329 and would have to prove to the irs on your own that the disability exception applies why is my entire distribution taxable for nonqualified contracts there are 2 possible reasons the distribution was all earnings it did not contain any return of cost basis the contract is aggregated for qualified contracts except for qualified trustee owned pension plans and 457 plans since some or all of the distribution may be taxable as ordinary income for the tax year in which the distribution is made we report all distributions as fully taxable on irs form 1099r if a portion of the distribution is not taxable you would indicate that on your own return qualified contracts are funded with pretax dollars and prudential doesnt track cost basis nonqualified are funded with after tax dollars and earnings are taxable and generally come out first why is box 2b taxable amount not determined checked on my 1099r taxable amount not determined is used on nonqualified accounts that were funded with a 1035 exchange where the prior institution did not send us the cost basis for roth ira contracts we report all distributions as taxable amount not determined why does my form 1099r show such a high taxable amount compared to my cost basis if the taxable amount seems high this contract is most likely a nonqualified annuity that is part of an aggregated group section 72 e 12 of the internal revenue code requires that all annuities entered into after october 21 1988 be aggregated and treated as a single deferred annuity contract for the purpose of determining the amount of taxable gain includible in gross income aggregation applies to all contracts purchased by the same contract owner from the same insurance company and its affiliates during the same calendar year all nonqualified annuity contracts issued to the same contract owner by the same insurance company or affiliate in the same calendar year they are treated as a single contract for tax gain purposes aggregated groups are determined by the tin of the owner aggregation rules do not apply to qualified contracts immediate annuities contracts subject to 72 u of the internal revenue code and contracts issued prior to october 21 1988 why did i receive tax form 1099r if i converted my ira into a roth ira an ira to roth conversion is generally fully taxable taxable amounts are included in income in the year of conversion subject to ordinary income tax 10 withholding applies unless election out rmd if applicable should be removed before the conversion amounts converted from an eligible ira to a roth ira are required to be included in the customers taxable income in the year of conversion generally this includes deductible contributions made to the ira and any earnings on those contributions and the present value of the actuarial benefit if applicable a form 1099r will be issued reflecting the conversion from the traditional to the roth ira the form 1099r will reflect a distribution code of either a 2 under 59 ½ with an exception or 7 over 59 ½ in addition a form 5498 will be generated to reflect the amounts converted to the roth ira why did i receive tax form 1099r when i received these funds as a death claim death proceeds from an annuity contract are taxable to the extent that there is gain under normal circumstances a beneficiary is responsible for the income tax on the death benefit they receive however there are exceptions to this general rule as indicated below on an annuitant driven contract the death proceeds are payable at the death of the annuitant and are payable to the beneficiary if the annuitant is the owner tax reporting is to the beneficiary if the
