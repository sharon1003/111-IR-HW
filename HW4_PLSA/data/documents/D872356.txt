easter vigil also found in wikipedia  easter vigil the easter vigil service is the oldest of all easter observances it takes place late at night on holy saturday though it officially marks the beginning of easter sunday celebrations duringthe middle ages the easter vigil service fell into a long slow decline in the second half of the twentieth century both roman catholics and protestants began to revive this ancientservice early christian vigils the word vigil comes from the latin word vigilia a noun which refers to the act of stayingawake and alert in order to protect guard or look after something in english we refer to thisactivity as keeping watch in the specialized language of the church a vigil is a nighttimeprayer service usually ending with a celebration of the eucharist some scholars think thatthe early christians held frequent vigils they suspect that these vigils were motivated by thewidely held belief that the second coming of christ would occur at midnight the selection of midnight as the hour of christs return may have been inspired by the parable of the wise and foolish virgins a story from christian scripture in which the longawaited bridegroominterpreted by many as a veiled reference to christ arrives at midnight matthew 25113 early christian easter vigils the earliest historical record of a christian easter service comes from the region of asia minor which included most of what is now the modern nation of turkey and dates back to about the middle of the second century the faithful held this service on the evening of passover and described it as a watch or vigil it began some time after dark lasted pastmidnight and finally ended before dawn when the roosters began to crow this servicecelebrated the redemption of humanity that was brought about by the life suffering deathresurrection and glorification of jesus christ it placed a special emphasis on jesus death on the cross as the moment of his greatest triumph the end of the service was marked by an early form of the eucharist historical records also indicate that the faithful fasted during thedaylight hours preceding the service breaking their fast with the eucharistic meal that closedthe ceremony among the early christians the easter vigil was one of the most well attendedservices of the year historical records allow us to trace the celebration of easter in rome back to the year 165 the roman easter vigil differed from that of asia minor however in that it was held on the saturday evening following the start of passover this difference in timing gave rise to a longdebate over the date on which to commemorate the death and resurrection of jesus christ in the fourth century the council of nicaea an important meeting of early christian leaders thatgave birth to the nicene creed decreed that all christians adopt the roman date for easter  see also easter date of elements of the easter vigil service from early christian times fires and lights served important functional and symbolic roles in the easter vigil  see also easter fires not only did lamps candles and torches light up thedarkness but they also served as symbols of christ and the divine presence of god thisuncanny nighttime brightness led some to call the ceremony the great service of light andthe evening itself the night of illumination or the night of radiant splendor an early christian writer recorded the fact that emperor constantine d 337 transformed the night of the sacred vigil into the brilliance of day by lighting throughout the whole city pillars of wax while burning lamps illuminated every house so that this nocturnal celebration wasrendered brighter than the brightest day weiser 134 st gregory of nyssa 335394described holy saturday evening as the glowing night which links the splendor of burninglamps to the morning rays of the sun thus producing continuous daylight without anydarkness weiser 134 in jerusalem the lighting of the lamps for the easter feast had taken on a special ceremonial quality by the end of the fourth century this early ceremonial lamplighting gave birth to an easter vigil custom that survives today the lighting of the paschalcandle with newly kindled fire the paschal candle is a very large candle used to shed light on the bible passages read out loud during the easter vigil service in explaining the origins of the paschal candle some researchers point to an ancient christian service called the lucernarium a ceremonial lighting of the lamps in preparation for the evening prayer service as time passed the lucernarium became a service in its own right which included chantingprayers and psalms scholars believe that the early christians based the lucernarium on jewish lamplighting rituals that preceded evening prayer in time however the christianobservance disappeared some commentators think that the ceremony that surrounds thelighting of the paschal candle on easter eve is all that remains of this ancient observance by the fourth century especially after the council of nicaea the easter vigil had emerged as the preferred occasion for baptisms although in some places pentecost served as an acceptable alternative date this development coincided with the formation of holy week during the first few centuries after jesus death the faithful commemorated the entire story of his life suffering crucifixion and resurrection at the easter vigil by the late fourth century christian communities had begun to separate out various elements of the story and assigntheir commemoration to different days in holy week thus they honored the last supper on maundy thursday mourned jesus crucifixion on good friday and rejoiced in hisresurrection at the easter vigil certain passages in christian scripture cast baptism as a kind of spiritual death and resurrection romans 6111 colossians 212 therefore churchleaders deemed it appropriate that baptisms be performed at the festival commemorating theresurrection of jesus christ since early christian times the easter vigil service has included numerous lengthy readingsfrom the bible the readings begin with gods creation of the earth as told in genesis the firstbook of the bible they also include the story of ancient israelites escape from slavery in egypt other stories from the hebrew scriptures or old testament along with readings fromthe hebrew prophets follow the bible readings close with a selection from christian scriptureconcerning the resurrection of jesus christ christian authorities chose these passagesbecause presented together they illustrate gods unfolding plan for humanitys redemptionand salvation the middle ages and beyond during the early middle ages the timing and the character of the easter vigil began to change in western europe as the number of adult converts to the christian religion decreased andthe number of infant baptisms increased the importance of the vigil service as an occasion forbaptism diminished in addition by the eighth century many churches offered the easter vigil on the afternoon rather than the evening of holy saturday in the twelfth century the servicehad shifted to midday in 1570 roman catholic authorities advanced the hour of the vigilservice yet again to the early morning of holy saturday this change in timing undermined thepowerful symbolic use of fire and light so prevalent in early christian vigil services in additionthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries witnessed the flowering of the reformation a religious reform movement that gave birth to protestant christianity many of the new protestant denominations abandoned the easter vigil along with many other rituals andfestivals observed by roman catholics finally in the seventh century the roman catholic church introduced the easter sunday service over the centuries this service grew in popularity as attendance at the easter vigil declined by the early part of the twentiethcentury the easter vigil was one of the least well attended services of holy week in the second half of the twentieth century western christians that is roman catholics and protestants began to restore the easter vigil service to its former glory in 1955 after a trialperiod of several years roman catholic authorities ordered the easter vigil service to be moved back to holy saturday evening this act revived the symbolic power of the fires andlights used in the vigil service this same era witnessed a liturgical renewal movement among western christians which has influenced both roman catholic and protestant attitudestowards the easter vigil service and its associated customs and ceremonies contemporary services among western christians contemporary easter vigil services among western christians feature
