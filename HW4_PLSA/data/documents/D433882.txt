c d question 7 in figure 142 which is the template strand answer a b c d question 7 do you agree if not why not question 8 bodnar et al 1998 used telomerase to extend the life span of normal human cells telomere shortening puts a limit on the number of times a cell can divide how might adding telomerase affect cellular aging answer telomerase would have no effect on cellular aging telomerase will speed up the rate of cell proliferation telomerase shortens telomeres and thus delays cellular aging telomerase ensures that the ends of the chromosomes are accurately replicated and eliminates telomere shortening  question 8 bodnar et al 1998 used telomerase to extend the life span of normal human cells telomere shortening puts a limit on the number of times a cell can divide how might
