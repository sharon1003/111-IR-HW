on entry models16sharesthe suzuki swift is one of only a handful of nameplates that needs no introduction with worldwide sales hitting two million units this month the swift is certain to go down in history as an iconic car of our times but wait there is a new one the current suzuki swift which has been on sale for almost seven years has finally been replaced when i say replaced you might be looking at the photos and wondering if ive lost my mind yes the 2011 suzuki swift does look remarkably similar to the old one but thats the point why change such an iconic shape despite its familiar appearance its a totally new car with prices starting from just 15990 for the swift ga the outgoing suzuki swift has been an outstanding seller in nearly all of the 80 countries its been sold in in australia however it was exceptionally well received more than 65000 suzuki swifts have been sold here making it one of the more popular cars on our road when it comes to private buyers the little japanese car is still the best performer in its segment2011 suzuki swift driving footage your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available click here to visit our frequently asked questions about html5 video000  140research has shown that the suzuki swift has a 90 percent population awareness in australia which is remarkable given the number of different cars on sale today if you have a product that is incredibly popular would you change it think about the porsche 911 you can recognise its iconic shape from its original incarnation back in 1963 the design philosophy has always been more about evolution than revolution and thats increasingly becoming the norm among car manufacturers if you have a design that sells keep it but modernise it the story behind the design of the new suzuki swift is actually rather interesting a good five years ago the japanese company sent two teams of designers to europe for six months one group stayed in france and the other took residence in italy the french and the italians have arguably designed some of the best looking cars in the world so its selfexplanatory why they based themselves there the french team designed a car which was candidly different to the current swift while the italian team decided to stick with the theme of the current model and modernise it as you can see from the pictures the italian team got the nod of approval from head office at the australian launch of the new swift suzukis chief engineer mr naoyuki takeuchi told car advice the swifts design philosophy is to not be affected by trends hence creating a timeless shape from the front you can see the new swift has grown up as it now sports a much sharper look than before the back also gets the same treatment with sharper angles and a much more defined stance the once girly suzuki swift has come of age speaking of girly suzuki says a few years ago nearly three quarters of all buyers were female these days 42 percent of buyers are male thats arguably due to the swift becoming the ever popular choice for first time car modifiers and lets not forget the swift sport one of the best handling cars in its segment what can one expect from a car that starts from just 15990 suzuki has spent considerable amounts of money developing a new engine k14b to power the mighty swift on paper alone the new swift has less power and torque than the old one plus it weighs more you might be thinking thats not much of an improvement if not a step backward altogether sometimes the details of a cars specifications are meaningless when it comes to realworld driving despite the engine having downsized from 15litre to 14litre power being reduced from 74k w to 70k w and torque throttled back to 130nm from 133nm the new swift is a far better drive than the old one the allnew manual gearbox is now better suited to the smaller engine providing better ratios that allow for a much smoother drive youll find it rather difficult to tell the new swift is down on power because it actually feels quicker no official 0100kmh times out and about it also happens to use just 55l of normal unleaded fuel per 100km down 08l from the previous car this was tested during our drive around the mornington peninsula as my codriver and i managed economy figures of 52l100km manual suzuki is manufacturing new swifts with extensive use of higherstrength steel for a more stiff and safer chassis although it weighs a tad more than the old one 1025kg the new swift comes with more features too most important of all is the inclusion of standard seven airbags and electronic stability program esp across all three variants this has led to a maximum fivestar ancap safety rating which is essential for a light car the new swift is 95mm longer than before and it has used most of that extra space for a more comfortable interior its still certainly not a car designed to carry five average sized adults but it can if the need be its best suited to four adults and kids can easily fit in the back the base model swift ga starts at 15990 and is aimed at those looking for a basic runabout that doesnt compromise on safety it comes with the bare essentials such as a fourspeaker audio system with usb support power windows and mirrors plus airconditioning and remote central locking its only available as a manual but for some strange reason misses out on a tachometre suzuki has also neglected to include bluetooth technology as a standard feature but its available as an option about 500 an extra 700 will move you into the midrange swift gl a small price to pay for leather steering wheel with audio controls two additional speakers and a tachometer if you pay more attention youll also notice the addition of bodycoloured door handles and side mirrors plus side indicators in the mirrors money well spent however it still fails to come with bluetooth 1700 to upgrade to the fourspeed automatic the topoftherange swift glx manual starts from 18990 and gets all the kit 16inch alloy wheels rear disc brakes keyless entry and push button start system climate control air conditioning and front fog lamps it also gains bluetooth phone and audio connectivity its a shame that bluetooth technology doesnt come standard across the range given that cars cheaper than the swift  nissan micra hyundai getz have this standard either way i suspect the majority of buyers would tick the option to have it fitted on a similar matter the steering wheel on the ga and gl models is not telescopically adjustable push in and out a feature only available on the glx a rather useful feature to leave out of the entire range the stereo system natively supports i podi phone via usb and allows for track changes via the cars audio system an easy system that even your grandmother could use and a big tick to suzuki for allowing full charging while also reading music the interior is relatively similar to the old car except that it no longer has the centre mounted information readout that used to tell you your fuel economy that has moved into the instrument cluster which  as far as i could work out in my few hours behind the wheel  means you cant view the trip meter and the fuel economy at the same time on the plus side there is noticeably less cabin noise than before and official figures say that there has been a 3d b noise reduction at 120kmh the automatic transmission still whines when youre full throttle but its not as intrusive as before if you put everything i have written so far aside here is what makes the suzuki swift a suzuki swift ride and handling the swift has won three of the four junior world rally championships jwrc it has competed in and has earned a reputation for itself as one of the best handling light cars on the market today the allnew swift only improves on this remarkable characteristic with a new steering system more rigid front and rear suspension plus better brakes the new swift now contends with the volkswagen polo for the award of best ride and handling in its class that shouldnt worry volkswagen too much given the german company owns nearly 20 percent of the japanese manufacturer around the twisty mountain roads of country victoria my codriver and i put the swift through its paces interesting fact my codriver just happened to be ed ordynski former australian rally championship winner and a legendary driver in his own right if he thinks it handles well you can bet your house on it from corner to corner the swift behaves exactly as it should you simply point it in the direction you want it to go and it will obey your command with the nanny controls hardly interfering if twisty mountain road driving on a budget is your idea of fun you really cant look past a swift it begs for more power and i suspect the new swift sport will cater for that speaking of which the team from japan was very hesitant to discuss the swift sport hinting that its coming but giving very little away in terms of engines or performance figures despite its few shortcomings the allnew suzuki swift is a brilliant little car its everything the old one was plus a lot more it has more safety more technology more realworld performance and a hell of a lot more fun built in id recommend test driving it against the volkswagen polo ford fiesta mazda2 toyota yaris and honda jazz the fairy tale story of the old swift has allowed the once relatively unknown japanese manufacturer to gain a strong foothold in the growing australian car market the new one should only strengthen that position swift ga manual
