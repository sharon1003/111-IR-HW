why no one should take nexium and it should never have been approved as chris discussed saturday the wsj had a silly article in which a woman demands a prescription drug from a flight attendant asking for the wrong drug to treat her problem acutely and then shockingly was refused this service worse nexium is mentioned by name multiple times and nexium is actually a drug which should never have even been approved by the fda it really is only prescribed because of intense marketing because logically it has no business on the market and is no different than an existing drug prilosec why would doctors irrationally prescribe this drug then because advertising encourages irrational choices so why is nexium such a scam read below the fold prilosec is the original proton pump inhibitor that functions by binding to and disabling the protein in your stomach that pumps h ions into gastric juices when it originally came out it was a wonder drug as previous drugs such as cimetidine or ranitidine would only change the p h of the stomach from 1 to 2 whereas the ppis can increase the p h of the stomach from 1 to 5 and remember p h is a log scale that means acid production is effectively ceased by these drugs this made them wonder drugs in the treatment of acid reflux or heartburn one more little piece of chemistry prilosec or omeprazole as it is known generically is a racemic compound that means it is a combination of two chemically identical compounds but one has a different chirality or handedness from the other it just so happens that one of the enantiomers – or handed molecules – in prilosec is the active drug and the other enantiomer is inert it does nothing amazing isn’t it that just changing a molecule to a it’s mirror reflection can make it so a drug is effective against it’s protein target or is totally worthless what does this have to do with nexium and why you shouldn’t take it the only active ingredient in nexium is the exact same thing as the only active ingredient in omeprazole prilosec a now generic drug made by the same company which is over the counter and four to eight times cheaper astra zeneca just figured out how to purify out the active component from omeprazole the senantiomer esoomprazole in clinical trials the only difference between nexium and its offpatent parent drug are modest improvements in some symptoms at distant time points however it is standard in these trials to compare 20mg of nexium to 20mg of omeprazole in other words the trials that have justified the use of this drug compared to the generic only show that when two times the amount of the active compound is used 1 nexium  2 omeprazole a slight improvement in some symptoms 87 vs 90 for cure of gastroesophageal reflux disease at 8 weeks is achieved 12 this is a result that is certainly not worth 48 times the cost based on patent law astra zeneca should never have been able to patent esoomeprazole as a new drug since they had already patented the same active ingredient when they patented prilosec they effectively patented the same drug twice thus doubling the time their drug can avoid generic competition however in order for the scam to work they had to pull one over on the regulators coincidentally they spent millions in lobbying congress the year before nexium was approved then advertise the hell out of nexium to make it appear it was somehow superior to it’s chemically identical sibling drug prilosec the take home message buy prilosecomeprazole it’s generic it’s over the counter if you want your insurance to cover it have your doc write a prescription for a bunch of pills so it falls under your copay save the healthcare system 5 billion a year and ditch this scam of a pill1 lind et al esomeprazole provides improved acid control vs omeprazole in patients with symptoms of gastrooesophageal reflux disease alimentary pharmacology and therapeutics 147 86167 20002 kahrilas p j et al esomeprazole improves healing and symptom resolution as compared with omeprazole in reflux oesophagitis patients a randomized controlled trial alimentary pharmacology and therapeutics 1410 124958 2000 mark hjanuary 9 2012health caredrugs medicine nexium
