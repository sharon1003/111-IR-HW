catalina 320by jack hornor revised by boat us editors in october 2012photo by catalina yachts the catalina 320 was introduced in 1993 along with its little sister the catalina 270 as the first in a series of designs intended to go head to head with the more contemporary roomier eurostyled designs of catalinas competitors it was an instant success and remains in production with more than 1000 built as of 2004 the most notable difference between the catalina 320 and previous catalina designs is the way in which the beam at the transom compared to the maximum beam is considerably increased the beam at the transom of the catalina 320 is 87 of the maximum beam while that of their earlier models was closer to 60 this is an industry trend that can result in as much as 10 more interior volume for a given length and translates to added space for accommodations in addition cockpit space is considerably increased the 320 measures 32 6 loa beam is 11 9 and draft with the standard wing keel is 4 3 a deep draft keel with bulb is offered as an option and draws 6 feet displacement of the shoal draft model is 11700 lbs and 11300 for the deep draft version construction of the hull of the 320 is basically a solid fiberglass laminate with a spunbound polyester fabric incorporated in some areas this material is primarily used to build up laminate thickness and is not typically considered a core constructed composite balsa wood and plywood core materials are used in the deck and cabin structures the interior of the 320 is made up of molded fiberglass liners which in most cases serve a dual role as structural reinforcement and foundations for berths lockers and joiner work vinylester resins are used in the first layers of hull laminate to reduce the possibility of osmotic blistering and catalina offers a fiveyear warranty against blisters for more than 30 years catalina has built tens of thousands of boats following their timetested methods with remarkable success some 1993 models were known to have problems with improperly routed wiring that resulted in chafed and broken wires catalina has retrofitted these boats with pvc conduit and redesigned later models to eliminate the problem on deck the tshaped cockpit with pedestalmounted wheel steering offers comfortable seating for five adults the centerline helm seat mounted just forward of the stern rail is removable the center section of the stern rail folds aft and down making for a handy swim platform and boarding ladder the side decks are uncluttered except for the necessary genoa track and the mast shrouds are well inboard for easy passage and improved sheeting angles there is a storage locker on the foredeck for anchor and rode storage the interior of the 320 is designed with the porttoport cruiser in mind and less thought given to sailors who make overnight or extended passages there are comfortable inport accommodations for two couples or a small family the layout includes a vberth cabin forward followed by the main saloon with a settee to port and convertible ushaped dinette to starboard the galley is aft to port and has a stove oven top loading icebox and double sink there is a small navigation table just forward of the galley which in a pinch could be used as extra counter space the head and entrance to the quarter berth cabin is opposite the galley the head includes toilet sink and integral shower and the quarter berth cabin has a large athwartships double berth and hanging locker there is adequate storage below the berths although hanging locker space is limited and there is no wet locker for wet foul weather gear a feature which is all too often overlooked on current production boats catalina has used yanmar westerbeke and perkins diesel engines of either 27 or 28 hp as standard auxiliary power at various times all are freshwater cooled all are dependable and all have good service support just about anywhere you sail all provide sufficient power for this 11000 pound boat the average weekend cruiser will be well satisfied with the performance of the 320 and the weekend racer may be a bit surprised although the waterline length is considerably shorter and the sail area to displacement ratio is about the same as catalinas 34footer the catalina 320 has better boat speed with the factory supplied 150 genoa and fully battened mainsail she will point to within 40 degrees of the apparent wind and the wide beam and the low center of gravity of the fin and bulb keel result in a stiff boat the helm is light and well balanced in fact so well balanced that some complain it is difficult to feel and keep the boat in the groove catalina yachts has endured the ups and downs of the recreational boating market for more than 30 years by giving sailors what they want and while many of us dream of sailing off to the far corners of the earth most of us do our sailing close to home and for alltooshort of periods of time for those of us in this category the
