when the i pad debuted many called it “just a big i pod touch ” most soon realized that such claims were misguided as the i pad turned out to be much more more powerful more capable more useful more everything instead of being arithmetically bigger than the i pod touch the i pad offered exponentially more of what was good about it now that the i pad mini is out some of the same people are calling it “just a smaller i pad” this time around such a description is much more apt as the i pad mini offers nearly all of the features power and capabilities of its fullsize siblings it even runs all the same apps the result is a device that—far more than the mac mini or even the old i pod mini—gives you nearly everything of its nonmini namesake in a smaller package but calling it “just a smaller i pad” glosses over much of what makes the i pad mini unique  further reading everything you need to know about i os 11 half the size most of the i pad at 79 inches tall and 53 inches wide the i pad mini is just 60 percent of the footprint of the fourthgeneration i pad even more impressive is that thanks to its 028inch thickness yes it’s even thinner than the i phone 5 and 308gram 11ounce weight the i pad mini is just 46 percent of the volume of the standard i pad and 47 percent of the weight yet the mini offers a 79inch diagonal display that’s a full 66 percent of the screen area of a fullsize i pad idg consumer  smbi pad mini left and i pad rightput simply the i pad mini gives you two thirds of an i pad at half the overall size and weight this will make the i pad mini usable in situations—and occupations—where a fullsize i pad wouldn’t be you can hold it in one hand and slip it into the pocket of a jacket or scrubs and remember the adage that the best camera is the one you have with you the best tablet is the one you have with you and i’ve already found myself bringing the i pad mini places i wouldn’t have taken the standard i pad why not just use an i pod touch or i phone while the i pad mini is just 1mm thicker than the latest i pod touch the mini’s footprint is nearly four times larger with a screen that’s 44 times as big in terms of area—though not in resolution as i’ll cover later just as striking as the i pad mini’s smaller size and higher screentobody ratio is its overall design which in some ways has more in common with the i phone 5 and i pod touch than with the fullsize i pad the first thing you’ll notice is that the bezel framing the display is much narrower along the longer edges than on a fullsize i pad allowing apple to squeeze as much screen area as possible into the i pad mini’s smaller package flip the i pad mini around and you’ll see that unlike the tapered brushedaluminum back of the fullsize i pad the i pad mini’s unibody enclosure is more squaredoff at the edges like the original and latest i pod touch models the color of the back varies as well on the black i pad mini the back and sides are matte slateblack aluminum with matching aluminum buttons and switches the whitebezel i pad gives you a matte silveraluminum back with matching controls and like the i phone 5 the i pad mini has polished chamfered edges between its body and the glass front putting aside for a moment the technical specs i’ll get to those soon enough the i pad mini feels incredibly solid there’s absolutely no give or flex to the body and the fit and finish are as good as with anything apple has ever done—the design and construction are that impressive i thought google’s nexus 7 tablet which i’ve been using for the past few months felt sturdy but even though the i pad mini has a 24percentlarger footprint across roughly half the thickness it feels much more solid than the nexus 7 which flexes and creaks when you twist it firmly idg consumer  smbthe i pad mini is 60 percent of the footprint of the fourthgeneration i pad black or white i generally prefer black i pads because i find the black bezel to be less distracting than white the black bezel seems to just get out of the way letting the screen draw me in but with the i pad mini i also like the black better for purely aesthetic reasons as macworlds jason snell pointed out in his i phone 5 review this new black design with its matte slateblack finish matching buttons and switches and glossyblack apple logo looks stunning it looks better than the fullsize i pad in black because well everything is black you don’t see a thin silver edge around screen and even the little squarish icon on the home button is darker on the i pad mini than on the fullsize i pad everything front and back just blends together don’t get me wrong the white i pad is beautiful—especially the aluminum buttons and switches which look much more upscale than the blackplastic versions on the standard i pad—but it doesn’t impress me quite as much my only complaint with the black i pad mini is that the matte back really shows fingerprints skin oil and grease you don’t want to eat potato chips while holding it i also suspect but haven’t tested that the black model will show scratches more easily as with the i phone 5 to protect the i pad mini from such scratches there are plenty of thirdparty i pad mini cases on the way but apple offers a matching i pad mini smart cover in a variety of colors for 39 like the original smart cover the mini version attaches to the lefthand edge of the i pad mini using magnets protecting the screen when you’re not using it folding behind the i pad mini when you are the smart cover also folds into a triangular stand for video or photoviewing or for onscreen typing and magnets in the cover work with the i pad mini’s magnetic sleepwake feature unlike the original smart cover the i pad mini version uses a plasticandfabric hinge we’ll be covering the smart cover separately but my initial impression is that this hinge is more comfortable against your hand than the metal version and it won’t scratch your i pad as easily idg consumer  smbthe bezel around the i pad mini left is thinner than the one around the i pad like the fourthgeneration i pad the i pad mini is available in three capacities each in black or white each colorcapacity combination is available with or without ltedata connectivity and each lteequipped model is available in three models in the united states att sprint or verizon yes that means that as with the fourthgeneration i pad there are 24 u s variations of the i pad mini the wifi models are 329 429 and 529 for 16gb 32gb and 64gb respectively adding lte cellular data bumps each price by 130 to 459 559 and 659 respectively we haven’t tested the lteequipped versions which are supposed to ship later this month but they’ll have the same features as the fullsize i pad with lte nocontract lte data tethering depending on the carrier gps circuitry and turnbyturn navigation call it an i pad 25—or 35of the many rumors swirling around prior to the i pad mini’s announcement the most common pegged the mini as being simply a smaller version of the i pad 2 but the mini is actually somewhere between the i pad 2 and the current fullsize i pad the mini uses the same dualcore a5 processor at the same clock speed as the i pad 2 includes the same 512mb of ram and sports a display with the same resolution 1024 by 768 pixels but the mini has the same 12megapixel face time hd 720pcapable front camera and 5megapixel 1080pcapable back camera as the fourthgeneration i pad note that apple says the a6x processor in the fourthgeneration i pad includes imagesignalprocessing features that allow that model to provide better image stabilization and spacial noise reduction for photos and video than the i pad mini we’ll publish imagingtest results later this week the mini also matches the newest fullsize i pad when it comes to wireless capabilities offering bluetooth 40 improved 5ghz 80211n wifi performance thanks to channel bonding and optional lte wireless data the i pad mini uses the same lte chip found in the fourthgeneration i pad so it’s compatible with more carriers compared to the thirdgeneration i pad of course the i pad mini also uses apple’s new lightning connector instead of

testing by james galbraith thanks to its i pad 2matching processor graphics capabilities and screen resolution the i pad mini should offer performance on par with that of the i pad 2 indeed in our benchmarks testing the i pad mini performed identically to the i pad 2 in every test except for our web pageload test where the i pad mini bested the i pad 2 by roughly 40 percent—likely because of the aforementioned 5ghz wifi enhancements in the mini my realworld testing echoed these findings as the i pad mini felt much like an i pad 2 when playing games and watching videos with one exception i experienced no stuttering or slowdowns even when playing graphicsheavy games and even when mirroring the i pad’s screen to an apple tv using air play the exception was real racing 2 hd but only when hosting a multiplayer game in party play mode where my i pad was mirroring to an apple tv both my screen and the screens of other players in this test the ontv images stuttered at times though the game was still quite playable in fact on a few highend games the i pad mini—like the i pad 2 before it—at times performed as well as the thirdgeneration i pad in terms of maintaining smooth graphics because the thirdgeneration retina model has to push four times as many pixels the fourthgeneration i pad with its much better processor and graphics capabilities outperforms the i pad mini pretty much everywhere the i pad mini also never got uncomfortably hot during heavy use—just warm thanks to its enhanced wifi capabilities the i pad mini offers noticeably better performance than the i pad 2 when loading webpages or streaming video—at least if you’re connected to a 5ghz 80211n wifi network however as with the i pad 2 the i pad mini’s 512mb of ram means that you’ll experience more safaritab reloads than with a recent fullsize i pad in terms of battery life apple says the i pad mini can last as long on a full charge as the standard i pad up to 10 hours of wifi web surfing watching video or listening to music or up to 9 hours of web surfing over a cellulardata connection in our standard battery test which involves looping a fullscreen video at specific volume and screenbrightness levels the i pad mini lasted 9 hours and twelve minutes compared to 9 hours and 21 minutes for the fourthgeneration i pad next battery life and display at a glance apple i pad mini with wifi dont confuse the mini in i pad mini with litewith the exception of a retina display this slimmed down i pad gives you the full i pad experience including access to over 275000 i padoptimized apps in a device thats about half the overall size and weight of the standard i pad retinadisplay purists will justifiably balk at the 1024by768pixel screen but i suspect that most people will be wowed enough by the i pad minis other features performance design and build quality to accept the screen for what it isvery good but not retina pros most of the fullsizei pad experience in a smaller lighter package all existing i pad apps run natively wireless capabilities and cameras on par with fourthgeneration i pad very good performance incredibly solid construction and beautiful design cons
