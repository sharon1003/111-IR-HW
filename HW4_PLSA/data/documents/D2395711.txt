the thymic chakra high heart chakrathe high heart chakra is located between the throat and heart chakras like the base of the throat chakra it is an important activator of higher consciousness the christian esotericist ann ree colton describes it as a minor whitefire chakra associated with the thymus gland essential for the immunological system of the body which works as a reflex centre for higher levels of consciousness  colton kundalini west p64 this may be the same as the centre briefly described in tibetan buddhism as the fire chakra located midway between the heart and throat level and possessing three petals or spokes it is also referred to as one of the centres of concentration in heschyastic christian mysticism eliade p410 it may also be the outer doorway for the inner spiritual centre referred to by barbara brennan as the soul seat which she says is the source of meaning direction and spiritual longing in life brenann light emerging p29 john oneill suggests that this chakra is where intent originates that it links the emotions of the heart with the reason of language correspondences petalsspokes tibetan buddhism 3element tibetan buddhism fire colour  colton

unbalanced you indulge in spiritual platitudes and ignore the needs of others blocked or closed you reject and are fearful of higher spiritual realities you stubbornly see only the ordinary side of life  paulson p123 you are unable to express emotions even thogh you can feel them john oneillnotes and comments when ann ree colton refers to the white fire spiritual antibodies of absolute healing and grace the archetypes of the physical immunesystem antibodies produced by the thymus gland residing within this chakra  kundalini west p64 she would certainly be describing a higher octave than the outer secondary chakra the heschyastic mystics associate with the thymic or pectoral centre stabilty of thoughtis much greater than in the preceeding cases but it is still thought that defines the emotional coloring and that is modified by it eliade p410the thymic or high heart chakra seems to be in the right position to be the outer doorway for the inner spiritual centre barbara brennan refers to as the soul seat she describes this as a diffuse light extending in all directions and the source of meaning and spiritual longing in life if this is clouded one is unable to know what his or her purpose in life is and life appears meaningless and empty through specific exercises it is possible to realign the soul seat with the lower tan tein and to the id point equivalent perhaps to the sahasrara chakra above the head the thymic chakra  the source of intentthe following description of the thymic chakra is by john oneill the thymic chakra is where intent originates it is the link between the emotions of the heart and the reason of language it is what makes you inhale a breath before you speak since this is where the intent behind the words you are about to speak actually starts forming so lets say that your heart feels a certain way about something that it would like to voice the energy shoots up to the throat chakra but passes through the thymic chakra first giving it a heads up to start getting prepared to speak by drawing a breath  or by stopping the breath to prevent you from speaking this is why you dont always say whats on the tip of your tongue this is also why emotions can wreck havoc with your health as the thymic chakra can be bombarded by emotions to the point of fatigue when the crown chakra speaks on the other hand it sends its energy down through the brow chakra which embellishes it the result is creative expression which may or may not be truthful the thymic chakra acts as something of a lie detector by interfering with energy that is not truthful this is why we have trouble speaking when we are upset the flow of energy from the heart is always meant to be peaceful and thats really the only kind of energy that the thymic chakra understands just as this chakra acts as a bridge in waking life between emotion and reason it also acts as a bridge in dreaming but in a totally different way if you have ever had a dream about a person that you would later meet in real life then you were using this chakra in your dream if this chakra is open in your dreaming body then you will be able to connect your dreams with actual reality that is the subject matter of your dreams will be the actual waking world instead of a representation of it if this chakra is closed in the waking body then the individual will not have the intent to express their emotions even thogh they can feel them and actually know what they want to say correspondently if this chakra is closed in the dreaming body then you will not have the intent to bridge the chasm between dreaming and waking from the dreaming side to visit this world while you are asleep one last important point to mention is that there is a certain vulnerability that this chakra has to being manipulated by outside forces while either awake or dreaming the end result is the same you end up dreaming somebody elses dream and sharing their intent for better or worse the symbol for the thymic chakra in waking is a map rolled up like a scroll it represents the path of ones life the symbol for this chakra in dreaming is a pair of wings representing the ability to cross the chasm of the unknown under ones own power chakra balancingmajor and minor chakras  notes on psychological termsrear chakras ascending front chakras descending crown back of headupper
