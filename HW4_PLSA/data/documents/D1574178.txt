brown mathcom → trig wo tears → 2  six functions updated 27 sept 2017  what’s new trig without tears part 2 the six functions copyright © 1997–2017 stan brown brown mathcom summary every one of the six trig functions is just one side of a right triangle divided by another side or if you draw the triangle in a unit circle every function is the length of one line segment the easy way to remember all six definitions memorize the definitions of sine and cosine and then remember the other four as combinations of sine and cosine  not as independent functions contents the basic two sine and cosine expressions for lengths of sides the other four tangent cotangent secant cosecant six functions in one picture practice problems btw why call it sine what’s new the basic two sine and cosine a picture is worth a thousand words which is why it takes a thousand times as long to download the trig functions are nothing more than lengths of various sides of a right triangle in various ratios  since there are three sides there are 3 × 2  6 different ways to make a ratio fraction of sides that’s why there are six trig functions no more and no less of those six functions three—sine cosine and tangent—get the lion’s share of the work the others are studied because they can be used to make some expressions simpler we’ll begin with sine and cosine because they are really basic and the others depend on them here is one of the conventional ways of showing a right triangle a key point is that the lowercase letters a b c are the sides opposite to the angles marked with the corresponding capital letters a b c most books use this convention lowercase letter for side opposite uppercase angle the two fundamental definitions are marked in the diagram you must commit them to memory  in fact they should become second nature to you so that you recognize them no matter how the triangle is turned around always always the sine of an angle is equal to the opposite side divided by the hypotenuse opphyp in the diagram the cosine is equal to the adjacent side divided by the hypotenuse adjhyp 1memorizesine  opposite side  hypotenusecosine  adjacent side  hypotenuse what is the sine of b in the diagram remember opphyp the opposite side is b and the hypotenuse is c so sin b  b  c  what about the cosine of b remember adjhyp the adjacent side is a so cos b  a  c do you notice that the sine of one angle is the cosine of the other since a  b  c  180° for any triangle and c is 90° in this triangle a  b must equal 90° therefore a  90° − b and b  90° − a when two angles add to 90° each angle is the co mplement of the other and the sine of each angle is the co sine of the other these are the cofunction identities 2sin a  cos 90° − a or cos π2 − acos a  sin 90° − a or sin π2 − aexpressions for lengths of sides the definitions of sine and cosine can be rearranged a little bit to let you write down the lengths of the sides in terms of the hypotenuse and the angles for example when you know that b  c  cos a you can multiply through by c and get b  c × cos a can you write another expression for length b one that uses a sine instead of a cosine remember that opposite over hypotenuse equals the sine so b  c  sin b multiply through by c and you have b  c × sin b can you see how to write down two expressions for the length of side a please work from the definitions and verify that a  c × sin a  c × cos b example given a right triangle with angle a 52° and hypotenuse c  150 m what is the length of side b hint draw a picture and label a c  and b solution pictures are always good you don’t have to obsess over getting the picture exactly right but at least make it close that will help you see when your answer is impossible so you know you’ve made a mistake in my little sketch i set out to make angle a a bit more than 45° but to my eyes it looks like a bit less that’s okay you may notice that i marked side a even though we don’t need it for the problem i did that so i didn’t have to think about which side was b always remember the rule that the side with a given letter is opposite the angle with that letter and conventionally we always put c at the right angle so that makes c the hypotenuse once you have the picture solving the problem is pretty straightforward you want something involving a its adjacent side and the hypotenuse that has to be the cosinecos a  b  cb  c × cos a  150 × cos 52°  about 9235 m example a guy wire is anchored in the ground and attached to the top of a 45foot flagpole if it meets the ground at an angle of 63° how long is the guy wire solution presumably the flagpole is vertical so this is a right triangle with a  63° a  45 ft and hypotenuse c unknown which function involves the opposite side and the hypotenuse it must be the sine you know thatsin a  a  c thereforec  a sin a  45sin 63°  about 505 ft you may be wondering how to find sides or angles of triangles when there is no right angle we’ll get to that under the topic of solving triangles sine and cosine in the unit circle one important special case comes up frequently suppose the hypotenuse c  1 then we call the triangle a unit right triangle  you can see from the paragraphs just above that if c  1 then a  sin a and b  cos a  in other words in a unit right triangle the opposite side will equal the sine and the adjacent side will equal the cosine of the angle the triangle is often drawn in a unit circle a circle of radius 1 as shown at right the angle a is at the center of the circle and the adjacent side lies along the x axis if you do this the hypotenuse is the radius which is 1 the  x  y coordinates of the outer end of the hypotenuse are the x and y legs of the triangle  x  y   cos a  sin a  the unit circle is your friend it can help you visualize lots of trig identities the other four tangent cotangent secant cosecant the other four functions have no real independent life of their own they’re just combinations of the first two you could do all of trigonometry without ever knowing more than sines and cosines but knowing something about the other four especially the tangent can often save you some steps in a calculation—and your teacher will expect you to know about them for exams i find it easiest to memorize sorry the definition of the tangent in terms of the sine and cosine 3memorizetan a  sin a  cos ayou’ll use the tangent tan function a lot more than the last three functions i’ll get to them in a minute there’s an alternative way to remember the meaning of the tangent  remember from the diagram that sin a  oppositehypotenuse and cos a  adjacenthypotenuse plug those into equation 3 the definition of the tan function and you have tan a  oppositehypotenuse  adjacenthypotenuse or 4 tangent  opposite side  adjacent sidenotice this is not marked “memorize” you don’t have to memorize it because it flows directly from the definition equation 3 and in fact the two statements are equivalent i’ve chosen to present them in this order to minimize the jumble of opp adj and hyp among sin cos and tan however if you prefer you can memorize equation 4 and then derive the equivalent identity equation 3 whenever you need it example a guy wire is anchored in the ground and attached to the top of a 45foot flagpole how far is the anchor from the base of the flagpole if the wire meets the ground at an angle of 63° solution this is a variation on the previous example this time you want to know the side adjacent to angle a not the hypotenuse as before assume the flagpole is vertical so this is a right triangle with a  63° a  45 ft and adjacent side b unknown which function involves the adjacent side and the opposite side it’s the tangent you know thattan a  a  b thereforeb  a tan a  45tan 63°  about 229 ft now i said you could do all of trig with just sines and cosines how would that work for this problem well sine and cosine both need the hypotenuse so you’d havesin a  a  c ⇒ c  a sin a andcos a  b  c ⇒ c  b cos a thereforeb cos a  a sin ab  a × cos a sin a  45 × cos 63°sin 63°  about 229 ft you got to the same place in the end but the journey was longer so although it’s not strictly necessary the tangent can make your work easier the other three trig functions— cotangent secant and cosecant —are defined in terms of the first three  they’re less often used but they do simplify some problems in calculus in practical problems not involving calculus you’ll pretty much never need them 5memorizecot a  1  tan asec a  1  cos acsc a  1  sin aguess what that’s the last trig identity you have to memorize you’ll probably find that you end up memorizing certain other identities without even intending to just because you use them frequently but equation 5 makes the last ones that you’ll have to sit down and make a point of memorizing just on their own because this textbook helps you please click to donateunfortunately the definitions in equation 5 aren’t the easiest thing in the world to remember does the secant equal 1 over the sine or 1 over the cosine here are two helpful hints  each of those definitions has a cofunction on one and only one side of the equation so you won’t be tempted to think that sec a equals 1sin a and secant and cosecant go together just like sine and cosine so you won’t be tempted to think that cot a equals 1sin a for an alternative approach to remembering the above identities you might like this 24second video suggested by gene laratonda  httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvmc ib whgj qng this ushaped approach by bob allison “robert a”  httpwwwwyzantcomresourcesanswers39213findtantheta you can immediately notice an important relation between tangent and cotangent each is the cofunction of the other just like sine and cosine 6tan a  cot 90° − a or cot π2 − acot a  tan 90° − a or tan π2 − aif you want to prove this it’s easy from the definitions and equation 2cot a  1  tan aapply the definition of tancot a  1  sin a  cos asimplify

tangent are cofunctions just like sine and co sine by doing the same sort of substitution you can show that secant and co secant are also cofunctions 7sec a  csc 90° − a or csc π2 − acsc a  sec 90° − a or sec π2 − asix functions in one picture you saw earlier how the sine and cosine of an angle are the sides of a triangle in a unit circle it turns out that all six functions can be shown geometrically in this wayunit circle radius  ab  1 sin θ  bc cos θ  ac tan θ  ed csc θ  ag sec θ  ae cot θ  fggraphic courtesy of the math page in the illustration at right triangle abc has angle θ at the center of a unit circle ab  radius  1 you already know that bc  sin θ and ac  cos θ  what about tan θ well since de is tangent to the unit circle you might guess that its length is tan θ and you’d be right triangles abc and aed are similar and therefore ed  ad  bc  aced  1  sin θ  cos θed  tan θmore information comes from the same pair of similar triangles ae  ab  ad  acae  1  1  cos θae  sec θthe lengths that represent cot θ and csc θ will come from the other triangle gaf that triangle is also similar to triangle aed why fg is perpendicular to fa and fa is perpendicular to ad therefore fg and ad are parallel in beginning geometry you learned that when parallel lines are cut by a third line the corresponding angles—marked θ in the diagram—are equal thus fg is a tangent to the unit circle and therefore angles g and θ are equal using similar triangles gaf and aedfg  fa  ad  edfg  1  1  tan θfg  cot θthat makes sense fg is tangent to the unit circle and is the tangent of the complement of angle θ namely angle gaf therefore fg is the cotangent of the original angle θ or angle gad finally using the same pair of similar triangles again you can also say that ag  fa  ae  edag

unit circlesin θ  bc cos θ  ac tan θ  edcsc θ  ag sec θ  ae cot θ  fgpractice problems to get the most benefit from these problems work them without first looking at the solutions refer back to the chapter text if you need to refresh your memory recommendation work them on paper — it’s harder to fool yourself about whether you really understand a problem completely you’ll find full solutions for all problems don’t just check your answers but check your method too1 find all six functions of the angle 30° find sine cosine and tangent of 60°2find sin a sin b tan a and tan b 3 a ≈ 5313° find the approximate area of the triangle hint the area of a triangle is base × height 2 btw why call it sine from the picture it’s obvious why the name “tangent” makes sense the tangent of an angle is the length of a segment tangent to the unit circle but what about the sine function how did it get its name please look at the picture again and notice that sin θ  bc is half a chord of the circle the hindu mathematician aryabhata the elder about 475–550 used the word “jya” or “jiva” for this halfchord in arabic translation the word was unchanged but in the arabic system of writing “jiva” was written the same way as the arabic word “jaib” meaning bosom fold or bay the latin word for bosom bay or curve is “sinus” or “sine” in english and beginning with gherardo of cremona about 1114–1187 that became the standard term edmund gunter 1581–1626 seems to have been the first to publish the abbreviations sin and tan for sin and tangent my source for this history is eli maor’s trigonometric delights 1998 princeton university press pages 35–36 i urge you to consult the book for a fuller account what’s new27 sept 2017 correct “292 ft” to 229 ft here and here  thanks to ryan mc parlan29 oct 2016 added sketches for the examples of sines and cosines and rewrote the solutions added a new example for the tangent added practice problems relabeled why call it sine as btw updated the
