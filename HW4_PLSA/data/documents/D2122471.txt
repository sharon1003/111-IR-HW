were recovered and last night a search was under way for a reported sixth body this has since been called off the tragedy was shrouded in mystery yesterday as police worked to establish the victims’ identities and where they were from one theory was that they drowned after being dragged out to sea by a riptide which has caused deaths there in the past but the beach has relatively shallow water and was said to be calm yesterday afternoon witnesses said the first three men were fully clothed and did not appear to have any family or friends on the beach with them it led to speculation the victims could be illegal immigrants but a sussex police source insisted “we’ve been advised that there is currently nothing to suggest the men were migrants”they later added all three men were dressed appropriately for the beach fame flynet 18families are seen paddling in the sea at camber sands today after yesterdays tragedy getty images 18police confirmed the five men are believed to have come

commented on the lack of lifeguards at the popular tourist beach one beachgoer said police told her to stay out of the sea due to a rip tide while another who declined to be named said we noticed when we came here that there were no lifeguards we had kids here and we were worried about them he said he could not understand how the men had run into difficulties as the sea appeared calm the sea is very shallow for quite a long way he said it seems so strange how they got into trouble there was no waves and no wind rob manning who works at bavarian beach grill saw one if the men pulled from the water he said i saw them take one of them back up on the pick up and they were giving him cpr i heard it was a group of men who got into trouble how could five men get in trouble it was a lovely day there wasnt a ripple in the sea if it was a red flag day and the sea was rough you could see how they got into trouble but the sea was perfect its really strange peter o uwaibi  twitter 18families were left in floods of tears by the tragedy according to one witness swns 18paramedics tried to save the lives of those involved at the scene a spokesman for rother district council said that despite there being no lifeguards there are summer patrols to advise people of potential dangers reunite lost children with their families and deal with incidents on the beach while its very upsetting to see two similar tragic incidents this summer over the years these kind of incidents are extremely rare and on a fine day around 25000 people use the beach safely he said although its too early to draw any conclusions from this latest incident in recent years we have seen a change in the makeup of visitors to camber including more people from outside the area who are not familiar with the sea and the dangers it can pose emergency crews were called to the scene shortly after 2pm following reports that one man was in difficulty in the sea rita wilcox 61 from sidcup kent who was on the beach with husband alan and two grandchildren said “we don’t know if the men were washed up or caught in a riptide”another witness said “they had all their clothes on — shorts and tshirts we found it quite odd

beach is a different entity all together paul osborne ward member for eastern rother which covers camber for rother district council said this morning thurs he was waiting to hear the full details about yesterday’s tragic incident in which five men lost their lives he said “we don’t have a lot of information at the moment about what happened we’re awaiting an update“it’s odd that no one seemed to be reported missing we’re trying to establish if the people are from the same group at the moment we just don’t know“but i suppose until the police know what happened they don’t want people speculating and until they know everything they can’t release it”he added camber is safe it’s not massively deep but you do find people go in even if they can’t swim and then get into difficulty it’s not a pool with steps which doesn’t have a current the beach is a different entity all together“personally i wouldn’t go into the sea and i can swim i wouldn’t risk it”last month brazilian tourist
