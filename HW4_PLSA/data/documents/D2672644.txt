only way i can get the full feeling to go away is to drink 23 glasses of ice cold water it washes the digested food from your stomach so you dont feel so full as i said i have had this 9 years and

stomach to feel full and bloated gas and indigestion gas is a common source for creating your stomach’s bloat and fullness feeling gas pains in your digestive tract usually has two means of creation the air that you swallow bacteria food breakdown in your large intestine lessen the air that you swallow by drinking nonfizzy liquid and chewing your food down to a “stomach ready” consistency certain foods may also cause you to experience “feeling bloated” gas but not have this same “full and bloated’ feel aftermath on others another common source for your stomach bloating and fullness is indigestion for many it results from eating too much eating too quickly eating high fat foods eating during stressful situations other causes for the “i feel full bloat” of indigestion or makes it worse include smoking being tired ongoing stress drinking too much alcohol medications that irritate the stomach lining avoiding the foods and situations that seem to cause indigestion is the way to treat bloating and fullness smokers can help relieve their indigestion by quitting or at least not smoking right before eating exercising with a full stomach can be a cause for feelings of indigestion so schedule your exercise before a meal or wait at least an hour after eating your feel full bloat of indigestion might be caused by a disease in the digestive tract for example gastritis colon cancer stomach cancer lactose intolerance irritable bowl syndrome gastroesophageal reflux disease some have persistent gas and indigestion that is not related to any of these food type factors this type of
