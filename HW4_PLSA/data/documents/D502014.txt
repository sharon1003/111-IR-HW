posts 2billing em and chemo treatment help new to oncology i know you cannot code an em visit on the same day as an infusion treatment so we were looking at having the patient come in the day before for their labs and visit i keep getting told by my compliance department that we still cannot bill the em visit the day before the infusion treatment that there needs to be at least a 3 day lag time can someone help me with this can i bill an em visit the day before an infusion treatment thanks shannon02282014 0126 pm 2peggy asher new posts 2chemo and emappend the modifier 25 to the em code if there is an icd 9 code that fits the em code as the reason for the visit use it if physician is changing med or patient is having a reaction to meds such as nausa anemia tingling numbness or dizziness and the doctor addresses the issue then same day ems are paid normally03032014 0305 pm 3davidsnk guest posts 36an em can be billed on the same day as chemotherapy with a 25 modifier if it is indeed a separate identifiable service with clear documentation03032014 0350 pm 4ocdcoder true blue location nashville aapc chapter posts 937this is a hotly debated topic whether to allow for an em on the same day as infusions performed a patient being given chemotherapy must be monitored very closely for side effects of the chemotherapy drugs this is no different than monitoring a patient with a chronic condition such as ms or rheumatoid arthritis or a diabetic which require routine labs also just not as frequently there is a lot of work our oncologists must perform to manage a cancer patient infusions are only one part i educate my providers to concentrate on documenting sideeffects signs or symptoms abnormal lab work of the chemotherapy when they occur to support a separate significant em many auditors look at infusions as surgical procedures they are not here is a blurp from palmetto mac supporting that thought granted a new patient will probably not get chemo on their firt visit but modifier 25 would still be necessary on established cpt codes focus on the important part of this information infusions are not to be considered surgical procedures new patient cpt codes require cpt modifier 25 when a separately identifiable em service is performed the same day as chemotherapy or nonchemotherapy infusions or injections as these are not considered surgery for example cpt codes 96401 and 9637203072014 0230 pm 5acw networker posts 39i code for a freestanding oncology infusion center and i have educated the oncologists about em visits with infusion the same day we only codebill for em visits where the patient is having symptoms change in chemo administration if the provider see the patient and everything is stable with no symptoms no change in meds labs stable it would be part of the infusion visit for that day and would not be spearately billable from a billing standpoint i have not received any denials when ems are documented this way there must be medical necessity for the billing that visit separate from the infusion visit hope that helps annette w cpc cemc03242015 0118 pm 6flycliffyboo contributor posts 15em in infusion coding where can i learn the

networker posts 39cms claims processing manual 10004 chapter 12  physiciansnonphysician practitioners 30  correct coding policy 305 f chemotherapy administration or nonchemotherapy injection and infusion and evaluation and management services furnished on the same day for services furnished on or after january 1 2004 do not allow payment for cpt code 99211 with or without modifier 25 if it is billed with a nonchemotherapy drug infusion code or a chemotherapy administration code apply this policy to code 99211 when it is billed with a diagnostic or therapeutic injection code on or after january 1 2005 physicians providing a chemotherapy administration service or a nonchemotherapy drug infusion service and evaluation and management services other than cpt code 99211 on the same day must bill in accordance with 3066 using modifier 25 the carriers pay for evaluation and management services provided on the same day as the chemotherapy administration services or a nonchemotherapy injection or infusion service if the evaluation and management service meets the requirements of section 3066 even though the underlying codes do not have global periods if a chemotherapy service and a significant separately identifiable evaluation and management service are provided on the same day a different diagnosis is not required in 2005 the medicare physician fee schedule status database indicators for therapeutic and diagnostic injections were changed from t to a thus beginning in 2005 the policy on evaluation and management services other than 99211 that is applicable to a chemotherapy or a nonchemotherapy injection or infusion service applies equally to these codes04232015 0956 am 8admiller04gmailcom networker posts 35billing em with chemo treatment originally posted

this can i bill an em visit the day before an infusion treatment thanks shannon hi shannon you can certainly capture and bill both services keep in mind the documentation for the em should stand alone therefore it should really address another reason beyond the fact the patient is there to receive their chemo treatment ensure you append a 25 modifier to the em to alert the payor the service is separately identifiable from the chemo treatment thanks ashley miller cpc chonc cppm oncology consultant revenue cycle inc thanks ashley miller cpc chonc cppm icd10 proficient similar threads chemo
