food and energy energy transfer and ecological pyramids edited by jamie science aid editor jen moreau carlos spicy wiener sar mal and 7 others6 parts food chains energy transfer ecological pyramids questions and answers referencing this article comments youve probably studied food chains since primary school and are familiar enough with the concept to differentiate between herbivores and carnivores to identify those species at the top of the food chain and those species on the bottom these concepts are the rudimentary basics of the food chain however food chains can be much more intricate and are undoubtedly vital parts of our ecosystems as the name implies food chains link the consumption of food the amount of energy wasted and the transfer of energy amongst a species food chains always start with a plant source and always end with an animal a simple example of a food chain would be a plant is consumed by a herbivore the herbivore is then consumed by a carnivore seems pretty simple right it is but there are many more links and transference of energy depending on the food chain was this helpful yes no i need help ad food chains a typical food chain looks like this a food chain the transference of energy between organisms through consumption in this case the rabbit is eating grass and the fox is eating the rabbit the initial energy source is found in the plant the plant uses initial energy from the sun to convert into chemical energy via photosynthesis the herbivores eat the plants ingesting some of the energy from the plant of the energy the herbivore then becomes prey their energy is transferred to the predator  was this helpful yes no i need help when consumed some of the energy is transferred but some of the energy is lost at each link in the chair or trophic level  in the above example the grass loses some energy by respiration the rabbit loses energy by heat and waste by the time the energy is transferred to the fox there is only a fraction of the total energy transferred was this helpful yes no i need help energy transfer in each ecosystem it is energy that enables organisms to live this energy mainly comes from one original source photosynthesis the plants in the ecosystem use this solar energy to produce carbohydrates which are then consumed by other organisms transferring the energy was this helpful yes no i need help not all of the energy from sunlight however is used by the plants solely as energy they are far from efficient a lot of sunlight misses the plant is in the wrong wavelength or lost in the inefficiencies of photosynthesis we use the term gross primary production to refer to the total energy in the molecules of the plant net primary production is the surplus energy not used by the plant itself was this helpful yes no i need help at each level of the food chain energy is lost because it is used by the organism itself for respiration this limits the number of steps there can be in a food chain the diagram above represents quantitatively in numbers the efficiency of energy transfer in a food chain notice that only about 8 of the energy is transferred from one stage to the next ecological pyramids a food chain is represented quantitatively with numbers in the form of a pyramid of a number listed below is a quantitative representation of the previously presented food chain from this graph we can see there are fewer foxes than rabbits which makes sense because a fox must eat several rabbits to get enough energy in order to survive was this helpful yes no i need help an ecological pyramid shows the relative sizes of different components at the various trophic levels of a food chain a trophic level refers to each stage shown as a horizontal bar on ecological pyramids there are three types of ecological pyramid we use numbers biomass and energy  was this helpful yes no i need help the pyramids of numbers show the raw number of each species at each trophic level the top example is a typical food chain with a large number of producers but diminishing numbers of consumers however if the producer was a tree followed by insects then the bottom bar would appear small as many organisms feed on one tree in this instance the pyramid of biomass is more useful as the tree is much larger was this helpful yes no i need help in the lower example both the pyramid of numbers and biomass show a smaller producer bar given what was discussed under the previous heading  this does not make sense this is because the phytoplankton reproduces very quickly however when we represent this information in a pyramid of energy we get a true pyramid was this helpful yes no i need help plotting the energy will always give a true pyramid because it is impossible to create new energy a trophic level will always be smaller than the one below it the picture of grass in the first graphic was taken by catarina carvalho and taken from wikimedia commons questions and answers how does energy transfer through the number energy and biomass pyramids how does the energy transfer through all these pyramids the article doesnt say how energy transfer through number energy and biomass pyramids energy is transferred through the pyramid by consuming something with energy the source is the sun photosynthesizers store this energy by forming chemical bonds as carbohydrates when these carbohydrates chemical bonds are consumed the energy stored in the bond is released and processed metabolically through respiration this can be either aerobic fermentative or anaerobic was this helpful yes no i need help look at other qa posted on this page for more info relating to energy pyramids why is the energy conversion factor different for caterpillar 55 kcalg vs the food 435 kcalg i had to calculate the energy for both the caterpillar and food in my experiment please see the article calculating the transfer of energy between trophic levels for an explanation on energy conversion and calculating the energy transfer how much energy is lost to get food in the food pyramid and how much energy is gained food pyramid for 10 grade biology please help it is for a study guide for the end of the year test the source of energy that drives the food chain is the sun plants and other photosynthesizers can incorporate the suns energy by the chemical bonds it forms in carbohydrates like glucose each trophic level in the energy pyramid obtains a logarithmic reduction in energy as you go up the pyramid this means that the lowest first trophic level for instance supplies 104 which is 10000 kcal of energy kilocalories kcal is the unit of measure for metabolic energy moving to the second trophic level only 103 kcal is provided the third trophic level would provide 102 kcal which is 100 the fourth is 101 kcal or 10 energy appears to be lost that is not the case through metabolic processes the energy is transferred to the environment as heat energy is also required to break down food chemically and turn it into usable energy this happens in the krebs or tca cycle in the mitochondria even bacteria expend 60 energy in metabolic processes when degrading consuming substances like plant litter glucose was this helpful yes no i need help the loss of energy up the food chain is why higher trophic levels must eat much more food than lower trophic levels this is also why food chains are usually limited to no more than 68 trophic levels im sure you realize that bunnies eat much less food than buzzards or lions also because bunnies are getting food from the highest energy containing source they dont need to eat as much to get the same equivalent energy was this helpful yes no i need help what does most of the energy from food get used for most of the energy that is lost during energy transfer is lost to heat however the energy gained through food is used for a variety of different things including respiration brain function and to fuel the metabolic function of organs and tissues was this helpful yes no i need help what amount of energy is used in each phase of the food web im currently in science class doing a project on ecology and i need to give info on the amount of energy used in each phase of the food web please help due the 18th as food is passed along roughly 10 is transferred to the next level example 10 of energy phytoplankton from the sun can be used by zooplankton at the next level about 90 of the energy is lost by the previous level meaning there must be many more organisms at the lower level than at the higher levels this energy loss is easier to understand by looking at a food pyramid was this helpful yes no i need help amount of biomass passed up the food pyramid  in pounds1 person10 large fish100 small fish1000 zooplankton10000 phytoplanktonwhy are there fewer numbers of organisms moving up the pyramid than there are in the preceding levels why are there fewer numbers of organisms moving up the pyramid you can find this answer in the article ecosystem and its components how much energy transfers to each after it eats the other when the rabbit eats the grass how much energy does it get how much energy does the fox get when it eats the rabbit please see the article calculating the transfer of energy between trophic levels for an explanation on energy conversion and calculating the energy transfer referencing this
