what is southern comfort anyway southern comfort so co to many traces its origins to new orleans in 1874 my personal history with the product like most people began when i was shy of legal drinking age and it ended badly in adulthood southern comfort became part of my job brownforman bought southern comfort the whole company not just the brand in 1979 i was working for a brownforman marketing agency and was part of the team that brought the brand into the brownforman fold i worked on it for the next six years among other things i wrote all of the southern comfort recipe books during that period they distributed about 10 million of them four times a year so thats probably the most widely circulated work of mine part of the strategy brownforman inherited from the previous owner was to position southern comfort as if it were a whiskey even though it was clearly labeled as a liqueur it was the right color and proof 50 abv then and maybe tasted a little like bourbon if you only vaguely knew what bourbon tasted like sales people were encouraged to place it in the whiskey section of liquor stores and with other whiskeys on back bars many of the cocktail recipes we repeated from recipe book to recipe book were whiskey recipes in which southern comfort was substituted for whiskey we always said you could substitute it for any whiskey but it most closely resembled bourbon one of the best cocktails was the comfort dry manhattan not that any drink made with southern comfort can truly be considered dry it consists of 1 jigger 1½ oz of southern comfort and ½ oz dry vermouth pour the ingredients over ice in a short glass stir and add olive s or a twist of lemon thats how they published it but olives i can tell you are terrible in it cherries are okay the lemon twist also good so what is southern comfort when brownforman acquired the company in 1979 it was a 100 grain neutral spirit gns base ie vodka a few years after my tenure they reformulated it to contain a little bit of bourbon i guess so they could call it a whiskey liqueur rather than just a liqueur apparently although no one will give me the details they reverted back to 100 gns a few years after that and thats what it is now the ingredients are mixed together and bottled at brownforman in louisville the gns comes from some gns supplier like mgp or adm the fruit concentrate mostly apricot is made at a brownforman facility in puerto rico and the final ingredient is sugar i remember being in the room one time when they were bottling it it goes through a filtration system and after a while the filter module looks like a honey comb with sugar syrup oozing out of it at every opportunity so co is very sweet i didnt come up with the so co nickname that was after my time my most noteworthy accomplishment was being the first to use comfort and joy as a christmastheme headline for the brand if you know your american whiskey history compound or fake whiskeys were a big problem preprohibition you might want to consider southern comfort as historys most successful compound or fake whiskey they didnt call it whiskey of course they called it the grand old drink of the south they we just implied that it was whiskey another funny thing about southern comfort it never sold that well in the south when i was working on the brand its 1 state was new jersey posted by chuck cowdery at 900 am email this blog this share to twitter share to facebook share to pinterest labels brownforman  liqueur
