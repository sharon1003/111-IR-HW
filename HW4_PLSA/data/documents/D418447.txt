fact or fiction five myths about common law marriageby mary s yamingarone most people are fuzzy on the specifics of common law marriage so lets start by putting one of the most common misconceptions to rest if two people live together for seven years or any other number of years they arent automatically common law spouses interestingly the idea of common law marriage actually dates back to medieval england it simply came about due to transportation difficulties and limitations clerics and justices who officiated at marriages were not always able to travel to couples in rural locations in such cases the couple could establish a marriage by common law today common law marriage isnt a result of geographic isolation which might explain why its been abolished in so many states now it results from a couples actions a common law couple never obtains a marriage license or fulfills the states statutory marriage laws typically this means the couple has cohabitated for a period of time—usually a year or more—while having an agreement to be married also they must present themselves to the larger world as husband and wife as mentioned common law marriage is not recognized in most states today so regardless of how many years you live together you dont have to worry about a common law marriage states that do recognize common law marriage include the following alabama colorado

requirements have been met the marriage is typically treated like any other marriage couples who do marry under common law are likely to have their marriage recognized in states where common law is off the books the full faith and credit rule of the u s constitution ordinarily compels sister states to recognize a marriage made valid under another states laws rights to protecting a family residence and dividing family assets are only granted to legally married couples fact or fiction despite what you may have heard the following statements are false cohabitation alone does not constitute a common law marriage while the requirements for common law marriage vary slightly among states the two essential elements are cohabitation and holding out holding out means the couples actions tell the world they are husband and wife for example the woman might assume her husbands last name also the couple files a joint tax return the property bought by a common law spouse will be split half and half in the event of separation rights to protecting a family residence and dividing family assets are only granted to legally married couples a common law spouse who is the sole owner of a shared residence may sell or mortgage property without consent and without splitting proceeds whenever a couple stops living together the registered homeowner keeps the property if you are planning to buy a home consider doing so under a coownership agreement that way both names will be listed on the deed as purchasers both partners will benefit from any increases in the homes value if a couple has a child together they must adopt himher children from a common law marriage have the same rights as those from a legal marriage plus common law parents have the same obligations as any other parent this means parents dont have to adopt children if they have already acknowledged them as their own the child may be given the mothers or the fathers last name or a combination of the two names should a common law spouse die or become disabled all assets automatically go to the surviving spouse it will be up to the survivor to prove the marriages validity your spouses family may exclude you from medical decisionmaking or inheriting property there is no such thing as common law divorce common law marriage isnt something to enter lightly if you are married by common law and then decide to end the relationship you will still require a legal divorce in this way common law marriages are similar to regular marriages they are usually easier to get into than to get out of there is no simple test to see if a couple qualifies as married under common law unfortunately this question of married or not most often arises in court since the sevenyearstoautomaticmarriage idea is only a myth the courts determination as to whether a common law marriage existed can be complicated some legal experts recommend that couples write sign and date a simple statement saying they do or do not intend to be married while common law marriage skirts legalities like a marriage license this simple statement can prevent future burdens and offer protection should the need arise need
