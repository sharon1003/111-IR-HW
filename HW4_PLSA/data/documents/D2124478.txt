for other uses see pretty baby disambiguation pretty baby  is a song written by tony jackson during the ragtime era the song and lyrics apparently referred to one of jacksons male lovers 1 the song was remembered 2 as being prominent in jacksons repertory before he left new orleans in 1912 but was not published until 1916 the background as to how the song came to be published has been confused over the years but the truth appears to be that composer egbert van alstyne and lyricist gus kahn were writing partners and whilst egbert was chicago manager of music publishers jerome h remick  company they heard tony jackson singing the song one evening at a chicago nightspot they liked the melody but the lyrics were unsuitable for mass consumption so jackson was paid 250 for the rights to the tune and kahn rewrote the lyrics with van alstyne adding a verse which he took from one of his earlier songs which had not been successful 2 jacksons name was included on the sheet music the song was quickly interpolated into the broadway show a world of pleasure oct 14 1915  jan 22 1916 and was then used in the show the passing show of 1916 jun 22 1916  oct 21 1916 where it was sung by dolly
