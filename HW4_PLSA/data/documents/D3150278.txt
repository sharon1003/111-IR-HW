being drawn into the wick for a top coil tilt and twirl or cut a small notch in the grommet right where the wick enters the coil on one side or both if needed for a bottom coil try removing 1 of the 2 flavor wicks if needed remove both talyon nov 23 2013 2katya ecf guru verified member ecf veteran feb 23 2010so caldry hits occur when your device cant supply enough juice to the hot coil fast enough to cool it off as a result you end up inhaling hot air from the overheated coil orand the smoke from the gunk thats being roasted on the coilnot vapor not a good thing keeping your coil wet is critical if your coil is not wet at all timesyoull get dry hits never over vape chain vape power vape or vape at excessive power wattageyoull starve the coil katya nov 23 2013 3lockhart320full member

my bad lockhart320 nov 23 2013 4decimate super member verified member ecf veteran nov 4 2013california with kanger bccs youre going to want to vape something around 70pg30vg high vg liquids dont do well at least for me in kanger products decimate nov 23 2013 5thamyris full member sep 14 2013coon rapids mnif you are using a thick juice that has a high vg percentage the above options with some flavor wick removal is a good start you could add a little distilled water to it but adding too much may mute the flavor some or you may wish to turn down your voltage or wattage if using a vvvw device when i first started vaping i was using the kangers and had some of the same issues in turn it made me get into the diy juice it allowed me to not only make my juices thin enough to wick well in them but also allowed me to add the flavor amounts i needed to not have them feel muted while keeping the nic levels i was needing when starting out it may be something you could investigate and see if that is a option that may be fitting for you thamyris nov 23 2013 6katya ecf guru verified member ecf veteran feb 23 2010so cal lockhart320 said ↑thanks for the great answer  do you have any tips on keeping the coil wet take longer slower drags do not exceed recommended wattage 5575w dont chainvape if your juice is very thick thin it out a with couple of drops of distilled water per ml take an occasional priming drag without activating the batterythat will force more juice into the atomizing chamber katya nov 23 2013 7katya ecf guru verified member ecf veteran feb 23 2010so cal kanger bcc troubleshooting if your clearo is flooding the connections are not tight enoughor too tight keep reading if youre using clearos and getting a burnt taste it means that not enough juice is getting to the coil and youre basically vaping dry hot air or inhaling smoke from the gunk thats burning off of your coil not a good thing another case of bad taste maybe the tank itselfsome arrive covered with some kind of nasty grease wash them with soap and water just the tanks soak the coils in pga or vodka there are a few things you need to remember when using a t3 or an e vod or a pro tankin addition to keeping your coils clean and free of gunk that accumulates on them 1 make sure that the atomizer coil is screwed into the base tightlyevery time you refill they often come not fully tightened from the manufacturer or may have gotten loose through repeated refills 2 look at all the inner seals and gaskets to make sure they havent become dislodged 3 make sure that you screw the tank into its base tightly if its not tight it will leak 4 when you screw your clearomizer into your battery do not over tightenscrew it in only until it makes contactno farther or you may push the center post in too deep and cause all kinds of problems including leaking when the draw becomes tight or the taste and vapor production begin to diminish replace the coil this will happen sooner even as soon as one day of heavy use if youre using dark viscous or very sweet juices the old coil can be cleaned and dry burned 5 make sure youre not getting any juice in the center tube when youre fillingthis will cause your e vod to leak like a sieve if some juice gets into the tube close the top cap place a tissue under your tank and blow gently through the clearomizer to get rid of any excess eliquid also extra condensation inside the tank may on some occasions drip back into the center tube wipe your mouthpiece dry with a qtip or a tissue when you refill or more often whenif needed 6 take an occasional primer puff a slow draw without activating the battery when you vape it helps move the juice into the coil chamber and removes any air bubbles that sometimes form in the tank and may cause gurgling or impede proper wicking 7 take slow long draws rather than sharp and quick ones like we used to do while smoking cigarettes do not over vape chain vape power vape let the juice travel to the coil between drags and last but not least 8 do not remove any flavor wicks if youre experiencing any leaking or flooding those wicks are there for a reason if you feel that you have to remove a wick because your eliquid is particularly thick do it carefullyone strand at a time if your liquid is super thin you can thicken it with a bit of vg usppharma grade or you can add another strand of cotton to your flavor wick dont add too much or youll choke your atomizer and get a dry hit its also a good idea to wash the tank with warm water and a drop of dishwashing detergent prior to first usesome of them taste funny on occasion rinse well and dry the atomizer coils may benefit from a quick soak in pga or vodka if the priming fluid has an off taste but i havent had any problems with themyet also make sure youre vaping at correct wattages kanger recommends 5575 watts always start low and increase voltage only if necessary per kangertech recommended voltage for varying resistance levels 17  19 ohm 31  33 volts 21  23 ohm 34  37 volts 24  26 ohm 38  41 volts 26  30 ohm 42  45 volts please note that atomisers will burn out more quickly at higher voltages katya nov 23

creating hot spots and shorts always make sure a fresh coil head is well saturated with juice before the first vapedice57 nov 23 2013 9 you must log in or sign up to reply here thread status not open
