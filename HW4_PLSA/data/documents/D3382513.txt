search this site zoning variances offer relief under unique circumstances zoning variances are exceptions to the zoning ordinance law usually granted by a separate board not including the planning commission or city council typically this board is called the zoning board of adjustment zoning board of appeals or some similar variant usually their decisions are final and the only appeal from that group is to a court according to sound theory the zoning ordinance law should state that zoning variances should be granted only when a property owner would have a unique and unusual hardship created by the physical characteristics of the land if the ordinance is strictly and literally applied in their case an example would be a weird triangular shaped lot that you see illustrated on this page a classic candidate for a variance might be for example the owner of the triangular lot who literally cannot maintain the front yard two side yards and rear yard setbacks as required by the ordinance a home owner might need a variance because he met the height restriction in his zoning district 40 years ago but now a building code requires him to rebuild his crumbling chimney to a taller height for safety reasons causing him to exceed the height limit zoning variances should not be granted for the land use itself in other words if hog farms are prohibited uses in the urban fringe uf district a person should not be able to buy that land and then claim a unique and unusual hardship because his experience is as a hog farmer and not a vegetable farmer here too practice has been slipping toward less stringent applications of zoning theory but be aware that a court might view the use of zoning variances to alter the list of permitted or prohibited land uses in a very bad light even if you bamboozle local authorities into granting you a variance a court might have other ideas if the hardship is not unique and other property owners have the same situation the theory says the zoning regulations themselves should be changed rather than having property owners seek exceptions on a casebycase basis how the board of adjustment decides in practice however be aware that all over the u s zoning boards of appeals are granting variances every day on matters that are not unique but where the board simply feels that literal application of the zoning law is unfair impractical or damaging to property value at the worst the exception is granted simply because a sympathetic neighbor asks we are not condoning the trend but we mention it to alert readers to the fact that the unique hardship test seems to be ignored sometimes just as rezoning requires one or more public hearings almost always the board that acts on variances is required by the zoning law to hold a public hearing or at least to provide an opportunity for public input a board of zoning appeals that wants to do a great job would take advantage of the public hearing to ask questions that neighbors might be able to address but unlike a city council the board of appeals should not take public sentiment as such into account in a wellrun planning office the legal criteria for granting a variance which are spelled out in the zoning ordinance should be addressed one by one in a written staff report that then is translated into findings of fact by the board of adjustment summary of zoning exceptions in short there are justified variances which provide land owners with flexibility where the zoning ordinance has not anticipated every variation of the physical characteristics of land or the actual method of conduct of business in the community many others are unjustified if you are buying property definitely donâ€™t regard obtaining a variance as a mere formality or figure that you surely will prevail if you persevere gain control of the property through an option to buy but dont close on the sale until you know you have a variance and feel reasonably sure that no opposition parties will be suing the municipality if you are a property owner and your next door neighbor seeks a variance you dislike the odds are in your favor in fact if you go to the board of adjustment informed with facts and an understanding of what your zoning ordinance says about the circumstances for granting a variance you may have a good chance to prevent that variance variances are the only exceptiongranting mechanism for the typical municipal zoning ordinance many ordinances say that variances cannot even be filed for certain provisions of the ordinance including permitted or prohibited land uses also relevant formbased code land use planning principles neighborhood advocacy home  land use zoning  zoning variances subscribe to our mailing listindicates required email address first name
