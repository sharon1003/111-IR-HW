higher memory capacity reduction in print time and reduction in number of memory errors regardless of driver emulation pcl or ps print speeds are determined by the performance of the computer network printer performance  and the printspool file size graphics added to any job will increase the spooled file size of the print job and affect printer performance hence any image including fonts rendered as raster graphics may impact overall printing performance  network congestion packet saturation network bandwidth printer processor speed printer memory spool file size and any concurrent functions

most instances pcl 6 is typically backwards compatible with software that supports older versions of the language a majority of all laser printers have language smartswitches which can automatically detect both pcl and ps printer data streams regardless of driver used lexmark pcl and ps smartswitches must be enabled for each datareceiving port on the printer failure to enable these smartswitches
