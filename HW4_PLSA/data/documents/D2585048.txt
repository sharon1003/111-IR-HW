marine flying squadrons were identified by one digit numbers this changed on july 1 1941 when all existing squadrons were redesignated to a threedigit system the first two numbers were supposed to identify the squadrons parent group but with the rapid expansion during the war and frequent transfer of squadrons this system fell apart 2inactive squadrons  editsquadrons are listed by their

forces pilots not being able to engage japanese bombers at night during the battle of guadalcanal this led to the formation of the first vmf n in november 1942 after much deliberation the lockheed pv1 ventura was picked as the first choice of aircraft for these squadrons the night fighting squadrons featured radar equipped aircraft ground based radar and personnel that provided groundcontrolled interception gci the vmf n designated squadrons were deactivated after the war as the night fighting mission was assumed by the fighter and attack communities 55lockheed pv1 ventura night fighter from
