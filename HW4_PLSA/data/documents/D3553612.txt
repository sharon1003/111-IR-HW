receiving enough oxygen to function properly stroke often results in permanent serious complications and disability and is a common cause of death it is the second leading cause of death worldwide and the third leading cause of death in the u s according to the american heart association the brain requires a steady supply of oxygen in order to pump blood effectively to all of the body oxygen is supplied to the brain in the blood that flows through arteries if an artery that supplies blood to the brain becomes blocked or ruptured or begins to leak the portion of the brain that gets its oxygenrich blood from that specific artery becomes damaged this injury can become permanent within minutes and result in the death of the affected brain tissue medically this is called cerebral necrosis there are two types of strokes an ischemic stroke occurs when a brain artery has been blocked a hemorrhagic stroke occurs when an artery ruptures or leaks there are primary causes of strokes cerebral thrombosis cerebral embolism and cerebral hemorrhage stroke cause by cerebral thrombosis is one cause of ischemic stroke and is the result of a buildup of plaque and inflammation in the arteries called atherosclerosis this process narrows the brain arteries and lowers the amount of oxygenrich blood that reaches the brain tissue arteries narrowed by atherosclerosis are more likely to develop a blood clot that completely blocks blood flow to an area of the brain risk factors for atherosclerosis include having high cholesterol diabetes and hypertension stroke cause by cerebral embolism is another cause of ischemic stroke it is caused by clot that forms in another part of the body and travels in the bloodstream to a brain artery and blocks the flow of blood to the brain stroke caused by cerebral hemorrhage occurs when a brain artery breaks or leaks blood into the surrounding brain tissue the extent of the damage done to the brain and resulting symptoms of a stroke vary depending on the cause of stroke the area or areas affected and how much time passes before stroke is treated complications of stroke include permanent neurological damage disability and death for more information on symptoms and complications refer to symptoms of stroke risk factors for stroke include a having hypertension heart disease diabetes high cholesterol and obesity other risk factors include being of africanamerican ancestry male drinking excessive amounts of alcohol smoking and having a family history of heart disease or stroke having a brain aneurysm puts a person at an extreme risk for hemorrhagic stroke making a diagnosis of stroke includes completing a complete medical evaluation and history and physical examination including a neurological examination this is often done in an emergency room diagnostic testing includes imaging tests such as a ct or mri and cerebral angiogram of the brain a cerebral angiogram reveals obstructed or narrowed arteries in the brain and can show blood flow a battery of other tests are also performed to evaluate for other conditions that commonly occur with a stroke such as heart disease and cardiac arrhythmia it is possible that a diagnosis of stroke can be missed or delayed because sometimes the symptoms may be mild and attributed to other conditions for more information on misdiagnosis refer to misdiagnosis of stroke
