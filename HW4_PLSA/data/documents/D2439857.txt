of two cups of tesubmitted 2 years ago  by deletedif someone tells me drink four 8oz cups of green tea per day and i drink two 8oz cups of green tea with two teabags each will i get the same health benefits edit the green tea was only an example i felt it would be easier to say green tea than to explain the echinacea elderberry tea im drinking to help my cold im looking for a more general answer

one cups worth but probably less than two cups because the amount of water in one cup may not be enough to leach out all the active incredients from two tea bagspermalink embed save – phantom316 3 points 2 years ago and it would taste awfulpermalink embed save parent – that metal panda 13 points 2 years ago i use two tea bags every morning and it tastes just fine to mepermalink embed save parent – scholles 2 points 2 years ago im curious wouldnt it taste similar to leaving one tea bag for a lot longerpermalink embed save parent – jbgatsby 2 points 2 years agoyou get overextraction with just one teabag in longer basically you only want the chemicals that come out in the first 35 minutes of brewing the stuff after that is just bitter

use one bagpermalink embed save parent – that metal panda 1 point 2 years ago i make mine into milk tea and if it doesnt use 2 tea bags it tastes like watered down half and half with a hint of tea fuck that i want the flavor of tea with the feeling of fullness of milkpermalink embed save parent – stellarguymk 1 point 2 years ago well if its a strong black breakfast tea then yes i agreepermalink embed save parent – zornasdfghjkl 1 point 2 years ago to each hisher own i personally wouldnt hate itpermalink embed save parent – 915710 1 point 2 years ago the awful taste is usually due to keeping the tea bags in for longer time letting the bitterness release its actually recommended that if you like strong flavor you use more tea for example two bags instead of one rather than leaving the one tea bag for longer timepermalink embed save parent – phantom316 1 point 2 years ago tilpermalink embed save parent – deleted 40 points 2 years ago there are health benefits to drinking green tea but there are also health benefits to drinking a lot of water each day although like anything you dont want to overdo it if nothing else you are losing the benefit of the water unless you make it up by drinking water at other timespermalink embed save – author tom frost 35 points 2 years ago i still get annoyed at places that sell you a small tea or a large tea at different prices its the same tea you just added more water which you otherwise give out for free to it remember if youre not part of the solution youre part of the precipitatepermalink embed save parent – mysticalmisogynistic 9

frost 5 points 2 years ago heisenbergpermalink embed save parent – rhubarbist 5 points 2 years ago youre goddamn rightpermalink embed save parent – elborracho420 5 points 2 years ago but also you have to pay for a larger cup when i worked in fast food back in nam most of the overhead for the drinks came from the cups themselves not necessarily the soda or drink we put in it not sure if this is still a factor todaypermalink embed save parent – author tom frost 7 points 2 years ago the cups are functionally the same price  a nickel difference between them theyre just used for shrinkage control during inventorypermalink embed save parent – elborracho420 5 points 2 years ago at the restaurant i worked at our small cups were significantly cheaper than our large cups this was back in 2002 though so times could have changed but with the employees being allowed to get free drinks the owners only wanted us using the small cups because the larger cups were significantly more expensivepermalink embed save parent – boukish 5 points 2 years agosignificantly is great because it can be 200 more expensive and still only a difference of two centspermalink embed save parent – elborracho420 1 point 2 years ago ah good pointpermalink embed save parent – xavierfox42 6 points 2 years ago but having tea bags in the water doesnt magically make the water thats there not water its still h2o just with additional chemicals from the tea edit nvmpermalink embed save parent – deleted 16 points 2 years ago i think you misunderstand op is asking if drinking 2 doubleconcentrated 8oz cups of tea is as beneficial as drinking 4 singleconcentrated 8oz cups of tea op will get the same total amount of tea but he will only get half as much water so i am advising him that he is giving up the water benefits but not the tea benefitspermalink embed save parent – xavierfox42 13 points 2 years ago oooh got it im stupid sorrypermalink embed save parent – deleted 10 points 2 years ago sureof course the only scientifically proven health benefit of green tea is anti oxidants and there are lots of ways to get those yes i get there are a lot of other claims of benefits from fat burning to brain function but none of these are proven in peer reviewed studies edit editting for your edit no you wont get the same health benefit as the idea of four cups is they are spaced out when taking in certain medications herbal or otherwise the point is to get the correct dosage if 2 aleve every 4 hours helps joint pain i cant take 4 at once and expect 8 hours of relief similarly the 4 glasses are meant to be spread out so your body has a more constant access to echinaciapermalink embed save – deleted 2 points 2 years ago the effect of caffeine in fat burning is scientifically proven and green tea has loads of caffeinepermalink embed save parent – mommy2libras 1 point 2 years ago the one place ive noticed a huge difference is using wet teabags on my eyes im 36 and have had a lot of hard times my under eye baggage is quite a bit worse than other people my age that ive noticed personally anyway  but using green tea bags soaked in ice water makes a noticeable difference i havent noticed benefits to my overall health from drinking green yes but ill definitely recommend it to people trying to get rid of dark circles and puffiness caffeine is what they put in those under eye roller things you can get better benefits by taking 5 minutes to diy thoughpermalink embed save parent – deleted 1 point 2 years agoyou didnt seriously cite caffeine as a health benefit did youpermalink embed save parent – deleted 1 point 2 years ago caffeine as a stimulant to the metabolism which in turn increases fat burning with exercise thats not the same as ingesting caffeine ten time a daypermalink embed save parent – deleted 1 point 2 years ago eh the effect is gone in most tea and coffee drinkers as the body grows immune to this part of it rather quickly if it was someone who never touched caffeine and suddenly used it sure but for a regular tea drinker nopepermalink embed save parent – some random redditor 8 points 2 years ago ive tried something like that when i wanted a stronger tea was out of coffee to be honest it didnt seem to really be much stronger so and this is simply a guess along with one experience id say no however the opposite seems true with longer seeping such as brewing sun ice tea which does indeed grow stronger based on the amount of tea bags you usepermalink embed save – nrjk 11 points 2 years ago id imagine theres a saturation pointpermalink embed save parent – use knowledge 4 points 2 years ago iirc theres only so much you can dilute in water theres a limit so i doubt itpermalink embed save – najevb2 2 points 2 years ago i doubt it will help you more i believe it will just slowly get rid of the actual nutrients you drankpermalink embed save – salradicchio 2 points 2 years ago i dont know about that but if youre drinking echinacea elderberry tea to help your cold just use one bag per cup you need all the fluids you can get anyway and drinking warm fluids can help loosen the mucus is that the traditional medicinals tea i swear by that brand im trying to drown myself in herbatussin right now feel better soon permalink embed save – beeasaurusrex 2 points 2 years ago probably yes but at what cost  p green tea has some pretty specific brewing times and amounts its just like coffee if you use too many leavesbrew too long it can taste really bitter and nasty so id definitely be careful if you want to enjoy the taste benefits of your tea instead of just the health benefits its also worth a try to check out your local teavana and give looseleaf tea a shot its a little pricier than bagged tea but you get a lot more of the health benefits out of it and tastes a lot nicer in my opinion plus if youre planning to drink tea on a daily basis or brew a tastier cup than you can get from a bag you wind up getting a lot more bang for your buckpermalink embed save – wtfthisisntatoaster 1 point 2 years ago no go to your local coffee shop or tea house and get yourself some damn good loose leafpermalink embed save parent – beeasaurusrex 1 point 2 years ago teavana is cheap and has lots of samples my local coffee shops and tea houses dont have loose leaf available for sampling or bulk purchase either i wish i lived where you dopermalink embed save parent – big mike0228 2 points 2 years ago over all its better for your body to take in nutrients through out the day your body will get rid of whatever it doesnt need at a certain time similar to water a lot of people say you need to dri m 8 8oz glasses of water a day it does your body no good to drink 64 oz all at once once a daypermalink embed save – bainj 2 points 2 years ago yes green tea contains antioxidants which you can also get from vegetables and fruit so nothing special there and some caffeine neither of which are unique to tea no reason to break tea consumption up unless the caffeine affects you too muchpermalink embed save – deleted 1 point 2 years ago it would depend however there will be a mass transfer limit that once it hits equilibrium will prevent any further transfer from the tea bag to the water so if this occurs before two full tea bags disperse then yes you would only be getting less than 4 tea bags worth of contents if you just have to do only 16 oz then figure a way out to pressurize the tea leaves adding pressure will cause more material to transferpermalink embed save – chronx6 1 point 2 years ago while your likely to get more than one normal brew would get you its not going to equal two full brews water can only carry so much and you will likely hit it before extracting everything from the second mix plus fluids are good for you as a general rulepermalink embed save – gowahoo 1 point 2 years ago you might need to ask this in rasksciencepermalink embed save – zardwiz 1 point 2 years ago the what youre taking for your cold take vitamin c not because it helps but because it might help and it cant really do much harm in supplement quantities drink the tea if you think its tasty dont drink the tea for medicinal purposes not a doc but no tea is going to impact the length of your coldpermalink embed save – deleted 1 point 2 years ago yes you still get the health benefits of two cups none take a
