its unique enough that the odds of me being confused with another micah are very very low however for those of you planning to name your daughters micah michelle please dont i personally hate having a gender neutral name mashed up with such a girly name id rather my middle name be a traditional family name plus micah and michelle literally mean the same thing who is like god micah is a great choice for male or female children and i personally can say that it has actually benefited my life greatly jun 12 2016i love this name as a boys name but i hate it as a girls name its a mans name in the bible stop naming your girls after a boys name apr 6 2016micah is a biblical name for boys but in hebrew it was a girls name means who is like god its fine to use for girls or boys as long as how you can carry your name and how you can make your name for you become proud jul 11 2014i named my daughter micahmichelle and it fits her i think her name is truly a beautiful name i know that she will

it mikeah i think its a beautiful unique name for a boy or a girl i tend to think for a boy it is better to pronounce mikeah and for a girl meeka her twin sister is named hannah and we thought the names go really well together nov 29 2012i want to name my daughter micah pronounced meeka i love the name a lot but my husband doesnt like it he prefers jaylin i love the biblical meaning i think the name can follow her age  just need a middle im thinking of michelle sep 26 2012my sons name is micah to me its a masculine name because its been a guys name for thousands of years read the bible people micah in the bible was a male prophet just because it has the ah sound at the end doesnt make it a girls name think elijah isaiah ezra nehemiah all male names jun 19 2012im also a bible kid timothy micah i experienced the same issues growing up my family calls me micah but the rest of the world uses tim because i got tired of mispronounced and misspelled micha instances so i made it as simple as it gets tim mar 6 2012awesome name we are planning to name our daughter micah feb 21 2012im a female named micah and i have always loved my name its different and special for a girl i agree that the spelling is an issue for people a lot of the time due to the scarcity of the name especially in my country but i have always carried it proudly nov 29 2011i named my female german shepard micah i pronounce it meekah most people say my ka when they see it i absolutely love the name and would never change naming her that it is such a nice name but i would never use it on a human child not pronounced as mee kah anyway maybe my kah for a boy oct 6 2011i am naming my daughter mikah and i love the name the biblical meaning is great and i wanted my childs name to have meaningnot jus some random name or everyday name on the street so many people pause and want to say its a boys name when they ask me what were naming her but i think it could go either way i know a girl named micca pronounced the same way and micha i think its a matter of opinion and if youre willing to stand by your childs nameits your childname them what you want regardless of what people may think or say itll grow on them after a while anyway  sep 29 2011micah is the name of one of my best friends she is a brilliant student especially in maths and chemistry she has a good voice and sings english and hindi

mycah shes really nice although i know she hates it when people thinks it a both name to tell the truth itd a unisex name nov 10 2009my oldest sons name is micah i got it from the bible and just love it ive never met another micah i agree it is difficult to find little trinkets with his name on it but thats alright i cant imagine him named anything else oct 24 2009i named my daughter micah pronounced meeka i have some friends who are israeli so i asked them about the pronunciation etc since its a hewbrew name they told me it should be pronounced meeka not myka in the same way they or latinbased languages would say meekal versus mycool for michaelor michelle which is not pronounced myshell i asked them about the translation to english and they told me a boy would always be micah but for a girl it would probably be mikah regardless its a great name oct 21 2009we plan on naming our baby boy micah we have a layla and jesse micah sounds perfect oct 19 2009comment left dec 13 2007 micah is a boys name its in the bible as a boy so i dont know why people think its a girls name its such a masculine name why would anyone name a girl that its just ugly as a girls name you might as well name her fred or george i wholeheartedly agree with this comment anyone who has ever picked up a bible knows micah is a male name micah was a powerful prophet and was definitely a man it really bugs me when people burden their kids with names without researching the meaning behind them jun 23 2009my beautiful son is named micah he will be 19 nineteen yrs old in december  people always love his name god has great plans for his life i know this is true may 28 2009my daughter is mc kenna but we are always calling her micah so we have decidewd to change it mckenna is sooo close to her sister mackenzie even though she is only 75 months we call ken and they both look may 5 2009i have a little chihuahua and her name is micah everyone said thats a boys name i said sure its after the prophet micah in the bible but ive always liked that name well im not married and have no kids so when i got a dog i named her micah shes the best feb 19 2009my name is micah and im a girl some people who think it is more of a boys name that doesnt sound right to me and i get really mad when i look at baby names websites and it says boy instead of both my opinion is that micah fits a girl better so if there was a edit thing on those websites i would change it to girl or at least both my dad named me that after this woman he met at a pizza place and she worked there with my dad and his friends they were about 15 or 16 then and she was maybe in her 20s or 30s and she didnt call them dumb little boys like some other girls did he decided that if he ever had a girl he would name her micah they even had my brother before me and didnt even think about naming him micah people always misspell my name as micha and im like omg my name isnt mitchah it is myecah once someone spelled it like micaiah but it is usually like micha jan 29 2009my daughter was born in 2003 were irish i christened her micah but we always spelt it as meeka people always comment on her name younger people like it older people not so much shes 5 now and loves her name and its a lovely name to listen to when other people call her its nice as boy or girl nov 1 2008we are hoping for a girl next and plan on naming her micah oct 19 2008my daughters name is micah as well everybody loves her name  oct 7 2008we named our daughter micah and loved the name it is unusual and when you call it not many turn around oct 2

jun 2 2008i like lauren have had visions that god has given me telling me to name my first born son micah i love the name and will listen to what god wants me to do i believe that there are names that are given that are more pleasing to god than others and i think micah is one of them mar 31 2008i like lauren have had visions that god has given me telling me to name my first born son micah i love the name and will listen to what god wants me to do i believe that there are names that are given that are more pleasing to god than others and i think micah is one of them mar 31 2008my name is micah and im a girl i have been told that it is a very pretty name guys are not pretty and so i believe the name micah suits and girl better i also believe it is sexist to say that micah is a guys name only i understand that micah the prophet was a guy but who cares i was named micah because i am japanese and jewish and it is the same in both languages in japanese micah means beautiful fragrance or divine plus micah sounds ugly as a boys name its like naming a boy kate or belle mar 25 2008our micah is a very girly girlbut she is tough and smart and such a leader i dont like sissy names for girls can you see a misty emily or susie as a future ceo and why would you want to be in class with 4 other ashleys and 3 other katelins and a few kaylas my micah is an original not a duplicate feb 11 2008my name is miycah and everyone spells it micah or mycah it is frusturating feb 1 2008this is my name and i love it the only difference is that i do not have a h on the end mica its rare that i meet other women with the name but i think that makes it unique futhermore the name has a great meaning feb 1 2008micah is a boys name its in the bible as a boy so i dont know why people think its a girls name its such a masculine name why would anyone name a girl that its just ugly as a girls name you might as well name her fred or george dec 13 2007i am 16 years old  i have been dreaming about a baby boy for quite some time now i am not planning on one anytime soon but i believe god has giving me dreams and visions of this boy assuming he is  going to be my son later on micah is both

deo x aug 26 2007we named our now 5 month old daughter micah we like the name because it is androgynous and biblical weve found that most young parents love the name however some older family members and friends obviously find it strange we love it and hopefully she will too aug 6 2007i am going to have a baby and wanted a unisex name to get use to my husbands name is michael it is not common but

perfectly i could not imagine her with any other name jul 24 20054 negative commentsbible or not this is a buttugly name in english sounds more feminine than masculine in english due to the ah ending but whatever its still butt lots of boys names get comandeered as girls names some so much so that weve lost track that they were originally boys names ashley lesley etc another annoying trend is to give a girl a surname as her first name if thats a family tradition great but when you think its cute and unique to call your baby daughter mac kenzie or madison its neither cute nor remotely unique two of the poppiest names of the last 20 years dec 10 2013only a complete idiot would name a girl micah pick up a bible people jul 22 2009i hate my stupid name i dont want it its ugly and disgusting

where i turn there is a baby or child named micah the ah at the end of the name can make it feminine and i have never felt that it was strictly a boy or girls name who ever said they would change their babys name cause of other please dont that is your child sep 30 2012my name is micah and im a 13 year old girl i agree its a boys name and i hate it because of that it is unique but i definitely
