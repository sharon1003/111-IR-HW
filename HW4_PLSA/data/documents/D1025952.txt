enzyme therapy and cancer by nicholas gonzalez m d the embryologist dr john beard proposed in 1906 that pancreatic proteolytic digestive enzymes represent the bodys main defense against cancer and that enzyme therapy would be useful as a treatment for all types of cancer 1 particularly during the first two decades of the twentieth century dr beards thesis attracted some attention in academic circles and several case reports in the medical literature documented tumor regression and even remission in terminal cancer patients treated with proteolytic enzymes 26 in 1911 dr beard published a monograph entitled the enzyme therapy of cancer and its scientific basis which summarized his therapy and the supporting evidence 7 in my book the trophoblast and the origins of cancer coauthored with my colleague dr linda l isaacs i review dr beards work from the perspective of contemporary molecular biology after dr beards death in 1923 the enzyme therapy was largely forgotten periodically other practitioners have rediscovered dr beards work and used pancreatic proteolytic enzymes as an alternative cancer treatment 8dr beard believed the enzymes had to be injected to prevent destruction by hydrochloric acid in the stomach however recent evidence demonstrates that orally ingested pancreatic proteolytic enzymes are acidstable 9 pass intact into the small intestine and are absorbed through the intestinal mucosa into the blood stream as part of an enteropancreatic recycling process 1011i began researching the use of oral pancreatic proteolytic enzyme therapy as a treatment for cancer after completion of my second year at cornell university medical college in 1981 at that time i had the opportunity to meet dr william donald kelley the texas dentist who for twenty years had been treating cancer patients with a complicated nutritional therapy based on beardâï¿½ï¿½s enzyme treatment although kelley had been attacked in the press because of the unorthodox nature of his work the dr kelley i met was an unassuming man whose primary wish was to have his controversial work fairly evaluated by the academic medical world i thought his request reasonable my research advisor at cornell dr robert a good at the time president of sloankettering agreed to support a case review of kelleys patients which i continued despite the rigors of third year medical school during my fourth year at cornell i was given a considerable block of time under dr goods direction to investigate kelleys work and results in a more structured manner eventually what began as a student project developed into a twoyear formal research effort which i pursued during my formal immunology training during my study i reviewed nearly 10000 of dr kelleys patient records i interviewed and evaluated intensively over 500 patients with appropriately diagnosed advanced cancer and summarized my findings in an extended monograph completed in 1986 as partial fulfillment for my fellowship training this monograph entitled one man alone an investigation of nutrition cancer and william donald kelley is now available through new spring press or on amazon the written report consisted of several sections in addition to outlining kelleys theoretical approach i discussed at length 50 of his patients initially diagnosed with 26 different types of poor prognosis cancer all of whom had enjoyed longterm survival andor apparent regression of disease while following their nutritional regimen as a separate chapter i also evaluated all cases of unresectable pancreatic cancer both compliant and noncompliant who had come to see kelley between 1974 and 1982 i eventually identified 22 patients in this group for all of these patients i obtained complete medical records including death certificates for those who were deceased i interviewed all surviving patients repeatedly and at length and in the case of those who had died i interviewed family members as well as the original attending physicians ten of these patients had visited kelley only once and had never followed the protocol these individuals had been discouraged from proceeding largely because of the negative influence of family and physicians who thought kelley to be an outright fraud this population with a median survival of only 60 days served as a convenient control among the remaining 12 patients i found a number who had survived far beyond what would be expected for the disease including one patient with pancreatic cancer to the liver who had when last contacted been alive over twenty years from her original diagnosis  discoveries in medicine reviewdespite the careful documentation and the fiveyear investment of time no one in academic medicine could at the time accept that a nutritional therapy might produce positive results with advanced cancer patients in 1986 probably as a result of endless pressures dr kelley gave up research and patient care and i myself did not speak to him or any of his associates after 1987 he passed away in january 2005  obituary of dr kelley in 1987 i decided to move to new york to try and salvage the enzyme approach and observe for myself the results with poor prognosis cancer patients my goal throughout has been to generate research support so that this method if it indeed proved to have value could be integrated into general medical treatment in july of 1993 the then associate director for the cancer therapy evaluation program at the national cancer institute invited me to present selected cases from my own practice as part of an nci effort to evaluate nontraditional cancer therapies dr isaacs and i prepared for presentation 25 cases representing a variety of poor prognosis or terminal malignancies who had either enjoyed long term survival or tumor regression while following my program  nih newsletter description included in my presentation were patients diagnosed with advanced breast lung prostate and other cancers after the session the associate director suggested we pursue a pilot study of our methods in ten patients suffering inoperable adenocarcinoma of the pancreas with survival as the endpoint he suggested pancreatic cancer because the standard survival for the disease is so poor and an effect could be seen in a small number of patients in a short period of time in fact i was told that if three of ten patients lived a year that would be considered a positive result nestec the nestle corporation agreed to fund the trial which began in january 1994 the study has been completed and was published in the june 1999 issue volume 33 number 2 of nutrition and cancer of 11 patients followed in the trial 8 of 11 suffered stage iv disease nine of 11 81 lived one year 5 of 11 lived two years 45 4 of 11 lived three years 36 and two lived longer than four years in comparison in a trial of the drug gemcitabine of 126 patients with pancreatic cancer not a single patient lived longer than 19 months 12  abstract of nutrition and cancer articlesubsequently the national cancer institute in conjunction with the national center for complementary and alternative medicine approved funding for a largescale controlled trial evaluating our approach against chemotherapy again in patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer unfortunately despite our initial enthusiasm for the project ultimately it was ineptly managed by the academicians involved the supervisory personnel at columbia admitted multiple patients into the nutritional arm of the study whom we believed failed to meet the very specific entry requirements and who for the most part were far too sick to comply with our treatment our multiple complaints were largely ignored finally at our request the office of human research protection an investigative arm of the national institutes of health launched a full scale investigation of those in charge at columbia after more than two years the ohrp determined that the columbia staff had inappropriately approved 42 of the total of 62 patients entered into the studyâ more recently the food and drug administration fda completed its own investigation of the project confirming my allegations of mismanagement my book what went wrong exposes in detail the truth behind this clinical study a brief summary of the problems with the trial can be found by clicking here in addition to these clinical trials we have collaborated with basic science researchers to test our enzyme approach in animal models of pancreatic cancer in may 2004 the results of these studies were published in the peerreviewed journal pancreas in these experiments a very aggressive form of pancreatic cancer was induced in mice then half the animals were given our pancreas product half were given no therapy those treated with our pancreas product showed a significant improvement in survival and behavior compared to animals not receiving the enzymes in a second experiment tumor growth was substantially reduced and survival prolonged again in animals receiving the pancreas product 13  abstract of article on enzyme therapy in mice we want to emphasize that the results were particularly significant for a first attempt since the investigators were using only the pancreas product part of our program and did not use a variety of doses to determine the most optimal for a mouse as the principal investigator of the study wrote in the conclusion of the article “in summary ppe porcine pancreatic enzyme is the first experimentally and clinically proven agent for the effective treatment of pc pancreatic cancer the significant advantages of ppe over any other currently available therapeutic modalities include its effects on physical condition nutrition and lack of toxicity”in addition to the financial support from nestle from 19951998 procter  gamble invested considerable resources helping us refine our therapy you can review statements of support from pierre guesry m d former vice president for research at nestle and j p jones ph d the retired vice president for health care at pg in january 2007 we published a lengthy article about our results in the peer reviewed journal alternative therapies in health and medicine 14 here dr gonzalez discussed 36 patients diagnosed with a variety of advanced and poor prognosis cancer who responded to his treatment with exceptional survival and in many cases evidence of tumor reduction these cases and more have now been published in the two volume book series conquering cancer please subscribe to our announcement list for updates on book projects dr gonzalez prescribed and in the pilot study and in the animal experiments he used a formulation of pancreas product made to his strict specifications in his experience quality manufacturing methods and composition vary widely among commercially available preparations of pancreas product andor proteolytic enzymes the results of his studies cannot be used as validation for any other product whether obtained from a health food store a pharmacy or an internet source although his published research deals with pancreatic cancer in his office he treated patients with all types of cancers he also treated patients with a variety of other problems ranging from chronic fatigue syndrome to multiple sclerosis each treatment protocol was individualized for each patient regardless of the underlying problem the gonzalez protocol itself is quite complex but basically involves three components diet aggressive supplementation with nutrients and pancreas product containing naturally occurring enzymes and detoxification the protocols are individualized and each patient receives a diet designed for his or her specific needs the diets are quite variable ranging from a pure vegetarian program to a diet requiring fatty red meat 23 times a day the supplement regimens are also individualized and intense each cancer patient consumes between 130 and 175 capsules daily noncancer patients will require considerably fewer supplements per day the supplement regimens include a range of vitamins minerals trace elements antioxidants and animal glandular products prescribed according to the particular patients needs and cancer type these nutrients do not have a direct anticancer effect but instead serve to improve overall metabolic function in addition to these supplements every cancer patient takes large quantities of pancreas product in capsule form which he believed provided the main anticancer action the animal glandular products and pancreas product that he used are derived from animals raised in australia and new zealand where there has been no history of bse mad cow disease or other prion diseases such as scrapie the animal husbandry regulations in australia and new zealand are the strictest in the world and prohibit the feeding practices that have caused problems in other countries the third component of the protocol involves what he called “detoxification” routines on this therapy he found that as patients repair and rebuild large amounts of metabolic wastes and stored toxins are released as a result patients routinely develop a variety of symptoms most commonly described as “flulike” such as low grade fevers muscle aches and pains even rashes that we hypothesize result from low grade tumor lysis “detoxification” refers to procedures such as the coffee enema which are believed by alternative practitioners to enhance liver function and in turn the processing and excretion of metabolic wastes the coffee enemas are done twice daily and patients most commonly report symptomatic relief  click here for dr isaacs article about these procedures coffee enemas have been discussed in the orthodox medical literature for the better part of this century many nursing texts routinely recommended coffee enemas 15 and the merck manual advocated coffee enemas as a stimulant in all editions from the first in 1898 through 1977 during the 1920s and 30s coffee enemas were prescribed for a variety of conditions 1620 in terms of their physiological effect studies have shown that the rectal instillation of fluids will stimulate gallbladder contraction and emptying 21of the hundreds of kelley patients i interviewed during my research study virtually every one reported significant symptomatic relief from the enemas in his own practice patients repeatedly reported the same improved wellbeing and relief of symptoms after a coffee enema the enemas in his experience appear to be safe he had yet to document a single serious side effect either in the thousands of kelley patients he evaluated or in his own practice however dr gonzalez did not encourage anyone to attempt coffee enemas except under the care of a knowledgeable physician for further information you may wish to order a book or a lecture recording recordings of lectures given by dr gonzalez over the years to both lay and professional groups are available and provide more intensive explanations of the program various audio recordings of dr gonzalez are available on this web site for periodic updates about the
