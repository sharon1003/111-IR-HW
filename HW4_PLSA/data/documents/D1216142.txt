data warehouse purpose and objective why is data warehouse needed data warehouse is designed to meet some business needs which is transaction system cannot do and vice versa the big question is on why we have to create a datawarehouse the reasons are as follows as a starter lets say you want to know the monthly variations in 3 months running average on your customer balances over last twelve months grouped by products channels customer segments lets see why do you need a datawarehouse for this purpose keeping analysisreporting and production separate if you run the abovesaid query on your production systems you will find that it will lock all your tables and will eatup most of your resources as it will be accessing a lot of data doing a lot of calculations this results in the production work to come to a virtual halt imagine hundreds of such abovesaid queries running at the same time on your production systems reporting and analysis work typically access data across the database tables whereas production work typically accesses specific customer or product or channel record at a point of time thatâ€™s why it is important to have the information generation work to be done from an offline platform aka data warehouse purpose of data warehouse is to keep analysisreporting nonproduction use data separate from production data information integration from multiple systems single point source for information as an example  lets say you have different systems for say a loan product vs credit card product the abovesaid query if run on production will need to pick the data on real time basis from these systems this will make the query extremely slow and will need to do connects in the intermediate tables or in runtime memory moreover it will not be a reliable result as at a particular point of time the databases may not be in synch as many of such synching happen in the end of day batch runs dw purpose for data consistency and quality organizations are riddled with tens of important systems from which their information comes each of these systems may carry the information in different formats and also may be having out of synch information different customer id formats mismatch in the supplier statuses by bringing the data from these disparate sources at a common place one can effectively undertake to bring the uniformity and consistency in data refer to cleansing and data transformation  high response time production databases are tuned to expected transaction load even if you run the abovesaid query on an offline database it will take a lot of time on the database design which is same as that of production this is because the production databases are created to cater to production work in production systems there is some level of expected intensity for different kind of actions therefore the indexing and normalization and other design considerations are for given transaction loads however the datawarehouse has to be ready for fairly unexpected loads and type of queries which demands a high degree of flexibility and quick response time high response time normalized data vs dimensional modeling productionsource system database are typically normalized to enable integrity and nonredundancy of data this kind of design is fine for transactions which involved few records at a time however for large analysis and mining queries the response time in normalized databases will be slow given the joins that have to be created data warehouse objective of providing an adaptive and flexible source of information its easier for users to define the production work and functionalities they want but difficult to define the analysis they need the analysis needs keep on changing and datawarehouse has the capabilities to adapt quickly to the changing requirements please refer to dimension modelingestablish the foundation for decision support decisioning process of an organization will involve analysis data mining forecasting decision modeling etc by having a common point which can provide consistent quality data with high response time provides the core enabler for making fast and informed decisions
