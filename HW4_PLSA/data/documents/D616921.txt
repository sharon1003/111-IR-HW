georges danton in full georgesjacques danton born october 26 1759 arcissuraube france—died april 5 1794 paris french revolutionary leader and orator often credited as the chief force in the overthrow of the monarchy and the establishment of the first french republic september 21 1792 he later became the first president of the committee of public safety but his increasing moderation and eventual opposition to the reign of terror led to his own death at the guillotine early years danton was the son of jacques danton an attorney and his second wife mariemadeleine camus after attending school in champagne danton was from 1773 educated by the oratorians at troyes after obtaining his law degree in 1784 at reims he went to paris to practice and in 1787 bought the office of advocate in the conseil du roi council with legislative and judicial functions he then married antoinette charpentier at the outbreak of the revolution in july 1789 danton enrolled in the garde bourgeoise civic guard of the cordeliers district and was elected president of the district in october in the spring of 1790 with some militants from his district he founded the popular association that was to become famous as the cordeliers club so far however danton’s fame had been merely local elected a member of the provisional paris commune city council in january 1790 he was excluded from the council in its final form in september although elected administrator of the département of paris in january 1791 he actually exercised no influence on that body meanwhile however danton shone at the cordeliers club and at another political association the jacobin club before both of which he frequently made speeches during 1791 during the crisis following louis xvi’s attempt to leave the country in june he became increasingly prominent in the revolutionary movement his signature however does not appear on the famous petition of the cordeliers demanding the abdication of louis xvi that on july 17 resulted in the massacre of some of the petitioners by the national guard during the repression following these events danton took refuge in london he returned to paris to take part in the elections to the legislative assembly as elector for the théâtre français section and in december 1791 he was elected second assistant to the procureur public prosecutor of the paris commune during the national crisis in the spring of 1792 war was declared on austria on april 20 danton resumed his role of tribune of the people on june 18 he attacked the marquis de lafayette an adviser of the king and a general for using his position to play politics yet he took no part in the demonstrations before the royal palace of the tuileries on june 20 although his part in the overthrow of the monarchy by the insurrection of august 10 1792 remains obscure he was largely credited with its success the overthrow of the monarchy speaking before the revolutionary tribunal danton boasted that he had “been responsible for” the events of august 10 that insurrection however was not the result of the efforts of danton or any other man but rather the collective act of obscure militants from all over the city however small a part he played in removing the king he was elected minister of justice by the legislative assembly though not officially its president danton dominated his colleagues by his strength of character the aura of his revolutionary past and his ability to make swift decisions when the news arrived that longwy had been taken by the invading armies prussia had allied itself with austria in july on august 25 1792 and jeanmarie roland minister of the interior proposed that the government should move from paris to blois danton objected vigorously the proclamation he then caused the executive council to adopt bears his stamp it was a summons to battle on the morning of september 2 when it was learned that verdun was besieged and while the populace broke into the prisons to search for suspects and traitors danton in the legislative assembly delivered the most famous of his speeches “to conquer the enemies of the fatherland we need daring more daring daring now and always and france is saved”the massacres of september 1792while danton was delivering this speech the prison massacres began for which the girondins the moderate wing of the revolution charged danton with responsibility there is no proof however that the massacres were organized by him or by anyone else though it is certain that he did nothing to stop them just as in the case of the august insurrection the september massacre was not the act of one man but of the people of paris on september 6 danton was elected deputy for paris to the national convention he immediately made every effort to end all the disputes between the revolutionary parties but his policy of conciliation was thwarted by the gironde which demanded that he render an accounting when he left his post as minister of justice danton could not justify 200000 livres of secret expenditures he emerged from this conflict embittered and with his political prestige diminished sent on a mission to belgium danton took no part in the opening of louis xvi’s trial in the convention he was present however on january 15 1793 and voted for death without reprieve although absent from the trial danton had played a part in it since the autumn of 1792 according to the mémoires of théodore comte de lameth a former revolutionary danton wanted to spare the king it seems that having failed despite strenuous efforts to gain the support of the girondins danton plotted with general charlesfrançois du périer dumouriez to obtain the intervention of the english government by bribery only when the plan miscarried did he vote for the death of the king danton remained in the mainstream of the revolution not without often engaging in intrigue his dealings with dumouriez who commanded the army of belgium have never been clarified after the defeat of neerwinden march 18 1793 when dumouriez went over to the austrians the gironde accused danton of complicity with the general boldly turning the tables danton made the same accusation against the girondins the break was irreparable danton’s committee of public safety on april 7 1793 danton became a member of the first committee of public safety which created the previous day became the executive organ of the revolutionary government for three months danton was effectively the head of the government charged especially with the conduct of foreign affairs and military matters during this second period in the government he pursued a policy of compromise and negotiation he tried in every direction to enter into diplomatic conversations with the enemy no doubt he could in all honesty think it useful to negotiate in an attempt to dissolve the allied coalition or even to obtain a general peace by the spring of 1793 however a policy of negotiation was no longer conceivable it was useless to try to disarm the enemy by concessions when he was victorious on july 10 when the committee of public safety’s term expired the convention elected a new committee without danton leader of the moderate opposition from that time danton’s political conduct became more complex on various occasions he supported the policy of the committee of public safety though at the same time refusing to play a part in it—which would have stabilized the political situation danton still reappeared from time to time as the tribune of the people voicing the demands of the masses he quickly showed however that he sought to stabilize the revolutionary movement very soon—whether he wanted it or not—he appeared as the leader of the indulgents the moderate faction that had risen out of the cordeliers during the great parisian popular demonstrations of september 4 and 5 1793 danton spoke eloquently in favour of all the popular demands yet at the same time he tried to set bounds to the movement and keep it under control he demanded for instance that the meetings of the hitherto permanent sectional assemblies be reduced to two per week disapproval of terror danton’s moderate position became more marked in the autumn of 1793 he did not however intervene personally but left it to his friends to criticize the policy of the government his disapproval of the terrorist repression had become so strong that he withdrew from political life alleging reasons of health or of family of the girondins he is reported to have said to a friend at the beginning of october 1793 “i shall not be able to save them” and to have burst into tears on october 12 he obtained leave from the convention and left for his native town he returned on november 21 although the reasons for his return remain ambiguous danton at once resumed political activity he vigorously supported the committee of public safety against excesses of the antichristian movement and later opposed the abolition of the salaries of constitutional priests and hence the separation of church and state danton’s support of the governmental policy of stabilization was doubtless not without ulterior motives both personal and political he was determined to save friends of his who had been arrested or who were in danger of arrest but he also wanted to slow the revolutionary drive of the government the dantonist policy was opposed in all points to the program of popular extremism supported by jacques hébert and his cordeliers friends extreme terror war to the hilt danton defined his moderate political line on december 1 1793 when he informed the revolutionary radicals that their role was ended from then on whether such had been his intention or not he was looked upon as the leader of the moderate opposition at the beginning of 1794 danton and his friends took an even more critical attitude with the revolutionary journalist camille desmoulins of le vieux cordelier serving as their spokesman they were challenging not only the system of the terror of robespierre but the whole policy of the revolutionary government while awakening the hopes of the opponents of the regime once the government realized it could not allow itself to be overwhelmed from the right however the tide turned abruptly when fabre d’églantine the dramatist and zealous revolutionary compromised in the affair of the compagnie des indes was arrested in january 1794 danton tried to defend him obliquely by demanding that the arrested deputies should be judged before the people “woe unto him who sat beside fabre and who is still his dupe” cried a deputy clearly threatening danton himself the incident signalled more than the defeat of the offensive of the indulgents for already compromised they were themselves soon threatened by the counteroffensive of their adversaries hébert’s ultraleft faction the exagérés or enragés when the crisis however became more acute and the exagéré opposition hardened its position the government lost its patience in march 1794 hébert and the principal cordeliers leaders were arrested sentenced to death they were executed on march 24 the indulgents believing that their hour had come increased their pressure the government however had no intention of letting itself be overwhelmed by the moderate opposition of the right warned several times of the threats that hung over him danton remained unafraid “they will not dare” finally during the night of march 29–30 1794 he and his friends were arrested trial of danton before the revolutionary tribunal danton boldly spoke his mind to silence him the convention decreed that a suspect on trial who insulted national justice be excluded from the debate “i will no longer defend myself” danton cried “let me be led to death i shall go to sleep in glory” danton was guillotined with his friends on april 5 1794 “show my head to the people” he said to the executioner “it is worth the trouble”legacy denigrated during the first half of the 19th century danton was rehabilitated under the second empire and enshrined as a hero under the third republic a chief controversy about him is the problem of his wealth and hence of his venality to his contemporaries danton’s venality was obvious even though for lack of documentation it was not proved during his lifetime it is now generally accepted that danton was used as an informer by the court and that in return he received payments from the funds of the civil list at the same time however his attachment to the nation and to the revolutionary cause is beyond doubt danton was a leader of men more than any other revolutionary leader he could enter into communion with the sansculottes—the revolutionary havenots—to share their passions he pleased the people by his generosity his indulgence his verve all these were characteristics that won him the sympathy of the people and that during the crisis of the summer of 1792 enabled him to serve the revolution
