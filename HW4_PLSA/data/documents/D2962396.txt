home renewable energy renewable energy renewable energy is energy from naturally replenished sources unlike fossil fuels which are exhaustible renewable energy can be used again and again in 2010 about 10 of u s electricity was generated from renewable resources some of the most common renewable energy sources are solar wind geothermal hydropower and biomass following is a brief description of each solar is the conversion of sunlight into electricity by either solar photovoltaic pv panels or solar thermal systems solar pv panels are what you may see on the roof of someone’s house these panels collect the solar power and convert it directly into electricity using photovoltaic cells solar thermal systems utilize the sun to heat some sort of liquid which is then used to produce steam that can operate a turbine and produce electricity wind is used to turn the blades of a wind turbine this movement drives a shaft that connects to a generator producing electricity geothermal systems utilize heat from within the earth’s core this heat is used to heat water or to create steam which as with a solar thermal system can operate a turbine to produce electricity hydropower systems use the movement of water to operate a turbine creating electricity hydropower is currently the largest and least expensive source of renewable electricity produced in the united states large– and smallscale hydropower projects are most commonly used by cleanpower generators to produce electricity biomass is organic material from plants or animals that can be burned for heat can be digested to produce methane which in turn can be used to generate electricity or can be fermented to produce fuels biomass should not be mistaken for a cleanenergy source while cleaner than most fossil fuels it still produces sulphur dioxide during electricity production wood energy is also categorized as biomass as it is renewable and is burned during electricity production shopping for a renewable energy supplier when shopping for your competitive generation supplier on the papower switch website you have the opportunity to learn which companies offer renewable energy services if you click on “shop for electricity” and enter your zip code a list of suppliers offering competitive generation service in your area will appear on the righthand side next to each company name is a category called “renewable energy” if there is a checkmark located underneath this heading the company does offer renewable sources suppliers have the ability to enter the percentage of renewable power in their energy portfolio along with where the power comes from pennsylvania regional or outside region the term regional means that the suppliers renewable energy source is found in all or parts of the following states delaware illinois indiana kentucky maryland michigan new jersey north carolina ohio pennsylvania tennessee virginia west virginia and the district of columbia additionally at the bottom of the page is a list of renewable energy addon options please note that the offers made by these companies are available as additions to your current electric supply purchase selecting one of these plans means the charge for the plan will be added to your monthly bill pennsylvania’s alternative energy portfolio standards aepspennsylvania’s alternative energy portfolio standards aeps has produced policies designed to increase electricity generation from renewable resources aeps requires each electric distribution company edc and electric generation supplier egs providing retail electric services to customers in pennsylvania to supply 18 of that service using alternative energy resources by 2020 pennsylvania’s standard provides for a solar setaside mandating that a certain percentage of electricity be generated by solar photovoltaic pv systems in other words solar panels pennsylvania’s aeps also includes demand side management waste coal coalmine methane and coal gasification as eligible technologies smart metering is one key component in effective demand side management smart meter technology helps to reliably and efficiently integrate renewable energy such as solar and wind energy into the electric grid for additional information on smart meters go to the ways to save energy page the aeps website provides a portal for the application and registration of alternative energy facilities that qualify for the aeps program alternative energy and economic development alternative energy at home links renewable energy for kids the federal government through the energy information association has developed the following “energy kids” website for young people that can be a useful resource when it comes to understanding energy and more specifically renewable energy choose pawind an initiative to encourage energy consumers in pennsylvania to power their businesses and homes with energy from pa wind farms
