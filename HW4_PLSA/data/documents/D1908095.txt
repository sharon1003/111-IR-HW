introduction the first meeting with a caterer is like a first date you want to talk about yourself but you also want to listen youll need to reveal how you want your wedding to feel then find out what kind of style the caterer has think about weddings you have attended and describe what you liked and what you didnt ask her to show you her book which should contain photographs and give you a good idea of her skills then if it seems a relationship might develop ask the caterer about weddings she has handled and tell her about your favorite foods cookbooks and restaurants avoid having a detailed menu discussion at this first meeting and concentrate instead on the feeling you want to create do you envision a casual reception with lots of dancing or an elegant seated dinner discuss costs dont be afraid to say what your budget is says sascha wolhandler owner of saschas gourmet catering in baltimore caterers should give you suggestions but remember you are paying and you are in control she counsels also be sure to read your caterers letters of reference and take numbers so you can call former clients too once youre committed the most basic decision youll need to make is about food presentation the four options are seated buffet station and cocktail service the classic seated meal features several served courses and it is usually preceded by a cocktail hour wedding traditions such as the formal presentation of the married couple are most fluidly incorporated into this format the service costs are highest for a seated meal restricting the use of expensive ingredients such as caviar and crab to hors doeuvres can help to offset the price for a buffet meal guests assemble their own plates of food but most caterers will supply staff to serve at the buffet table if your guest list grows to more than fifty your caterer should set up duplicate buffet tables a buffet may start with a served first course which will offer some structure for toasts and a first dance and can provide a smooth transition from the cocktail hour to the meal as well the station reception features several food areas each with a theme and gives guests many choices a meatcarving station that includes roasted potatoes and caesar salad might be offered at one while fresh pasta might be available at another if you choose this style of service plan on at least three stations plus one for dessert at a cocktail reception hors doeuvres are passed and often served at stations this allows the most time for mingling but is not well suited to wedding rituals once youve decided on the format its time to talk turkey  or beef or fish most caterers encourage clients to get personal holly safford of the catered affair in hingham massachusetts says many couples become cautious when they should be assertive and show their personalities she warns that a meal designed to appeal to everyone may end up being bland personalizing the menu may be as simple as serving your grandmothers treasured lace cookies with coffee at the meals end to keep costs down consider the service needs serve as much room temperature food as possible says san francisco bayarea caterer paula le duc of paula le duc fine catering because hot foods must be plated and served within minutes they require more staff some caterers offer a tasting that allows clients to sample dishes on their menu a tasting lets us adjust foods change a sauce or refine a recipe says peggy dark of the kitchen for exploring foods in pasadena california anyone who helps to pay for the reception should have initial input but only the couple need attend the tasting most caterers designate an event manager to help coordinate the florist musicians and waitstaff he or she should also be present make a plan with your event manager listing everything that will happen from the time the caterer arrives until the last glass is packed away decide on a serving time for each course and a start and end time for the party catering charges can vary quite a bit because each company has a different way of evaluating costs most caterers estimate food costs per person which can range from 25 for a cocktail party to 100 or more for a seated dinner to this most caterers then add the approximate cost for the staff either an hourly rate or a flat fee rentals beverages and cake some caterers include some or all of these charges in the food cost others dont there is some latitude with beverages you can serve just champagne and sparkling water and rentals silver costs more than stainless steel but service costs are pretty much fixed purchasing your own wine and liquor though can save you hundreds of dollars request a shopping list from your caterer based on the number of guests ask about staff overtime charges taxes and gratuities some caterers add 15 or 17 percent to cover tips as well as some overhead this can add thousands of dollars to the bill if your caterer does not add a gratuity keep in mind that for an eighthour event the average staff person might get a tip of 30 to 50 the event coordinator would get more also some companies charge a perperson fee for slicing any cake they do not provide finally get everything in writing most caterers will ask you to sign a letter of agreement or a contract this contract should be very specific detailing everything from the exact menu to the total charges for rentals and staff at this point many caterers will ask for a deposit of up to 50 percent with the remaining balance due the day of the event other caterers demand 80 or 90 percent of the fee when you provide the final head count the remaining charges which may fluctuate based on the length of the party and the amount of liquor consumed are billed after the wedding one last tip ask your caterer to pack food for you for after the wedding a boxed meal will be quite welcome when its two in the morning and you realize youve been so busy greeting guests that you havent eaten a thing all day hiring a
