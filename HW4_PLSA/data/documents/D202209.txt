how to grill perfect skewers kabobs or kebabsshare 4 pin 732 tweet736kebabs kabobs skewers… anyway you look at it it’s food on a stick plain and simple however getting your skewers to be “perfect” isn’t that easy i’ve eaten plenty of dry and burned skewered things in my lifetime it’s summer summer means lots of barbecue for us why because cooking “heats up the house” as my husband puts it it does… and i like to cook – a lot confession i love to make lunch and i love to cook breakfast night … but the rest i just “like” where were we oh yes grilling confession 2 our grill is over 15 years old it’s a hand me down webber from my mom i’ve had it for nearly 10 years and it was at least 5 year old before i got it i’ve replaced nearly every part and i now have to use one of those long lighters to get it going… but it works so what’s the trick to the perfect skewer i’m going to tell you all of these tips are gathered from numerous trips to the butcher whom i used to nag every time my skewers didn’t turn out good ikidyounot if this is your first time here know that i have a thing about good food i don’t mean gourmet food i mean good family food that fits my budget and everyone will eat oh i also don’t do short order cooking –anymore i’m recovering the key to great grilling is practice keep grilling all summer long seriously that’s basically what the butcher keeps telling me and somehow i keep listening you can grill just about anything veggies fruits corn on the cob pizza meat fish… you name it the grill can handle it here are some tips for better skewers preheat the grill to a constant temperature before placing your skewers on it somewhere around 375 is great cut your meats and veggies in similar shape and size so they cook evenly cut your meats and veggies bigger than the space between the grills wooden planks need to be soaked submerged in water for about 30 minutes beforehand so they don’t burn wooden skewers need to be soaked as well for “restaurant style crosshatch marks” wait until the grate leaves a set of lines before rotating the skewers 90 degrees brush your kebab pieces with olive oil or vegetable oil before placing them on the grill since you are turning your meats and vegetables remember to leave the skewers about the same time on the grill for each side grilling consistently over medium heat is better than over high heat you’ll get tough burned or even scorched pieces that way over 400 is a nono cooking times meats will take 1215 minutes total fish about 10 and veggies about 810 depending on thickness corn on the cob tip i soak my corn husks for at least 30minutes and place the whole thing on my grill husks and all if i want grill marks on my corn i open the husk and “painton” some olive oil before grilling other grilling tips eggplant cut eggplant lengthwise into 1 12 inch wedges brush them with olive oil and place on grill cut side down grill over mediumhigh heat for about 3 minutes until they are golden flip and grill each additional side for 56 minutes bell peppers i like to grill whole bell peppers over high heat and turning them occasionally it’s ok if the skins get charred in certain spots medium to large bell peppers about 15 minutes after grilling peel away charred skin get rid of the seeds and stems and keep the meat part of your pepper portobello mushrooms although i am not a fan my guests do like these puppies marinate them or brush them with olive oil prior to grilling grill mushrooms gill sides up over mediumlow heat for about 15 minutes and flip over for an additional 12 minutes asparagus if you don’t have one of those veggie mesh cages you can just use a wooden or metal skewer to poke your asparagus through this way they won’t fall between the grates poke them through the top 13 and bottom 13 like making an asparagus pontoon and grill for about 9 minutes flipping half way onions cut onions in 12 to 38 inch thick slices poke through with a skewer and grill each onion skewer for about 15 minutes flip and cook through for a final 23 minutes zucchini  squash these are my favorite veggies to grill i cut them in fourths brush them with olive oil and seasoning and grill for about 68 minutes potatoes did you know you have to cook potatoes before grilling them otherwise your potatoes will need to go on the grill for about an hour i cook my small potatoes until tender rinse and
