quarters in either pcgs or ngc i was wondering what grading service is the best out of the two im only 17 years old and gonna keep this set for many years so what service will have the best resellrobster16 aug 16 2005 1  quote reply guest user guest log in or sign upto hide this ad speedy researching coins supporter ngc will have the better gradebut it has been proven that when selling it seems that pcgs sells higherbut i would go for the ngcbetter grade is better all around speedy speedy aug 16 2005 2  quote reply midas coin hoarder sorry speedyhave to disagree i find that ngc is more liberal with proof coins than pcgs look especially at 69s and 70 grades ngc tends to hand out the holy 70 grail grade way more oftennot as much as icg but far less than pcgs how many 70 grades is too much or just right pcgs and ngc are both respected leaders of the third partied grading the question also came up as to what service will have the best resell all things being equal a quick example i looked up completed auctions in e bay for a 1998 pr69dcam silver eagle 1 ultra cam for ngc these took place over the last 7 days pcgs prices realized 6100 7100 5104 ngc prices realized 4959 3800 6600 so if you can pick up silver eagles in a pcgs holder at a decent price chances are that if you sell they will obtain higher prices than other servicesand yes you will net more down the road considering what you paid up front for it could it change maybebut when current market forces come in to play i find pcgs selling prices higher than ngc who is more than anacs who is more than icg search the completed e bay auctions and prices realized from the other auction houses like heritage or teletrade it is hard not to ignore the prices pcgs coins are selling for over ngcin the same grade for the same coin midas aug 16 2005 3  quote reply speedy researching coins supporter hey midas i dont think there should be any pfms 70sthere just isnt such a thingthere will always be some little thing i have never seen a anacs pfms 70 of anything i have heard that there are some out there but i would like to see some pcgs and ngc are both respected leaders of the third partied grading the question also came up as to what service will have the best resell all things being equal if you look at my post i agree on this point with you pcgs will sell higher most of the timeor so it seemsbut then there was the time when i paid the highest price paid for a pf66 1954 ngc or pcgs pf franklinand it was ngcin that caseit was not ngc so i agree with you on almost everything but it still seems that pcgs grades more pf70s speedy speedy aug 16 2005 4  quote reply spiderpcgs grades more 70s because they are more popular more coinsmore possibilities icg grades everything pr 70 ive seen a bunch of their state quarter pr70 sets everywhere spider aug 16 2005 5  quote reply speedy researching coins supporter icg grades everything pr 70 not everything but they do use that grade more than others cos speedy speedy aug 16 2005 6  quote reply midas coin hoarder lets examine the population reports from both pcgs and ngc for the issue at hand proof american silver eagles for the purpose of my argument lets examine 5 years beginning with 1996 after all most of these coins have been distributed and those that were slabbed by pcgs or ngc have already been completed in other words i doubt anybody with a hoard of saes from these dates plans on submitting them to pcgs or ngc for grading thereby scewing the population reports i have pcgs population reports co of their web site and you can pull both ngc and pcgs reports together through heritages website so with a little math we can figure out ngc population reports for the ultimate 70 grade for these saes date  total pcgs and ngc  pcgs only  ngc only  pr70s 1996p 212 38 174 1997p 205 33 172 1998p 554 65 489 1999p 285 20 265 2000p 1614 31 1616 sorry it has hard to make a chart look it upthere are more ngc pr70 ultra cam silver eagles than pcgs pr70 dcams in this sample of 5 straight years as stated i find much more 70 grades for proofs being thrown around by ngc than pcgshence another reason why pcgs graded coins realize more and should be chosen if you had a choice among the twoall things being equal midas aug 16 2005 7  quote reply speedy researching coins supporter as i said before i agree with you but that doesnt make me wish i had bought more pcgs slabs when i like ngc better i dont buy mspf70 coins so this doesnt make beans to me as it has been said before ngc has graded more consistantlythat doesnt mean that pcgs doesnt grade good coins i have pcgs graded coins but if i was going to pick a coin for my collection and i had the chance to buy a pcgs graded one and a ngc graded one for the same price i would go for the ngcits just me and nobody is going to change that so yesin the higher grades they do morebut if you want to put some more chartsdo one of ngc and icg speedy speedy aug 16

out of the two im only 17 years old and gonna keep this set for many years so what service will have the best resell here is an idea that will save you money in the endbuy the sets not slabbedbuy them just like they came from the mintthat should save you money imo you wont be getting pf70 coins anyway and i think this would be better all around speedy speedy aug 16 2005 9  quote reply midas coin

old and gonna keep this set for many years so what service will have the best resell his question was pcgs or ngc for long term investment purposes i answered his question based on personal experience in both buying and selling both of their slabbed products it was my intention to give him some dollars and sense for years to come based on real numbers and real dollarsnot human subjectivity nor emotion he never did ask about icg but i will state it again pcgs realizes higher dollars than ngc who realizes higher dollars than anacs who realizes higher dollars than icgbased on the same coin in the same grade sold at the same period of time btwwhen robster 16 tries to sell that sae as a proof 70 based on his opinion raw per your suggestion instead of one slabbed by either pcgs or ngc i can assure you the dollars he realizes will be far far less than if it were a pcgs or ngc slabbed pr70 anyways he wanted 69 dcams anyway good luck robster16 i rest my case midas aug 16 2005 10  quote reply cloudsweeper99treasure hunter just to jump in here the original post indicated that the set would be held for many years so this is really a request to predict the future which is quite a tough assignment since it is hard enough to figure out and agree upon the present but with that criteria i would say buy whichever set is less expensive assuming there is no measurable difference in quality nobody knows which tpg will be preferred in say 20 years nobody knows what sort of scandal lurks just beneath the surface of the popular grading companies of today that might damage the trust that people put in their holders if the coins in the ngc holder are 10 cheaper buy them the only way this wont work out is if the percentage increases at the time of sale if the gap narrows you will earn a higher percentage return if it stays the same it doesnt matter im not sure there is much evidence that the gap is likely to widen more than it already is because these things tend to regress to the mean over time anyway thats what i would do cloudsweeper99 aug 16 2005 11  quote reply gdjmspnumismatist moderator midas said sorry speedyhave to disagree i find that ngc is more liberal with proof coins than pcgs look especially at 69s and 70 grades ngc tends to hand out the holy 70 grail grade way more oftennot as much as icg but far less than pcgs you cant just use 1 example to prove a point  you need to look at all the facts i will agree that ngc has more pf70 ucam grades than pcgs does but theres more to it than that what about the ms grades  what about the pf69 grades  its just as easy to be liberal with the 69 grades as it is to be liberal with the 70 grades i think if you will refer to an article in coin wolrd dated 442005 by mark ferguson titled higher populations soften modern values  youll see what i mean heres a few examples  in 2005 alone and this was just up until april  lincoln cents  ngc pf69 ucam  20501 lincoln cents  pcgs pf69 dcam  45242 lincoln cents  ngc ms69  45

board for the various coin series and they occur while ngc is grading more coins than pcgs does it tells a bit of a different story gdjmsp aug 17 2005 12  quote reply midas coin hoarder gdthose are for total submissions up to the year 2005 i am not positive who does the more of total submissions but you have to look at the individual years and coins here is the ngcs population reports ngc population reports lets go back to the year 1997 since most coins that were slated to be slabbed have pretty much been slabbed in 1997 for just lincolns they have certified 572 prultra cam lincolns heres the breakdown 9 68s 528  69s 34  70s 59 ngc certified a total of 572 ultra cam 1997 lincolns pcgs on the other hand certified 1651 1997 lincoln proofs better than 3 times more 3  64s 2  65s 15 67s 88  68s 1520  69s 20 70s 12 back again to saes here is pcgs population reports for saes since 2000 the last number is total graded and the first number to the left is the number in the 70 grade the third number to the left is the 69 grade etc s1 2000p prdc 0 0 0 0 1 4 3 21 56 404 4745 31 5265 s1 2001w prdc 0 0 0 1 0 8 3 11 67 354 6794 74 7312 s1 2002w prdc 0 0 0 0 0 5 1 9 23 176 4038 68 4320

since 2000 over pcgs which explains why they have more 70 grades than pcgs however look at the ratio of 70 grades to the total submissions for instance in the year 2000 ngc certified 1863 of their submissions as the 70 grade where pcgs certified 58 of their total submissions earning a 70 grade last examplelets look at the population reports of the 1996w dime that recently has been discussed pcgs total graded in ms 2074807 were 67s 426 were 68s and 5 were 69s pcgs total grade in msfb 473231 were 67s and 90 were 68s none higher ngc total grade in ms 397179 were 67s 50 were 68s none higher ngc total grade in msft instead of fb 16880 were 67s and 38 are 68s none higher conclusion look at past and recent prices realized and study the population reports per coin as you go forward midas aug 17 2005 13  quote reply thecavetroll the coin troll midas said conclusion look at past and recent prices realized and study the population reports per coin as you go forward this i can agree with people have always said that while one company has suchansuch a series that they are tough on theother companies are tough on different series i guess to answer the question of the op wed have to say from the data presented that in the ase series that pcgs tends to be more strict in their interpretation of the high grades and therefore it is likely but by no means guaranteed that investment in pcgs ases is the option that will return higher raw numbers upon the future sale of the coins thecavetroll aug 17 2005 14  quote reply gdjmspnumismatist moderator midas  ngc didnt even slab modern us coins until 2001 or 2002  i forget for sure which year they started  pcgs started slabbing them in 1989 so it stands to reason that pcgs has slabbed more in total  for all modern us coins so it is useless to try and compare totals now i could be mistaken but seeing as how ngc slabs 150000 coins a month and pcgs slabs 100000 coins a month  i think the numbers i used were just for this year alone also  those numbers are not for just 2005 coins  they are for coins of all dates in the series except for the nickels and they are post war only  after 1945 the author of the article knew all of this which why he tracked the total pop reports by year this allowed him to do the basic math and determine how many coins were graded in what grade per a given year you and i both know that the pop reports are not listed by how many were slabbed in each year so that was the only way he could obtain the information now i never have disputed that pcgs slabbed coins typically realize higher prices on sale than ngc slabbed coins do although the amount of difference between the two has dropped significantly from what it was a few years ago and it shows no signs of stopping i believe that this due to collectors becoming better educated in regard to how the two companies grade the point i was trying to make with my post is that you cannot say one company is more liberal than another when it comes to grading based simply on one grade  that being 70 gdjmsp aug 17 2005 15  quote reply gdjmspnumismatist moderator thecavetroll said i guess to answer the question of the op wed have to say from

ases is the option that will return higher raw numbers upon the future sale of the coins if it were not for the fact that the value of slabbed ases has dropped roughly by 50 in the past 2 yrs or so  i might agree but that drop includes the coins slabbed by both companies my previous post were not really addressing the ops question they were addressing other comments gdjmsp aug 17 2005 16  quote
