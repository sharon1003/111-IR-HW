why should i get one can i properly care for a ferret do i want a pet that requires time spent with it each day do you go out of town a lot will you be leaving the ferret alone for long stretches of time its okay to leave it while you go to work but you should spend a few hours each day playing with it and letting it romp around your house for exercise ferrets bond very strongly with their owners so they will definitely miss you and react with sadness and other behavioral problems if you are gone much of the time if you are gone for days or weeks at a time on business trips on a regular basis you might not be the best parent for any kind of pets at all okay maybe fish can i properly house a ferret now and in the future to cage ferrets are not like hamsters or gerbils or other small animals that stay caged all the time think of ferrets as being more like cats but not as independent as cats they require more care than cats your ferrets can live in a wire cage the larger the better but they should be allowed to run around outside their cage but inside your house for several hours each day see our ferret products page for companies who make ferret cages or not to cage many ferret owners dedicate an extra bedroom or bathroom in their homes to be the ferret room so that the ferrets can be more or less freeroaming however if you decide to keep your ferrets in a freeroaming state in an extra bathroom make sure to always keep the toilet lid down  ferrets are good climbers and jumpers if they fall in your toilet they may not be able to get out and they could drownare they outdoor pets at all you cannot keep ferrets outside or even let them run around outside without supervision they are fast runners and can get away from you in an instant if you want to take them outside we recommend a leash yes they make leashes for ferrets all ferrets are domesticated versions of the polecat  they have been bred for centuries to be dependent on humans for survival they will not survive in the outside world by themselves but dont they have a homing instinct they do not have a homing instinct like cats and dogs if they get out they will likely go exploring and never find their way back to you they may suffer a cruel death  hit by a car attacked by other animals or having someone shoot it or beat it to death thinking it is a large funnylooking rat photo by the ferret lady theyre really rats arent they ferrets are not related to rats yes they have that little mouse face and sable ferrets have facial mask markings like raccoons but ferrets are not rodents they are mustelids in the same family as minks are they more like hamsters or more like cats ferrets even most older ferrets typically exhibit behavior similar to kittens they are playful active and downright hilarious unlike hamsters which are much smaller creatures ferrets should not remain caged all the time they need to run around in larger spaces from time to time preferably a ferretproofed room this could be a bathroom or extra bedroom just make sure you remove things you dont want broken or things that may harm the ferret they are extremely resourceful and will get into everything if you are not carefuli live in a hot climate is that okay ferrets are cold climate pets for the most part we dont recommend letting them outside as a general rule anyway but especially in hot climates their habitat in your home should be normal room temperature ferrets can die within minutes in temperatures above 80 degrees their living space should not be too cold either keep the room temperature where the ferrets are housed between 65 and 75 degrees am i willing to train my ferret or tolerate certain behaviors dont they bite we hear about a lot of people who want to give up their ferrets not long after acquiring them because they bite most very young ferrets will nip when teething but they should be taught not to do this or you may wind up with an adult ferret that bites and hurts a little flick on the nose is usually enough to discourage this behavior in conjunction with a strong no from you they can learn by your voice along with the noseflick that the nipping is not acceptable before long all you need to do is just say no loudly and they understand never hit your ferrets on the head or anywhere else to discipline them that will only result in an abused and hostile ferret some ferret owners do not like the idea of even the little nose flick to discourage nipping so instead they spray bitter apple on their fingers andor toes when playing with their ferrets when the ferret attempts to bite your finger they will taste the harmless but nasty tasting bitter apple and this helps teach them that human digits are not for chewinggive them cheweasels to teeth on or at any time for a snacktoy these are treats made from proteinbased humangrade food materials and are 100 digestible you can purchase cheweasels from many sources especially ferret supply stores dont they always land on their feet no never drop ferrets to see if they will twist in the air and land on their feet like cats do they dont although they are hardy and can usually survive a fall from a table just fine you do not want to put them at any needless unnecessary risk for injury the poop meisters ferrets are also kings and queens of poop they will make in almost any corner in your home so it is best to keep them confined to a specific area most of the time they can be trained to use cat litter boxes but they may still want to mark corners of a room by eliminating in them place the litter box relatively near their sleeping area they usually relieve themselves almost immediately upon waking if you want them to freeroam your house you would do well to keep newspaper or plastic in the corners or at least put some out while the ferrets are out of their cage hitting your ferrets to discipline them for pooping outside the litter box will not train them it will only abuse them and turn them into either fearful skittish creatures or aggressive angry animals this is true of any pet you should keep an eye on them  if they go for a corner instead of the litter box say no loudly pick them up and put them gently into the litter box be consistent with this training and they will learn they may still go for the corners sometimes so you must accept this behavior about ferrets and be willing to put up with it if you cannot do not get a ferret in the first place this baby ferret is stealing a camera tripod photo by the ferret lady at ferret citycom stop thief ferrets are famous for being little thieves they will steal all sorts of things keys socks etc and hide them under beds or in corners its best to ferretproof your home  keep small items rings earrings keys etc up and out of their reach this is very entertaining behavior so give them hard plastic balls or edible toys they can steal and hide dont give them balls or other toys made from foam rubber type material they will bite off and swallow little pieces which may cause intestinal obstructions and sometimes death another tip dont leave open glasses or bottles of water around they will knock them over and get everything wet am i willing

always eat too much on thanksgiving photo by the ferret lady at ferret citycom ferrets are not usually any more diseaseridden or diseaseprone than dogs or cats but you should be aware of what diseases can occur in ferrets so that you can have them inoculated and you can monitor their condition from time to time ferrets are generally hardy animals many bounce back from illness with incredible
