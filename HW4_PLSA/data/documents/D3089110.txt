t e in grammar a clause is the smallest grammatical unit that can express a complete proposition 1 a typical clause consists of a subject and a predicate 2 the latter typically a verb phrase a verb with any objects and other modifiers however the subject is sometimes not said or explicit often the case in nullsubject languages if the subject is retrievable from context but it sometimes also occurs in other languages such as english as in imperative sentences and nonfinite clauses  a simple sentence usually consists of a single finite clause with a finite verb that is independent more complex sentences may contain multiple clauses main clauses  matrix clauses independent clauses are those that can stand alone as a sentence subordinate clauses  embedded clauses dependent clauses are those that would be awkward or incomplete if they were alone contents  hide 1 two major distinctions2 clauses according to a distinctive syntactic trait21 standard svclauses22 verb first clauses23 wh

clauses61 gerund clauses62 to infinitive clauses63 small clauses7 see also8 notes9 references two major distinctions  edita primary division for the discussion of clauses is the distinction between main clauses ie matrix clauses independent clauses and subordinate clauses ie embedded clauses dependent clauses  3 a main clause can stand alone ie it can constitute a complete sentence by itself a subordinate clause ie embedded clause  in contrast is reliant on the appearance of a main clause it depends on the main clause and is therefore a dependent clause whereas the main clause is an independent clause a second major distinction concerns the difference between finite and nonfinite clauses a finite clause contains a structurally central finite verb whereas the structurally central word of a nonfinite clause is often a nonfinite verb traditional grammar focuses on finite clauses the awareness of nonfinite clauses having arisen much later in connection with the modern study of syntax the discussion here also focuses on finite clauses although some aspects of nonfinite clauses are considered further below clauses according to a distinctive syntactic trait  editclauses can be classified according to a distinctive trait that is a prominent characteristic of their syntactic form the position of the finite verb is one major trait used for classification and the appearance of a specific type of focusing word eg wh word is another these two criteria overlap to an extent which means that often no single aspect of syntactic form is always decisive in determining how the clause functions there are however strong tendencies standard svclauses  editstandard svclauses subjectverb are the norm in english they are usually declarative as opposed to exclamative imperative or interrogative they express information in a neutral manner eg the pig has not yet been fed  declarative clause standard sv order ive been hungry for two hours  declarative clause standard sv orderthat ive been hungry for two hours  declarative clause standard sv order but functioning as a subordinate clause due to the appearance of the subordinator that declarative clauses like these are by far the most frequently occurring type of clause in any language they can be viewed as basic other clause types being derived from them standard svclauses can also be interrogative or exclamative however given the appropriate intonation contour andor the appearance of a question word ega the pig has not yet been fed  rising intonation on fed makes the clause a yesnoquestionb the pig has not yet been fed  spoken forcefully this clause is exclamativec youve been hungry for how long  appearance of interrogative word how and rising intonation make the clause a constituent question examples like these demonstrate that how a clause functions cannot be known based entirely on a single distinctive syntactic criterion svclauses are usually declarative but intonation andor the appearance of a question word can render them interrogative or exclamative verb first clauses  editverb first clauses in english usually play one of three roles 1 they express a yesnoquestion via subject–auxiliary inversion 2 they express a condition as an embedded clause or they express a command via imperative mood ega he must stop laughing  standard declarative svclause verb second orderb should he stop laughing  yesnoquestion expressed by verb first orderc had he stopped laughing  condition expressed by verb first orderd stop laughing  imperative formed with verb first ordera they have done the job  standard declarative svclause verb second orderb have they done the job  yesnoquestion expressed by verb first orderc had they done the job  condition expressed by verb first orderd do the job  imperative formed with verb first order most verb first clauses are main clauses verb first conditional clauses however must be classified as embedded clauses because they cannot stand alone wh clauses  editwh clauses contain a wh word wh words often serve to help express a constituent question they are also prevalent though as relative pronouns in which case they serve to introduce a relative clause and are not part of a question the wh word focuses a particular constituent and most of the time it appears in clauseinitial position the following examples illustrate standard interrogative wh clauses the bsentences are direct questions main clauses and the csentences contain the corresponding indirect questions embedded clausesa sam likes the meat  standard declarative svclauseb who likes the meat  matrix interrogative wh clause focusing on the subjectc they asked who likes the meat  embedded interrogative wh clause focusing on the subjecta larry sent susan to the store  standard declarative svclauseb whom did larry send to the store  matrix interrogative wh clause focusing on the object subjectauxiliary inversion presentc we know whom larry sent to the store  embedded wh clause focusing on the object subjectauxiliary inversion absenta larry sent susan to the store  standard declarative svclauseb where did larry send susan  matrix interrogative wh clause focusing on the oblique object subjectauxiliary inversion presentc someone is wondering where larry sent susan  embedded wh clause focusing on the oblique object subjectauxiliary inversion absent one important aspect of matrix wh clauses is that subjectauxiliary inversion is obligatory when something other than the subject is focused when it is the subject or something embedded in the subject that is focused however subjectauxiliary inversion does not occura who called you  subject focused no subjectauxiliary inversionb whom did you call  object focused subjectauxiliary inversion occurs another important aspect of wh clauses concerns the absence of subjectauxiliary inversion in embedded clauses as illustrated in the cexamples just produced subjectauxiliary inversion is obligatory in matrix clauses when something other than the subject is focused but it never occurs in embedded clauses regardless of the constituent that is focused a systematic distinction in word order emerges across matrix wh clauses which can have vs order and embedded wh clauses which always maintain sv order ega why are they doing that  subjectauxiliary inversion results in vs order in matrix wh clauseb they told us why they are doing that  subjectauxiliary inversion is absent in embedded wh clausec they told us why are they doing that  subjectauxiliary inversion is blocked in embedded wh clausea whom is he trying to avoid  subjectauxiliary inversion results in vs order in matrix wh clauseb we know whom he is trying to avoid  subjectauxiliary inversion is absent in embedded wh clausec we know whom is he trying to avoid  subjectauxiliary inversion is blocked in embedded wh clause relative clauses  editmain article relative clause see also english relative clauses relative clauses are a mixed group in english they can be standard svclauses if they are introduced by that or lack a relative pronoun entirely or they can be wh clauses if they are introduced by a wh word that serves as a relative pronouna something happened twice  standard declarative svclauseb something that happened twice  relative clause introduced by the relative pronoun that and modifying the indefinite pronoun somethinga i know everyone  standard declarative svclauseb everyone i know  relative clause lacking a relative pronoun entirely and modifying the indefinite pronoun everyonea they left early  standard declarative clauseb the time when they left early  relative clause introduced by the relative proform when and modifying the noun timea the woman sang a song  standard declarative svclauseb the woman who sang a song  relative clause introduced by the relative pronoun who and modifying the noun woman as embedded clauses relative clauses in english cannot display subjectauxiliary inversion a particular type of wh relativeclause is the socalled free relative clause free relatives typically function as arguments ega what he did was unexpected  free relative clause functioning as subject argumentb he will flatter whoever is present  free relative clause functioning as object argument these relative clauses are free because they can appear in a variety of syntactic positions they are not limited to appearing as modifiers of nominals the suffix ever is often employed to render a standard relative pronoun as a pronoun that can introduce a free relative clause clauses according to semantic predicateargument function  editembedded clauses can be categorized according to their syntactic function in terms of predicateargument structures they can function as arguments as adjuncts or as predicative expressions that is embedded clauses can be an argument of a predicate an adjunct on a predicate or part of the predicate itself the predicate in question is usually the matrix predicate of a main clause but embedding of predicates is also frequent argument clauses  edita clause that functions as the argument of a given predicate is known as an argument clause argument clauses can appear as subjects as objects and as obliques they can also modify a noun predicate in which case they are known as content clauses that they actually helped was really appreciated  svclause functioning as the subject argument they mentioned that they had actually helped  svclause functioning as the object argument what he said was ridiculous  wh clause functioning as the subject argument we know what he said  wh clause functioning as an object argument he talked about what he had said  wh clause functioning as an oblique object argument the following examples illustrate argument clauses that provide the content of a noun such argument clauses are content clausesa the claim that he was going to change it  argument clause that provides the content of a noun ie content clauseb the claim that he expressed  adjunct clause relative clause that modifies a nouna the idea that we should alter the law  argument clause that provides the content of a noun ie content clauseb the idea that came up  adjunct clause relative clause that modifies a noun the content clauses like these in the asentences are arguments relative clauses introduced by the relative pronoun that as in the bclauses here have an outward appearance that is closely similar to that of content clauses the relative clauses are adjuncts however not arguments adjunct clauses  editadjunct clauses are embedded clauses that modify an entire predicateargument structure all clause types sv verb first wh can function as adjuncts although the stereotypical adjunct clause is sv and introduced by a subordinator ie subordinate conjunction eg after because before when etc  ega fred arrived before you did  adjunct clause modifying matrix clauseb after fred arrived the party started  adjunct clause modifying matrix clausec susan skipped the meal because she is fasting  adjunct clause modifying matrix clause these adjunct clauses modify the entire matrix clause thus before you did in the first example modifies the matrix clause fred arrived adjunct clauses can also modify a nominal predicate the typical instance of this type of adjunct is a relative clause ega we like the music that you brought  relative clause functioning as an adjunct that modifies the noun musicb the people who brought music were singing loudly  relative clause functioning as an adjunct that modifies the noun peoplec they are waiting for some food that will not come  relative clause functioning as an adjunct that modifies the noun food predicative clauses  editan embedded clause can also function as a predicative expression that is it can form part of the predicate of a greater clausea that was when they laughed  predicative svclause ie a clause that functions as part of the main predicateb he became what he always wanted to be  predicative wh clause ie wh clause that functions as part of the main predicate these predicative clauses are functioning just like other predicative expressions eg predicative adjectives  that was good and predicative nominals  that was the truth  they form the matrix predicate together with the copula representing clauses  editsome of the distinctions presented above are represented in syntax trees these trees make the difference between main and subordinate clauses very clear and they also illustrate well the difference between argument and adjunct clauses the following dependency grammar trees show that embedded clauses are dependent on an element in the main clause often on a verb 4the main clause encompasses the entire tree each time whereas the embedded clause is contained within the main clause these two embedded clauses are arguments the embedded wh clause what we want is the object argument of the predicate know the embedded clause that he is gaining is the subject argument of the predicate is motivating both of these argument clauses are directly dependent on the main verb of the matrix clause the following trees identify adjunct clauses using an arrow dependency edge these two embedded clauses are adjunct clauses because they provide circumstantial information that modifies a superordinate expression the first is a dependent of the main verb of the matrix clause and the second is a dependent of the object noun the arrow dependency edges identify them as adjuncts the arrow points away from the adjunct towards it governor to indicate that semantic selection is running counter to the direction of the syntactic dependency the adjunct is selecting its governor the next four trees illustrate the distinction mentioned above between matrix wh clauses and embedded wh clauses the embedded wh clause is an object argument each time the position of the wh word across the matrix clauses atrees and the embedded clauses btrees captures the difference in word order matrix wh clauses have v2 word order whereas embedded whclauses have what amounts to v3 word order in the matrix clauses the wh word is a dependent of the finite verb whereas it is the head over the finite verb in the embedded wh clauses clauses vs phrases  editthere has been confusion about the distinction between clauses and phrases this confusion is due in part to how these concepts are employed in the phrase structure grammars of the chomskyan tradition in the 1970s chomskyan grammars began labeling many clauses as cps ie complementizer phrases or as ips ie inflection phrases and then later as tps ie tense phrases etc the choice of labels was influenced by the theoryinternal desire to use the labels consistently the xbar schema acknowledged at least three projection levels for every lexical head a minimal projection eg n v p etc  an intermediate projection eg n v p etc  and a phrase level projection eg np vp pp etc extending this convention to the clausal categories occurred in the interest of the consistent use of labels this use of labels should not however be confused with the actual status of the syntactic units to which the labels are attached a more traditional understanding of clauses and phrases maintains that phrases are not clauses and clauses are not phrases there is a progression in the size and status of syntactic units words  phrases  clauses the characteristic trait of clauses ie the presence of a subject and a finite verb is absent from phrases clauses can be however embedded inside phrases nonfinite clauses  editmain article nonfinite clause the central word of a nonfinite clause is usually a nonfinite verb as opposed to a finite verb  there are various types of nonfinite clauses that can be acknowledged based in part on the type of nonfinite verb at hand gerunds are widely acknowledged to constitute nonfinite clauses and some modern grammars also judge many to infinitives to be the structural locus of nonfinite clauses finally some modern grammars also acknowledge socalled small clauses which often lack a verb altogether it should be apparent that nonfinite clauses are by and large embedded clauses gerund clauses  editthe underlined words in the following examples are considered nonfinite clauses ega bill stopping the project was a big disappointment  nonfinite gerund clauseb bills stopping the project was a big disappointment  gerund with noun statusa weve heard about susan attempting a solution  nonfinite gerund clauseb weve heard about susans attempting a solution  gerund with noun statusa they mentioned him cheating on the test  nonfinite gerund clauseb they mentioned his cheating on the test  gerund with noun status each of the gerunds in the asentences  stopping attempting and cheating constitutes a nonfinite clause the subjectpredicate relationship that has long been taken as the defining trait of clauses is fully present in the asentences the fact that the bsentences are also acceptable illustrates the enigmatic behavior of gerunds they seem to straddle two syntactic categories they can function as nonfinite verbs or as nouns when they function as nouns as in the bsentences it is debatable whether they constitute clauses since nouns are not generally taken to be constitutive of clausesto infinitive clauses  editsome modern theories of syntax take many to infinitives to be constitutive of nonfinite clauses 5 this stance is supported by the clear predicate status of many to infinitives it is challenged however by the fact that to infinitives do not take an overt subject ega she refuses to consider the issuea he attempted to explain his concerns the to infinitives to consider and to explain clearly qualify as predicates because they can be negated they do not however take overt subjects the subjects she and he are dependents of the matrix verbs refuses and attempted respectively not of the to infinitives data like these are often addressed in terms of control the matrix predicates refuses and attempted are control verbs they control the embedded predicates consider and explain which means they determine which of their arguments serves as the subject argument of the embedded predicate some theories of syntax posit the null subject pro ie pronoun to help address the facts of control constructions egb she refuses pro to consider the issueb he attempted pro to explain his concerns with the presence of pro as a null subject to infinitives can be construed as complete clauses since both subject and predicate are present one must keep in mind though that protheory is particular to one tradition in the study of syntax and grammar  government and binding theory minimalist program  other theories of syntax and grammar eg headdriven phrase structure grammar construction grammar dependency grammar reject the presence of null elements such as pro which means they are likely to reject the stance that to infinitives constitute clauses small clauses  editanother type of construction that some schools of syntax and grammar view as nonfinite clauses is the socalled small clause a typical small clause consists of a noun phrase and a predicative expression 6 eg we consider that a joke  small clause with the predicative noun phrase a joke something made him angry  small clause with the predicative adjective angry she wants us to stay  small clause with the predicative nonfinite to infinitive to stay the subjectpredicate relationship is clearly present in the underlined strings the expression on the right is a predication over the noun phrase immediately to its left while the subjectpredicate relationship is indisputably present the underlined strings do not behave as single constituents a fact that undermines their status as clauses hence one can debate whether the underlined strings in these examples should qualify as clauses the layered structures of the chomskyan tradition are again likely to view the underlined strings as clauses whereas the schools of syntax that posit flatter structures are likely to reject clause status for them see also  editadverbial clause dependent clause
