a more warlike u s could have been a decisive influence on many eastern european countries and shortcircuited the soviets sphere of influence expansion while significantly shortening the war the country would have made somewhat less profits from selling supplies but they had the potential to establish their domination over the communists of stalin and skip the whole cold war in the process there is no telling how big that impact would have been but i can assume it would have been a step in the right direction in that scenario my guess for the best moment to intervene would have been right in the middle of the first year of operation barbossa the u s would have been in a position to force germany to surrender while wide swaths of russian lands were still in germanys hands hindsight how marvellous  obviously that claim has no base on legal or moral grounds the u s historically did exactly what anyone else would have done in their place go where their interests lead them using a shortsightedness that was to become their trademark in decades to come but no one had the authority moral or of any other kind to ask them to do otherwise518 views · view upvoterspromoted by

including the european powers didn’t consult with the united states on their actions prior to 1939  why was the us going to get into a mess that it had no part in starting nobody had really attacked the us or interests prior to 1941  the sinking of the uss reuben james a destroyer by a german uboat and the attack on pearl harbor were the only two significant attacks on the us or us interests the attack on the uss panay in 1937 by japanese forces in china had already been quietly settled meaning that it was no longer a factor there was no reason for the united states to have entered before it did the ussr and germany weren’t fighting until 1941  not much benefit for the us to take the brunt of the german assault alone when the soviets were willing to act as a punching bag china was doing an excellent job of tying up japan’s army  again someone else was taking a beating that the us didn’t have to the collapse of europe besides the united kingdom and the ussr did little to motivate americans to join the fray  france collapsed in six weeks most of the rest of europe submitted within weeks or months why would the united states be eager to have its soldiers die if the nations that it would be liberating put up token defenses at best considering that the war ended less than four years after the entrance of the united states it seems a safe historical assessment to believe that

wanted to take the usa out eventually but then it wasn’t that simple he knew that there was opposition to the usa entering the war and for good reason there are some who say he provoked the japanese

had just been defeated at the gates of moscow it was clear to many on the german general staff that the failure to take moscow before the end of 1941 meant the failure of operation barbarossa as a result the majority of the wehrmacht would tied up fighting the russians for a long time rommel had just been driven from the gates of tobruk el alamein was still 11 months in the future but the emphasis on the russian campaign meant he could never get sufficient resources to achieve complete victory in north africa italy was becoming more of a liability than asset to germany they had lost their east african colonies and ethiopia suffered their own “pearl harbor” at taranto and had become a junior partner to germany in north africa the lack of surface raiders bismark sunk tirpitz scharnhorst and gneisenau and others bottled up in french and norwegian ports and the luftwaffe largely withdrawn to russia the uboats were all germany had to attack allied shipping with the advent of the convoy system the british were starting to turn the battle of the atlantic in their favor that losses to uboats spiked after the us entry was due mainly to us inexperience in others words while the war was far from over it looked as if the axis powers had reached their limit of conquest this of course was not quite true as japan conquered the philippines which took 7 months indonesia and southeast asia in the first half of 1942 and germany nearly took stalingrad the us could probably have waited a bit later but pearl harbor forced it to act1k views · view upvoters angela karson answered jul 21 2015its kind of hard to say im not really sure what you meant by too late obviously it wasnt too late because the allies beat the axis regardless of the uss 1941 entry date if by too late you mean the war could have been ended earlier or less people would have died maybe like i said its hard to say before our entry into wwii the us had a very small military i recall reading that it was smaller than even the romanian military and we needed time to build it up for a large scale war the first real american offensive against the germans operation torch the invasion of german held north africa didnt even start until november of 1942 almost a year after we entered the war even if we declared war on germany after the invasion of poland with france and the uk we might not have been ready to provide any real assistance aside from sending weapons and supplies which we were already doing regardless until 1941 or 42 anyway621 views · view upvoters michael grainger answered may

against fascist supporters like joseph kennedy to start with and to limited degree the usa supported franco whilst i would not suggest there was a strong faction in favour of joining the fascist powers there was a good deal of support of isolationism and the extensive propaganda which permeated the usa regarding wwi and its aftermath which still echoes today read comments here only went to support the concept of standing back and allowing eurpoe to sort out its own mess neglecting the fact that the usa had some responsibility for the creation of that mess in the first place it must be true that had the usa stood up to fascism in concert with others there would have been no wwii but it is equally true that there were a number of adoring admirers of hitler and the simply amazing way he had turned germany round dahling in the uk so whether the uk did enough to get the usa off its derriere is very much open to question book 1 the gathering storm a history of the second world war by

destroyers to england for land rights england paid off her lendlease debt to us in 2006 as has the soviet union much of the lendlease was heavily discounted so we didnt make any money on the deal but that wasnt the point lendlease was just a way to make supplying the allies palatable to the public and congress lendlease because of the countrys isolationist mood brought on partly by the public sentiment that wwi was a huge mistake roosevelt could not enter any sooner than we did entering sooner simply wasnt in the cards whether it would have made much difference is an unknown because gearing up our war machine from almost nothing took time roosevelt was putting us on a war footing with weapons development switching factories over and enacting a peacetime draft the public was realizing we might be pulled into this war after france was invaded so we were getting there some of the weapons we developed were among the finest of the war such as our m1 garand battle rifle m2
