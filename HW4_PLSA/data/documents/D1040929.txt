effects of supramalleolar orthoses on children sure step kathy martin pt dhs assistant professor of physical therapy krannert school of physical therapy university of indianapolis indianapolis usa correspondence to author at krannert school of physical therapy university of indianapolis indianapolis indiana usa email kmartinuindyedu this study explored the effects of a flexible supramalleolar orthosis smo indicated to decrease pronation associated with hypotonia on postural stability in children with down syndrome seventeen children with down syndrome nine males eight females mean age 5 years 10 months sd 172 months range 3 years 6 months to 8 years were tested three times in a 10week period weeks 1 3 and 10 using the standing and the walking running and jumping dimensions of the gross motor function measure gmfm and the balance subtest of the bruininksoseretsky test of motor proficiency botmp range of motion measurements were used to explore the influence of joint laxity significant improvement was found with smos compared with shoes only in the standing dimension p0001 and the walking running and jumping dimension p00001 of the gmfm both at the time of fitting week 3 and after 7 weeks of wearing smos week 10 for the botmp balance subtest significant improvement p0027 was seen only at the end of the 7week study period amount of joint laxity did not influence response to orthotic intervention this study showed that young children with down syndrome showed immediate and longerterm after 7 weeks of use improvement in postural stability with the use of flexible smos down syndrome a genetic disorder occurring in 13 per 1000 live births in north america is a common cause of neurodevelopmental disability harris and shea 1991 that includes hypotonia joint laxity delayed achievement of motor milestones and disturbances in postural control rast and harris 1985 shumwaycook and woollacott 1985 lauteslager et al 1998 russell et al 1998 in a longitudinal study connolly et al 1993 found that children with down syndrome continued to have problems with postural stability into adolescence the neuropathology associated with down syndrome including a smaller cerebellum and brainstem is thought to be a factor in these deficits shumwaycook and woollacott 1985 connolly et al 1993 improving postural stability leads to better functional motor performance westcott et al 1997 lauteslager et al 1998 anecdotal reports from physical therapists and parents indicate that children with down syndrome have improved postural stability when they use orthoses however this belief has not consistently been supported in the literature knutson and clark 1991 only one study has investigated the use of orthoses during gait in children with down syndrome and it showed decreased external rotation in the foot progression angle more consistent foot function during gait and decreased heel eversion in standing with foot orthoses selby silverstein et al 2001 genaze 2000 recommended supramalleolar orthoses smos for children with down syndrome as conventional foot orthoses are usually not sufficient to control pronation secondary to hypotonia and joint laxity yet no study has investigated the use of smos in children with down syndrome the purpose of this study therefore was to determine the immediate and longerterm effects of a flexible smo on postural stability and physical disability in children with down syndrome in addition the influence of joint laxity on response to the orthoses was investigated the primary research hypothesis was that flexible smos would improve postural stability in children with down syndrome as measured by dimensions of the gross motor function measure gmfm russell et al 1993 and the bruininksoseretsky test of motor proficiency botmp bruininks 1978 secondary hypotheses were that this effect would be greater after several weeks of wearing the orthoses and that children with down syndrome with greater joint laxity would benefit more from smos method participants participants were recruited from central and northern indiana usa through local parent support groups they were eligible for the study if they met the following criteria aged between 3 years 6 months and 10 years diagnosis of down syndrome no parentreported history of inner ear impairment or uncorrected visual impairment ability to follow simple commands no history of seizures and independent ambulation for 30 yards this study was approved by the committee on research involving human participants at the university of indianapolis usa informed written consent was obtained from a parent or guardian before participation in the study seventeen children nine males eight females with down syndrome participated in the study between july 2002 and january 2003 data from three children were eliminated from the final analysis one was unable to participate appropriately in the testing one did not tolerate the orthoses and one was a lowscoring outlier on all dependent variables for the 14 remaining participants mean age at initial testing was 5 years 10 months standard deviation sd 172 months and range was 3 years 6
