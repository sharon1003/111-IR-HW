recorded for their first ep flobots present platypus but was rereleased on fight with tools two years later which then led to its single release one year after the release of fight with tools theme  editjamie laurie stated that the song is about the idea that we have so much incredible potential as human beings to be destructive or to be creative and its tragic to me that the appetite for military innovation is endless but when it comes to taking on a project like ending world hunger its seen as outlandish its not treated with the same seriousness  at the same time i knew there were people at that moment who were being bombed by our own country and i thought that was incredibly powerful it is the contrast between these little moments of creativity these bursts of innovation and the way these ideas are put to use to oppress and destroy people that the singer feels is beautiful and tragic at the same time 1music video  editthe video for the song is animated it starts out lighthearted showing two young friends sitting on a hill looking over a city prominent in the city is a crystalline tower with part of its framework showing the friends ride their bikes down the hill without their hands on the handlebars while one smiles widely they arrive at a sign that points in two directions one labeled with a corporatelooking symbol and the other labeled by a dove they hug and head their separate ways the one who originally smiled taking the path of the dove the next part of the song centers on the friend who went the way of the dove he walks along a cracked sidewalk and sees a chalk drawing depicting the first scene of the video two children on bicycles with their arms in the air riding down a hill next to a city he picks up an apple off of the ground and puts it back in its barrel symbolizing him putting the world back together he walks past a street corner that shows a path to the corporate street he does not see that there is blood on the walls of the corporate street he picks up his phone and sees the corporate friends face here the perspective switches to the other friend and we see him talking to the peaceful friend on the phone the corporate friend hangs up and walks down the street he lists his accomplishments and they are shown in the video before he stops in front of the same tower that appeared in the beginning of the video he looks up at it in the next scene he is completing a transaction with a man in a board room a graph clearly of profits zigzags up a board with the corporate logo on it before ending in what looks like a spatter of blood the camera zooms out and we see that he was inside the tower he then gives a speech behind a podium which is broadcast on television the background changes from the original corporate image into two american flags the other friend sees it and shakes his head disappointedly the scene then cuts to the world being more bleak and oppressive with security cameras and smokestacks emblazoned with the corporate logo spewing toxic fumes into the air a scene features the dove being killed by a hawk and a fighter jet soars overhead in the next sequence the previously peaceful friend begins rallying a crowd of oppressedlooking people we see a man wearing a bandana spray an x over a poster with a picture of the nowdictatorlike friend on it and then the word liar below that we then see a crowd of people led by the rebellious friend advancing on the tower they are stopped by a line of heavily armed riotcontrol officers with shields displaying a fist and submachine guns who proceed to kill the entire crowd the bandana wearing man is killed first by a sniper following many more deaths the corporate friend looks on in horror as he sees his friend shot down dead and lying on the floor the video ends with a flashback of the two friends pedaling off riding with no handlebars crisscrossing into a bright light several times in the video the dove as a symbol is destroyed once an actual dove is killed by a hawk the second time a wall with a dove painted on it located next to a billboard displaying the corporate symbol and a cityscape again featuring the tower is destroyed by a wrecking ball in addition we see a hawk fly over the head of the corporate friend when he is walking down the street another reference made within the video is to che guevara an iconic revolutionist this can be seen when the oppressed friend is rallying a crowd an image of guevaras face appears on an overweight mans yellow tshirt arguably there is also a reference to bloody sunday when the peaceful protesters are marching they are gunned down by guards in a similar fashion as to that of the marchers in st petersburg russia on bloody sunday in 1905 another reference is seen during the massacre seen of a flashing image similar to that which represented the abu ghraib prisoner abuse the image particular to the iconic image of satar jabar chart performance  editon may
