about the grand opening laura a cronin 44 a stayathome mother of a 3yearold son who grew up in shrewsbury was grabbing a drink at the starbucks recently ms cronin said she was angry when hooters opened up down the street in another plaza but was glad to see a familyfriendly whole foods opening at lakeway commons she said she would grocery shop there when it opens rather than in northboro as she does now and also likely stop in for a bite to eat at the restaurants“it is good to have more dining options in shrewsbury” ms cronin said whose fiancé is a lawyer “everyone here is so busy — i think we eat out a lot and it is a very convenient location having lived in shrewsbury my whole life one thing that is sad is that spag’s is gone at least it is acknowledged on the front of whole foods but i don’t think we’ll ever get over spag’s being gone it was a landmark”scott r pearl a general contractor from mrg construction management in peabody which is working on massage envy opening in the plaza soon also lives in shrewsbury he said he and his wife drive to the whole foods in framingham to shop and are looking forward to having one local“i think it is great we have this stuff here” mr pearl said “whole foods is what i’m looking forward to the most  after i get a massage and then going to eat at one of the restaurants for us it is going to be way more convenient and so much easier”michael v petrone 33 a sales representative from petro home services in shrewsbury who was meeting with colleagues at starbucks said he would have liked to see a pool hall or dave  buster’s open in the plaza to give him and his friends a place to hang out and have fun“i was talking with my boss about that the other day – this is just an upscale version of white city plaza” mr petrone said “they should incorporate something else into it for shrewsbury people to do”mr grossman said he began working with shrewsbury officials a few years ago and said the planning process was clear and officials cooperative“shrewsbury officials were a pleasure to work with” mr grossman said “they made expectations clear and as long as i executed the vision they agreed on there was full cooperation we believe we have indeed executed that vision and the end result is what you see at lakeway commons”with an estimated assessed value of about 666 million assistant town manager kristen d las who also serves as shrewsbury’s economic development coordinator said lakeway commons located in the lakeway business district is “extremely significant” to shrewsbury“over the past 10 years the site deteriorated significantly” ms las said “lakeway commons is a revitalization of an extremely iconic site in central massachusetts”some of the parcels needed rezoning from “purely residential” zoning to an overlay district that allows mixeduse she said town meeting approved the changes in 2014 she said and adopted language changes to zoning regulations in the district that allowed for a drivethru at starbucks and several other design standards just how much tax revenue the project will bring in won’t be known until next summer after the project is fully occupied she said but during the

wellbeing it’s a great combination”especially for pets president and owner michael j di tullio said his business offers a “healthier diet for pets” including natural and organic whole foods as well as pet products and services such as obedience training day school — daycare with a purpose he said — grooming and nonemergency veterinary care mr di tullio said the types of businesses opening at the lakeway commons attracted him to the plaza“most notably whole foods – we have kind of the same customer” he said of his eight locations all in massachusetts with one other in worcester county  westboro “i think shrewsbury is a great growing market and the partners we have in the shopping center are similar and conducive to business”mr grossman said there are four retail units without occupants but they will be filled by the end of the year ben n zimmerman development manager for criterion development partners which is constructing the apartment complex said the first of five buildings is complete that represents 76 of the 250 total units the remaining buildings will be completed over the next few months he said with the final building scheduled for completion in march“we

center it has good access to transportation including a new wrta stop there are great recreation and conveniences nearby and of course all the shops and restaurants of lakeway commons are right at

rockingham park racetrack in salem new hampshire“we have a great working relationship and hope to do more with them moving forward” mr burns said who also managed another development in shrewsbury and
