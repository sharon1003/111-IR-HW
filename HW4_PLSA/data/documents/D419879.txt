overview osteoporosis causes bones to become weak and brittle — so brittle that a fall or even mild stresses such as bending over or coughing can cause a fracture osteoporosisrelated fractures most commonly occur in the hip wrist or spine bone is living tissue that is constantly being broken down and replaced osteoporosis occurs when the creation of new bone doesnt keep up with the removal of old bone osteoporosis affects men and women of all races but white and asian women — especially older women who are past menopause — are at highest risk medications healthy diet and weightbearing exercise can help prevent bone loss or strengthen already weak bones symptoms there typically are no symptoms in the early stages of bone loss but once your bones have been weakened by osteoporosis you may have signs and symptoms that include back pain caused by a fractured or collapsed vertebra loss of height over time a stooped posture a bone fracture that occurs much more easily than expected when to see a doctor you may want to talk to your doctor about osteoporosis if you went through early menopause or took corticosteroids for several months at a time or if either of your parents had hip fractures request an appointment at mayo clinic causes osteoporosis weakens bone your bones are in a constant state of renewal — new bone is made and old bone is broken down when youre young your body makes new bone faster than it breaks down old bone and your bone mass increases most people reach their peak bone mass by their early 20s as people age bone mass is lost faster than its created how likely you are to develop osteoporosis depends partly on how much bone mass you attained in your youth the higher your peak bone mass the more bone you have in the bank and the less likely you are to develop osteoporosis as you age risk factors a number of factors can increase the likelihood that youll develop osteoporosis — including your age race lifestyle choices and medical conditions and treatments unchangeable risks some risk factors for osteoporosis are out of your control including your sex women are much more likely to develop osteoporosis than are men age the older you get the greater your risk of osteoporosis race youre at greatest risk of osteoporosis if youre white or of asian descent family history having a parent or sibling with osteoporosis puts you at greater risk especially if your mother or father experienced a hip fracture body frame size men and women who have small body frames tend to have a higher risk because they may have less bone mass to draw from as they age hormone levels osteoporosis is more common in people who have too much or too little of certain hormones in their bodies examples include sex hormones lowered sex hormone levels tend to weaken bone the reduction of estrogen levels in women at menopause is one of the strongest risk factors for developing osteoporosis men experience a gradual reduction in testosterone levels as they age treatments for prostate cancer that reduce testosterone levels in men and treatments for breast cancer that reduce estrogen levels in women are likely to accelerate bone loss thyroid problems too much thyroid hormone can cause bone loss this can occur if your thyroid is overactive or if you take too much thyroid hormone medication to treat an underactive thyroid other glands osteoporosis has also been associated with overactive parathyroid and adrenal glands dietary factors osteoporosis is more likely to occur in people who have low calcium intake a lifelong lack of calcium plays a role in the development of osteoporosis low calcium intake contributes to diminished bone density early bone loss and an increased risk of fractures eating disorders severely restricting food intake and being underweight weakens bone in both men and women gastrointestinal surgery surgery to reduce the size of your stomach or to remove part of the intestine limits the amount of surface area available to absorb nutrients including calcium steroids and other medications longterm use of oral or injected corticosteroid medications such as prednisone and cortisone interferes with the bonerebuilding process osteoporosis has also been associated with medications used to combat or prevent seizures gastric reflux cancer transplant rejection medical conditions the risk of osteoporosis is higher in people who have certain medical problems including celiac disease inflammatory bowel disease kidney or liver disease cancer lupus multiple myeloma rheumatoid arthritis lifestyle choices some bad habits can increase your risk of osteoporosis examples include sedentary lifestyle people who spend a lot of time sitting have a higher risk of osteoporosis than do those who are more active any weightbearing exercise and activities that promote balance and good posture are beneficial for your bones but walking running jumping dancing and weightlifting seem particularly helpful excessive alcohol consumption regular consumption of more than two alcoholic drinks a day increases your risk of osteoporosis tobacco use the exact role tobacco plays in osteoporosis isnt clearly understood but it has been shown that tobacco use contributes to weak bones complications compression fractures bone fractures particularly in the spine or hip are the most serious complication of osteoporosis hip fractures often are caused by a fall and can result in disability and even an increased risk of death within the first year after the injury in some cases spinal fractures can occur even if you havent fallen the bones that make up your spine vertebrae can weaken to the point that they may crumple which can result in back pain lost height and a hunched forward posture prevention good nutrition and regular exercise are essential for keeping your bones healthy throughout your life protein protein is one of the building blocks of bone and while most people get plenty of protein in their diets some do not vegetarians and vegans can get enough protein in the diet if they intentionally seek suitable sources such as soy nuts legumes and dairy and eggs if allowed older adults may also eat less protein for various reasons protein supplementation is an option body weight being underweight increases the chance of bone loss and fractures excess weight is now known to increase the risk of fractures in your arm and wrist as such maintaining an appropriate body weight is good for bones just as it is for health in general calcium men and women between the ages of 18 and 50 need 1000 milligrams of calcium a day this daily amount increases to 1200 milligrams when women turn 50 and men turn 70 good sources of calcium include lowfat dairy products dark green leafy vegetables canned salmon or sardines with bones soy products such as tofu calciumfortified cereals and orange juice if you find it difficult to get enough calcium from your diet consider taking calcium supplements however too much calcium has been linked to kidney stones although yet unclear some experts suggest that too much calcium especially in supplements can increase the risk of heart disease the institute of medicine recommends that total calcium intake from supplements and diet combined should be no more than 2000 milligrams daily for people older than 50 vitamin dvitamin d improves your bodys ability to absorb calcium and improves bone health in other ways people can get adequate amounts of vitamin d from sunlight but this may not be a good source if you live in a high latitude if youre housebound or if you regularly use sunscreen or avoid the sun entirely because of the risk of skin cancer scientists dont yet know the optimal daily dose of vitamin d for each person a good starting point for adults is 600 to 800 international units  iu a day through food or supplements for people without other sources of vitamin d and especially with limited sun exposure a supplement may be needed most multivitamin products contain between 600 and 800 iu of vitamin d up to 4000 iu of vitamin d a day is safe for most people exercise exercise can help you build strong bones and slow bone loss exercise will benefit your bones no matter when you start but youll gain the most benefits if you start exercising regularly when youre young and continue to exercise throughout your life combine strength training exercises with weightbearing and balance exercises strength training helps strengthen muscles and bones in your arms and upper spine and weightbearing exercises — such as walking jogging running stair climbing skipping rope skiing and impactproducing sports — affect mainly the bones in your legs hips and lower spine balance exercises such as tai chi can reduce your risk of falling especially as you get older swimming cycling and exercising on machines such as elliptical trainers can provide a good cardiovascular workout but theyre not as helpful for improving bone health by
