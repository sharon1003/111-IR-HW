story behind great songs published october 3 2013 last modified april 28 2016 1246pm“spill the wine” war featuring eric burdon what plays out like a blowbyblow account of a psychedelic trip of some sort is actually about something equally as complex and deep women well according to one member of the band“spill the wine” the first hit for the southern california soulfunk band war featured the great eric burdon — late of the animals — on vocals over a funky hypnotic groove burdon raps on about a dream in which he stars in a movie he is taken to the hall of the mountain king naked as a jaybird where he finds every type of woman under the sun eventually a lady pours some wine from a bottle into a glass and puts it to her lips as burdon looks on she then whispers “something crazy” — the song’s title with an added treat more on that later harold brown drummer for war clarified the meaning of this cryptic song according to brown this song celebrates women not drugs“all ladies are beautiful you’ve got to look at them god i believe put all of us here and made us all different so we could be like the flowers you know like women i look at them as beautiful flowers even when they get older the flowers and so on and that’s what it really boils down to they can be skinny big fat i’ve seen some fine voluptuous women and then i’ve seen some that are skinny and if you look at them they could be beautiful depending on personality and stuff” you hear that skinny women develop a personality and you too can be beautiful while females figure prominently in the song what about the other imagery vivid and thoughtprovoking — especially the spilling of fermented grapes well according to howard some wine actually did spill during the creative process leading to the song’s key line“so for about a year we just kept going in and out of studios and then one day we were up in san francisco just playing and stuff lonnie jordan keyboard player came in acting all drunk and stuff and out they had a bottle of wine and some of that wine got spilled in the console“lee oskar harmonica player says he felt that the song didn’t have anything to do with the wine going into the console but all i know is after that they moved out of the a studio they moved us into the b studio and then we were playing a latin thing and even if eric had been writing ‘spill the wine’ all along and writing the concepts that’s when it all came together i think that eric was already working on an idea about leaking gnomes waking up in a grassy field and then when the wine inadvertently got knocked over whether it was part of the song or not it all just came together right at that moment”jordan himself confirms this revealing that the inspiration for the song was a time when he spilled a glass of wine on a mixing board in the recording studio burdon found the event funny so he and jordan used it as the inspiration for the song an integral part of “spill the wine” is a woman with an accent speaking sexy spanish in the background while burdon does his thing this mystery woman was revealed to be burdon’s girlfriend at that time said brown “we went back there and we put up a little tent candlelight and some wine back there they were behind there and eric was doing things to her and making her talk”although translations vary many agree that the woman is saying this“blue’s crazy but so is well all things are azure blue because i’m”“i am no longer here in my body i am flying there outside of my body among truth”the chorus is often misheard but the proper lyrics are “spill the wine take that girl spill the wine take that pearl”“take that pearl” is believed to be a sexual reference if you’re really curious i’m sure google would be glad to enlighten you“spill the wine” was used in the popular motion pictures “boogie nights” “deuce bigalow male gigolo” and “remember the titans”the song can also be heard in the “dexter” episode “a horse of a different color”the song has been covered by the isley brothers the bside players juan ma y su sonido costeño 2nu lalo schifrin melvin sparks michael hutchence the dream syndicate lighter shade of brown los mocosos and freaked out flower children one more burdon tidbit burdon was indeed the “eggman” john lennon was referring to in the song “i am the walrus” once again this bit of trivia is a bit beyond r rated so while i can’t help you google i’m sure can discuss this story about online comments sorry the browser you are using is not currently supported disqus actively supports the following browsers firefox chrome internet explorer 11safari
