minutes or less i thought the cost was quite high for this service i wish dentists listed their prices on their websites so you know before you go was this post helpful to you yes no report prohibited

that i shouldn’t pay hardly anything because all your equipment and electric etc is already covered your hygienist who “allegedly” is making 53 an hour lucky if she is at half that does 90 of the job by hand of my appointment only 20 minutes are actually spent with her hands in my mouth that’s why it is multiple appointments try charging 1500 hour and see the back lash that is why we need terms like scaling you can not charge 1500 for “scraping” your teeth that would be outrageous another tell tale sign it is a scam is at the end of my 1st visit i asked as to the costs and nobody could even ball park the price as if i am the only one to ever need this treatment but after i got rocked with my bill i questioned the cost they read it down like the menu was rite in front of their face prior to the procedure not a clue so please after you jam it up our butts have the common decency of not lie too was this post helpful to you yes no report prohibited or spam its a racket part 2amount

by your clients and when you list your 10k chair equipment electric rent water napkins rinse cups etc you end up with a pretty big list what you don’t include however is an actual bread down of the costs per patient i mean that list makes it look like your taking it in the shorts a thousand to clean your teeth doesn’t even cover the chair you bought for me to sit in but after ten years and thousands of patients my cost on that chair is really less the a couple dollars i choose to drive a truck that cost me 12k used in excellent condition if i drive a new 60k truck can i now charge you a lot more for hanging your siding i buy equipment based on will it improve my quality in less time resulting in a profit for me not to raise my prices before i went to my dentist he did not even know i existed thus his equipment purchase was not based on me at all was this post helpful to you yes no report prohibited or spam its a racket part 1amount 279000posted by east coast chris in phila pa
