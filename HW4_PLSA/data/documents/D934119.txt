this page air travel is a bit like riding a bike after you’ve done it for a while it becomes second nature however the world of airport terminals and baggage claims can be pretty overwhelming to the uninitiated especially kids traveling alone so today tpg contributor jason steele offers guidelines for helping unaccompanied minors get from gate to gate worry free update united has increased the age of passengers who must use the unaccompanied minor service from 5 to 11 years old to 5 to 15 years old the site reads “for tickets purchased on or after december 14 2015 children 5 to 15 years of age who travel on an aircraft without a parent legal guardian or someone at least 18 years of age are considered unaccompanied minors and are subject to certain restrictions” the unaccompanied minor service charge is still 150 each way and is not available to children over the age of 15 as a child i was always very excited and a little bit nervous to fly by myself to visit my grandparents back then in the eighties arranging for airline staff to escort an unaccompanied minor was free and easy just like checking baggage and like checked baggage there were occasionally some problems which led airlines to eventually increase safeguards and pass the costs on to passengers like all airline policies and fees those for accompanied minors vary between airlines and are constantly subject to change for example american airlines recently announced that it would start charging a 150 fee for unaccompanied children ages 1214 whereas the fee previously applied only to children age 511 in this post i’ll explain the unaccompanied minor um policies of some major domestic airlines and offer recommendations for how to help the kids in your life travel safely and comfortably traveling as an

courtesy of shutterstock tips for choosing an airline for an unaccompanied minor1 travel with connections many cities can only be reached with a connection but that’s a challenge with um travel if you need to send a child ages 57 on an itinerary with a connection you pretty much have to go with united otherwise someone will have to drive or otherwise travel to the nearest city with a nonstop flight even when a connection is permitted i think that parents should strongly consider going out of their way to put an unaccompanied minor on a nonstop flight or a direct flight with a stop but no plane change even if it means paying more or driving farther to an alternate airport2 shop around the prices for unaccompanied minor service vary tremendously with alaska being the least at 25 each way for nonstop and direct flights and the three major legacy airlines charging 150 for the same service parents should first consider alaska and southwest which charge at most 50 each way followed by the remaining carriers which typically charge 100 each way3 tween travel another area where airlines differ is in their policies for “tweens” which are children ages 1215 southwest united alaska and the three largest canadian airlines all allow tweens to fly essentially as adults without paying for unaccompanied minor service parents need to take into account the travel experience and comfort level of each child before allowing them to travel without the um service on a nonstop flight and with family escorting kids to and from the gate this can be a great option escorting kids to and from their gate will help them feel more comfortable image courtesy of shutterstockother tips for unaccompanied minor travel1 plan carefully it’s worth repeating that parents should do everything possible to avoid connecting flights as that is where kids will have the highest chance of being stranded or having other travel problems many airlines forbid unaccompanied minors from booking the last flight out but it’s a good idea to avoid those flights even when permitted in fact flights earlier in the day are the least likely to be delayed by mechanical and weather issues and offer the best chance for being reaccommodated in the event of cancellations2 use a checklist sending a child off alone can be a bit stressful and it’s easy to forget one or two important steps thankfully alaska airlines offers a great checklist for children traveling alone even if your child is flying another carrier most of the items on their list will still apply alaska airlines has a great checklist you can use to get your child ready even when flying on another carrier3 give the child a phone there’s no need to buy your child the latest smartphone but if he or she is old enough to operate a simple handheld then you should definitely purchase an inexpensive nocontract phone just for travel that way you should be able to reach your child no matter what happens rather than rely 100 on the airlines which are far from perfect4 be careful with nonrefundable fees many airlines make the unaccompanied minor fee nonrefundable so don’t be in a hurry to pay that fee when you book the ticket pay it at the airport instead just in case your travel plans have to change for any reason5 use travel funds and fee credits to offset the pain of expensive um fees there are a few tricks you can use for example airlines often hand out travel credit vouchers for service failures and um fees often can be covered by these vouchers um fees are also eligible for reimbursement using the 200 annual airline fee credit offered by the american express platinum card or similar credits offered by other cards finally you can redeem miles from your barclaycard arrival plus or capital one venture rewards cards to pay for this fee or any other airline charge6 consider a meet and greet service a company called global airport concierge  which meets and greet travelers and assists them with luggage also offers an unaccompanied minor service this option might be necessary to fill in a missing step in an itinerary such as when a child has to connect to a flight on another airline master card cardholders receive

dont get this culture of fear liability and protecting children from learning how to be welladjusted adults by not letting them figure out how to get where they are going by reading their boarding pass and signs asking for directions when necessary and finding the restroom by themselves in a location as secure as an airport if your 17 year old needs a constant escort what happens on his 18th birthday will he survive once i turned 10 or 11 i routinely flew from la to chicago to visit my grandmother my parents dropped me off at lax and my grandmother and her friend who could drive picked me up at the curb at ohare back then sometimes my parents would come with me to the gate just like they might do with anyone they took to the airport pre 911 you didnt need a ticket to get past security but not always say if they were in a hurry sometimes i had a nonstop sometimes i had to change flights no big deal it wasnt weird or scary or even unusual in fact there are few places easier to figure out where to go than an airport since there are signs everywhere directing you wherever you need to go because there are lots of other people who have also never been there before  its an airport it was just a matter of looking for the gate number on my ticket and matching it to a sign we didnt have cell phones and we never knew we needed one on the rare occasions i couldnt figure out where i was i just asked an airport employee for directions and guess what they always were happy to help and point me in the right direction people complain that young adults these days dont have any life skills maybe its because their parents never let them learn any rantdoug bergman • 3 years ago sorry jason and brian you probably didnt write this to inflame passions and it is indeed useful information jason steele • 3 years ago certainly i tried to highlight the airlines like southwest that let teenagers fly on their own but parents must realize that each child is different and will be ready to travel independently at different times mike • 3 years ago this is nothing but a huge money suck from the airlines my 17 yearold and 14 yearold were travelling together on a nonstop flight and i was hit with this extortion from delta there was no extra service in fact it was a bit of a joke we were flagged at checking bags and forced to go wait in the typically long delta lines so that we could pay our 100 they put some paper band on the 14 yearolds wrist and gave us some paperwork which we stuffed in the 17 yearolds backpack we were given no further instruction they boarded normally and there was nothing special along the way as they were exiting a fa noticed the band on the 14 yearolds wrist and gave them a nagging lecture about how irresponsible their parents were for not properly checking them in at the gate we had never even been told we were supposed tograndparents were waiting at the destination airport so the fa just letem go nothing but a pure revenue generating maneuver by delta maybe add this to your weekly wish list waive these absurd um fees for elitesstef • 3 years ago one important factor that i think you overlooked is whether the child wants to travel as an unaccompanied minor over the summer i escorted my nephews ages 8 and 10 from bwi to tpa with a change of planes in bna they fly a couple times a year and i asked my nephews if this is something they would be interested in doing unaccompanied their answer was no way i consider my nephews to be mature and thought they would be eager to do something like that but you have to be aware of their feelings about it as well julianna • 3 years ago i think more airlines should let the parents decide after age 12 like united and southwest my kids fly one way nonstop to denver every summer for camp and did not need to be accompanied after age 12 we switched to southwest when the oldest turned 12 so that i wouldnt have to pay the fee for all 3 of my boys people including the gate agent looked at us and them funny if only they knew how much we travel you can still ask the airline for a pass through security to see them off also last spring i had to fly my 13 almost 14 year old out to telluride to meet us after he went to dc with a school group my only choice without fees was united with cell phones these days these fees and services are not necessary for kids 1213 and up sonia martinez • 1 year ago thanks for all the information put together in one spot i tried to get all the updated information one airline at a time and just when i felt that i had it all under control i called delta airlines and they said that they just recently raised their minor fee to 150 like the other big airlines i was ready to book with them because of that anyways feeling frustrated i googled again and saw weflykids and went to their website and their agent walked me through the process and in the end he found me something for less than i was going to spend with delta i was glad to have somebody else do it finallyaha • 2 years ago unfortunately as of december 2015 united changed their unaccompanied minor ages quote children 5 to 15 years of age who are traveling alone must use our unaccompanied minor service a service charge will apply bummer emiliano • 2 years ago i have to kids 14 and 15 who we are planning on sending as unaccompanied minors but i know they will not want to have it as they are actually the ones who guide us at the airports literally would you think american airlines would be kind enough to make an exception for them cherie magnus • 2 years ago lots of good info here but it can get confusing with all of the different rules and fees i use we fly kids and they do everything and quickly figure out the best way to send my unaccompanied grandkids across the country to camp debbie lerner • 2 years ago i really got frustrated with all of the different fees and regulations regarding the different ages etc i saw an ad for weflykids online and i just called them and the agent was able to book me a flight which in the end saved me a few hundred dollars considering i was ready to pay 300 roundtrip in chaperoning fees for each of my 2 kids i definitely would recommend those guyskiley rivera • 3 years ago i do have to say this amenity is a relief to a worried parent especially to one who went through a scary travelling experience when she was young i used to travel quite often to visit friends and family alone from a young age once on a trip to pittsburgh from cleveland oh i was nearly lured into a bathroom and later a hotel by a young man claiming to be a mormon from utah i left my baggage behind when he tried to physically drag me into a car outside on the curb of course by the time security came to help he was long gone i was 15 yrs old whomever thinks paying for an um to be attended to is a money meandering scheme is beyond senseless three hundred dollars can never replace your childs life logan gogarty • 3 years ago in the post it says  many cities can only be reached with a connection but that’s a challenge with um travel if you need to send a child ages 57 on an itinerary with a connection you pretty much have to go with united is that still true i was reading the united policy and it stated restrictions for unaccompanied minor travel unaccompanied minors can only travel on nonstop flights operated by united or united express® united does not offer unaccompanied minor service to or from other airlines flights are there any airlines that let the uam have connections heather • 3 years ago we are considering flying the kids um to spend the summer with their dad do they charge per child each way or just each way i have seen it written both ways on different airline sites but most airlines i am finding do not specify any assistance would be appreciated as we determine which airline to utilize2ruse • 3 years agomake sure the airline and um have alternate phone numbers for everyone involved in case the primary one doesnt work  i work at sfo and there was a comedy of errors recently when grandparents were meeting a teenage granddaughter  apparently the airline had an invalid phone number in san francisco and simply made the teenager sit at the gate on arrival we never figured out for what or how long they would have made her stay there  the grandparents had not been told that it was the airlines policy and this can vary by carrier to hold the um on arrival expecting those meeting her to get a pass thru security for this purpose  but nobody told the grandparents about this it was only after about 1 12 hours that someone noticed that there must have been a screwup and went to the gate to investigateboxedlunch • 3 years ago im sure glad that i managed to survive multiple trips to japan wconnections as a reckless 1216 yo minor my parents must have been terribly irresponsible call cpsjusta good guy • 3 years ago our now 17 year old has attended boarding school since he was 13 he has travelled as a um and as a nonum many many times in the past 4 years here are my own tips that i would add to jasons 1  make sure that the cell phone is fully charged and that your child does not use it for games they should have another device that they can use for fun there have been a couple of times that the cell phone was useless because it had been gamed out 2 give you child both cash and a debit card if they are um they probably wont need or use the money but you never know 3 if they do connect in another city rack your brains to find a family member or friend in the connecting city call them and have them lined up as a safety backup in case the final flight gets cancelled of the dozens of trips we only had a few close calls but having your son stranded in detroit or new york is something that can be avoided with good planning brent • 3 years ago please be aware of this ridiculous delta policy when traveling with children on the same plane but in a different class we were on an international flight we booked our kids ages 11 and 13 in coach and my wife and i were booked in business class delta made us pay the unaccompanied minor fee at the ticket counter because we were in different class i spoke with the station manager and he insisted he couldnt waive the fee because it is delta policy which it is he agreed that if i would have booked one child and my wife in coach and one child an myself in business we wouldnt have to pay the fee lesson learned we had no choice but to pay the fees in order to fly that day but we insisted they provide the service so a delta employee escorted us through security and to the gate we sent an email to delta customer service after the flight and they reiterated it was their policy but they did credit my sky miles account with 10000 miles if you are a delta employee and reading this post please consider rescinding your policy for traveling on the same plane with a minor in a different class i can understand not wanting parents to put a five yearold alone in coach but come onguymark • 3 years ago although i am sure your children are well behaved i have noticed that splitclass parties tend to leave their little poppets to the mercies of cabin crew in coach while they relax in business the result is often that half a dozen kids manage to keep an hostess busy to the point that everyone else suffers slower service  simply because the parent didnt open the fruit juice peel back the tray lid provide them a tissue mop up the spilled coke show them where the loo is if there are several unattended children they are obligated to provide more staff which does help with the issue above but costs them more money this is so in the event of an emergency someone will manage to ensure your children know how to use the oxygen mask and retrieve life jacket etc parents wanting to rush from business to coach in an emergency is not an ideal situation as i say i am sure your kids are not like some of the ones i have seen when travelling coach but i can understand why some airlines charge a fee  and if the parents dont want to travel with their own kids then perhaps the other passengers dont really want them around either you point out that if one of the children had been with you in business and one of them with your partner in coach then no fee would apply why did you need that confirmed the children would not be unattended and so no fee would be due as for asking them to change policy i hope they do not  as otherwise the additional costs will be passed on to people without children and those who are prepared to travel with theirs denver ken • 3 years ago wow i am planning some international family trips and now i can watch out for this one thanks for the heads upmike • 3 years ago ouch it essentially means you paid 004 per sky peso 10000 miles for 400 but at least you got something all i got was a letter from delta telling me that i should be thankfulgrateful for the wonderful service they were providing to me maybe another wish to add give bonus miles to people that are forced to pay the um tax and i wonder does the fee count towards the mqd on delta abeagle knots • 3 years ago im amazed at the rapacious fees i had assumed this was free just like the extra service for the disabled not pc • 3 years ago especially considering most kids become mentally disabled for the teen years
