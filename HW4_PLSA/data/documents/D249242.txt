fuel oil also known as kerosene diesel fuel home heating oil coal oil jp5chemical reference numbers cas 8008206 and 70892103fuel oil is a general term for a number of burnable liquids made from crude oil most common is fuel oil no1 also called kerosene range oil and jet fuel jp5 fuel oils 1d and 2d are diesel fuels fuel oil no 2 is home heating oil and fuel oil no 4 is a diesel fuel for boats all fuel oil mixtures have similar chemical and physical properties fuel oils are used to run many types of engines lamps and heaters sometimes small amounts of fuel oil are stored in portable containers for use in space heaters to clean metal parts or used in camp stoves or lanterns most fuel oil entering the environment comes from spills or leaking storage tanks when spilled on soil some components of fuel oil attach to soil furthermore fuel spilled on water or soil evaporates into the air fuel oil can also contaminate soil sediments and private drinking water supplies information on this page has been organized into three categories please choose one of the following tabs exposure information standards health effects breathing people can breathe fuel oil vapors when filling tanks or after a spill other situations include using kerosene heaters or using kerosene to clean machinery or paint brushes if water supplies are contaminated people can inhale the vapors as they bathe do laundry or use the water for other household purposes fuel oil spills in basements or attached garages can seriously contaminate the air inside of homes drinkingeating lowlevel exposure can occur when contaminated water is used for drinking and for preparing food touching some fuel oil can pass through the skin when people use it as a solvent spill it on their skin or use contaminated water since some of the chemicals in fuel oil attach to soil particles children can be exposed as they play in contaminated soil air no standards exist for the amount of fuel oil vapors allowed in homes or workplaces most people can smell fuel oil at levels as low as 01 parts per million ppm in air use fuel oil only in wellventilated areas large spills should be cleaned by a professional all spills require significant cleaning and venting tightly seal and properly label storage containers be sure to vent kerosene heaters outdoors this will reduce your exposure to carbon monoxide a deadly gas that can be formed as kerosene burns water although there are no drinking water standards for fuel oil there are standards for some of its ingredients aromatic compounds such as benzene toluene and xylene make up about 35 of fuel oil the standard for benzene is 5 parts per billion ppb toluene is 1 part per million ppm and xylene is 10 ppm we suggest you stop drinking or cooking with water containing these chemicals at levels higher than the standard or if you smell a kerosene odor or see a oily sheen if levels are very high you should avoid washing bathing or using the water for other purposes as well most people can withstand short exposures to fuel oil vapors without any problems however breathing fuel oil vapors over time can affect a persons ability to smell and taste high levels can cause headaches nausea lightheadedness poor coordination increased blood pressure and difficulty concentrating skin contact with fuel oil can cause irritation that results in itchiness redness pain blisters and peeling swallowing fuel oil can cause vomiting diarrhea swelling of the stomach cramps coughing drowsiness restlessness irritability and breathing difficulties drinking more than an ounce can result in coma or death most accidental poisonings involve children many of these children drink kerosene that was being kept in old soft drink bottles in general a chemical will affect the same organ systems in all people who are exposed however the seriousness of the effects may vary from person to person a persons reaction depends on several things including individual health heredity previous exposure to chemicals including medicines and personal habits such as smoking or drinking itâ€™s also important to consider the length of exposure to the chemical the amount of chemical exposure and whether the chemical was inhaled touched or eaten cancer exposure to fuel oil is not known to cause cancer in humans however longterm exposure to benzene the most toxic component of fuel oil is known to cause leukemia organ systems prolonged or high level exposures to fuel oil can cause kidney and liver damage nervous system damage increased blood pressure and reduced blood clotting reproductive effects reproductive and growthrelated effects of fuel oil are not known medical tests fuel oil leaves the body within 23 days although benzene toluene and xylene can be measured in blood there is no good method to determine the level of your exposure through tests of the nervous system kidneys liver and blood your doctor can evaluate the health effects of fuel oil exposure seek medical advice if you have any symptoms that you think may be related to chemical exposure last revised march 13 2017questions cant find what youre looking for contact us
