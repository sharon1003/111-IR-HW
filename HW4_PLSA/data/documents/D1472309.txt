by jenna busch on may 16 2016begin slideshowcs interview josh gad talks voicing chuck in the angry birds movie if you own a mobile device you’ve probably played some iteration of angry birds shooting different avian creatures at green pigs the insanely popular game is now a film and stars the voice talents of jason sudeikis red maya rudolph matilda peter dinklage mighty eagle danny mc bride bomb and josh gad who plays the super speedy bird chuck the gang has to band together to save their land from the pig invasion chuck is hanging in anger management class with matilda and bomb when red enters their lives chuck has a bit of a speed demon issue but he uses it to good advantage when push comes to shove we caught up with gad at the angry birds press day in maui hawaii where he told us about voicing chuck playing video games and working on the film check out what he had to say belowcoming soonnet so chuck is everyone’s favorite angry bird after seeing the film did you know this josh gad i didn’t know thiscs yup everyone has been saying “chuck’s my favorite” all day josh gad aw that’s so sweetcs so tell us about your approach to chuck josh gad well i set out to make him everybody’s favorite i studied birds…cs you did not study birdsjosh gad laughs i did not study birds what if i had what if i went to an aviary for months and just lived among the birds laughs no my approach was—originally i wasn’t keen on doing another animated movie especially so close to “frozen” i felt like been there done that and i didn’t want to confuse my audience which was kids and john cohen the producer he pitched me the movie and specifically the character and there was something so unfiltered fast and furious about this little guy named chuck that i immediately fell in love with i was like oh my god this guy is—he’s just—it’s like mouth can’t keep up with his thoughts and his body goes faster than both of those things i just love the idea of this speed demon who almost speaks in streamofconsciousness and that for me was a very compelling thing to be honest i had a friend growing up one of my best friends this kid david who we used to call motor mouth because he spoke so fast this is my tribute to him cs we all know somebody like that josh gad oh yeah just somebody who is a constant neverending motor cs he’s super fast and he does sort of a quicksilver thing josh gad yeah it’s cool you know what i love about the movie is each of the birds is distinct unique and seeing the various shades of anger is really fun and compelling that’s what’s so fun about the movie they put together this ridiculous cast you’ve got danny mc bride kate mc kinnon maya rudolph you’ve got sean penn in there peter dinklage and you know there’s this element to it that just allows every person to just kill and shine especially with a game like this that everyone brings their familiar baggage to it’s amazing because you’re finally seeing the origin of how each of these characters learned to use their anger to attack the pigs and how each one of their anger manifests into a slingshot into a bomb into a speed demon like chuck i think that element is what’s so fun about the film and not just for chuck but for all of them cs in most animated films you don’t get to record together i’m assuming that’s the case here as well josh gad no we didn’t it’s a bummer even on “frozen” i never had a session with any of the characters with any of the actors so the most time you get to spend with your costars is events like this where you just chill you’re like “by the way you’re really good in the film i like you as that red bird” sadly no we didn’t get to play but the directors are so great because they’ll feed you the other lines and just let you discover and that’s what so fun about animation the sky’s the limit it’s just what you’re vocally capable of putting out there cs i’m sure they let you improv but does that ever get weird you’ve got all of the other actors also doing improv—do they ever grab a storyline or something you come up with and say okay we’re changing everything else for this josh gad it will happen occasionally i mean usually you’ll improv within the context of a scene because you don’t want to derail that but it will start with an idea and then that idea will sort of avalanche into some different thoughts especially with improv it usually comes down to comedic tangents so they’ll let you tangent within the context of the scene but i don’t know if i’ve ever improved anything that’s changed the entire story development maybe i can’t remember if i have or haven’t but that would be quite a feat cs was the singing improved or was that…josh gad so the singing was their idea but within again once they gave me the springboard to sing it became its own thing give me a little and i’ll take a lot so yeah cs so did you have the whole script i talk to a lot of actors who only get their lines in an animated film josh gad if a script existed it was never shown to me laughs they were very protective of it apparently even on frozen i never read a script i’ll never forget the first time i saw the film i sat there and i was shocked that hans turned on the sisters i was shocked i was like huh it’s one of those things it’s very unlike liveaction you are constantly—you’re as surprised as the audience cs have you seen it yet josh gad no i haven’t seen it in its entirety yet cs i’m dying to know what you thought of the mighty eagle stuffjosh gad oh i’ve seen the mighty eagle stuff and it’s incredibly funny peter dinklage is so perfect for that role it’s just—that pomposity that the character has just destroys me the swimming in the “stream” is one of my favorite moments of the film cs for “frozen 2” are they telling you about the story at all josh gad no they’ll just drop little hints but for the most part not really it’s still very much in development cs i know with disney films they often get part way done and then go back and rework the entire thing was that something they did here did they change things josh gad yeah with animation i consider it a luxury in liveaction what you shoot is what you shoot sometimes if you’re lucky or unlucky the film will require reshoots but that will be like two weeks to figure things out but you rarely get a chance to say oh that story thread is completely broken let’s go back and change it all with animation it’s all handdrawn or computer animated you have the opportunity to go futz with it and discover and really really work on it until it’s hopefully near as perfect as it can be so with disney or sony or dream works or whatever it is in my experience that’s always been a common thread threads will be broken and always at first you’re like oh what do we have here and then you start to weed out the stuff that’s not working and develop the stuff that is working and that’s where you get your gem angry birds will hit theaters on may 20 201640 images share
