millions of working americans don’t know where their next meal is coming from we sent three photographers to explore hunger in three very different parts of the united states each giving different faces to the same statistic onesixth of americans don’t have enough food to eat click below to launch galleries osage iowa photographs by amy toensing on our nation’s richest lands farmers grow corn and soybeans used to feed livestock make cooking oil and produce sweeteners yet one in eight iowans often goes hungry with children the most vulnerable to food insecurity houston texas photographs by kitra cahana despite a strong economy houston is ringed by neighborhoods where many working families can’t afford groceries hunger has grown faster in america’s suburbs than in its cities over the past decade creating a class of “suv poor”bronx new york photographs by stephanie sinclair urban neighborhoods with pervasive unemployment and poverty are home to the hungriest the south bronx has the highest rate of food insecurity in the country 37 percent compared with 166 for new york city as a whole on a goldgray morning in mitchell county iowa christina dreier sends her son keagan to school without breakfast he is three years old barrelchested and stubborn and usually refuses to eat the free meal he qualifies for at preschool faced with a dwindling pantry dreier has decided to try some tough love if she sends keagan to school hungry maybe he’ll eat the free breakfast which will leave more food at home for lunch dreier knows her gambit might backfire and it does keagan ignores the school breakfast on offer and is so hungry by lunchtime that dreier picks through the dregs of her freezer in hopes of filling him and his little sister up she shakes the last seven chicken nuggets onto a battered baking sheet adds the remnants of a bag of tater tots and a couple of hot dogs from the fridge and slides it all into the oven she’s gone through most of the food she got last week from a local food pantry her own lunch will be the bits of potato left on the kids’ plates “i eat lunch if there’s enough” she says “but the kids are the most important they have to eat first”the fear of being unable to feed her children hangs over dreier’s days she and her husband jim pit one bill against the next—the phone against the rent against the heat against the gas—trying always to set aside money to make up for what they can’t get from the food pantry or with their food stamps issued by the supplemental nutrition assistance program snap congressional cuts to snap last fall of five billion dollars pared her benefits from 205 to 172 a month on this particular afternoon dreier is worried about the family van which is on the brink of repossession she and jim need to open a new bank account so they can make automatic payments instead of scrambling to pay in cash but that will happen only if jim finishes work early it’s peak harvest time and he often works until eight at night applying pesticides on commercial farms for 14 an hour running the errand would mean forgoing overtime pay that could go for groceries it’s the same every month dreier says bills go unpaid because when push comes to shove food wins out “we have to eat you know” she says only the slightest hint of resignation in her voice “we can’t starve”“it’s not enough” christina dreier describes the difficulty of feeding her family on an inadequate budget chances are good that if you picture what hunger looks like you don’t summon an image of someone like christina dreier white married clothed and housed even a bit overweight the image of hunger in america today differs markedly from depressionera images of the gauntfaced unemployed scavenging for food on urban streets “this is not your grandmother’s hunger” says janet poppendieck a sociologist at the city university of new york “today more working people and their families are hungry because wages have declined”in the united states more than half of hungry households are white and twothirds of those with children have at least one working adult—typically in a fulltime job with this new image comes a new lexicon in 2006 the u s government replaced “hunger” with the term “food insecure” to describe any household where sometime during the previous year people didn’t have enough food to eat by whatever name the number of people going hungry has grown dramatically in the u s increasing to 48 million by 2012—a fivefold jump since the late 1960s including an increase of 57 percent since the late 1990s privately run programs like food pantries and soup kitchens have mushroomed too in 1980 there were a few hundred emergency food programs across the country today there are 50000 finding food has become a central worry for millions of americans one in six reports running out of food at least once a year in many european countries by contrast the number is closer to one in 20 to witness hunger in america today is to enter a twilight zone where refrigerators are so frequently bare of all but mustard and ketchup that it provokes no remark inspires no embarrassment here dinners are cooked using macaroniandcheese mixes and other processed ingredients from food pantries and fresh fruits and vegetables are eaten only in the first days after the snap payment arrives here you’ll meet hungry farmhands and retired schoolteachers hungry families who are in the u s without papers and hungry families whose histories stretch back to the mayflower here pocketing food from work and skipping meals to make food stretch are so common that such practices barely register as a way of coping with hunger and are simply a way of life it can be tempting to ask families receiving food assistance if you’re really hungry then how can you be—as many of them are—overweight the answer is “this paradox that hunger and obesity are two sides of the same coin” says melissa boteach vice president of the poverty and prosperity program of the center for american progress “people making tradeoffs between food that’s filling but not nutritious and may actually contribute to obesity” for many of the hungry in america the extra pounds that result from a poor diet are collateral damage—an unintended side effect of hunger itself help for the hungry more than 48 million americans rely on what used to be called food stamps now snap the supplemental nutrition assistance program in 2013 benefits totaled 75 billion but payments to most households dropped the average monthly benefit was 13307 a person less than 150 a meal snap recipients typically run through their monthly allotment in three weeks then turn to food pantries who qualifies for snap households with gross incomes no more than 130 percent of the poverty rate for a family of four that qualifying point is 31005 a year qualifying incomes in alaska and hawaii are higher than in the contiguous u s as the face of hunger has changed so has its address the town of spring texas is where ranchland meets houston’s sprawl a suburb of curving streets and shade trees and privacy fences the suburbs are the home of the american dream but they are also a place where poverty is on the rise as urban housing has gotten more expensive the working poor have been pushed out today hunger in the suburbs is growing faster than in cities having more than doubled since 2007 yet in the suburbs america’s hungry don’t look the part either they drive cars which are a necessity not a luxury here cheap clothes and toys can be found at yard sales and thrift shops making a middleclass appearance affordable consumer electronics can be bought on installment plans so the hungry rarely lack phones or televisions of all the suburbs in the country northwest houston is one of the best places to see how people live on what might be called a minimumwage diet it has one of the highest percentages of households receiving snap assistance where at least one family member holds down a job the jefferson sisters meme and kai live here in a fourbedroom twocargarage twobath home with kai’s boyfriend frank and an extended family that includes their invalid mother their five sons a daughterinlaw and five grandchildren the house has a rickety desktop computer in the living room and a television in most rooms but only two actual beds nearly everyone sleeps on mattresses or piles of blankets spread out on the floor though all three adults work fulltime their income is not enough to keep the family consistently fed without assistance the root problem is the lack of jobs that pay wages a family can live on so food assistance has become the government’s—and society’s—way to supplement low wages the jeffersons receive 125 in food stamps each month and a charity brings in meals for their bedridden matriarch like most of the new american hungry the jeffersons face not a total absence of food but the gnawing fear that the next meal can’t be counted on when meme shows me the family’s food supply the refrigerator holds takeout boxes and beverages but little fresh food two cupboards are stocked with a smattering of canned beans and sauces a pair of freezers in the garage each contain a single layer of food enough to fill bellies for just a few days meme says she took the children aside a few months earlier to tell them they were eating too much and wasting food besides “i told them if they keep wasting we have to go live on the corner beg for money or something”stranded in a food desert tens of thousands of people in houston and in other parts of the u s live in a food desert they’re more than half a mile from a supermarket and don’t own a car because of poverty illness or age public transportation may not fill the gap small markets or fastfood restaurants may be within walking distance but not all accept vouchers if they do costs may be higher and nutritious options fewer jacqueline christian is another houston mother who has a fulltime job drives a comfortable sedan and wears flattering clothes her older son 15yearold ja’zarrian sports bright orange air jordans there’s little clue to the family’s hardship until you learn that their clothes come mostly from discount stores that ja’zarrian mowed lawns for a summer to get the sneakers that they’re living in a homeless shelter and that despite receiving 325 in monthly food stamps christian worries about not having enough food “about half of the year”christian works as a home health aide earning 775 an hour at a job that requires her to crisscross houston’s sprawl to see her clients her schedule as much as her wages influences what she eats to save time she often relies on premade food from grocery stores “you can’t go all the way home and cook” she says on a day that includes running a dozen errands and charming her payday loan officer into giving her an extra day christian picks up ja’zarrian and her sevenyearold jerimiah after school as the sun drops in the sky jerimiah begins complaining that he’s hungry the neon glow of a hartz chicken buffet appears up the road and he starts in can’t we just get some gizzards please christian pulls into the drivethrough and orders a combo of fried gizzards and okra for 811 it takes three declined credit cards and an emergency loan from her mother who lives nearby before she can pay for it when the food finally arrives filling the car with the smell of hot grease there’s a collective sense of relief on the drive back to the shelter the boys eat until the gizzards are gone and then drift off to sleep christian says she knows she can’t afford to eat out and that fast food isn’t a healthy meal but she’d felt too stressed—by time by jerimiah’s insistence by how little money she has—not to give in “maybe i can’t justify that to someone who wasn’t here to see you know” she says “but i couldn’t let them down and not get the food”to supplement what they get from the food pantry the cashstrapped reams family forages in the woods near their osage home for puffball mushrooms and grapes kyera reams cans homegrown vegetables when they are in season and plentiful so that her family can eat healthfully all year “i’m resourceful with my food” she says “i think about what people did in the great depression”of course it is possible to eat well cheaply in america but it takes resources and knowhow that many lowincome americans don’t have kyera reams of osage iowa puts an incredible amount of energy into feeding her family of six a healthy diet with the help of staples from food banks and 650 in monthly snap benefits a stayathome mom with a high school education reams has taught herself how to can fresh produce and forage for wild ginger and cranberries when she learned that snap benefits could be used to buy vegetable plants she dug two gardens in her yard she has learned about wild mushrooms so she can safely pick ones that aren’t poisonous and has lobbied the local library to stock field guides to edible wild plants“we wouldn’t eat healthy at all if we lived off the foodbank food” reams says many foods commonly donated to—or bought by—food pantries are high in salt sugar and fat she estimates her family could live for three months on the nutritious foods she’s saved up the reamses have food security in other words because kyera makes procuring food her fulltime job along with caring for her husband whose disability payments provide their only income but most of the working poor don’t have the time or knowhow required to eat well on little often working multiple jobs and night shifts they tend to eat on the run healthful food can be hard to find in socalled food deserts—communities with few or no fullservice groceries jackie christian didn’t resort to feeding her sons fried gizzards because it was affordable but because it was easy given the dramatic increase in cheap fast foods and processed foods when the hungry have money to eat they often go for what’s convenient just as betteroff families do senior care in rural arkansas many elderly people don’t have enough to eat and rely on food banks for help charolette tidwell and ken kupchick work tirelessly to make sure every person is fed it’s a cruel irony that people in rural iowa can be malnourished amid forests of cornstalks running to the horizon iowa dirt is some of the richest in the nation even bringing out the poet in agronomists who describe it as “black gold” in 2007 iowa’s fields produced roughly onesixth of all corn and soybeans grown in the u s churning out billions of bushels these are the very crops that end up on christina dreier’s kitchen table in the form of hot dogs made of cornraised beef mountain dew sweetened with corn syrup and chicken nuggets fried in soybean oil they’re also the foods that the u s government supports the most in 2012 it spent roughly 11 billion to subsidize and insure commodity crops like corn and soy with iowa among the states receiving the highest subsidies the government spends much less to bolster the production of the fruits and vegetables its own nutrition guidelines say should make up half the food on our plates in 2011 it spent only 16 billion to subsidize and insure “specialty crops”—the bureaucratic term for fruits and vegetables those priorities are reflected at the grocery store where the price of fresh food has risen steadily while the cost of sugary treats like soda has dropped since the early 1980s the real cost of fruits and vegetables has increased by 24 percent meanwhile the cost of nonalcoholic beverages—primarily sodas most sweetened with corn syrup—has dropped by 27 percent“we’ve created a system that’s geared toward keeping overall food prices low but does little to support healthy highquality food” says global food expert raj patel “the problem can’t be fixed by merely telling people to eat their fruits and vegetables because at heart this is a problem about wages about poverty”when christina dreier’s cupboards start to get bare she tries to persuade her kids to skip snack time “but sometimes they eat saltine crackers because we get that from the food bank” she said sighing “it ain’t healthy for them but i’m not going to tell them they can’t eat if they’re hungry”the dreiers have not given up on trying to eat well like the reamses they’ve sown patches of vegetables and a stretch of sweet corn in the large green yard carved out of the cornfields behind their house but when the garden is done for the year christina fights a battle every time she goes to the supermarket or the food bank in both places healthy foods are nearly out of reach when the food stamps come in she splurges on her monthly supply of produce including a bag of organic grapes and a bag of apples “they love fruit” she says with obvious pride but most of her food dollars go to the meat eggs and milk that the food bank doesn’t provide with noodles and sauce from the food pantry a spaghetti dinner costs her only the 388 required to buy hamburger for the sauce what she has christina says is a kitchen with nearly enough food most of the time it’s just those dicey moments after a new bill arrives or she needs gas to drive the kids to town that make it hard “we’re not starved around here” she says one morning as she mixes up powdered milk for her daughter “but some days we do go a little hungry”crops taxpayers support with subsidies federal crop subsidies began in the 1920s when a quarter of the u s population worked on farms the funds were meant to buffer losses from fluctuating harvests and natural disasters today most subsidies go to a few staple crops produced mainly by large agricultural companies and cooperatives how subsidized crops affect diet subsidized corn is used for biofuel corn syrup and mixed with soybeans chicken feed subsidies reduce crop prices but also support the abundance of processed foods which are more affordable but less nutritious across income brackets processed foods make up a large part of the american diet tracie mc millan is the author of the american way of eating and a senior fellow at the schuster institute for
