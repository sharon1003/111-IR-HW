years ago hk–pg tr–jp–tr cap late do–sthe percentage of marine animal extinction at the genus level through the five mass extinctions the holocene extinction otherwise referred to as the sixth extinction or anthropocene extinction is the ongoing extinction event of species during the present holocene epoch mainly as a result of human activity 1 the large number of extinctions spans numerous families of plants and animals including mammals birds amphibians reptiles and arthropods with widespread degradation of highly biodiverse habitats such as coral reefs and rainforest as well as other areas the vast majority of these extinctions is thought to be undocumented the current rate of extinction of species is estimated at 100 to 1000 times higher than natural background rates 2 3the holocene extinction includes the disappearance of large land animals known as megafauna starting at the end of the last ice age megafauna outside of the african continent which did not evolve alongside humans proved highly sensitive to the introduction of new predation and many died out shortly after early humans began spreading and hunting across the earth additionally many african species have also gone extinct in the holocene  these extinctions occurring near the pleistocene – holocene boundary are sometimes referred to as the quaternary extinction event the arrival of humans on different continents coincides with megafaunal extinction the most popular theory is that human overhunting of species added to existing stress conditions although there is debate regarding how much human predation affected their decline certain population declines have been directly correlated with human activity such as the extinction events of new zealand and hawaii aside from humans climate change may have been a driving factor in the megafaunal extinctions especially at the end of the pleistocene the ecology of humanity has been noted as being that of an unprecedented global superpredator that regularly preys on the adults of other apex predators and has worldwide effects on food webs extinctions of species have occurred on every land mass and ocean with many famous examples within africa asia europe australia north and south america and on smaller islands overall the holocene extinction can be characterized by the human impact on the environment the holocene extinction continues into the 21st century with meat consumption overfishing ocean acidification and the decline in amphibian populations being a few broader examples of an almost universal cosmopolitan decline in biodiversity human overpopulation and continued population growth along with profligate consumption are considered to be the primary drivers of this rapid decline 4 5contents

extinction is also known as the sixth extinction due to its possibly being the sixth mass extinct event after the ordovician–silurian extinction events the late devonian extinction the permian–triassic extinction event the triassic–jurassic extinction event and the cretaceous–paleogene extinction event 6 7 8 9 4 1 mass extinctions are characterized by the loss of at least 75 of species within a geologically short period of time 10 11 there is no general agreement on where the holocene or anthropogenic extinction begins and the quaternary extinction event which includes climate change resulting in the end of the last ice age ends or if they should be considered separate events at all 12 13 some have suggested that anthropogenic extinctions may have begun as early as when the first modern humans spread out of africa between 100000 and 200000 years ago which is supported by rapid megafaunal extinction following recent human colonisation in australia new zealand and madagascar 6 in a similar way that any large adaptable predator moving into a new ecosystem would  invasive species  in many cases it is suggested even minimal hunting pressure was enough to wipe out large fauna particularly on geographically isolated islands 14 15 only during the most recent parts of the extinction have plants also suffered large losses 16in the future of life 2002 edward osborne wilson of harvard calculated that if the current rate of human disruption of the biosphere continues onehalf of earths higher lifeforms will be extinct by 2100 a 1998 poll conducted by the american museum of natural history found that seventy percent of biologists acknowledge an ongoing anthropogenic extinction event 17 at present the rate of extinction of species is estimated at 100 to 1000 times higher than the background extinction rate the historically typical rate of extinction in terms of the natural evolution of the planet 2 3 18 and also the current rate of extinction is therefore 10 to 100 times higher than any of the previous mass extinctions in the history of earth one scientist estimates the current extinction rate may be 10000 times the background extinction rate nevertheless most scientists predict a much lower extinction rate than this outlying estimate 19 theoretical ecologist stuart pimm stated for plants the extinction rate is 100 times higher than normal 20in a pair of studies published in 2015 extrapolation from observed extinction of hawaiian snails led to the conclusion that 7 of all species on earth may have been lost already 21 22while there is widespread consensus in the scientific community that human activity is accelerating the extinction of many animal species through the destruction of wild lands the consumption of animals as resources or luxuries and the persecution of species that humans view as threats or competitors 23 some contend that this biotic destruction has yet to rise to the level of the previous five mass extinctions stuart pimm for example asserts that the sixth mass extinction is something that hasn’t happened yet – we are on the edge of it 24 in november 2017 a statement titled  world scientists’ warning to humanity a second notice  led by eight authors and signed by 15364 scientists from 184 countries asserted that among other things we have unleashed a mass extinction event the sixth in roughly 540 million years wherein many current life forms could be annihilated or at least committed to extinction by the end of this century 1anthropocene  editmain article anthropocene a diagram showing the ecological processes of coral reefs before and after the anthropocene the abundance of species extinctions considered anthropogenic or due to human activity have sometimes especially when referring to hypothesized future events been collectively called the anthropocene extinction 25 26 23 anthropocene is a term introduced in 2000 it is now posited by some that a new geological epoch has begun characterised by the most abrupt and widespread extinction of species since the cretaceous–paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago 6the term anthropocene is being used more frequently by scientists and some commentators may refer to the current and projected future extinctions as part of a longer holocene extinction 27 28 the holocene–anthropocene boundary is contested with some commentators asserting significant human influence on climate for much of what is normally regarded as the holocene epoch 29 other commentators place the holocene–anthropocene boundary at the industrial revolution while also saying that  formal adoption of this term in the near future will largely depend on its utility particularly to earth scientists working on late holocene successions it has been suggested that human activity has made the period following the mid20th century different enough from the rest of the holocene to consider it a new geological epoch known as the anthropocene 30 which was considered for implementation into the timeline of earths history by the international commission on stratigraphy in 2016 31 32 in order to constitute the holocene as an extinction event scientists must determine exactly when anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions began to measurably alter natural atmospheric levels at a global scale and when these alterations caused changes to global climate employing chemical proxies from antarctic ice cores researchers have estimated the fluctuations of carbon dioxide co 2 and methane gases ch 4 in the earth’s atmosphere for the late pleistocene and holocene epochs 29 based on studies that estimated fluctuations of carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere using chemical proxies from antarctic ice cores general argumentation of when the peak of the anthropocene occurred pertains to the timeframe within the previous two centuries typically beginning with the industrial revolution when greenhouse gas levels were recorded by contemporary methods at its highest 33 34influences  editcompetition by humans  editsee also megafaunal mass extinctions and quaternary extinction event the percent of megafauna on different land masses over time with the arrival of humans indicated the holocene extinction is mainly caused by human activity 7 8 23 9 4 extinction of animals plants and other organisms caused by human actions may go as far back as the late pleistocene over 12000 years ago 23 there is a correlation between megafaunal extinction and the arrival of humans and human overpopulation and human population growth along with overconsumption and consumption growth most prominently in the past two centuries are regarded as one of the underlying causes of extinction 7 35 4 5 36megafauna were once found on every continent of the world and large islands such as new zealand and madagascar but are now almost exclusively found on the continent of africa with notable comparisons on australia and the islands previously mentioned experiencing population crashes and trophic cascades shortly after the earliest human settlers 14 15 it has been suggested that the african megafauna survived because they evolved alongside humans 6 the timing of south american megafaunal extinction appears to precede human arrival although the possibility that human activity at the time impacted the global climate enough to cause such an extinction has been suggested 6it has been noted in the face of such evidence that humans are unique in ecology as an unprecedented global superpredator regularly preying on large numbers of fully grown terrestrial and marine apex predators and with a great deal of influence over food webs and climatic systems worldwide 37 although significant debate exists as to how much human predation and indirect effects contributed to prehistoric extinctions certain population crashes have been directly correlated with human arrival 13 6 23agriculture  editthe dodo a flightless bird native to mauritius became extinct during the mid to late 17th century due to habitat destruction and predation by introduced mammals 38human civilization flourished in accordance to the efficiency and intensification of prevailing subsistence systems 39 local communities that acquire more subsistence strategies increased in number to combat competitive pressures of land utilization 29 39 therefore the holocene developed competition on the basis of agriculture the growth of agriculture has then introduced newer means of climate change pollution and ecological development 40habitat destruction by humans including oceanic devastation such as through overfishing and contamination and the modification and destruction of vast tracts of land and river systems around the world to meet solely humancentered ends with 13 percent of earths icefree land surface now used as rowcrop agricultural sites 26 percent used as pastures and 4 percent urbanindustrial areas 41  thus replacing the original local ecosystems 42 other related human causes of the extinction event include deforestation hunting pollution 43 the introduction in various regions of nonnative species and the widespread transmission of infectious diseases spread through livestock and crops 3recent investigations about huntergatherer landscape burning has a major implication for the current debate about the timing of the anthropocene and the role that humans may have played in the production of greenhouse gases prior to the industrial revolution 39 studies on early huntergatherers raises questions about the current use of population size or density as a proxy for the amount of land clearance and anthropogenic burning that took place in preindustrial times 44 45 scientists have questioned the correlation between population size and early territorial alterations 45 ruddiman and ellis research paper in 2009 makes the case that early farmers involved in systems of agriculture used more land per capita than growers later in the holocene who intensified their labor to produce more food per unit of area thus per laborer arguing that agricultural involvement in rice production implemented thousands of years ago by relatively small populations have created significant environmental impacts through largescale means of deforestation 39while a number of humanderived factors are recognized as potentially contributing to rising atmospheric concentrations of ch 4 and co 2 deforestation and territorial clearance practices associated with agricultural development may be contributing most to these concentrations globally 33 46 39 scientists that are employing a variance of archaeological and paleoecological data argue that the processes contributing to substantial human modification of the environment spanned many thousands of years ago on a global scale and thus not originating as early as the industrial revolution gaining popularity on his uncommon hypothesis palaeoclimatologist william ruddiman in 2003 stipulated that in the early holocene 11000 years ago atmospheric carbon dioxide and methane levels fluctuated in a pattern which was different from the pleistocene epoch before it 29 44 46 he argued that the patterns of the significant decline of co 2 levels during the last ice age of the pleistocene inversely correlates to the holocene where there have been dramatic increases of co 2 around 8000 years ago and ch 4 levels 3000 years after that 46 the correlation between the decrease of co 2 in the pleistocene and the increase of it during the holocene implies that the causation of this spark of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere was the growth of human agriculture during the holocene such as the anthropogenic expansion of human land use and irrigation 29 46islands  edithuman arrival in the caribbean around 6000 years ago is correlated with the extinction of many species 47 examples include many different genera of ground and arboreal sloths across all islands these sloths were generally smaller than those found on the south american continent megalocnus were the largest genus at up to 90 kilograms 200 lb acratocnus were mediumsized relatives of modern twotoed sloths endemic to cuba imagocnus also of cuba neocnus and many others 48recent research based on archaeological and paleontological digs on 70 different pacific islands has shown that numerous species became extinct as people moved across the pacific starting 30000 years ago in the bismarck archipelago and solomon islands 49 it is currently estimated that among the bird species of the pacific some 2000 species have gone extinct since the arrival of humans representing a 20 drop in the biodiversity of birds worldwide 50genyornis newtoni a 2metre 7 ft tall flightless bird evidence of egg cooking in this species is the first evidence of megafaunal hunting by humans on australia 51the first settlers are thought to have arrived in the islands between 300 and 800 ce with european arrival in the 16th century hawaii is notable for its endemism of plants birds insects mollusks and fish 30 of its organisms are endemic many of its species are endangered or have gone extinct primarily due to accidentally introduced species and livestock grazing over 40 of its bird species have gone extinct and it is the location of 75 of extinctions in the united states 52

australia was once home to a large assemblage of megafauna with many parallels to those found on the african continent today australias fauna is characterised by primarily marsupial mammals and many reptiles and birds all existing as giant forms until recently humans arrived on the continent very early about 50000 years ago 6 the extent human arrival contributed is controversial climatic drying of australia 40000–60000 years ago was an unlikely cause as it was less severe in speed or magnitude than previous regional climate change which failed to kill off megafauna extinctions in australia continued from original settlement until today in both plants and animals whilst many more animals and plants have declined or are endangered 53due to the older timeframe and the soil chemistry on the continent very little subfossil preservation evidence exists relative to elsewhere 54 however continentwide extinction of all genera weighing over 100 kilograms and six of seven genera weighing between 45 and 100 kilograms occurred around 46400 years ago 4000 years after human arrival 55 and the fact that megafauna survived until a later date on the island of tasmania following the establishment of a land bridge 56 suggest direct hunting or anthropogenic ecosystem disruption such as firestick farming as likely causes the first evidence of direct human predation leading to extinction in australia was published in 2016 51madagascar  editfurther information wildlife of madagascar and subfossil lemur radiocarbon dating of multiple subfossil specimens shows that now extinct giant lemurs were present in madagascar until after human arrival within 500 years of the arrival of humans between 2500–2000 years ago nearly all of madagascars distinct endemic and geographically isolated megafauna became extinct 57 the largest animals of more than 150 kilograms 330 lb were extinct very shortly after the first human arrival with large and mediumsized species dying out after prolonged hunting pressure from an expanding human population moving into more remote regions of the island around 1000 years ago smaller fauna experienced initial increases due to decreased competition and then subsequent declines over the last 500 years 15 all fauna weighing over 10 kilograms 22 lb died out the primary reasons for this are human hunting and habitat loss from early aridification both of which persist and threaten madagascars remaining taxa today  citation neededthe eight or more species of elephant birds giant flightless ratites in the genera aepyornis and mullerornis are extinct from overhunting 58 as well as 17 species of lemur known as giant subfossil lemurs some of these lemurs typically weighed over 150 kilograms 330 lb and fossils have provided evidence of human butchery on many species 59new zealand  editmain article list of extinct animals of new zealand see also biodiversity of new zealand timeline of the new zealand environment and invasive species in new zealand new zealand is characterised by its geographic isolation and island biogeography and had been isolated from mainland australia for 80 million years it was the last large land mass to be colonised by humans the arrival of polynesian settlers circa 12th century resulted in the extinction of all of the islands megafaunal birds within several hundred years 60 the last moa large flightless ratites became extinct within 200 years of the arrival of human settlers 14 the polynesians also introduced the polynesian rat this may have put some pressure on other birds but at the time of early european contact 18th century and colonisation 19th century the bird life was prolific with them the europeans brought ship rats possums cats and mustelids which decimated native bird life some of which had adapted flightlessness and ground nesting habits and others had no defensive behavior as a result of having no extant endemic mammalian predators the kakapo the worlds biggest parrot which is flightless now only exists in managed breeding sanctuaries and nzs national emblem the kiwi is on the endangered bird list 60americas  editmain articles list of north american animals extinct in the holocene and list of south american animals extinct in the holocene reconstructed woolly mammoth bone hut based on finds in mezhyrich the passenger pigeon was a species of pigeon endemic to north america it experienced a rapid decline in the late 1800s due to habitat destruction and intense hunting after the arrival of europeans the last wild bird is thought to have been shot in 1901 there has been a debate as to the extent to which the disappearance of megafauna at the end of the last glacial period can be attributed to human activities by hunting or even by slaughter 61 of prey populations discoveries at monte verde in south america and at meadowcroft rock shelter in pennsylvania have caused a controversy 62 regarding the clovis culture there likely would have been human settlements prior to the clovis culture and the history of humans in the americas may extend back many thousands of years before the clovis culture 62 the amount of correlation between human arrival and megafauna extinction is still being debated for example in wrangel island in siberia the extinction of dwarf woolly mammoths approximately 2000 bce 63 did not coincide with the arrival of humans nor did megafaunal mass extinction on the south american continent although it has been suggested climate changes induced by anthropogenic effects elsewhere in the world may have contributed 6comparisons are sometimes made between recent extinctions approximately since the industrial revolution and the pleistocene extinction near the end of the last glacial period the latter is exemplified by the extinction of large herbivores such as the woolly mammoth and the carnivores that preyed on them humans of this era actively hunted the mammoth and the mastodon 64 but it is not known if this hunting was the cause of the subsequent massive ecological changes widespread extinctions and climate changes 12 13the ecosystems encountered by the first americans had not been exposed to human interaction and may have been far less resilient to human made changes than the ecosystems encountered by industrial era humans therefore the actions of the clovis people despite seeming insignificant by todays standards could indeed have had a profound effect on the ecosystems and wild life which was entirely unused to human influence 6afroeurasia  editsee also list of african animals extinct in the holocene list of asian animals extinct in the holocene and list of extinct animals of europe africa experienced the smallest decline in megafauna compared to the other continents this is presumably due to the idea that afroeurasian megafauna evolved alongside humans and thus developed a healthy fear of them unlike the comparatively tame animals of other continents 65 unlike other continents the megafauna of eurasia went extinct over a relatively long period of time possibly due to climate fluctuations fragmenting and decreasing populations leaving them vulnerable to overexploitation as with the steppe bison  bison priscus  66 the warming of the arctic region caused the rapid decline of grasslands which had a negative effect on the grazing megafauna of eurasia most of what once was mammoth steppe has been converted to mire rendering the environment incapable of supporting them notably the woolly mammoth 67climate change  edittop arid ice age climate middle atlantic period warm and wet bottom potential vegetation in climate now if not for human effects like agriculture 68bramble cay melomys were declared extinct in june 2016 this is likely the first mammalian extinction due to anthropogenic climate change 69one of the main theories to the extinction is climate change the climate change theory has suggested that a change in climate near the end of the late pleistocene stressed the megafauna to the point of extinction 27 70 some scientists favor abrupt climate change as the catalyst for the extinction of the megafauna at the end of the pleistocene but there are many who believe increased hunting from early modern humans also played a part with others even suggesting that the two interacted 6 71 72 however the annual mean temperature of the current interglacial period for the last 10000 years is no higher than that of previous interglacial periods yet some of the same megafauna survived similar temperature increases 73 74 75 76 77 78 in the americas a controversial explanation for the shift in climate is presented under the younger dryas impact hypothesis which states that the impact of comets cooled global temperatures 79 80 81megafaunal extinction  editmegafauna play a significant role in the lateral transport of mineral nutrients in an ecosystem tending to translocate them from areas of high to those of lower abundance they do so by their movement between the time they consume the nutrient and the time they release it through elimination or to a much lesser extent through decomposition after death 82 in south americas amazon basin it is estimated that such lateral diffusion was reduced over 98 following the megafaunal extinctions that occurred roughly 12500 years ago 83 84 given that phosphorus availability is thought to limit productivity in much of the region the decrease in its transport from the western part of the basin and from floodplains both of which derive their supply from the uplift of the andes to other areas is thought to have significantly impacted the regions ecology and the effects may not yet have reached their limits 84 the extinction of the mammoths allowed grasslands they had maintained through grazing habits to become birch forests 12 the new forest and the resulting forest fires may have induced climate change 12 such disappearances might be the result of the proliferation of modern humans some recent studies favor this theory 23 85large populations of megaherbivores have the potential to contribute greatly to the atmospheric concentration of methane which is an important greenhouse gas modern ruminant herbivores produce methane as a byproduct of foregut fermentation in digestion and release it through belching or flatulence today around 20 of annual methane emissions come from livestock methane release in the mesozoic it has been estimated that sauropods could have emitted 520 million tons of methane to the atmosphere annually 86 contributing to the warmer climate of the time up to 10 °c warmer than at present 86 87 this large emission follows from the enormous estimated biomass of sauropods and because methane production of individual herbivores is believed to be almost proportional to their mass 86recent studies have indicated that the extinction of megafaunal herbivores may have caused a reduction in atmospheric methane this hypothesis is relatively new 88 one study examined the methane emissions from the bison that occupied the great plains of north america before contact with european settlers the study estimated that the removal of the bison caused a decrease of as much as 22 million tons per year 89 another study examined the change in the methane concentration in the atmosphere at the end of the pleistocene epoch after the extinction of megafauna in the americas after early humans migrated to the americas about 13000 bp their hunting and other associated ecological impacts led to the extinction of many megafaunal species there calculations suggest that this extinction decreased methane production by about 96 million tons per year this suggests that the absence of megafaunal methane emissions may have contributed to the abrupt climatic cooling at the onset of the younger dryas 88 the decrease in atmospheric methane that occurred at that time as recorded in ice cores was 2–4 times more rapid than any other decrease in the last half million years suggesting that an unusual mechanism was at work 88disease  editthe hyperdisease hypothesis proposed by ross mac phee in 1997 states that the megafaunal dieoff was due to an indirect transmission of diseases by newly arriving aboriginal humans 90 91 92 according to mac phee aboriginals or animals travelling with them such as domestic dogs or livestock introduced one or more highly virulent diseases into new environments whose native population had no immunity to them eventually leading to their extinction kselection animals such as the nowextinct megafauna are especially vulnerable to diseases as opposed to rselection animals who have a shorter gestation period and a higher population size humans are thought to be the sole cause as other earlier migrations of animals into north america from eurasia did not cause extinctions 90there are many problems with this theory as this disease would have to meet several criteria it has to be able to sustain itself in an environment with no hosts it has to have a high infection rate and be extremely lethal with a mortality rate of 50–75 disease has to be very virulent to kill off all the individuals in a genus or species and even such a virulent disease as west nile virus is unlikely to have caused extinction 93however diseases have been the cause for some extinctions the introduction of avian malaria and avipoxvirus for example have had a negative impact on the endemic birds of hawaii 94defaunation  editmain article defaunation history  editthere

ecological communities defaunation is primarily driven by human activity 8 this has resulted in empty forests ecological communities depleted of large vertebrates 96 23 this is not to be confused with extinction as it includes both the disappearance of species and declines in abundance 97 defaunation effects were first implied at the symposium of plantanimal interactions at the university of campinas brazil in 1988 in the context of neotropical forests 98 since then the term has gained broader usage in conservation biology as a global phenomenon 99 98big cat populations have severely

never recovered completely altering the ecosystem and rendering the species locally extinct overhunting can reduce the local population of game animals by more than half as well as reducing population density and may lead to extinction for some species 150 populations located nearer to villages are significantly more at risk of depletion 151 152the surge in the mass killings by poachers involved in the illegal ivory trade along with habitat loss is threatening african elephant populations 153 154 in 1979 their populations stood at 17 million at present there are fewer than 400000 remaining 155 prior to european colonization scientists believe africa was home to roughly 20 million elephants 156 according to the great elephant census 30 of african elephants or 144000 individuals disappeared over a sevenyear period 2007 to 2014 154 157 african elephants could become extinct by 2035 if poaching rates continue 113fishing has had a devastating effect on marine organism populations for several centuries even before the explosion of destructive and highly effective fishing practices like trawling 158 humans are unique among predators in that they regularly predate on other adult apex predators particularly in marine environments 37 bluefin tuna blue whales north atlantic right whales 159 and various sharks in particular are particularly vulnerable to predation pressure from human fishing a 2016 study published in science concludes that humans tend to hunt larger species and this could disrupt ocean ecosystems for millions of years 160“ if this pattern goes unchecked the future oceans would lack many of the largest species in today’s oceans many large species play critical roles in ecosystems and so their extinctions could lead to ecological cascades that would influence the structure and function of future ecosystems beyond the simple fact of losing those species ”— jonathan payne associate professor and chair of geological sciences at stanford university 161disease

confluence of several factors including el niño warming fungus habitat loss and the introduction of invasive species 162toughie the last rabbs fringelimbed treefrog died in september 2016 163 the species was killed off from the chytrid fungus batrachochytrium dendrobatidis 164the decline of amphibian populations has also been identified as an indicator of environmental degradation as well as habitat loss introduced predators and pollution chytridiomycosis a fungal infection thought to have been accidentally spread by human travel 6 has caused severe population drops of several species of frogs including among many others the extinction of the golden toad in costa rica and the gastricbrooding frog in australia many other amphibian species now face extinction including the reduction of rabbs fringelimbed treefrog to an endling and the extinction of the panamanian golden frog in the wild chytrid fungus has spread across australia new zealand central america and africa including countries with high amphibian diversity such as cloud forests in honduras and madagascar batrachochytrium salamandrivorans is a similar infection currently threatening salamanders amphibians are now the most endangered vertebrate group having existed for more than 300 million years through three other mass extinctions 6 17millions of bats in the us have been dying off since 2012 due to a fungal infection spread from european bats which appear to be immune population drops have been as great as 90 within five years and extinction of at least one bat species is predicted there is currently no form of treatment and such declines have been described as unprecedented in bat evolutionary history by alan hicks of the new york state department of environmental conservation 165between 2007 and
