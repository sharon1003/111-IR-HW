in 2016 a team of university researchers discovered the chemical gen x in the cape fear river in north carolina the fear now is that hundreds of thousands of people have potentially been exposed to a toxic chemical in their drinking water that can cause various types of cancer and organ disease what is gen xgen x is a chemical invented by du pont to replace its highly toxic chemical c8 which was being used in products such as teflon du pont stopped producing c8 after it was discovered that the company had discharged the chemical from its plant in parkersburg west virginia into the air and waterway along the ohio river du pont’s unlawful discharge of 25 million pounds of c8 polluted the drinking water in six water districts in west virginia and ohio the chemical was then unknowingly consumed by residents on a daily basis for many years after more than fifteen years of extensive litigation six law firms of which we are one reached a 670 million settlement with du pont to compensate approximately 3500 people who suffered injuries such as kidney cancer testicular cancer and ulcerative colitis read more why are gen x lawsuits being filed since 2009 du pont and chemours have been producing gen x at their 2000acre fayetteville works plant situated along the cape fear river in cumberland and bladen counties north carolina the plant is located 100 miles upstream from wilmington in 2016 gen x was found in the drinking water being supplied to the brunswick county public utilities bcpu cape fear public utility authority cfpua and pender county utilities which combined serve 250000 people in the counties of brunswick new hanover and pender unfortunately there is no known process for filtering the chemical out of the water gen x is not regulated by federal or state governments it is not known what the safe level if any is that can be consumed by humans or animals what is known is that gen x is in the same family as du pont’s previous chemical c8 the safe level of c8 also is not known but the epa has put the figure at 007 parts per billion other scientists believe concentrations as low as 00003 parts per billion can be life threatening yet gen x has been found in the cfpua drinking water at an average of 631 parts per billion which is at least nine times the advisory level for c8 and as much as 2000 times the recommended level read more video du ponts newest toxic contamination gen xdu ponts newest toxic contamination gen xyour browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available click here to visit our frequently asked questions about html5 video000  1043watch more videos gen x lawsuit news new teflon toxin causes cancer in lab animals in one experiment rats given various amounts of gen x over two years developed cancerous tumors in the liver pancreas and testicles according to a report du pont submitted in january 2013 in addition to the cancers some of the gen xexposed rats in that experiment also developed benign tumors as well as well as kidney disease liver degeneration and uterine polyps to read more click the intercept companies react to study indicating presence of unregulated toxin in water supply water companies and local officials are reacting to a study published in the wilmington star news this week indicating the presence of an unregulated chemical known in the trade market as gen x in the raw water supply feeding many people in southeastern north carolina to read more click wectnew hanover wilmington officials to meet with chemours over gen xin 201314 a team of researchers and scientists found a gen x average of 631 parts per trillion or nine times the advisory level for c8 at cfpua’s water intake on the river to read more click star news read more epa and scientific studies regarding gen xlegacy and emerging perfluoroalkyl substances are important drinking water contaminants in the cape fear river watershed of north carolina our adsorption data further show that pfpr opr a “gen x” is less adsorbable than pfoa which it is replacing thus pfpr opr a presents a greater drinking water treatment challenge than pfoa does the detection of potentially high levels of pfecas the continued presence of high levels of legacy pfass and the difficulty of effectively removing legacy pfass and pfecas with many water treatment processes suggest the need for broader discharge control and contaminant monitoring to read more click university of north carolina du pontchemours reports to the epa on the dangers of gen xto read the letters that du pontchemours sent to the epa notifying the government of the potential health dangers associated with gen x click du pontchemours independent studies
