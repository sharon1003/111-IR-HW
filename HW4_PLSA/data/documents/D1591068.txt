radiographic signs in addition to altering normal structures the presence of mediastinal malignancies can result in radiographic signs or patterns that aid in detection and localization many of these classic signs and patterns were originally described by felson  6 and continue to be beneficial in interpreting chest radiographs when a mass abuts a normal mediastinal structure of similar radiodensity the margins of the 2 structures will be obliterated this sign is referred to as the silhouette sign although there is actually desilhouetting of the normal structure by the mass this apparent loss of the margin of the normal structure can be used to localize a mediastinal mass to the same compartment as the normal structure the hilar overlay sign figure 3 is another sign described by felson  6 that is especially useful in distinguishing an anterior mediastinal mass from a prominent cardiac silhouette if the bifurcation of the main pulmonary artery is 1 cm medial to the lateral border of the cardiac silhouette it is strongly suggestive of a mediastinal mass if the pulmonary artery arises from the lateral heart border this favors an enlarged heart in other words because the pulmonary arteries arise from the heart when the heart enlarges then pulmonary arteries must move laterally with the heart border an anterior mediastinal mass that appears as an enlarged cardiac silhouette will not cause displacement of the pulmonary arteries enlarge imagethe hilar overlay sign in a 57yearold man with liposarcoma of the anterior mediastinum a a posteroanterior chest radiograph shows a large mediastinal mass mimicking an enlarged border of the heart and the ascending aorta b a magnified view of the right hilum shows a normal right pulmonary artery arrow that is 1 cm medial to the lateral border of the mass c a contrastenhanced chest ct scan shows a fatty tumor which is consistent with liposarcoma the right pulmonary artery is posterior and medial to the lateral border of the mass the hilar convergence sign is used to distinguish between a prominent hilum and an enlarged pulmonary artery  6 if the pulmonary arteries converge into the lateral border of a hilar mass the mass represents an enlarged pulmonary artery figure 4 if the convergence appears behind the abnormality or arises from the heart a mediastinal mass is more likely in other words because the pulmonary artery branches arise from the main pulmonary artery trunk an enlarged pulmonary artery will have branches that arise from its outer margin the vessels converge toward the main pulmonary artery a hilar mass may have the appearance of an enlarged pulmonary artery but the vessels will not arise from the margin instead they will seem to pass through the margins as they converge on the true artery figure 5 enlarge imagethe hilum convergence sign in a 66yearold man with a history of a right upper lobe lobectomy for nonsmallcell lung cancer a a posteroanterior chest radiograph reveals an enlarged left hilum b a magnified view of the left hilum reveals that the pulmonary vessels converge arrows onto the border of the hilar prominence confirming an enlarged pulmonary artery and no adenopathy enlarge imagea hilar convergence sign in a 25yearold man with hodgkin´s disease a a posteroanterior chest radiograph reveals bilateral hilar enlargement a number of branches of the pulmonary artery arrows are visualized passing through the borders of the masses note the widening of the right paratracheal stripe arrowheads and the subcarinal mass  indicating adenopathy b a contrastenhanced chest ct scan at the level of the pulmonary arteries confirms the presence of bilateral hilar adenopathy c a contrastenhanced chest ct scan at the level of the aortic arch confirms the presence of paratracheal adenopathy as well as anterior mediastinal adenopathy finally the cervicothoracic sign figure 6 is used to determine the location of a mediastinal lesion in the upper chest the uppermost border of the anterior mediastinum ends at the level of the clavicles however the medial and posterior mediastinum extends above the clavicles a mediastinal mass that projects superior to the level of the clavicles must therefore be located either within the middle or posterior mediastinum furthermore the more cephalad the mass extends the more posterior the location  6 enlarge imagethe cervicothoracic sign in a 52yearold man with a plexiform neurofibroma a a posteroanterior chest radiograph shows a large mediastinal mass arrows that extends well above the level of the clavicles indicating that the lesion is not in the anterior mediastinum note how the anterior mediastinal mass in figure 3a does not extend above the clavicles b a contrastenhanced ct scan of the chest at the level of the clavicular heads shows a posterior mediastinal mass arrows that caused the appearance of the chest radiograph the trachea is against the anterior wall of the chest and there is no longer an anterior mediastinum at this level once an abnormality is detected on a conventional chest radiograph crosssectional imaging plays an important role in the further characterization of the mediastinal mass ct and mri provide excellent anatomic definition and characterization of mediastinal masses and therefore are the imaging modalities of choice more recently functional imaging using pet and integrated petct imaging has been useful in assessing mediastinal masses  7next section appl radiol 200736 1 © 2007 anderson publishing ltd references
