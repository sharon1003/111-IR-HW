you yes no  report inappropriate for pharyngitis wow i cant believe how much this drug is downrated oh boo hoo i have a bad taste in my mouth and a headache medicine sucks youre sick chances are that your condition is bad or it is getting there i would like to have a headache for a week than be hospitalised for pneumonia if left untreated ive been prescribed this drug a few times since i was 12 and every time i tried to man up to the illness and not letting it get to me until it worsens and i had to take meds antibiotics like this one are godsend 710 days and im back on my feet again i got to point out that you cant even say if the side effects are from the med or from the illness andor the process of your body healing from it i would have been dead at least a few times if it werent for this lol its nature in the first place that put you in this situation a few years ago if you got tuberculosis you were pretty much a goner thank you big pharma 10yung dud march 26 20181 users found this comment helpful did you yes no  report inappropriate for helicobacter pylori infection was started on clarithromycin 500mg 2xday amoxicillin 500mg 2caps 2xday and lansoprazole 30 mg 2xday for h pylori my insurance didn’t cover the kit so they split the meds insurance still didn’t cover lansoprazole so i used otc 15mg 2caps 2xday my heart burn and acid reflux was awful before starting these meds i had low appetite and lost weight and had trouble going to bed even with antacid im on 25 days of therapy medication is horrible got bone pain fatigue and throatchest discomfort after my 1st dose and side effects continues terrible metallic taste most of the day so i chew gum to mask the taste i will keep enduring because symptomatic h pylori can cause severe condition including miscarriages and stomach cancer if left untreated i don’t think the triple therapy side effects will be worse than a chemo for stomach cancer so i encourage to take this medicine if you can tolerate it the side effects 60hope taken for less than 1 month march 12 20180 users found this comment helpful did you yes no  report inappropriate for sinusitis side effects were awful  headache and awful

treating me for a respiratory infection and prescribed me 500mg of clarithromycin twice a day for 7 days these antibiotics are bad i’m sure the first day wasn’t too bad but come day 2 the stomach pain nausea bitter taste losing my sense of taste and chronic headaches had started i’m on day 6 and still have these side effects along with breathlessness terrible dizziness anxiety and generally feeling like i’m not on this planet my head feels like it doesn’t belong to me which i’m turn doesn’t help the anxiety side effects vicious circle i’m at a loose end but as i’ve only one day and my evening tablet to go i will persevere i hope these side effects don’t continue for too long once i’ve finished the course or i think i may crack up 50rt taken for less than 1 month march 10 20180 users found

report inappropriate for pneumonia 2x 500mg tablets 3 times a day for 3 days 3000 mg a day i had pretty severe pneumonia after flu complications and seemed to be resistant to amoxicillin so was prescribed these the dose concerned me as it was very high and twice the usual dosage i found these tablets almost impossible to swallow and they made me retch and gag after 2 doses i had severe stomach pains which only eased after a hot bath the stomach pains continued every time i took a dose after the full course i have a vile taste in my mouth that nothing seems to get rid of i certainly feel better but all food tastes like acid right now and the pain was annoying 50ditsy taken for less than 1 month march 2 20180 users found this comment helpful did you yes no  report inappropriate

after heartburn for two years and being on esomeprazole i finally had an endoscopy which turned out to be the wrong diagnosis hiatus hernia then had to wait nearly a year to be referred back into the system for another endoscopy only to be told there’s no evidence of hiatus hernia and that’s its h plyori  i didn’t know what it was went on the triple therapy with metronidazole amoxicillin and omezprazole didn’t work now it’s nearly march 18 and i’m back on the antibiotics for two weeks this time clathromycin amoxicillin and lansoprazole day 2 ok but probably not really kicked in yet but hopefully better than metronidazole as last time was so ill on that drug went to hospital twice and first time called an ambulance so i really don’t want to go through that again 30sunflower78 taken

helpful did you yes no  report inappropriate for bronchitis took these tablets  500 mg twice a day for 3 days the last tablet taken was when the delusions  hallucinations started the real world felt a million miles away feeling confused almost l could see myself doing things  talking from a birds eye view vision became blurry and the feeling of onset of doom was constantly by my side along with this visiting the toilet 4 times in three hours and throwing up with thick brown mucus felt like if i closed my eyes i would never open them again safe to say never again these antibiotics are way too strong had to give it a 110 as could not post otherwise really scary antibiotics to take for me anyway now i know what t feels like to be on a class drugs 10khad february 13 20180 users found this

to prevent infection after tonsillectomy i told the doctor that it makes me feel very sick but she insisted on it rather than prescribing kefexin which i tolerate really well i am allergic to penicillin and find that in uk doctors prescribe mysin based antibiotics for anything must be the cost as it just doesnt make any sense anyway this medicine is making me feel so sick that i cannot take it im recovering from tonsillectomy and the last thing i want is to be sick never again 20mrs sh february 4 20180 users found this comment helpful did you yes no  report inappropriate biaxin

this comment helpful did you yes no  report inappropriate for bronchitis come on people 1s and 2sreally i have chronic bronchitis and frequent my doctor several times a year i was prescribed this by my doctor for 10 days and i am on day 7 i am also battling the flu and some fluid on my lungs i do feel a little bit better but my sleeping has been reduced and i find myself awake much earlier than i
