parliamentary systems vs presidential systems which one of these systems established a stable democracy democracy is originated from greek words from the composition of demos and kratos demo is translated as “the people” and kratos as “power” ober 2007 2 its history goes back to the ancient greece approximately 2500 years ago fleck 2002 2 democracy was perceived as a form of corrupt government system by aristotle in his politics ober 20041 however in the last centuries with the industrial developments and enlightenment democracy became more noticeable and favourable all the countries begun to claim themselves as the guardian of democracy especially in last centuries some countries invade others just for the name of democracy equality of human rights freedom of speech…etc therefore in this paper i am going to concentrate on the two main types of government systems of democracy namely parliamentary systems and presidential systems and i will try to illustrate which one of these systems are able to establish a stable democracy either parliamentary systems or presidential systems in order to discuss these two main government systems i will base my arguments mainly on the work of linz 1990 and mainwaring 1993 because each of this person has different approaches regarding to these two main government systems and their accomplishment to bring a stable democracy furthermore in order to make this paper more effective and clear i used some extra sources as well the concept of stable democracy is defined in different context in this paper and i will try to clarify it through my argumentation 1 why presidential systems cannot bring a stable democracy comparing to parliamentary systems linz 1990 linz in his article called “the perils of presidentialism” “focuses mainly on the general problems of presidential systems” rather than focusing on its specific subtypes like semipresidential systems linz clearly favours presidential systems over parliamentary systems and begins his article by illustrating some historical performances of both systems presidential systems and parliamentary systems he argues “the superior historical performance of parliamentary democracies is no accident”  linz 1990 258 he also adds that from the historical performance of both government systems one can conclude that parliamentary systems performs better and accomplishes a stable democracies rather presidential systems especially in deeply divided societies linz 1990 258 a parliamentary system is the one in which the only democratically legitimate institution is parliament in such system the government’s authority is totally depending on the parliamentary vote of confidence on the contrary a presidential system is the one in which a president in other words the executive haves considerable institutional authority he or she is independent of parliament and is directly elected by the people unlike prime minister linz 1990 258 presidential systems are mainly defined by one or more of three criteria “ two things about presidential systems stand out the first is the president’s strong claim to democratic legitimacy and the second is the president’s fixed term in office” linz 1990 258 there are four main reasons that can illustrate best why presidential systems fail to accomplish a stable democracy the first reason is due to competing claims of legitimacy between executive and legislatures the second reason is due to fixed term of presidential office thirdly because of “zerosome” election systems in presidential systems and fourth and the last reasons because of the “ the styles of presidential politics” itself 2 the first and the most significant reasons why presidential systems fail to accomplish a stable democracy because of consistent conflict between two powers legislatures and executives in presidential system bot president and legislatures are independent of each other people popularly elected both of them because of this both of them feel themselves responsible from people and not by each other this situation can be very clear when the assembly is formed of by majority of legislatures who are from opposition parties for instance if a majority of legislatures favours a policy which is different from a president’s interests in this case a dramatic conflict can occur between legislatures and executives furthermore there are no democratic and well known principles on the basis of which this the problem should be solved moreover in the past it was not an accident the armed force often attempted to intervene as a mediating power in such presidential governing countries linz 1990 258 on the contrary in the parliamentary systems the executive and legislatures are not independent of each other the government’s authority is completely dependent on the legislatures votes of confidence therefore it is also easy to solve conflicts and problems when it occurred in addition the probability of armed force intervention is very unlikely in such regimes the second reason why presidential cannot establish a stable democracy due to fixed term of president’s office “the fixed term of office in presidential system is more rigid and it breaks political process into discontinues and leaves no rooms for continues readjustment when there is a demand for readjustment” linz 1990 259 the fixed term of office is a length of time over this period a person serves in a particular office it can be perceived as the “paradox of presidentialsim” because in many cases it stands against assumptions and principles presidential systems also it has many benefits for example it creates a strong legitimation to stand fast against the particular interest of legislatures in parliament linz 1990 259 3 the rigidity of presidential system’s office term can create a profound suspicion of the personalization of power a president may become a dictator by the help of legislatures in the parliament in such case it is really difficult to remove from his office in presidential system on the other hand also we can argue that it is very difficult to a political system to produce a popular and successful leader in each five or four years therefore it is problematic to keep a successful leader for the office presidency more than fixed term of office because of this it is hard for him to meet his promises that he made for people in order to get elected in a short period of time but parliamentary system is well known for it is flexibility a prime minister can implement his policies as much as he or she has the confidence vote of assembly in addition in this regime a party and legislatures may at any time can adopt a basic changes even legislatures can change a prime minister through the vote of no confidence when there is a scandal or misusing of power by a prime minister linz 1990 259 thirdly why presidential system fails to establish a stable democracy because it is based on the system of “winnertakeall” linz in explains “winnertakeall” as “an arrangement that tends to make a democratic society a zero some game with all potential for conflict such games portend” linz 1990 259 linz gives the fixed office term of president as the motive for the zero sum presidential elections linz 1990 260 in zero sum elections the losers and winners are sharply defined for an entire period of presidential systems the losers must wait for a fixed term of office because there is no hopes for making alliances till the new elections come in presidential systems alliances are formed before the elections in order to get more votes from people also these alliances are not bounded after elections on contrary in parliamentary system even though it can produce a majority for a single party but still can give a chance of representation for small parties as well furthermore power sharing and coalition forming is very common in parliamentary systems incumbents are always interested in the votes of smaller parties in the parliament and the smaller parties in turn 4 expect to share some posts with governing parties fourthly the reason why presidential system fails to accomplish a stable democracy is due to its “ styles of presidential politics” or because of presidential office itself a president is simultaneously the head of state symbolic representatives of entire nations as well as being the head of government the president may find this situationcombining role as the symbolic aspect of polity with his role as a chief executive and as party leader to promote the program of his party also it is more probably that a president can act intolerance against his opposition therefore the presidential system needs a monarch a moderating power and as a means restraining powers linz 1990 261262 in parliamentary system a prime minister is just the head of government and responsible from executing and not the symbolic head of states comparing to presidential systems it is easy to overcome conflicts and crises in parliamentary systems for example there is the speaker of parliament who has some restraining power over the parliamentary antagonists in addition generally there are some neutral figures as well who can provide moral ballast in a crises or can act symbolically as the moderator between the premier and his opponents who may include not only his parliamentary foes but military leaders as well linz 1990 262 the other reasons that presidential system cannot accomplish a stable democracy because of dual legitimacy in the system the position of cabinet members in presidential system is quite different from the position of cabinet members in parliamentary systems the post of prime minister is almost equal with his or her colleague in parliament because both of them are a member of parliament and depends on each other on the other hand in presidential system the cabinet members are selected independent from parliament if a president dismisses his or her cabinet member he or she is atomically out of public unlike cabinet members of parliamentary systems but in parliamentary systems if a prime minister dismisses his or her member of cabinet in such situation the dismissed members of cabinet is not out of public he can go to 5 his site to the parliament event if he is dismissed from the party then heshe can stay as an independent member of parliament but it is not very common to dismiss a mp from party because the party needs votes of legislatures in order to preserve its interests in the parliament in presidential system a president can protect his members of cabinet from criticism even in extreme cases but in parliamentary system this situation more difficult because the member of cabinet is also the member of the parliament therefore there are more direct criticisms in parliamentary systems why presidential democracy fails to accomplish a stable democracy mainwaring mainwaring in his article called “presidentialism multipartism and democracy the difficult combination” unlike linz he does not focuses on the general problems of presidential system he supports presidentialism in two party systems but not in multi party systems because he believes that the combination of a multi party systems and presidential systems fails to accomplish a stable democracy rather than two party systems mainwaring 1993 266 mainwaring defines stable democracy on the basis of democratic longevity for example he states that 1993 “ presidential systems have not faired well only 7 of 31 226 presidential democracies have endured for at least 25 consecutive years compared with 25 of 44 parliamentary systems 568 p267 also like li̇nz maiwaring starts his work by mentioning about two main criteria presidential systems which are popular elections and fixed office term of president in presidential systems the legislative elections and post elections negotiations do not have influence on executive powers but in parliamentary systems the head of the government is not elect popularly unlike presidential systems post elections have a huge influence and which determines which parties going to be the head of government mainwaring 1993 266 6 the fixed term of president as the second wellknown criteria presidential systems plays a huge role for not reaching a stable democracy although most presidential systems allows for impeachments when there is a scandal or misusing presidential power this practices are rare because the executive be forced to resign as there is no confidence vote by legislatures on the contrary in parliamentary systems the prime minister does not a specific period of office his office term depends on the confidence vote of legislatures therefore when there is a scandal it easy to remove a head of government mainwaring 1993 267 presidential systems multi party systems and its problem to build a stable democracy mainwaring regarding failure of presidential systems to accomplish a stable democracy mainwaring shares similar ideas with linz he gives three main reasons for the failure of presidential systems that are problems of handling major crises the problems of deadlock and the third problems derives from presidential election itself mainwaring 1993 267 as they share almost similar ideas regarding this issues therefore i will not focus on this topic and i will move on to the next topic that is the problem of multipartisim in presidential systems it is not fair to argue that all presidential systems fail to accomplish a stable democracy because as we can see today the worlds most well known and adorable democracies are presidential systems like the united states of america but the problem is with combination of multipartisim and presidential systems this makes difficult presidential systems to accomplish a stable democracy and not totally two party systems of course there are some reasons to believe that presidential systems in two party systems seem more favourable than multi party systems for bringing stable democracy even tough it has some problems with itself the reasons that define presidential system as unstable democracy is as follows first the combination of multi party system and presidentialism may increase the likelihood of deadlock between executives and legislatures secondly the combination of multi party system and presidentialism increases the ideological polarizations thirdly 7 there is a need to build interparty alliances in multi party systems but it seems to be very problematic in presidential systems mainwaring 1993 269 the first reason why multi party presidential systems fail to accomplish a stable democracy the combination of multi party system and presidentialism increases the likelihood of deadlock between executives and legislatures comparing to parliamentary systems and two party systems in presidential systems as the president is elected directly by people and independent of congress therefore the president lacks the means of ensuring his or her support in congress heshe does not k now either heshe has the majority of the support in congress or not because in multi party presidential system sometimes small parties can make a successful run as well which do not have the support of majority legislatures in congress therefore it is difficult for a president in deeply divided societies with multi party systems to pass a law from congress mainwaring 1993 269 in the case two party systems it is more likely to lower conflict between presidents and legislatures because two party presidential systems make a president to act more flexible and makes him more comfortable that he is backing the majority support of legislatures in congress than multi party systems therefore pushing policy in two parties presidential system is easier than the multi party presidential systems however it does not mean that two party presidential systems totally fine with deadlock still have many problems for example there is no clear instruments to overcome the probable conflicts between legislatures and executives or to remove an ineffective president hence most of the time the coup will be solutions to solve such problems mainwaring 1993 269 on the other hand parliamentary governing systems have an institutional means to overcome the problem of deadlock when it occurred in the parliament the vote of no confidence can change balance by removing an ineffective prime minister in parliamentary hence there is more effective way of changing an executive without threatening the regime comparing two parties and multi parties presidential systems mainwaring 1993 270 8 secondly the combination of multi party system and presidentialism increases the ideological polarizations which leads to of that presidential system cannot accomplish a stable democracy because “intense ideological divisions increases the stake of political game and serves as an incentives to polarizations and consequently less favourable to stable democracy” mainwaring 1993 270 on the contrary in two party systems presidentialism they are less likely to became ideologically polarized in multi party presidential systems competitions tends to be centripetal in order to get more votes in the elections but in most two party systems parties with a centrist moderate orientation dominates the electoral markets therefore this characteristics in turns favours moderation and increases the likelihood of a stable democracy mainwaring 1993 270 the third reasons why multi party systems fail to accomplish a stable democracy are because of the problem in building coalition in multi party systems actually both presidential systems and parliamentary systems need to build an interparty coalition in order to get a legislative majority however there are some reasons that make interparty coalitions more problematic in presidential systems comparing to parliamentary systems the first reason why coalition building is problematic in presidential systems to an answer this question it is because party supports for the government tend to be less sure in presidentialism than the parliamentary systems as in presidential systems coalition building take places before the election therefore it is not bounded after the elections as a result breaking coalition is more likely in presidential system after a president took office furthermore in presidential systems the president is responsible for putting together a cabinet and not parties therefore in presidential system a president is freer to change and dismiss his cabinet members compared to parliamentary systems mainwaring 1993 270 on the contrary in parliamentary system generally take places after the election and which is bounded after the elections as well the executive power is determined through the postelection agreements that are made among the parties the parties themselves are corresponsible for forming 9 government and hence they are committed to support the government’s policies mainwaring1993 270 the second reasons why coalitions building in presidential systems are more problematic because in presidential systems individual legislatures are less bounded to the negotiations that are made by the leadership of a party therefore legislatures in presidential systems often votes as they choose not for the interest of hisher party leadership on other hand in parliamentary systems the members of the parliaments are bounded to decision of their parties and supports the governments policies till hisher parties drops out the alliances mainwaring 1993 271 the third reason why coalitions building in presidential systems are more problematic compared to parliamentary systems because of high incentives of parties for breaking coalitions in multi party systems when a new come close they feel to break the coalitions they do so because of the fear of losing own identity sharing the blame of government’s mistake etc mainwaring 1993 271 conclusion taking everything into conclusion although both authors seem to share some common criticisms of presidential systems they differ regarding their points for example linz talks about the general problems of presidential systems without any exceptions he clearly favours parliamentary systems over the presidential systems and he refuses the assumption that presidential regimes accomplish a stable democracy on the other hand mainwaring shares somehow different ideas with linz he differentiates presidential systems into two main categories as multi party systems and two party systems he argues that the combination of multiparty systems and presidential systems fail to accomplish a stable democracy on the contrast from the arguments the i presented above we can conclude that mainwaring believes that the combination of two party systems and presidential system can accomplish a stable democracy 10 from my point of view i personally agree with the both authors’ arguments if we look to the historical records of presidential systems it did not fared well as mainwaring mentions mainwaring 1993267 on the other hand if we look at the historical records of parliamentary systems we can realize that the parliamentary systems also did fared well somehow in this regard the third and furth french republic are opt cited examples
