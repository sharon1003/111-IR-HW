were involved a distinction between whether the owner had a cvt or manual was needed i have the 5sp manual and was wondering if there are any advantages or disadvantages over he cvt when it comes to towing with the manual id like to hear from experts who know their stuff because owners tend to be largely biased towards the type of transmission they have  also i chose the 5sp manual by choice for maximum vehicle control so no one needs to be afraid of hurting my feelings here if the cvt turns out to be better for towing haha share share this post on digg delicious technorati twitter add this

irrelevant imo it is not about bias it is about verified facts where is the evidence and where does it say that in the handbook last edited by sandi 02192013 at 0507 am  share share this post on digg

originally posted by scooby xvlthats stupid a cvt has out tow a 5 speed im pretty sure this is the type of comment that the original post was trying to avoid i havent towed with the xv but with many many other vehicles up to 20000lb trailers in my experience towing with a manual transmission is better on the vehicle an automatic is better on the driver getting going will be an exercise in clutch control in a manual especially on hills of course our hill assist helps with this once moving it is easier to keep the engine speeds where they need to be to handle the load braking is also more effective as you can downshift to minimize the wear and tear on your cars brakes now i know that the cvt can be manually shifted but a significant amount of torque is lost in the transmissions rubber band the mts direct mechanical link to the drivetrain puts more power to the wheels period also there is a reason that vehicles meant to tow on a regular basis have transmission coolers the strain of towing heats things up a lot my preference a dodge ram 3500 cummins diesel w 6sp manual best vehicle ive ever towed with bar none share share this post on digg delicious technorati twitter add this

senior member join date jan 2013location connecticut posts 205scooby you may say that the cvt is the best vehicle youve ever towed with and that may be true but i was looking for something more like what sail114 said i dont really care about maximum ease of operation but am most concerned about vehicle strain it makes sense that the cvt is easy to tow with because 1 theres no gears to shift through and 2 you dont need to manage the throttle as heavily to keep an automatic transmission in the appropriate gear also scooby are you saying a cvt has out towed a 5sp because were talking about the same car here and each has 148 hp and torque so when it comes down to it neither is going out tow the other and even if they could from what it sounds like the manual has a higher towing capacity does anyone else have any additional knowledge of the strain towing puts on the vehicle with a manual or cvt last edited by nickb 02192013 at 0926 pm  share share this post on digg delicious
