love exercising and had heard so many good things about pilates that i just had to try i signed up in july for an unlimited package and took as many classes as i could and the results are phenomenal i

recommended i try it out to deal with muscle and joint recovery after playing tennis i noticed improvement immediately and wanted to keep going with pilates but was not interested in continuing with that fitness center when i was planning my move to chamblee this summer i noticed club pilates was on google maps well before the studio opened so i was excited to join and be a part of the new location on opening day everything is a at club pilates  high quality instructors who get to know you personally the best equipment the great variety of classes available for all levels and a well managed business i can see the results in the mirror and in my tennis playing and recovery  it feels so good to feel good1 person voted for this review useful 2 funny cool kelsey e atlanta ga212

exercise and the best studio that i have ever joined each instructor is expertly trained and develops programs tailored to each student including modifications if needed every single class is different the only problem is that the 50 minutes fly by too fast it is amazing to feel the progress that i have made in the short time that club pilates brookhavenchamblee has been open love this place and its staff carol m1 person voted for this review useful 2 funny cool sandralee g atlanta ga1 friend3 reviews1 photo share review embed review compliment send message follow sandralee g8272017the best pilates studio to come to my end of town what a welcome addition great instructors many different classes offered and yet havent been to the same level class where they had the same routine they constantly change it up and keep everyone engaged and challenged worth every penny and more affordable than reformer classes offered at my usual gym or other pilates studios in town i highly recommend club pilates was this review … useful funny cool a m pennington nj0 friends2 reviews share review embed review compliment send message follow a m8282017i love this place brand new
