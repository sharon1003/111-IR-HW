etymological interpretation defines vishnu as viṣṇur viṣvater vā vyaśnoter vā one who enters everywhere he also writes atha yad viṣito bhavati tad viṣnurbhavati that which is free from fetters and bondages is vishnu 10the medieval indian scholar medhātithi suggested that the word vishnu has etymological roots in viś meaning to pervade thereby connoting that vishnu is one who is everything and inside everything 11vishnu means all pervasive 12 13texts vishnu icons across cultures180 bce indogreek coin of agathocles vishnu nicolo seal 4th–6th century ce gandhara13th century cambodian vishnu india myanmar indonesia the iconography of hindu god vishnu has been widespread in history vedas vishnu is a vedic deity but not a prominent one when compared to indra agni and others 14 just 5 out of 1028 hymns of the rigveda a 2nd millennium bce hindu text are dedicated to vishnu and he finds minor mention in the other hymns 11 vishnu is mentioned in the brahmana layer of text in the vedas thereafter his profile rises and over the history of indian mythology states jan gonda vishnu becomes a divinity of the highest rank one equivalent to the supreme being 14 15though a minor mention and with overlapping attributes in the vedas he has important characteristics in various hymns of rig veda such as 11545 1563 and 10153 14 in these hymns the vedic mythology asserts that vishnu resides in that highest home where departed atman souls reside an assertion that may have been the reason for his increasing emphasis and popularity in hindu soteriology 14 16 he is also described in the vedic literature as the one who supports heaven and earth 11in the vedic hymns vishnu is invoked alongside other deities especially indra whom he helps in killing the symbol of evil named vritra 11 17 his distinguishing characteristic in vedas is his association with light two rigvedic hymns in mandala 7 refer to vishnu in section 799 of the rgveda vishnu is addressed as the god who separates heaven and earth a characteristic he shares with indra in the vedic texts the deity or god referred to as vishnu is surya or savitr sun god who also bears the name suryanarayana again this link to surya is a characteristic vishnu shares with fellow vedic deities named mitra and agni where in different hymns they too bring men together and cause all living beings to rise up and impel them to go about their daily activities 18in hymn 799 of rigveda indravishnu are equivalent and produce the sun with the verses asserting that this sun is the source of all energy and light for all 18 in other hymns of the rigveda vishnu is a close friend of indra 19 elsewhere in rigveda atharvaveda and upanishadic texts vishnu is equivalent to prajapati both are described as the protector and preparer of the womb and according to klaus klostermaier this may be the root behind postvedic fusion of all the attributes of the vedic prajapati unto the avatars of vishnu 11in the yajurveda taittiriya aranyaka 10131 narayana sukta narayana is mentioned as the supreme being the first verse of narayana suktam mentions the words paramam padam which literally mean highest post and may be understood as the supreme abode for all souls this is also known as param dhama paramapadam or vaikuntha rig veda 12220 also mentions the same paramam padam 20in the atharvaveda the mythology of a boar who raises goddess earth from the depths of cosmic ocean appears but without the word vishnu or his alternate avatar names in postvedic mythology this legend becomes one of the basis of many cosmogonic myth called the varaha legend with varaha as an avatar of vishnu 17trivikrama the three steps of vishnu the three strides of vishnu artwork is common in hindu temples wherein his leg is shown raised like a gymnast symbolizing a huge step left trivikrama art at a temple in bhaktapur nepal right at 6thcentury badami cave temples india several hymns of the rigveda repeat the mighty deed of vishnu called the trivikrama which is one of the lasting mythologies in hinduism since the vedic times 21 it is an inspiration for ancient artwork in numerous hindu temples such as at the ellora caves which depict the trivikrama legend through the vamana avatar of vishnu 22 23 trivikrama refers to the celebrated three steps or three strides of vishnu starting as a small insignificant looking being vishnu undertakes a herculean task of establishing his reach and form then with his first step covers the earth with second the ether and the third entire heaven 21 24विष्णोर्नु कं वीर्याणि प्र वोचं यः पार्थिवानि विममे रजांसि । यो अस्कभायदुत्तरं सधस्थं विचक्रमाणस्त्रेधोरुगायः ॥१॥  i will now proclaim the heroic deeds of visnu who has measured out the terrestrial regions who established the upper abode having widepaced strode out triply — rigveda 11541 translated by jan gonda 25the vishnu sukta 1154 of rigveda says that the first and second of vishnus strides those encompassing the earth and air are visible to the mortals and the third is the realm of the immortals the trivikrama describing hymns integrate salvific themes stating vishnu to symbolize that which is freedom and life 21 the shatapatha brahmana elaborates this theme of vishnu as his herculean effort and sacrifice to create and gain powers that help others one who realizes and defeats the evil symbolized by the asuras after they had usurped the three worlds and thus vishnu is the savior of the mortals and the immortals  devas  21brahmanas to what is one seven germs unripened yet are heavens prolific seed their functions they maintain by vishnus ordinance endued with wisdom through intelligence and thought they compass us about present on every side what thing i truly am i know not clearly mysterious fettered in my mind i wander when the firstborn of holy law approached me then of this speech i first obtain a portion  they call him indra mitra varuna agni and he is heavenlywinged garutman to what is one sages give many a title— rigveda 11643637 46 26 27the shatapatha brahmana contains ideas which vaishnavism tradition of hinduism has long mapped to a pantheistic vision of vishnu as supreme he as the essence in every being and everything in the empirically perceived universe in this brahmana states klaus klostermaier purusha narayana vishnu asserts all the worlds have i placed within mine own self and mine own self have i placed within all the worlds 28 the text equates vishnu to all knowledge there is vedas calling the essence of everything as imperishable all vedas and principles of universe as imperishable and that this imperishable which is vishnu is the all 28vishnu is described to be permeating all object and life forms states s giora shoham where he is ever present within all things as the intrinsic principle of all and the eternal transcendental self in every being 29 the vedic literature including its brahmanas layer while praising vishnu do not subjugate others gods and goddesses they present an inclusive pluralistic henotheism max muller states although the gods are sometimes distinctly invoked as the great and the small the young and the old rig veda 12713 this is only an attempt to find the most comprehensive expression for the divine powers and nowhere is any of the gods represented as the subordinate to others it would be easy to find in the numerous hymns of the veda passages in which almost every single god is represented as supreme and absolute 30upanishads the vaishnava upanishads are minor upanishads of hinduism related to vishnu theology there are 14 vaishnava upanishads in the muktika anthology of 108 upanishads 31 it is unclear when these texts were composed and estimates vary from the 1stcentury bce to 17thcentury ce for the texts 32 33these upanishads highlight vishnu narayana rama or one of his avatars as the supreme metaphysical reality called brahman in hinduism 34 35 they discuss a diverse range of topics from ethics to the methods of worship 36puranas the bhagavata purana is centered around krishna a vishnu avatar5thcentury vishnu at udayagiri caves vishnu is the primary focus of vaishnavismfocused puranas genre of hindu texts of these according to ludo rocher the most important texts are the bhagavata purana vishnu purana nāradeya purana garuda purana and vayu purana 37 the purana texts include many versions of cosmologies mythologies encyclopedic entries about various aspects of life and chapters that were medieval era regional vishnutemples related tourist guides called mahatmyas 38one version of the cosmology for example states that vishnus eye is at the southern celestial pole from where he watches the cosmos 39 in another version found in section 480 of the vayu purana he is the hiranyagarbha or the golden egg from which were simultaneously born all feminine and masculine beings of the universe 40 the vishnu purana presents vishnu as the central element of its cosmology unlike some other puranas where shiva or brahma or goddess shakti are the reverence and the worship of vishnu is described in 22 chapters of the first part of vishnu purana along with the profuse use of the synonymous names of vishnu such as hari janardana madhava achyuta hrishikesha and others 4111thcentury vishnu sculpture at brooklyn museum the edges show reliefs of vishnu avatars varaha narasimha balarama rama and others also shown is brahma 42the vishnu purana discusses the hindu concept of supreme reality called brahman in the context of the upanishads a discussion that the theistic vedanta scholar ramanuja interprets to be about the equivalence of the brahman with vishnu a foundational theology in the sri vaishnavism tradition 43 vishnu is equated with brahman in bhagavata purana such as in verse 1211 as learned transcendentalists who know the absolute truth call this nondual substance as brahman paramatma and bhagavan 44the bhagavata purana has been the most popular and widely read purana texts relating to vishnu avatar krishna it has been translated and available in almost all indian languages 45 like other puranas it discusses a wide range of topics including cosmology genealogy geography mythology legend music dance yoga and culture 46 47 as it begins the forces of evil have won a war between the benevolent devas deities and evil asuras demons and now rule the universe truth reemerges as the vishnu avatar first makes peace with the demons understands them and then creatively defeats them bringing back hope justice freedom and good – a cyclic theme that appears in many legends 48 the bhagavata purana is a revered text in vaishnavism 49 the puranic legends of vishnu have inspired plays and dramatic arts that are acted out over festivals particularly through performance arts such as the sattriya manipuri dance odissi kuchipudi kathakali kathak bharatanatyam bhagavata mela and mohiniyattam 50 51 52some versions of the purana texts unlike the vedic and upanishadic texts emphasize vishnu as supreme and on whom other gods depend vishnu for example is the source of creator deity brahma in the vaishnavismfocussed purana texts vishnus iconography typically shows brahma being born in a lotus emerging from his navel who then is described as creating all the forms in the universe but not the primordial universe itself 53 in contrast the shiva focussed puranas describe brahma and vishnu to have been created by ardhanarishvara that is half shiva and half parvati or alternatively brahma was born from rudra or vishnu shiva and brahma creating each other cyclically in different aeons  kalpa  54in some vaishnava puranas vishnu takes the form of rudra or commands rudra to destroy the world thereafter the entire universe dissolves and along with time everything is reabsorbed back into vishnu the universe is then recreated from vishnu all over again starting a new kalpa 55 other texts offer alternate cosmogenic theories such as one where the universe and time are absorbed into shiva 55 56sangam and postsangam literature main article thirumal the mythologies of vishnu avatar krishna are extensive such as baby krishna stealing butter or playing the flute these themes appear in ancient and medieval coins of south asia 57 and the motifs described by 3rdcentury poet hala 58the sangam literature refers to an extensive regional collection in tamil language mostly from the early centuries of the common era these tamil texts revere vishnu and his avatars such as krishna and rama as well as other panindian deities such as shiva muruga durga indra and others 59 vishnu is described in these texts as mayon or one who is dark or black in color in north india the equivalent word is krishna 59 other terms found for vishnu in these ancient tamil genre of literature include mayavan mamiyon netiyon mal and mayan 60krishna as vishnu avatar is the primary subject of two postsangam tamil epics silappadikaram and manimekalai each of which was probably composed about the 5th century ce 61 62 these tamil epics share many aspects of the story found in other parts of india such as those related to baby krishna such as stealing butter and teenage krishna such as teasing girls who went to bathe in a river by hiding their clothes 61 63bhakti movement ideas about vishnu in the mid 1st millennium ce were important to the bhakti movement theology that ultimately swept india after the 12th century the alvars which literally means those immersed in god were tamil vaishnava poetsaints who sang praises of vishnu as they travelled from one place to another 64 they established temple sites such as srirangam and spread ideas about vaishnavism their poems compiled as alwar arulicheyalgal or divya prabhandham developed into an influential scripture for the vaishnavas the bhagavata purana s references to the south indian alvar saints along with its emphasis on bhakti have led many scholars to give it south indian origins though some scholars question whether this evidence excludes the possibility that bhakti movement had parallel developments in other parts of india 65 66vaishnava theology part of a series on

vaishnavism and pañcaratra the bhagavata purana summarizes the vaishnava theology wherein it frequently discusses the merging of the individual soul with the absolute brahman ultimate reality supreme truth or the return of brahman into his own true nature a distinctly advaitic or nondualistic philosophy of shankara 46 68 69 the concept of moksha is explained as ekatva oneness and sayujya absorption intimate union wherein one is completely lost in brahman self supreme being ones true nature 70 this states rukmini is proclamation of return of the individual soul to the absolute and its merging into the absolute which is unmistakably advaitic in its trend 70 in the same passages the bhagavata includes a mention of bhagavan as the object of concentration thereby presenting the bhakti path from the three major paths of hindu spirituality discussed in the bhagavad gita 70 71the theology in the bhagavad gita discusses both the sentient and the nonsentient the soul and the matter of existence it envisions the universe as the body of vishnu krishna state harold coward and daniel maguire vishnu in gitas theology pervades all souls all matter and time 13 in sri vaishnavism subtradition vishnu and sri goddess lakshmi are described as inseparable that they pervade everything together both together are the creators who also pervade and transcend their creation 13the bhagavata purana in many passages parallels the ideas of nirguna brahman and nonduality of adi shankara 69 for examplethe aim of life is inquiry into the truth and not the desire for enjoyment in heaven by performing religious rites those who possess the knowledge of the truth call the knowledge of nonduality as the truth it is called brahman the highest self and bhagavan— sūta bhagavata purana 121011 translated by daniel sheridan 72scholars describe the vaishnava theology as built on the foundation of nondualism speculations in upanishads and term it as advaitic theism 69 73 the bhagavata purana suggests that god vishnu and the soul atman in all beings is one 68 bryant states that the monism discussed in bhagavata purana is certainly built on the vedanta foundations but not exactly the same as the monism of adi shankara 74 the bhagavata asserts according to bryant that the empirical and the spiritual universe are both metaphysical realities and manifestations of the same oneness just like heat and light are real but different manifestations of sunlight 74in the bhakti tradition of vaishnavism vishnu is attributed with numerous qualities such as omniscience energy strength lordship vigour and splendour 75 the vaishnava tradition started by madhvacharya considers vishnu in the form of krishna to be the supreme creator personal god allprevading all devouring one whose knowledge and grace leads to moksha 76 in madhvacharya vaishnava theology the supreme vishnu and the souls of living beings are two different realities and nature dualism while in ramanujas sri vaishnavism they are different but share the same essential nature qualified nondualism 77 78 79relations with deities lakshmi vishnu with lakshmi  laxminarayan at halebidu main article lakshmi

101the ten bestknown avatars of vishnu are collectively known as the dashavatara a sanskrit compound meaning ten avatars five different lists are included in the bhagavata purana where the difference is in the sequence of the names freda matchett states that this resequencing by the composers may be intentional so as to avoid implying priority or placing something definitive and limitation to the

incarnation of vishnu buddhists in sri lanka venerate vishnu as the custodian deity of sri lanka and protector of buddhism 121 vishnu is also known as upulvan or uthpala varna meaning blue lotus coloured some postulate that uthpala varna was a local deity who later merged with vishnu while another belief is that uthpala varna was an early form of vishnu before he became a supreme deity in puranic hinduism according to chronicles mahawamsa chulawamsa and folklore in sri lanka buddha himself handed over the custodianship to vishnu others believe that buddha entrusted this task to sakra  indra and sakra delegated this task of custodianship to god vishnu 122 many buddhist and hindu shrines are dedicated to vishnu in sri lanka in addition to specific vishnu kovils or devalayas all

and goddesses who were integrated into the sinhala buddhist religious culture such as the 14th and 15thcentury lankatilaka and gadaladeniya buddhist temples 125 he states that the medieval sinhala tradition encouraged visnu worship puja as a part of theravada buddhism just like hindu tradition incorporated the buddha as an avatar of vishnu but contemporary theravada monks are attempting to purge the vishnu worship practice from buddhist temples 126 according to holt the veneration of vishnu in sri lanka is evidence of a remarkable ability over many centuries to reiterate and reinvent culture as other ethnicities have been absorbed into their own though the vishnu cult in ceylon was formally endorsed by kandyan kings in the early 1700s holt states that vishnu images and shrines are among conspicuous ruins in the medieval capital polonnaruwa14thcentury vishnu thailand vishnu iconography such as statues and etchings have been found in archeological sites of southeast asia now

an abandoned village of russia in the volga region archaeologist alexander kozhevin excavated an ancient idol of vishnu the idol dates from between the 7th and 10th centuries in the interview kozhevin stated that we may consider it incredible but we have ground to assert that middlevolga region was the original land of ancient rus this is a hypothesis but a hypothesis which requires thorough research 138iconography and temples the frontview of padmanabhaswamy temple in thiruvananthapuram kerala vishnu iconography show him with a dark blue bluegray or black colored skin and as a well dressed jeweled man he is typically shown with four arms but two armed representations are also found and discussed in hindu texts on artworks 139 140 the historic identifiers of his icon include his image holding a conch shell between first two fingers of one hand left back a chakra – war discus – in another right back the conch shell is spiral and symbolizes all of interconnected spiraling cyclic existence while the discus symbolizes him as that which restores dharma with war if necessary when cosmic equilibrium is overwhelmed by evil 139 one of his arms sometimes carries a gadda club mace which symbolizes authority and power of knowledge 139 in the fourth arm he holds a lotus flower which symbolizes purity and transcendence 139 140 141 the items he holds in various hands varies giving rise to twenty four combinations of iconography each combination representing a special form of vishnu each of these special forms is given a special name in texts such as the agni purana and padma purana these texts however are inconsistent 142 vishnu iconography show him either in standing pose seated in a yoga pose or reclining hindu texts on iconography describe design rules of these

pradesh for example is dated to the early 6th century and features the ten avatars of vishnu 143 58 its design based on a square layout and vishnu iconography broadly follows the 1st millennium hindu texts on architecture and construction such as the brihat samhita and visnudharmottarapurana 144archaeological evidence suggest that vishnu temples and iconography probably were already in existence by the 1st century bce 145 the most significant vishnurelated epigraphy and archaeological remains are the two 1st century bce inscriptions in rajasthan which refer to temples of sankarshana and
