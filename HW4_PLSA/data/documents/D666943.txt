voteacceptedbut i was wondering how normal it is to go through several years ofschool before a problem is noticed by parents andor teachers or other professionals is this possible autism is strange beast it is extremely varied from person to person and other psychological disorders and several genetic ones can look like autism and not be it depression is a good example both have very similar symptoms and at times its a toss up between which one it is3 is around the age where they make an actual diagnosis  also i believe but if you have a good pediatrician they start looking for signs much earlier 15 to 2 years old you should have been asked questions or given a list to fill out before the childs 2 year checkup now depending on the childs age this may not have happened as within the past few years they revised the checklist to include children of a younger age you can ask your childs doctor for an autism checklist they give to parents to see if concern is warranted children can technically move in and out of this diagnosis its just that most dont unfortunately there is no genetic test etc to say yep thats what it is on the upside that means that some of those who go through counseling etc can lead a somewhat normal as opposed to things like downs syndrome where those people will almost always need some sort of help it is definitely possible for this to get missed teachers and doctors who are overworked or just dont care could miss early warning signs the problem with autism is that it covers a range of behaviors depending on the severity a mild case might be labelled as quirky or shy 30 years ago a child who was considered an outsider might be diagnosed with autism now aspergers syndrome is an autism spectrum disorder and people with this are capable of functioning in society without difficulty if you have health insurance what i would do is explain to the childs doctor your concerns and see what comes as that check with your insurance provider and see if you can have a psychologist do a formal evaluation you can also check with the school to see if they have someone who can do that also in the u s most places have developmental schools which are specifically geared towards diagnosing and helping children with disabilities i suggest this advice more than all others have two people evaluate the child autism can be very very difficult to diagnose because it focuses on a range of behaviors one person may say no where the other may say yes if you suspect something is wrong and the first says no go to the second one i know this sounds like you are shopping for the answer you want but in this case you should be absolutely sure the sooner the better too the earlier treatment starts the better off the child will be above all you need to have professionals evaluate the child dont try and make a formal judgement yourself they know what to look for and they know what other problems look and what to look for here is what you have to remember above all about autism the child is still your kid autism is nothing more than a name given to a series of behaviors dont let a formal diagnosis change how you feel all it is saying is that the person needs some help in certain areas think of it like getting a math tutor but its tutoring for social skills most children with autism arent slow they arent retarded they just have difficulty

a lot of symptoms present as normal adolescent awkwardness – bill dec 13 11 at 1738add a commentup vote4down vote this is a very difficult question to answer for the following reasons autism spectrum disorders are incredibly varied the medical definition of autism is changing the dsm iv definition is quite different from the soontobeadopted dsm v definition the legal definition of autism at least in the us is completely different from the medical definition of autism autism isnt only diagnosed when a child is autistic at least here in the u s huge monetary benefits are lavished upon schools for each child diagnosed with autism thus if a child has any special needs rather than having no extra help paying for what can be expensive treatment schools are motivated to shoehorn the child into a diagnosis like autism that comes with federal and state funding theres a difference between diagnosing autism and accurately diagnosing autism theres no objective test for autism in most cases the best way to diagnose autism is to see if the treatments that help autism help the child so in a way its hard to know if a child is autistic until after heshe is diagnosed with autism finally as kevin already pointed out many other things can be confused for autism a number of speechlanguage disorders emotional trauma sensory integration disorders sensory processing disorders extremely high iq a number of social issues and several behavior disorders just off the top of my head are commonly mistaken for autism as a very general guideline id be very leery of someone offering a definitive autism diagnosis under age 6 or so and id be equally skeptical of an autism determination for a child who showed no symptoms during early schooling and suddenly developed problems later on while it can sometimes be difficult to discern whether a young ones problems are related to autism or not unless its a case of highfunctioning autism or aspergers being initially masked by a very bright childs intelligence its hard not to know that something is up long before the child is done with primary schoolshare improve this answeranswered apr 8 11 at 054hedge mage127k 1 37 63add a commentup vote2down vote sorry but i have to disagree with kevin based upon the evidence autism is generally diagnosed around the second birthday and as another poster said there is a wide variation and severity of problems which make a child at one end of the autistic spectrum very very different from a child at the other end of the spectrum the problems can not simply be explained in terms of behaviours like needing a math tutor  these are a set of problems caused by abnormal neurodevelopment it seems that in individuals who have autism parts of the brain wire themselves together differently  it now seems also that there can be various causes for this one of which is genetic but also autism can be caused by brain injury neither are the problems caused by this abnormal wiring pattern just social they are wide ranging the fact is that the majority of children who have autism also have some degree of learning difficulty  some also have epilepsy  many experience sensory processing difficulties which then have the effect of producing obsessive compulsive defensive and other behaviours as to your point about being able to go several years without is being noticed  with some very mild cases possible there is a good book which describes many of the problems which are faced by autistic individuals which you can find it hereshare improve this answeranswered jun 30 11 at 1401andrew brereton1050 8
