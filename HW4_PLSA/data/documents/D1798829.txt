italian mainland and the campaign on italian soil until the surrender of the german armed forces in italy in may 1945 it is estimated that between september 1943 and april 1945 some 60000–70000 allied

there was disagreement between the allies on the best strategy to defeat the axis  citation needed the british especially the prime minister winston churchill advocated their traditional navalbased peripheral strategy even with a large army but greater naval power the traditional british answer against a continental enemy was to fight as part of a coalition and mount small peripheral operations designed to gradually weaken the enemy the united states with the larger u s army favoured a more direct method of fighting the main force of the german army in northwestern europe the ability to launch such a campaign depended on first winning the battle of the atlantic the strategic disagreement was fierce with the u s service chiefs arguing for an invasion of france as early as possible while their british counterparts advocated a policy centred on operations in the mediterranean there was even pressure from some latin american countries to stage an invasion of spain which under francisco franco was friendly to the axis nations although not a participant in the war 24 the american staff believed that a fullscale invasion of france at the earliest possible time was required to end the war in europe and that no operations should be undertaken that might delay that effort the british argued that the presence of large numbers of troops trained for amphibious landings in the mediterranean made a limitedscale invasion possible and useful  citation neededeventually the u s and british political leadership reached a compromise in which both would commit most of their forces to an invasion of france in early 1944 but also launch a relatively small scale italian campaign a contributing factor was franklin d roosevelt s desire to keep us troops active in the european theatre during 1943 and his attraction to the idea of eliminating italy from the war 25 it was hoped that an invasion might knock italy out of the conflict 26 or at least increase the pressure on it and weaken it 27 28 the elimination of italy would enable allied naval forces principally the royal navy to dominate the mediterranean sea securing the lines of communications with egypt the far east the middle east and india 28 29 italian divisions on occupation and coastal defence duties in the balkans and france would be withdrawn to defend italy while the germans would have to transfer troops from the eastern front to defend italy and the entire southern coast of france thus aiding the soviets 30 31campaign  editinvasion of sicily  editmain article allied invasion of sicily british infantry marching through the town of noto sicily 11 july 1943 a combined allied invasion of sicily began on 10 july 1943 with both amphibious and airborne landings at the gulf of gela the land forces involved were the u s seventh army under lieutenant general george s patton and the british eighth army under general bernard montgomery the original plan contemplated a strong advance by the british northwards along the east coast to messina with the americans in a supporting role along their left flank when the eighth army were held up by stubborn defences in the rugged hills south of mount etna patton amplified the american role by a wide advance northwest toward palermo and then directly north to cut the northern coastal road this was followed by an eastward advance north of etna towards messina supported by a series of amphibious landings on the northern coast that propelled pattons troops into messina shortly before the first units of the eighth army the defending german and italian forces were unable to prevent the allied capture of the island but they succeeded in evacuating most of their troops to the mainland with the last leaving on 17 august 1943 the allied forces gained

achse artillery being landed during the invasion of mainland italy at salerno september 1943 forces of the british eighth army still under montgomery landed in the toe of italy on 3 september 1943 in operation baytown the day the italian government agreed to an armistice with the allies the armistice was publicly announced on 8 september by two broadcasts first by general eisenhower and then by a proclamation by marshal badoglio although the german forces prepared to defend without italian assistance only two of their divisions opposite the eighth army and one at salerno were not tied up disarming the royal italian army on 9 september forces of the u s fifth army under lieutenant general mark w clark expecting little resistance landed against heavy german resistance at salerno in operation avalanche in addition british forces landed at taranto in operation slapstick which was almost unopposed there had been a hope that with the surrender of the italian government the germans would withdraw to the north since at the time adolf hitler had been persuaded that southern italy was strategically unimportant however this was not to be although for a while the eighth army was able to make relatively easy progress up the eastern coast capturing the port of bari and the important airfields around foggia despite none of the northern reserves having been made available to the german 10th army it nevertheless came close to repelling the salerno landing the main allied effort in the west initially centred on the port of naples that city was selected because it was the northmost port that could receive air cover by fighter planes flying from sicily as the allies advanced they encountered increasingly difficult terrain the apennine mountains form a spine along the italian peninsula offset somewhat to the east in the most mountainous areas of abruzzo more than half the width of the peninsula comprises crests and peaks over 3000 feet 910 m that are relatively easy to defend and the spurs and reentrants to the spine confronted the allies with a succession of ridges and rivers across their line of advance the rivers were subject to sudden and unexpected flooding which constantly thwarted the allied commanders plans 32allied advance to rome  editmain articles bernhardt line moro river campaign battle of monte cassino and battle of anzio the situation south of rome showing german prepared defensive lines in early october 1943 hitler was persuaded by his army group commander in southern italy field marshal albert kesselring that the defence of italy should be conducted as far away from germany as possible this would make the most of the natural defensive geography of central italy whilst denying the allies the easy capture of a succession of airfields each one being ever closer to germany hitler was also convinced that yielding southern italy would provide the allies with a springboard for an invasion of the balkans with its vital resources of oil bauxite and copper 33canadian sniper at the battle of ortona kesselring was given command of the whole of italy and immediately ordered the preparation of a series of defensive lines across italy south of rome two lines the volturno and the barbara were used to delay the allied advance so as to buy time to prepare the most formidable defensive positions which formed the winter line – the collective name for the gustav line and two associated defensive lines on the west of the apennine mountains the bernhardt and hitler lines the latter had been renamed the senger line by 23 may 1944 34polish ii corps and bishop józef gawlina in casarano canadian soldiers inspect a captured german mg34 machine gun the winter line proved a major obstacle to the allies at the end of 1943 halting the fifth armys advance on the western side of italy although the gustav line was penetrated on the eighth armys adriatic front and ortona captured blizzards drifting snow and zero visibility at the end of december caused the advance to grind to a halt the allies focus then turned to the western front where an attack through the liri valley was considered to have the best chance of a breakthrough towards the italian capital landings at anzio during operation shingle advocated by the british prime minister winston churchill behind the line were intended to destabilise the german gustav line defences but the early thrust inland to cut off the german defences did not occur thanks to the indecisiveness of the american commander  major general john p lucas  and the anzio forces became bottled up in their beachhead lucas was replaced by major general lucian truscott german tiger i tank in front of the altare della patria in rome in 1944 it took four major offensives between january and may 1944 before the line was eventually broken by a combined assault of the fifth and eighth armies including british american french polish and canadian corps concentrated along a twentymile front between monte cassino and the western seaboard in a concurrent action american general mark clark was ordered to break out of the stagnant position at anzio and cashin on the opportunity to cut off and destroy a large part of the german 10th army retreating from the gustav line between them and the canadians but this opportunity was lost on the brink of success when clark disobeyed his orders and sent his u s forces to enter the vacant rome instead 35 rome had been declared an open city by the german army so no resistance was encountered the ruined town of pontecorvo 26 may 1944 the american forces took possession of rome on 4 june 1944 36 the german tenth army were allowed to get away and in the next few weeks were responsible for doubling the allied casualties

operation dragoon codename for the allied invasion of southern france the sudden removal of these experienced units from the italian front was only partially compensated for by the gradual arrival of three divisions the brazilian 1st infantry division the u s 92nd infantry division both in the second half of 1944 and the u s 10th mountain division in january 1945 36in the period from june to august 1944 the allies advanced beyond rome taking florence and closing up on the gothic line 37 this last major defensive line ran from the coast some 30 miles 48 km north of pisa along the jagged apennine mountains chain between florence and bologna to the adriatic coast just south of rimini in order to shorten the allied lines of communication for the advance into northern italy the polish ii corps advanced towards the port of ancona and after a monthlong battle succeeded in capturing it on 18 july british infantry moving cautiously through the ruined streets of imprunetta 3 august 1944 during operation olive which commenced on 25 august the gothic line defences were penetrated on both the fifth and eighth army fronts but there was no decisive breakthrough churchill the british prime minister had hoped that a major advance in late 1944 would open the way for the allied armies to advance northeast through the ljubljana gap the area between venice and vienna which is todays slovenia to vienna and hungary to forestall the red army from advancing into eastern europe churchills proposal had been strongly opposed by the u s chiefs of staff who not fully understanding its importance to british postwar interests in the region did not think that it aligned with the overall allied war priorities 36in october lieutenant general sir richard mc creery succeeded lieutenant general sir

succeeded in command of the fifth army by lieutenant general lucian k truscott jr in the winter and spring of 1944–45 extensive partisan activity in northern italy took place as there were two italian governments during this period one on each side of the war the struggle took on some characteristics of a civil war brazilian troops arrive in the city of massarosa italy september 1944 the poor winter weather which made armoured manoeuvre and the exploitation of overwhelming air superiority impossible coupled with the massive losses suffered to its ranks during the autumn fighting 38 39 the need to transfer some british troops to greece as well as the need to withdraw the british 5th infantry division and i canadian corps to northwestern europe made it impractical for the allies to continue their offensive in early 1945 instead the allies adopted a strategy of offensive defence while preparing for a final attack when better weather and ground conditions arrived in the spring an italian soldier on the gothic line late 1944 in late februaryearly march 1945 operation encore saw elements of the u s iv corps 1st brazilian division and the newly arrived u s 10th mountain division
