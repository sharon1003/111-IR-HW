stenosis aortoostial stenosis overview coronary ostial stenosis refers to the narrowing of the ostium part of the coronary arteries an ostial lesion is defined as a lesion which begins within 35 mm of the origin of a major epicardial artery ostial lesions represent a challenge to the interventional cardiologist because they often involve the wall of the aorta they are often calcified they may not fully dilate and they are prone to restenosis a key issue in the treatment of an ostial lesion is to assure that the stent is inserted proximal enough to fully cover the aorto  ostial junction particularly in the right coronary artery  essentially the operator must realize that the aortic wall is being stented as well causes atherosclerosis 1syphilis 2diagnosis angiography pci in the ostial lesion technical considerations predilation direct stenting confers many benefits in lesions other than the ostial lesion pre dilation is critical in the ostial lesion for may reasons1 assurance that the aorto  ostial junction will dilate the aorto  ostial junction may be more refractory to dilation and may have greater recoil if the aorto  ostial junction will not dilate it may not be a good idea to insert a stent because you may not be able to fully expand the stent  following stent placement with a residual lesion i once ruptured three balloons trying to dilate the stent at high pressures c michael gibson m s m d2 use a low pressure inflation to define the extent of the lesion proximally  i like to inflate the balloon to 12 atmosphere and see how for the lesion extends proximally while doing this i spin the gantry to gauge the proximal extent of the lesion in multiple angles any one view may underestimate the proximal extent of the lesion  c michael gibson m s m d debulking debulking in the calcified ostial right coronary artery may be necessary using rotational atherectomy before stenting  use of a longer stent use a longer stent than you anticipate1 it is often tempting to use a short 8 mm stent to cover such a short lesion however use of a longer stent will reduce the rocking of the stent that occurs during systole and diastole during stent deployment2 it will also reduce the risk of watermelon seeding3 it increases the chances that sufficient stent is available to cover the aortic wall2011 accfahascai guidelines for percutaneous coronary intervention
