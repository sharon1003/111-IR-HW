first samuel 1120 samuels mother authored by rev takao kiyohiro tokyo japan1 today we read the opening section of  the book of first samuel the book of ruth is located in our bibles right before that ill spare you a detailed explanation but in the original hebrew bible the book of judges actually comes right before first samuel the end of judges concludes as follows in those days there was no king in israel and they did what they considered right from person to person in their own eyes judges 2125 this is the setting to the narrative we read for today people were living by their own individual standards the people of god were truly in a spiritual dark ages but among such israelites god raised up a man of god it was samuel the history of israel was immensely altered by this man2 and god chose a specific woman to give samuel upon this earth god chose a woman to become samuels mother it was hannah what kind of person was she was she a female warrior who grieved for her country and burned with the ideal of the people of god no she didnt seemed to be like that by any means when we look at todays scriptural passage we see that she was a lonely weak person pounded by sadness and worries god chose a woman like her and had prepared her for the birth of samuel this preparation was done through one of the great hardships she was given a test of faith3 this hardship given her took the form of no children being born to her the bible ventures to say in verse five that the lord closed up hannahs womb in other words the bible explicitly informs us that the will of god is at work here4 back then when no children were born to you it was taken as an extremely religious situation they thought when you had a lot of children it was the blessing of god but when you couldnt have children it was regarded as a curse from god thats why it wasnt unusual at all when a childless person habitually received unearned suffering and was all the time discriminated against5 furthermore it was also a time back then when polygamy was commonly accepted hannahs husband also had him another wife it said her name was peninnah as youd expect by his having two wives there strife arose in the home peninnah hated hannah and hurt her6 peninnah had children but hannah did not this was suitable material for peninnahs attack on her how would she hurt her in verse six it has it that when the lord did not grant her children she made her depressed and tormented her she did that at festival time when they worshipped the lord and presented sacrifices to him in other words its not that peninnah tormented her with the fact that there would be no heir to leave behind hannahs name thats not what it was rather she hurt her saying you are cursed by god its useless for you no matter how much you may try to worship god even if you offer a sacrifice to god it will have no meaning thus hannahs problem was the problem of being placed in a situation where everyone thinks she was so cursed by god and in their not understanding gods will at all7 it was a test of faith more than mere pain it was an ordeal in which her very faith itself was being accused and tested when she did not understand the will of god and at the time when she could not find his good will in visible form the doubts of whether do i keep looking to god or do i turn my back on god were in question8 of course hannah wasnt the only one alone who had experienced such testing we can find this in the lives of the many characters who appear in the bible for example consider jesus mother mary i wonder how surprised and stunned mary was when it was announced to her that she had conceived by the holy spirit and she was in a situation where her engagement to be married should have been broken 1 her trust in god and obedience to him were under fire in all this mary said according to your word may it befall me luke 1389 as for another example but in a different form we can see the same test in the book of job10 it says in the text that job was pure and righteous he feared god and lived avoiding evil job 11 god said to satan have you noticed my servant job there is no one like on the earth he is pure and righteous fears god and lives avoiding evil 18 in reply to this satan spoke as follows will job honor god even while there is no benefit to him arent you preserving him his clan and all his properties you bless all the works of his hands please with this one thing to him lift your hand and try touching his property he will definitely turn his face to yours and curse you 111 this is from the opening section of the book of job11 as we understand from the entire book of job these words of satan are words that have great significance i dont think im the only one who has the feeling of having their hearts searched out by these words what we call faith is often times really a trust in signs visible to the eye when we take the good will of god in a form visible to the eye then fearing god and trusting him isnt hard to do but satan says will you honor god even while there is no benefit to you when you no longer understands gods will and when you cant find gods grace in a visible form anywhere will you still turn your eyes to god and respect him that is what is at stake here that is the significance of the test given to job and that is the significance of the test given to hannah the prayer in which she pours out her life12 well amid such great suffering what did hannah do it says the following beginning in verse nine then the sacrificial meal at siloh ended and hannah stood up the priest eli was sitting on a seat near the pillar of the temple of the lord groaning with pain hannah prayed to the lord and wept hard verses nine through twelve13 she was not the kind of person who remained calm regardless of the suffering she showed her pain openly she wept and wouldnt eat anything she moped along but she didnt turn her back on the lord i think that is wonderful just because we are believers we dont need to smile when we want to cry when we want to cry we should cry we might even feel a little blue but we should not turn our backs on god if hannah had turned against god what would have happened if she had turned against god and paid back evil for peninnahs animosity what would have happened that house would have surely become like a hell  as if samuel had never been given to it but she did not pursue such a foolish course she was probably filled with sorrow but she stood up and she went to pray she goes to the lord14 as hannah wept hard she prayed there a long time because the priest eli saw hannahs lips moving since she was praying on the inside of her heart he misunderstood her as being drunken with wine eli said to her how long will you be drunk start sobering up whereupon she replied no kind priest you are mistaken i am a woman with deep sorrow i have not been drinking wine or strong drink i have only poured out my request before the lord from my heart verse fifteen15 its a detailed account but i think its a very poor translation here where it says i have only poured out my request before the lord from my heart in verse eleven as she states her own request and vow it might be translated here as request from the heart but this is a word that ought to be translated by all rights as life or soul in other words she had not been just pouring out her requests she was pouring out her life or we could say she was pouring out her entire being before the lord it wasnt a partial thing like a request we should expect that what was going on in her was not only her requests there was probably resentment towards peninnah in her there was probably sorrow over her husband who truly never understood her pain she must have been so lonely because of that in addition i dont think we can say she never even had resentful feelings towards god who had allowed such a condition in her life she included all these things and poured out her whole being before god16 and the reason she could make a prayer in pouring out her life was that there is one who steadfastly accepts it there are limitations among us human beings no matter how much we trust or love we have limits when someone pours out his or her soul it is humans who cant take it but god who heard hannahs prayer is different from humans he is a being who does accept our lives our souls and our entire beings17 before long at the end of her prayer like she made she accepted the words of the priest to be at peace and return home verse seventeen and she went back home then the bible says this after that she ate the meal but her facial expressions were no longer like they were before verse eighteen in the bible society version it is translated loosely as her face was sorrowful no more18 nothing at all changed in her life situation no children were born when she went back home peninnahs egging on was still there as always she might have been sad that she was not understood by her husband but she herself had changed she is in a tight spot here but there she is already over and passed the hardship when she had poured out her life and turned it over to god she broke past her difficulty19 hannah was given a great test according to the deep plans of god in it hannah did not turn her back on god but poured out her soul and prayed here we have the figure of a person of faith that we ought to look at and because she was like that when samuel was born she did not raise her child as if she had owned him but she nurtured the child with faith and soon was able to present the child to the lord just as she had vowed to him thus samuel came to be sent into a world of darkness i think today we should engrave in our hearts this image of samuels mother end note1 the hebrew custom of marriage at that time even required a bill of divorcement for just engagement periods as well
