choice when karnad started writing plays kannada literature was highly influenced by the renaissance in western literature writers would choose a subject that looked entirely alien to manifestation of

from the mahabharata in kannada i could actually hear the dialogues being spoken into my ears  i was just the scribe said karnad in a later interview yayati was published in 1961 when he was 23 years old it is based on the story of king yayati one of the ancestors of the pandavas who was cursed into premature old age by his preceptor shukracharya who was incensed at yayatis infidelity yayati in turn asks his sons to sacrifice their youth for him and one of them agrees it ridicules the ironies of life through characters in mahabharata it became an instant success immediately translated and staged in several other indian languages 10karnad found a new approach of drawing historical and mythological sources to tackle contemporary themes and existentialist crisis of modern man through characters locked in psychological and philosophical conflicts his next was tughlaq 1964 about a rashly idealist 14thcentury sultan of delhi muhammad bin tughluq and allegory on the nehruvian era
