robotic prostate surgery – superior results and reduced risks robotic prostate cancer surgery using the da vinci system offers several advantages over the traditional laparoscopic surgical method of treating prostate cancer when objectively compared in the following areas clinically superior results reduced risk of complications quicker recovery period minimize scarring what is robotic prostate surgery robotic prostatectomy is a radical prostatectomy that is also known as robotic assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy ralp it is a minimally invasive prostate removal and cancer treatment surgery dr samadi developed his signature smart samadi modified advanced robotic technique prostate surgery which incorporates oncologic principles combines it with open radical prostatectomy skills and builds upon it with a robotic surgery approach robotic surgery is really a remote control operation where the surgeon sits at a real distance from the patient and as he does the surgery the entire movements of the surgeon are translated through the sensitive fibers of the machine with certain precision to the tip of the instruments the surgeon can even be in a different hospital a different state or a different country on another continent it doesn’t matter such an operation is truly done in a remote fashion smart is a revolutionary and advanced prostate cancer surgery and prostate cancer treatment method which drastically reduces blood loss pain hospital stay recovery time and the side effects of other types of prostate cancer treatments the smart technique is also known as bloodless prostate surgery the smart technique does not require opening the endopelvic fascia or cutting the dorsal vein complex this results in no sutures and less damage to the neurovascular bundle dr samadi is able to enter into the patient through a few small “keyhole” entrances and handle the smart robotic surgery with very tiny and precise instruments that allow him to perform the surgery with great precision and remove the patient’s prostate gland without doing any harm to surrounding tissue the patient is left with only a few small marks on his abdomen – none of the scars normally associated with prostate cancer treatment and surgery clinically superior results with robotic prostate cancer surgery the da vinci robotic prostate cancer surgery system is able to provide superior clinical prostate cancer treatment results when compared to nonrobotic traditional and scopeassisted procedures this is because the da vinci system’s surgeon console is equipped to provide the surgeon with a revolutionary threedimensional multilevel magnification spectrum more traditional scopeassisted surgery typically provides a much lower resolution image and a far more limited field of vision furthermore the da vinci system’s sensitive electronics and one centimeter diameter surgical arms allow the surgeon to make highly precise movements inside the incision during robotic prostate cancer surgery this means that the malignant tissue can be removed with an efficiency and ease unheard of prior to the era of robotic surgery this greater precision reduces the likelihood of relapse due to missed cancerous tissue the precision of the da vinci system also allows the surgeon to avoid damaging healthy prostate tissue which improves clinical results reduces scar tissue build up and contributes to an overall shorter recovery period after robotic prostate surgery reduced risk of complications with robotic prostate surgery surgery is an inherently risky medical procedure however for prostate cancer treatment surgery can be the most effective choice for eradicating malignant tumors without the painful side effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy among the more serious risks associated with surgical treatment is the possibility of infection at the incision site such infections are often the primary cause of serious complications which may hamper a quick and uneventful recovery the da vinci system greatly mitigates the risk of infection during robotic prostate surgery first the size of the incision s is significantly smaller with robotic prostate surgery than with the traditional procedure a standard nonrobotic prostate surgery requires a six to eightinch vertical incision to the abdomen a large open incision increases the patient’s susceptibility to bacterial infection during and after the surgery postoperative infections are more common than intraoperative infections as hospital rooms are not maintained at the same level of sterility which operating rooms are the da vinci robotic prostate surgery system utilizes a much less invasive technique requiring four to five small incisions each less than two inches these smaller incisions will heal significantly faster than the large incision needed in traditional surgery quicker recovery period after robotic prostate surgery when a physician determines robotic prostate surgery is the best prostate cancer treatment option da vinci’s robotic technology optimizes the chances of a quicker recovery time as opposed to traditional surgical prostatectomy the smaller incisions required to maneuver the operating arms heal much faster require fewer sutures and therefore are less vulnerable to tearing or infection the precise movements of the robotic arms allow a more targeted approach for cleaner removal of malignant tissue and reduces damage to healthy tissue during robotic prostate surgery the operating arms of the da vinci surgical system are designed to avoid contact between the operating instruments and the walls of the incision all of these advantages translate to a speedier and less worrisome recovery period minimal scarring after robotic prostate cancer surgery the sheer size of the incision needed for a traditional prostatectomy produces significant scarring in the patient’s lower abdomen the robotic prostate surgery procedure leaves incisions which heal with little or no visible scarring in addition to the obvious aesthetic value minimizing scar tissue on the interior walls of the incision promotes better healing excess scar tissue buildup can sometimes interfere with the proper function of the prostate although such a complication is rare it’s worth considering when exploring prostate cancer treatment options the precision of robotic prostate surgery offers an inherent solution to this potential difficulty by minimizing the size of the incision needed to remove cancerous tissue the risk of scar tissuerelated complications is greatly mitigated surgeon console for robotic prostate surgery the surgeon operates while seated comfortably at the da vinci surgeon console an ergonomically designed console viewing a 3d image of the operative site as the surgeon moves his hands wrists and fingers the instruments are performing the same movements inside the patient’s body the da vinci robotic system is able to scale the doctor’s motions and translate them to the operating arms during robotic prostate surgery patientside cart this part of the robot provides the instrument arms that are completely under the control of the surgeon the laparoscopic arms pivot at the 1cm operating ports eliminating the use of the patient’s body wall for leverage and minimizing tissue damage supporting surgical team members assist in installing the proper instruments preparing the 1cm port in the patient as well as supervise the laparoscopic arms and tools being utilized whenever a robotic prostate surgery is underway in site vision system with high resolution 3d endoscope this component provides true 3d images of the operative field during robotic prostate surgery operative images are enhanced refined and optimized using image synchronizers high intensity illuminators and camera control units during the course of the robotic assisted surgery ny robotics expert david b samadi md – what is robotic prostate surgery learn
