microsoft management console windows event log task scheduler is a component of microsoft windows that provides the ability to schedule the launch of programs or scripts at predefined times or after specified time intervals job scheduling task scheduling it was first introduced in the microsoft plus for windows 95 as system agent 1 but was renamed to task scheduler in internet explorer 40 and windows 98 the windows event log service must be running before the task scheduler starts up this service should not be confused with the scheduler that allocates cpu resources to processes already in

edittask scheduler 10 is included with windows nt 40 with internet explorer 40 or later windows 2000 windows xp and windows server 2003 2 it runs as a windows service and the task definitions and schedules are stored in binary job files tasks are manipulated directly by manipulating the job files each task corresponds to single action on windows 95 with internet explorer 40 or later windows 98 and windows me the task scheduler runs as an ordinary program mstaskexe it also displays a status icon in the notification area on windows 95 and windows 98 and runs as a hidden service on windows me but can be made to show a tray icon 3 computer programs and scripts can access the service through six com interfaces 4 microsoft provides a scheduling agent dll a sample vbscript and a configuration file to automate task scheduler 5in addition to the graphical user interface for task scheduler in control panel windows provides two commandline tools for managing scheduled task atexe deprecated and schtasksexe 6 7 however atexe cannot access tasks created or modified by control panel or schtasksexe 8 also tasks created with atexe are not interactive by default interactivity needs to be explicitly requested 9task scheduler 20  edittask scheduler 20 was introduced with windows vista and included in windows server 2008 as well 2 the redesigned task scheduler user interface is now based on management console in addition to running tasks on scheduled times or specified intervals task scheduler 20 also supports calendar and eventbased triggers such as starting a task when a particular event is logged to the event log or when a combination of events has occurred also several tasks that are triggered by the same event can be configured to run either simultaneously or in a predetermined chained sequence of a series of actions instead of having to create multiple scheduled tasks tasks can also be configured to run based on system status such as being idle for a preconfigured amount of time on startup logoff or only during or for a specified time xpath expressions can be used to filter events from the windows event log tasks can also be delayed for a specified time after the triggering event has occurred or repeat until some other event occurs actions that need to be done if a task fails can also be configured the actions that can be taken in response to triggers both eventbased as well as timebased not only include launching applications but also take a number of custom actions task scheduler includes a number of actions builtin spanning a number of applications including send an email show a message box or fire a com handler when it is triggered custom actions can also be specified using the task scheduler api task scheduler keeps a history log of all execution details of all the tasks 10 windows vista uses task scheduler 20 to run various systemlevel tasks 11 consequently the task scheduler service can no longer be disabled except with a simple registry tweak task scheduler 20 exposes an api to allow computer programs and scripts create tasks 12 it consists of 42 cominterfaces 13 the windows api does not however include a managed wrapper for task scheduler though an open source implementation exists  citation needed the job files for task scheduler 20 are xml based and are humanreadable conforming to the task scheduler schema 12 although possible microsoft advises not to create the job files by hand and instead use the task scheduler api  citation neededother features  editnew security features including using credential manager to passwords for tasks on workgroup computers and using active directory for task credentials on domainjoined computers so that they cannot be retrieved easily also scheduled tasks are executed in their own session instead of the same session as system services or the current user ability to wake up a machine remotely or using bios timer from sleep or hibernation to execute a scheduled task or run a previously scheduled task after a machine gets turned on ability to attach tasks to events directly from the event viewer tasks  editthe task scheduler service works by managing tasks task refers to the action or actions taken in response to trigger s a task is defined by associating a set of actions which can include launching an application or taking some customdefined action to a set of triggers which can either be timebased or eventbased in addition a task also can contain metadata that defines how the actions will be executed such as the security context the task will run in tasks are serialized to job files and are stored in the special folder titled task folder organized in subdirectories programmatically the task folder is accessed using the itask folder interface or the task folder scripting object and individual tasks using the iregistered task interface or registered task object 14column last result  editthe last result column

2000 and windows xp tasks assigned to run with system privileges do not function when the computer is prepared for disk imaging with sysprep sysprep changes the security identifier sid to avoid duplication but does not update scheduled tasks to use the new sid consequently all system scheduled tasks fail to run on the imaged computers there is no solution for this problem but one may reschedule the tasks to work around the issue 17on windows vista or windows server 2008 where service pack 2 is not installed the next execution time displayed in task scheduler may be wrong 18on windows vista 7 2008 and 2008 r2 the mmc component says that you are running task scheduler 10 when in fact you are running 20 this is a trivial bug so it wasnt noticed and is likely due to the rewrite of the task scheduler the version has been corrected to 20 in windows 8 and in 2012 see also  editjob schedulingcron visual cron references  edit al fasoltd march 29 1998 windows 98 stable and
