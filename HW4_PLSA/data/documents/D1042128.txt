fireball at its introduction in 1962 was a large v6 engine used by general motors the block is made of cast iron and all use twovalvepercylinder iron heads actuated by pushrods the 3800 was on the wards 10 best engines of the 20th century list made wards yearly 10 best list multiple times and is one of the mostproduced engines in history to date over 25 million have been produced in 1967 gm sold the design to kaiserjeep the muscle car era had taken hold and gm no longer felt the need to produce a v6 considered in north america an unusual engine configuration at the time the energy crisis a decade later prompted the company to buy the design back from american motors amc who had by that point bought kaiserjeep and the descendants of the early 231 continue to be the mostcommon gm v6 as it developed into a very durable and reliable design though the pre3800 rearwheel drive rwd v6 uses the buick oldsmobile pontiac bop bellhousing pattern an oddity of both the frontwheel drive fwd and rwd 3800 v6 is that although it is a 90° v6 it uses the gm 60° v6 bell housing metric pattern for use in the fwd applications the bellhousings on the fwd transmissions are altered slightly this engine has the cylinders numbered 135 on the lefthand bank front bank for fwd applications and 246 on the righthand bank the number 1 cylinder being the furthest from the flywheel end the firing order is 165432 the engine was produced at the flint north plant in flint michigan with engine blocks and cylinder heads cast at the grey iron plant now the gm saginaw metal casting operations plant in saginaw michigan it is a derivative of buicks 215 cubic inch 35 l aluminium v8 family which also went on to become the rover v8 another engine with a very long life 1960–2006contents  hide 1 fireball v611

v6  editthe first engine in this family was introduced in 1961 for the 1962 model year buick special with buicks 198 cu in 32 l engine the first v6 in an american car because it was derived from buicks 215 cu in 35 l aluminum v8 it has a 90° bank between cylinders and an uneven firing pattern due to the crankshaft having only three crank pins set at 120° apart with opposing cylinders 12 34 and 56 sharing a crank pin in as do many v8 engines the uneven firing pattern was often perceived as roughness leading a former american motors executive to describe it as rougher than a cob in 1977 buick redesigned the crankshaft to a splitpin configuration to create an evenfiring version the crank pins associated with the opposing cylinders were offset from each other by 30° the relatively small offset did not require flying arms to be incorporated however a 30 mm thick flange was built in between the offset crank pins to prevent the connecting rod bigends from walking off the crank pin bearing journal and interfering with the adjacent big end the 30 mm thick flange effectively caused the connecting rods on the lefthand bank of cylinders forward bank for fwd applications to move 30 mm forward relative to the righthand bank but the engine block remained unchanged compared to the oddfire engine since the cylinders centrelines were no longer centralised over the crank pin bearing journals the connecting rods were redesigned with the bigends offset from the piston pin ends by 15 mm the engine in this configuration became known to have offcenter bore spacing the offcentre design continued up until the 1988 ln3 version of the engine when the lefthand bank of cylinders was moved forward relative to the righthand bank although the actual bore spacing between cylinders on the same bank remained unchanged at 1077 mm 4240 the ln3 and later engines became known to have oncenter bore spacing198  editbuick division concerned about high manufacturing costs of their innovative aluminum 215 v8 sought to develop a cheaper castiron engine based on the same tooling they settled on an unusual 90° v6 layout that was essentially the architecture of the 215 less two cylinders in initial form it had a bore of 3625 inches 9208 mm and stroke of 31875 inches 8096 mm for an overall displacement of 198 cu in 32 l it weighed about 35 lb 159 kg more than the aluminum engine but was far cheaper to produce dubbed the fireball v6 it became the standard engine in the 1962 buick special in their test that year road  track was impressed with buicks practical new v6 saying it sounds and performs exactly like the aluminum v8 in most respects 225  editthe bore was increased to 375 in 953 mm and stroke increased to 34 in 864 mm increasing displacement to 225 cu in 37 l since the engine was similar to the popular smallblock buick v8 — now with a castiron block and displacement of 300 cubic inches 49 l the engine was made cheaply at the same factory with much of the same tooling this engine was used in buicks intermediatesized special and skylark models from 1964 to 1967 and oldsmobiles midsized f85cutlass models for 1964 and 196519641965 models featured a 1barrel rochester mono jet producing 155 hp in 19661967 the 1barrel was replaced with a 2barrel rochester 2gv giving the engine a 5horsepower boost to 160 hp the v6 was dropped after the 1967 model year in favor of a conventional 250 cubicinch 4 l inline6 engine built by the chevrolet division and the tooling was sold to kaiserjeep dauntless  editin 1965 kaiserjeep began using the buick 225 in jeep cjs it was known as the dauntless v6 and used a much heavier flywheel than the buick version to damp vibrations resulting from the engines firing pattern buick sold the tooling for this engine to kaiser in 1967 as the demand for the engine was waning steadily in an era of v8s and muscle cars when american motors amc bought jeep they replaced the v6 with amc straight6 engines applications1966–1971 jeep jeepster  jeepster commando1966–1971 cj51966–1971 cj6231  editthe 1973 oil crisis prompted gm to look for more economical engines than the v8s of 350 400 and 454455 cubic inches that powered most general motors cars and trucks during that time at that time the only small engines generally offered by gm were built by the chevrolet division including the 140 cubicinch 23 l ohc aluminum fourcylinder engine used in the subcompact chevy vega and a 250 cubicinch inline sixcylinder used in smaller chevy buick oldsmobile and pontiac models whose design roots dated back to the 1962 chevy ii nova one quick idea was tried by buick engineers — taking an old fireball v6 picked up at a junkyard and installing it into a 1974 buick apollo the solution worked so well that gm wanted amc to put the engine back into production however amcs cost per unit was deemed as too high instead of buying completed engines gm made an offer to buy back the tooling and manufacturing line from amc in april 1974 and began building the engines on august 12 1 with production back within gm buick reintroduced the v6 that fall in certain 1975 models — a move made possible by the fact that foundations for the old v6 machinery were still intact at buicks engine assembly plant in flint michigan so it was easy to put the old tooling back in place and begin production at least two years ahead of the normal schedule that would have been required to create new tooling the bore was enlarged to 38 in 965 mm identical to the buick 350 and olds 307 v8s yielding 231 cu in 38 l displacement 78349 231s were installed in buicks for 1975 2due to difficulties with the new fuel economy and emissions standards the engine produced just 110 hp 82 k w this engine was used in the following vehicles1975 buick

the buick v6 and the 229 cid chevrolet v6 are 90degree v6 engines and both are often referred to as being a 38l v6 these engines should not be confused as being the same and are unique engine designs the 229 cid chevrolet v6 was essentially a small block chevy v8 missing two cylinders1978–1987 chevrolet monte carlo this is very confusing as monte carlo at various times used both the v6 from the
