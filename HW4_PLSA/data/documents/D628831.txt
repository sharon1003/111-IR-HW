lifestyle ongoing care battery replacement pacemaker definition and factsa pacemaker is a small device thats placed in the chest or abdomen to help control abnormal heart rhythms this device uses lowenergy electrical pulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate pacemakers are used to treat arrhythmias arrhythmias are problems with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat during an arrhythmia the heart can beat too fast too slow or with an irregular rhythm pacemakers can relieve some arrhythmia symptoms such as fatigue  tiredness and fainting a pacemaker also can help a person who has abnormal heart rhythms resume a more active lifestyle doctors also treat arrhythmias with implantable cardioverter defibrillators icds icds are similar to pacemakers however besides using lowenergy electrical pulses to control abnormal heart rhythms icds also can use highenergy electrical pulses to treat certain dangerous arrhythmias doctors recommend pacemakers for a number of reasons the most common reasons are bradycardia and heart block bradycardia is a slower than normal heartbeat heart block is a problem that occurs with the hearts electrical system the disorder occurs when an electrical signal is slowed or disrupted as it moves through the heart before recommending a pacemaker your doctor will consider any arrhythmia symptoms you have such as dizziness unexplained fainting or shortness of breath he or she also will consider whether you have a history of heart disease what medicines youre currently taking and the results of heart tests a pacemaker consists of a battery a computerized generator and wires with sensors called electrodes on one end the electrodes detect your hearts electrical activity and send data through the wires to the computer in the generator if your heart rhythm is abnormal the computer will direct the generator to send electrical pulses to your heart the pulses then travel through the wires to reach your heart newer pacemakers also can monitor your blood temperature breathing and other factors and adjust your heart rate to changes in your activity placing a pacemaker requires minor surgery the surgery usually is done in a hospital or special heart treatment laboratory youll be given medicine just before the surgery that will help you relax and may make you sleepy the surgery takes just a few hours but youll stay in the hospital overnight so your health care team can check your heartbeat and make sure your pacemaker is working properly complications from pacemaker surgery are rare most people can return to their normal activities within a few days your doctor may ask you to avoid vigorous exercise or heavy lifting for about a month after your surgery after you have fully recovered from surgery discuss with your doctor how much and what kinds of physical activity are safe for you once you have a pacemaker you have to avoid close or prolonged contact with electrical devices or devices that have strong magnetic fields you also need to avoid certain medical procedures that can disrupt your pacemaker let all of your doctors dentists and medical technicians know that you have a pacemaker your doctor can give you a card that states what kind of pacemaker you have carry this card in your wallet you may want to consider wearing a medical id bracelet or necklace that explains that you have a pacemaker your doctor will want to check your pacemaker regularly some pacemaker functions can be checked remotely through a telephone call or a computer connection to the internet your doctor may ask you to come to his or her office to check your pacemaker pacemaker batteries last between 5 and 15 years average 6 to 7 years depending on how active your pacemaker is the wires of your pacemaker also may need to be replaced eventually your doctor can tell you whether your pacemaker or its wires need to be replaced quick guide atrial fibrillation heart symptoms diagnosis  afib treatment what is a pacemaker a pacemaker is a small device thats placed in the chest or abdomen to help control abnormal heart rhythms this device uses electrical pulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate pacemakers are used to treat arrhythmias ahrithmeahs arrhythmias are problems with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat during an arrhythmia the heart can beat too fast too slow or with an irregular rhythm a heartbeat thats too fast is called tachycardia takihkardeah a heartbeat thats too slow is called bradycardia braydekardeah during an arrhythmia the heart may not be able to pump enough blood to the body this can cause symptoms such as fatigue tiredness shortness of breath or fainting severe arrhythmias can damage the bodys vital organs and may even cause loss of consciousness or death a pacemaker can relieve some arrhythmia symptoms such as fatigue and fainting a pacemaker also can help a person who has abnormal heart rhythms resume a more active lifestyle how do pacemakers regulate arrhythmias readers comments 12 share your story faulty electrical signaling in the heart causes arrhythmias pacemakers use lowenergy electrical pulses to overcome this faulty electrical signaling pacemakers can speed up a slow heart rhythm help control an abnormal or fast heart rhythm make sure the ventricles contract normally if the atria are quivering instead of beating with a normal rhythm a condition called atrial fibrillation  coordinate electrical signaling between the upper and lower chambers of the heart coordinate electrical signaling between the ventricles pacemakers that do this are called cardiac resynchronization therapy crt devices crt devices are used to treat heart failure prevent dangerous arrhythmias caused by a disorder called long qt syndrome pacemakers also can monitor and record your hearts electrical activity and heart rhythm newer pacemakers can monitor your blood temperature breathing rate and other factors they also can adjust your heart rate to changes in your activity pacemakers can be temporary or permanent temporary pacemakers are used to treat shortterm heart problems such as a slow heartbeat thats caused by a heart attack heart surgery or an overdose of medicine temporary pacemakers also are used during emergencies they might be used until your doctor can implant a permanent pacemaker or until a temporary condition goes away if you have a temporary pacemaker youll stay in a hospital as long as the device is in place permanent pacemakers are used to control longterm heart rhythm problems this article mainly discusses permanent pacemakers unless stated otherwise doctors also treat arrhythmias with another device called an implantable cardioverter defibrillator icd an icd is similar to a pacemaker however besides using lowenergy electrical pulses an icd also can use highenergy pulses to treat lifethreatening arrhythmias how does the heart work your heart has its own internal electrical system that controls the rate and rhythm of your heartbeat with each heartbeat an electrical signal spreads from the top of your heart to the bottom as the signal travels it causes the heart to contract and pump blood each electrical signal normally begins in a group of cells called the sinus node or sinoatrial sa node as the signal spreads from the top of the heart to the bottom it coordinates the timing of heart cell activity first the hearts two upper chambers the atria aytreeuh contract this contraction pumps blood into the hearts two lower chambers the ventricles ventrihkuls the ventricles then contract and pump blood to the rest of the body the combined contraction of the atria and ventricles is a heartbeat a visual guide to heart disease medical illustrations of the heart image collection take the heart disease quizwho needs a pacemaker doctors recommend pacemakers for many reasons the most common reasons are bradycardia and heart block bradycardia is a heartbeat that is slower than normal heart block is a disorder that occurs if an electrical signal is slowed or disrupted as it moves through the heart heart block can happen as a result of aging damage to the heart from a heart attack or other conditions that disrupt the hearts electrical activity some nerve and muscle disorders also can cause heart block including muscular dystrophy your doctor also may recommend a pacemaker if aging or heart disease damages your sinus nodes ability to set the correct pace for your heartbeat such damage can cause slower than normal heartbeats or long pauses between heartbeats the damage also can cause your heart to switch between slow and fast rhythms this condition is called sick sinus syndrome youve had a medical procedure to treat an arrhythmia called atrial fibrillation a pacemaker can help regulate your heartbeat after the procedure you need to take certain heart medicines such as beta blockers these medicines can slow your heartbeat too much you faint or have other symptoms of a slow heartbeat for example this may happen if the main artery in your neck that supplies your brain with blood is sensitive to pressure just quickly turning your neck can cause your heart to beat slower than normal as a result your brain might not get enough blood flow causing you to feel faint or collapse you have heart muscle problems that cause electrical signals to travel too slowly through your heart muscle your pacemaker may provide cardiac resynchronization therapy crt for this problem crt devices coordinate electrical signaling between the hearts lower chambers you have long qt syndrome which puts you at risk for dangerous arrhythmias doctors also may recommend pacemakers for people who have certain types of congenital heart disease or for people who have had heart transplants children teens and adults can use pacemakers before recommending a pacemaker your doctor will consider any arrhythmia symptoms you have such as dizziness unexplained fainting or shortness of breath he or she also will consider whether you have a history of heart disease what medicines youre currently taking and the results of heart tests from tips to better manage your migraine start now how are abnormal heart rhythms arrhythmias diagnosed many tests are used to detect arrhythmias you may have one or more of the following tests ekg electrocardiograman ekg is a simple painless test that detects and records the hearts electrical activity the test shows how fast your heart is beating and its rhythm steady or irregular an ekg also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through your heart the test can help diagnose bradycardia and heart block the most common reasons for needing a pacemaker a standard ekg only records the heartbeat for a few seconds it wont detect arrhythmias that dont happen during the test to diagnose heart rhythm problems that come and go your doctor may have you wear a portable ekg monitor the two most common types of portable ekgs are holter and event monitors holter and event monitors a holter monitor records the hearts electrical activity for a full 24 or 48hour period you wear one while you do your normal daily activities this allows the monitor to record your heart for a longer time than a standard ekg an event monitor is similar to a holter monitor you wear an event monitor while doing your normal activities however an event monitor only records your hearts electrical activity at certain times while youre wearing it for many event monitors you push a button to start the monitor when you feel symptoms other event monitors start automatically when they sense abnormal heart rhythms you can wear an event monitor for weeks or until symptoms occur echocardiography echocardiography echo uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart the test shows the size and shape of your heart and how well your heart chambers and valves are working echo also can show areas of poor blood flow to the heart areas of heart muscle that arent contracting normally and injury to the heart muscle caused by poor blood flow electrophysiology study for this test a thin flexible wire is passed through a vein in your groin upper thigh or arm to your heart the wire records the hearts electrical signals your doctor uses the wire to electrically stimulate your heart this allows him or her to see how your hearts electrical system responds this test helps pinpoint where the hearts electrical system is damaged stress test some heart problems are easier to diagnose when your heart is working hard and beating fast during stress testing you exercise to make your heart work hard and beat fast while heart tests such as an ekg or echo are done if you cant exercise you may be given medicine to raise your heart rate a visual guide to heart disease medical illustrations of the heart image collection take the heart disease quizhow does a pacemaker work share your story a pacemaker consists of a battery a computerized generator and wires with sensors at their tips the sensors are called electrodes the battery powers the generator and both are surrounded by a thin metal box the wires connect the generator to the heart a pacemaker helps monitor and control your heartbeat the electrodes detect your hearts electrical activity and send data through the wires to the computer in the generator if your heart rhythm is abnormal the computer will direct the generator to send electrical pulses to your heart the pulses travel through the wires to reach your heart newer pacemakers can monitor your blood temperature breathing and other factors they also can adjust your heart rate to changes in your activity the pacemakers computer also records your hearts electrical activity and heart rhythm your doctor will use these recordings to adjust your pacemaker so it works better for you your doctor can program the pacemakers computer with an external device he or she doesnt have to use needles or have direct contact with the pacemaker pacemakers have one to three wires that are each placed in different chambers of the heart the wires in a singlechamber pacemaker usually carry pulses from the generator to the right ventricle the lower right chamber of your heart the wires in a dualchamber pacemaker carry pulses from the generator to the right atrium the upper right chamber of your heart and the right ventricle the pulses help coordinate the timing of these two chambers contractions the wires in a biventricular pacemaker carry pulses from the generator to an atrium and both ventricles the pulses help coordinate electrical signaling between the two ventricles this type of pacemaker also is called a cardiac resynchronization therapy crt device the image shows a crosssection of a chest with a pacemaker figure a shows the location and general size of a doublelead or dualchamber pacemaker in the upper chest the wires with electrodes are inserted into the hearts right atrium and ventricle through a vein in the upper chest figure b shows an electrode electrically stimulating the heart muscle figure c shows the location and general size of a singlelead or singlechamber pacemaker in the upper chest types of pacemaker programming the two main types of programming for pacemakers are demand pacing and rateresponsive pacing a demand pacemaker monitors your heart rhythm it only sends electrical pulses to your heart if your heart is beating too slow or if it misses a beat a rateresponsive pacemaker will speed up or slow down your heart rate depending on how active you are to do this the device monitors your sinus node rate breathing blood temperature and other factors to determine your activity level your doctor will work with you to decide which type of pacemaker is best for you quick guide atrial fibrillation heart symptoms diagnosis  afib treatment what should i expect during pacemaker surgery readers comments 4 share your story placing a pacemaker requires minor surgery the surgery usually is done in a hospital or special heart treatment laboratory before the surgery an intravenous iv line will be inserted into one of your veins you will receive medicine through the iv line to help you relax the medicine also might make you sleepy your doctor will numb the area where he or she will put the pacemaker so you dont feel any pain your doctor also may give you antibiotics to prevent infection first your doctor will insert a needle into a large vein usually near the shoulder opposite your dominant hand your doctor will then use the needle to thread the pacemaker wires into the vein and to correctly place them in your heart an xray movie of the wires as they pass through your vein and into your heart will help your doctor place them once the wires are in place your doctor will make a small cut into the skin of your chest or abdomen he or she will slip the pacemakers small metal box through the cut place it just under your skin and connect it to the wires that lead to your heart the box contains the pacemakers battery and generator once the pacemaker is in place your doctor will test it to make sure it works properly he or she will then sew up the cut the entire surgery takes a few hours what should i expect after pacemaker surgery expect to stay in the hospital overnight so your health care team can check your heartbeat and make sure your pacemaker is working well youll likely have to arrange for a ride to and from the hospital because your doctor may not want you to drive yourself for a few days to weeks after surgery you may have pain swelling or tenderness in the area where your pacemaker was placed the pain usually is mild overthecounter medicines often can relieve it talk to your doctor before taking any pain medicines your doctor may ask you to avoid vigorous activities and heavy lifting for about a month after pacemaker surgery most people return to their normal activities within a few days of having the surgery a visual guide to heart disease medical illustrations of the heart image collection take the heart disease quizwhat are the risks of pacemaker surgery readers comments 1 share your story pacemaker surgery generally is safe if problems do occur they may include swelling bleeding bruising or infection in the area where the pacemaker was placed blood vessel or nerve damage a collapsed lung a bad reaction to the medicine used during the procedure talk with your doctor about the benefits and risks of pacemaker surgery how will a pacemaker affect my lifestyle once you have a pacemaker you have to avoid close or prolonged contact with electrical devices or devices that have strong magnetic fields devices that can interfere with a pacemaker include cell phones and mp3 players for example i podshousehold appliances such as microwave ovens hightension wires metal detectors industrial welders electrical generators these devices can disrupt the electrical signaling of your pacemaker and stop it from working properly you may not be able to tell whether your pacemaker has been affected how likely a device is to disrupt your pacemaker depends on how long youre exposed to it and how close it is to your pacemaker to be safe some experts recommend not putting your cell phone or mp3 player in a shirt pocket over your pacemaker if the devices are turned on you may want to hold your cell phone up to the ear thats opposite the site where your pacemaker is implanted if you strap your mp3 player to your arm while listening to it put it on the arm thats farther from your pacemaker you can still use household appliances but avoid close and prolonged exposure as it may interfere with your pacemaker you can walk through security system metal detectors at your normal pace security staff can check you with a metal detector wand as long as it isnt held for too long over your pacemaker site you should avoid sitting or standing close to a security system metal detector notify security staff if you have a pacemaker also stay at least 2 feet away from industrial welders and electrical generators some medical procedures can disrupt your pacemaker these procedures include magnetic resonance imaging or mrishockwave lithotripsy to get rid of kidney stones electrocauterization to stop bleeding during surgery let all of your doctors dentists and medical technicians know that you have a pacemaker your doctor can give you a card that states what kind of pacemaker you have carry this card in your wallet you may want to wear a medical id bracelet or necklace that states that you have a pacemaker quick guide atrial fibrillation heart symptoms diagnosis  afib treatment how often do pacemakers need to be checked your doctor will want to check your pacemaker regularly about every 3 months over time a pacemaker can stop working properly because its wires get dislodged or broken its battery gets weak or fails your heart disease progresses other devices have disrupted its electrical signaling to check your pacemaker your doctor may ask you to come in for an office visit several times a year some pacemaker functions can be checked remotely using a phone or the internet your doctor also may ask you to have an ekg  electrocardiogram to check for changes in your hearts electrical activity how long do pacemaker batteries last pacemaker batteries last between 5 and 15 years average 6 to 7 years depending on how active the pacemaker is your doctor will replace the generator along with the battery before the battery starts to run down replacing the generator and battery is lessinvolved surgery than the original surgery to implant the pacemaker your pacemaker wires also may need to be replaced eventually your doctor can
