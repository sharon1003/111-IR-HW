canada 20 during the highest tides the rising water is funnelled up the severn estuary into a wave that travels rapidly upstream against the river current the largest bores occur in spring but smaller ones can be seen throughout the year the bore is accompanied by a rapid rise in water level which continues for about one and a half hours after the bore has passed industry  edita 3mile 48 km stretch
