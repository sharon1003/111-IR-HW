the 20 highest mlb payrolls in 2015zac 033115 baseball joe camporealeusa today sports images share on facebook tweet share email comment advertising xmajor league baseball is on paper an easy business to understand franchises are not handcuffed by a hard salary cap as teams are in the national football league and thus owners can theoretically spend whatever they want on players and rosters one who has only outside knowledge of the working in mlb would assume that the teams that have the highest payrolls are surethings to at the very least be in the world series on a yearly basis that as you will see in this piece is not always the case and sometimes a middleoftheroad team can sneak up and shock the baseball world by the time fall rolls around two of the topthree clubs responsible for the highest payrolls in the big leagues did not even qualify for the postseason in 2014 one of those teams was near the basement of the league standings and of league power rankings last september but that same side is widely expected to experience a massive turnaround beginning this coming april some are even advertising that team to be a playoff contender that could make a run to yet another world series championship that fact is amazing to ponder when you consider the state of the franchise and the supposed “curse” that hovered over it just 12 years ago what some might find surprising is that there is one new york team that does not even make it into the top20 for highest payrolls as of the start of the 2015 regular season the new york mets have been cutting costs for several years now and that side is set to enter the upcoming campaign with the 21sthighest team payroll do not at all think however that fans of the mets will put up with the club once again being mediocre new york

brewers 98037500 team payroll rick scuteriusa today sports images advertising xthe first name you think of when you reflect on the milwaukee brewers may very well be ryan braun the outfielder has been linked to performanceenhancing drugs on multiple occasions and his lackluster play in 2014 did nothing to silence the critics who claimed that braun could only put up allstar numbers with the aid of certain chemicals braun’s arrogance and defiance in denying that he was guilty of wrongdoing rubbed some the wrong way once it was learned that he had dabbled in cheating the system and that he will make 13 million in 2015 is not helping his cause in that matter19 colorado rockies 99516171 team payroll matt kartozianusa today sports images advertising xone of the muchdiscussed major league baseball topics of this past offseason centered around the future of shortstop troy tulowitzki tulowitzki is set to earn 20 million in 2015 and it was believed that several teams were going to be in for him during the winter months specifically some claimed that tulowitzki would land with the new york mets when all was said and done that move never happened and tulowitzki is set to be the

payroll kim klementusa today sports images advertising xthe minnesota twins were one of the more enviable clubs in major league baseball back at the start of the current decade minnesota was opening a new beautiful ballpark and the twins had a core of players capable of taking the team to the playoffs and maybe to a world series championship no title was ever won by the club during that run of course and the twins have since fallen beneath several american league central division rivals in the standings both the kansas city royals and cleveland indians are believed to be better off than are the twins these days17 chicago cubs 114629523 team payroll joe camporealeusa today sports images all eyes may be on the chicago cubs this summer the cubs have what is on paper one of the more exciting rosters in all of major league baseball and some including sports talk radio royalty mike francesa are predicting that the long world series drought that has plagued one of the more famous sports teams in the united states will come to an end in 2015 the biggest move that the cubs made during the offseason was to acquire free agent pitcher jon lester lester had been linked with several other clubs and the cubs will pay the starter 15 million this year16 cincinnati reds 114869587 team payroll joe camporealeusa today sports images advertising xthe team payroll for the cincinnati reds could be on the rise and soon fox sports ohio the network that airs cincinnati home games as well as contests played by the cleveland cavaliers and columbus crew is expected to reup with the reds and that new contract should net the baseball club even more money than it is currently earning via its current media deal cincinnati fans will be hoping that the reds reinvest some of that cash on the roster that includes five players making at least 10 million this season joey votto first baseman for the reds will earn 14 million in salary this year15 st louis cardinals 115350000 team payroll scott rovakusa today sports images there may not be a more admirable major league baseball franchise out there than the st louis cardinals the cards do not routinely break the bank to get bigname free agents nor does the club pull off blockbuster trades that make headlines on a yearly basis st louis just wins and wins more often than not so much so that the cardinals are essentially postseason mainstays starting pitcher adam wainwright will be the highpaid player on the st louis roster pulling in 195 million for 2015 matt holiday yadier molina and jhonny peralta will all make at least 15 million this year14 kansas city royals 116475100 team payroll allan henryusa today sports images raise your hand if you predicted last march that the kansas city royals would go on a run that would see them make it to the world series now lower your hands because you are all obviously lying kansas city may once again prove to be the best team in the american league central but most analysts are expecting that the royals will have a letdown in 2015 too many al teams improved over the offseason and there are even some out there who think that the cleveland indians will be this year’s version of the royals and play for a world series championship in the fall13 seattle mariners 119237142 team payroll rick scuteriusa today sports images the seattle mariners are currently linked with the team that sits at no 12 on this year’s list for team payrolls seattle snagged slugger nelson cruz away from the baltimore orioles via free agency and cruz will cost seattle 1425 million in 2015 cruz will be the thirdhighest paid player on the mariners this season with only second baseman robinson cano and starting pitcher felix hernandez ahead of him cano possesses a salary of 24 million king felix will cost over 248 million this year and hernandez will likely be worth every penny spent on him12 baltimore orioles 119618333 team payroll kim klementusa today sports images advertising xthe baltimore orioles were one of the surprise stories of the 2014 season rising and becoming the best team in the american league east as often happens when a club has a positive campaign the o’s lost a key man during the offseason when slugger nelson cruz put pen to paper on a deal that saw him move westward to the seattle mariners outfielder adam jones is set to be the highestpaid player on the baltimore roster for 2015 his contract is worth a guaranteed 13 million this year starting pitcher ubaldo jimenez will cost the orioles 1225 million for this season advertising x11 toronto blue jays 121125000 team payroll jonathan dyerusa today sports images what is the going rate for a oncespeedy shortstop who has seen his legs betray him well before they logically should have apparently it is not 22 million which is the salary that the toronto blue jays will owe former new york mets star jose reyes this year it has been a poorly kept secret that the blue jays would ship reyes out of town if a different team would be willing to eat his high salary but no buyers have come around and none will likely appear anytime soon the hope for the blue jays now is that reyes will remain healthy and have a rebound campaign10 chicago white sox 122630477 team payroll mark j rebilasusa today sports images it is dark days in the kingdom for the chicago white sox the white sox are now the little brothers in their own city as there are respected and knowledgeable analysts and reporters out there who are claiming that the chicago cubs will be in it to win it up through october meanwhile the white sox are expected to struggle to not post another losing season and there are some out there who believe that chicago could have the worst overall squad in the american league central acquiring starting pitcher jeff samardzija for 98 million was the team’s big transaction during the offseason9 texas rangers 135750000 team payroll mark j rebilasusa today sports images advertising xwhatever big man and slugger prince fielder achieves while with the texas rangers this year he likely will not prove to be worth the 24 million being paid to him as it pertains to the club’s overall record the rangers lost starting pitcher yu darvish who has 10 million tied to him for 2015 before the season even began darvish is scheduled to have tommy john surgery and as is well known to baseball people pitchers are sometimes not the same after coming off of that operation the health of outfield shinsoo choo who will receive 14 million in salary this year is also in question8 philadelphia phillies 136366666 team payroll kim klementusa today sports images those who look only at the standings from a year ago may be confused as to how the phillies are in the topten for overall team payrolls the answer is that the team has been unable to unload deals that have come back to bite it most notably contracts tied to slugger ryan howard and starting pitcher cliff lee all indications are that the phillies will eventually find an american league team willing to give a designated hitter spot to howard but lee could prove to be a different story the bangedup starter is once again dealing with elbow soreness and any trade would involve philadelphia eating up a portion of his contract7 washington nationals 158514285 team payroll steve mitchellusa today sports images remember when the nationals were widely seen as the worst team in the national league east those days have been replaced by washington being responsible for the best baseball in the entire division and the nats will

angels of anaheim 159687833 team payroll joe camporealeusa today sports images the finances of the angles will be a fascinating sports story to follow over the next several years angels stadium needs what could politely be referred to as a facelift and yet the team and the city of anaheim have been unable to come to terms on an agreement for such renovations thus there have been loud whispers that the angels could relocate perhaps as far as an hour away from anaheim were that to happen such a move would include a shiny new ballpark that would be worth hundreds of millions of dollars and it could lead to the angles spending even more money on players down the road5 detroit tigers 166675000 team payroll jonathan dyerusa today sports images a baseball club that is owned by the same man who runs the detroit red wings and also the franchise little caesars pizza can spend money without having to worry about losing sleep about how much his players are getting paid starting pitcher justin verlander will be bringing home the big bucks yet again and he will make 28 million guaranteed for his work on the mound in 2015 designated hitter victor martinez is set to earn 14 million per his contract but whether or not there is enough glue and tape out there to keep him healthy and able to play for an entire season has yet to be determined4 san francisco giants 169102777 team payroll allan henryusa today sports images anybody who knows anything about the san francisco giants is aware that the club is likely headed for a downswing in 2015 this has nothing to do with how the club spends money highpriced talent such as starting pitcher matt cain or internet darling hunter pence he likes godfather 3 you know san francisco is currently in a run that sees the team win a world series championship every other season the giants have the talent to repeat as champions this year but they will have to hold off some stiff competition both in the national league west and elsewhere

boston fans the boston red sox are indeed back following a season that saw the red sox phone it in and plan for the future boston went out and splashed the cash to acquire both hanley ramirez and pablo sandoval add in the other talent that is on that roster and the red sox could emerge as the favorites to once again win the american league east watch out for starting pitcher justin masterson who could prove to be a bargain at just 95 million for 20152 new york yankees 211747857 team payroll reinhold matayusa today sports images he’s only the fourthhighest player on the team’s payroll for 2015 but attempting to discuss the new york yankees without mentioning the name of alex rodriguez would be downright silly arod will be owed 22 million for his baseball services this year so long as he abides by the rules regarding what he is allowed and not allowed to put into his body and that contract is one that the yankees would love to be able to run far from if at all legally possible instead those running the club and also diehard new york fans will be hoping to see rodriguez truly earn his salary while on the field1 los angeles dodgers 273440830 team payroll matt kartozianusa today sports images when you play in one of the biggest media markets in the world and you have a profitable local television deal you can afford to spend bigtime money on players the dodgers will once again be doing just that in 2015 as four players – clayton kershaw zack greinke adrian gonzalez and carl crawford – will all make over 21 million this year alone kershaw arguably the best regular
