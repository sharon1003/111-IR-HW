i ian brown 16superstar i captain tsubasa 09superstar v superstar 1 v superstar 2 v superstar 80s there haven’t been too many noticeable changes in the different versions of the adidas superstars over its career when the the superstar 1 was launched adidas added a trefoil to the back heel support and removed the “superstar” writing on the side of the shoe the trainer then stayed the same until the adidas superstar 2 was released the main difference of the adidas superstar 2 was a fatter tongue so urban fashion gurus could copy that infamous rundmc style adidas achieved this by adding more padding than the previous thin felt like tongue of earlier models the superstar 2 has seen a range of limited edition models released recently and is probably the most common edition of the momentadidas changed the tongue and made it thinner and longer with the superstar 80s the sides were lowered slightly to give the shoe a sleeker feel adidas have recently given us the option to

the same way as our wriggly friend would have out in the jungleadidas superstar brief history the adidas superstar trainer was first released in 1969 and offered a lower top design than the existing pro model the superstar was designed with basketball in mind and consisted of some key characteristics that are still evident in the modern releases the most famous of these characteristics was the shell toe which was added to the shoe simply to protect the players toes during competitive basketball games shell toes became a popular nickname of the shoe and many dont even know the trainers real name the all leather uppers were used to provide extra comfort and support whilst the nonmarking soles became the basketball courts best friend kareem abduljabaar and his superstars one of the first basketballers in the nba to wear the adidas superstars was basketball legend kareem abduljabaar prior to wearing this state of the art super shoe kareen and the other nba players of that time were wearing a floppy canvas shoe it didn’t take long for the adidas superstar trainer to become the shoe of choice for a reported 75 of players in the nba at that time“i played in them the whole time and i think that shoe worked for me it didn’t need to be improved on”  kareen abduljabaarrun dmc move adidas superstars to the streets in the 80s a huge turn of events happened around the adidas superstar which not only catapulted the shoe into greatness but also laid the foundations for adidas to become a world leader in street fashion and extend its popularity beyond just sportswear run dmc were pivotal in this transition the rap group out of queens started wearing the shoe on the street and at concerts it wasn’t long before the superstar was embraced into hip hop and urban culture the bigger rundmc became the bigger the adidas superstar sneaker became and the trend was soon spread globally rundmc even had their own way of wearing the trainer with the laces really loose and the tongue pulled out its surprising that adidas was not endorsing rundmc at this stage and they weren’t even behind the song my adidas that they released 1986 it did however set the wheels in motion for a reported 16 million contract between the 2 parties a couple of years later“we started in the alley now we chill in caliand i wont trade my adidas for no beat up ballys”  my adidas rundmcadidas
