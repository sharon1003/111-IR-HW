subagency is a type of brokerage relationship a defining characteristic of subagency is that the listing firm with the permission of the seller has extended its agency relationship with the seller outside the firm’s own agents and authorized other cooperating brokerage firms to represent the seller in a transaction when this happens the other cooperating broker becomes a “subagent” of the listing broker a subagent is a real estate licensee who provides real estate services to a buyer while actually representing the seller in a real estate transaction it is important to note that subagency cannot take place within a firm for an agent to be a subagent he or she must work for a different brokerage than the listing agent who represents the buyer when a subagent is involved in the real estate transaction when a buyer is working with a subagent he or she is not being represented by any of the real estate licensees involved in the transaction the listing agent and subagent both represent the seller while the buyer remains unrepresented in the real estate transaction does the seller have to consent to subagency yes agency relationships are consensual in nature and require the informed consent of the principal ie seller the listing agent should discuss subagency with sellers when taking the listing to determine whether or not the seller will consent to subagency agents should consult with their brokers about their firm’s policies on offering and accepting offers of subagency does the buyer have to consent to subagency yes even though the subagent does not represent the buyer the licensee must still discuss agency relationships as mandated by state law the buyer may decline to work with a subagent if he or she prefers to work with a real estate licensee under a buyer agency or nonagency ie transactional brokerage relationship failure to disclose the subagent’s representational relationship with the seller to the buyer can create the potential for undisclosed dual agency which is a violation of state law one contributing factor to the decline of subagency was the rapid increase in the number of lawsuits from buyers about undisclosed dual agency why is a discussion of subagency important if it is so rarely used by real estate brokerage firms many realtors® misunderstand the meaning of the term “subagency” those agents who do not understand the term cannot properly explain it to a seller when reviewing the listing agreement a few listing agents have mistakenly told their clients that “subagency” is the listing firms’ share of the commission while “buyeragency” is the buyer broker’s share of the commission this has also led to misunderstandings about how to input this information into the mris system by sarah louppe petcher nvar general counselhttpnvarcom2012marchaprilissuechangesaheadagencyabcsunderstandingthebasicsofvirginiaagencylaw advertisements report this ad report this ad share this email print tweet like this like one blogger likes this related advertising other agents listings on craigslist in laws and changes2011 nar profile of home buyers and sellers in real estate2012 changes to the virginia agency law in laws and changes
