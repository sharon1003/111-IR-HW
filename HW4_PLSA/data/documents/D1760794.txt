and resources for developing and implementing reviewing and maintaining the occupational safety and health policy the system should cover the entire gambit of an employers occupational health and safety organisation the key elements of a successful safety and health management system are1 policy and commitment the workplace should prepare an occupational safety and health policy programme as part of the preparation of the safety statement required by section 20 of the safety health and welfare at work act 2005 effective safety and health policies should set a clear direction for the organisation to follow they will contribute to all aspects of business performance as part of a demonstrable commitment to continuous improvement responsibilities to people and the working environment will be met in a way that fulfils the spirit and letter of the law costeffective approaches to preserving and developing human and physical resources will reduce financial losses and liabilities in a wider context stakeholders expectations whether they are shareholders employees or their representatives customers or society at large can be metback to top2 planning the workplace should formulate a plan to fulfil its safety and health policy as set out in the safety statement an effective management structure and arrangements should be put in place for delivering the policy safety and health objectives and targets should be set for all managers and employeesback to top3 implementation and operation for effective implementation organisations should develop the capabilities and support mechanisms necessary to achieve the safety and health policy objectives and targets all staff should be motivated and empowered to work safely and to protect their longterm health not simply to avoid accidents these arrangements should beunderpinned by effective staff involvement and participation through appropriate consultation the use of the safety committee where it exists and the safety representation system andsustained by effective communication and the promotion of competence which allows all employees and their representatives to make a responsible and informed contribution to the safety and health effort there should be a planned and systematic approach to implementing the safety and health policy through an effective safety and health management system the aim is to minimise risks risk assessment methods should be used to determine priorities and set objectives for eliminating hazards and reducing risks wherever possible risks should be eliminated through the selection and design of facilities equipment and processes if risks cannot be eliminated they should be minimised by the use of physical controls and safe systems of work or as a last resort through the provision of ppe performance standards should be established and used for measuring achievement specific actions to promote a positive safety and health culture should be identified there should be a shared common understanding of the organisation‘s vision values and beliefs on health and safety the visible and active leadership of senior managers fosters a positive safety and health cultureback to top4 measuring performance the organisation should measure monitor and evaluate safety and health performance performance can be measured against agreed standards to reveal when and where improvement is needed active selfmonitoring reveals how effectively the safety and health management system is functioning selfmonitoring looks at both hardware premises plant and substances and software people procedures and systems including individual behaviour and performance if controls fail reactive monitoring should find out why they failed by investigating the accidents ill health or incidents which could have caused harm or loss the objectives of active and reactive monitoring areto determine the immediate causes of substandard performanceto identify any underlying causes and implications for the design and operation of the safety and health management systemback to top5 auditing and reviewing performance the organisation should review and improve its safety and health management system continuously so that its overall safety and health performance improves constantly the organisation can learn from relevant experience and apply the lessons there should be a systematic review of performance based on data from monitoring and from independent audits of the whole safety and health management system these form the basis of complying with the organisation’s responsibilities under the 2005 act and other statutory provisions there should be a strong commitment to continuous improvement involving the development of policies systems and techniques of risk control performance should be assessed byinternal reference to key performance indicatorsexternal comparison with the performance of business competitors and best practice in the organisation’s employment sector many companies now report on how well they have performed on worker safety and health in their annual reports and how they have fulfilled their responsibilities with regard to preparing and implementing their safety statements in addition employers have greater responsibilities under section 80 of the 2005 act on ‘liability of directors and officers of undertakings’ that requires them to be in a position to prove they have proactively managed the safety and health of their workers data from this ‘auditing and reviewing performance’ process should be used for these purposesback to top what issues should a review of the safety and health management system cover an organisation should carry out an initial review of the safety and health management system and follow this up with periodic reviews the initial review should compare existing safety and health practice withthe requirements of safety and health legislationthe provisions set out in the organisation’s safety statementsafety and health guidance in the organisationexisting authoritative and published safety and health guidancebest practice in the organisation’s employment sector the following checklist may be used for the review is the safety statement clear and concise so that it can be read and understood by those who may be at risk is the safety statement available at the workplace to which it relates and are workers given relevant extracts where they are at specific risk is the overall safety and health policy of the organisation and the internal structure for implementing it adequate eg are responsibilities of named persons clearly outlined does the safety statement contain a systematic identification of hazards and an assessment of risks for the workplace s it covers are risk assessments being carried out on a regular basis as risks change and are the necessary improvements made to keep the safety and health management system up to date are the necessary safety control measures required for a safe workplace identified and implemented eg the provision of safe access and egress good housekeeping clear passageways and internal traffic control are written safe procedures for those operations that require them available eg for routine processing and ancillary activities handling and using chemicals preventive maintenance plant and equipment breakdown maintenance accident and illhealth investigations emergency planning assessment of personal protective equipment ppe requirements are procedures available for monitoring the implementation of safety systems and control measures eg are safety audits being carried out is safety and health training being carried out and does the training give adequate information to workers on risks they might be exposed to is the impact of this training and the level of understanding of the information assessed by anyone do safety consultation employee participation and representation procedures exist and are these procedures effective eg is there good cooperation between employer managers and employees on safety and health issues at the workplace is there a safety committee in existence and if so does it comply with the 2005 act requirements are safety committee meetings constructive with meeting reports and followup action lists is the safety representative or representatives involved at every stage of the safety consultation processback to top a safety statement should have a safety and health policy incorporated into it what is this policy a safety and health policy is a written document which recognises that safety and health is an integral part of the organisation’s business performance it is a statement by the organisation of it’s intentions and approach in relation to it’s overall safety and health performance and provides a framework for action and for the setting of its safety and health objectives and targets the safety and health policy mustbe appropriate to

documentation may also be referred to in the policyback to top can i get an example of a safety and health policy anywhere safety and health policies are specific to each individual organisation the content of the policy of an organisation should be based on the hazards and risks present in the organisation and should reflect the fact that systematic hazard identification and risk assessment have been undertaken as a minimum the policy should contain a commitment that safety and health legislation will be complied with and should specify those responsible for implementing the policy at all levels in the organisation and define their responsibilities employees’ responsibilities should also be addressed an organisation’s policy declaration may be as follows to all employees as your employer we are required to comply with all safety and health legislation that applies to this company with this in mind we have carried out risk assessments of all our key operations and processes in all the workplaces we control we have discussed these risk assessments with all relevant employees and worked with the safety committee in preparing this safety statement this statement sets out the safety and health measures we are implementing to protect everyone who works here the board of abc ltd has endorsed this statement and gave me the responsibility to implement it i am committed to ensuring that the safety and health measures set out in our safety statement are met john kelly safety and health manager will give advice and information on how to comply with this safety statement but everyone especially if you are in a management or supervisory position is responsible for ensuring compliance where they work we expect all employees to cooperate with us so that we can achieve

rests with the employer this responsibility is normally delegated to executive directors senior managers line managers supervisors and employees each person’s authority and duties should be clearly defined documented and communicated to them the organisational and reporting structure for implementing these duties should be illustrated in an inhouse organisational chart in addition each director on the organisation’s board needs to accept their responsibilities in providing safety and health commitment and leadership byensuring that each members’ actions and decisions at board level always reinforce the message in the organisation’s safety statementpreventing a mismatch between individual board members attitudes behaviour or decisions and the organisation’s safety statement so as not to undermine workers belief in maintaining good safety and health standards accidents ill health and incidents are seldom random events they generally arise from failures of control and involve multiple contributory elements the immediate cause may be a human or technical failure but such events usually arise from organisational failings which are the responsibility of management successful safety and health management systems aim to utilise the strengths of managers and other employees the organisation needs to understand how human factors affect safety and health performance senior executive directors or other senior management controlling body members and executive senior managers are primarily responsible for safety and health management in the organisation these people need to ensure

aspects of contractors’ work although organisations routinely contract out either all or parts of their work activities they may still retain some of the legal responsibility for health and safety particularly if they directly control how this work is done for this reason the organisation should establish and maintain procedures for controlling the safety and health aspects of contractor work these should includepreplanning for medium or longterm contracts this will involve carrying out a full safety and health prequalification procedure for shortterm contracts safety and health aspects should be suitably checked by questionnaire or reviewensuring the contractor has prepared risk assessments and an uptodate safety statement which are specirfic for the project to be undertakendefining

directors or senior management team recognise the need to involve all staff in issues that affect their safety and health do your directors and senior managers provide daily safety and health leadership in the organisation do you have an agreed safety and health policy is it written into your safety statement have you allocated responsibilities for safety and health to specific people  are they clear on what they have to do and are they held accountable is safety and health always considered before any new work is started or work equipment is bought did you consult and involve your staff and your safety representatives effectively have you identified the hazards and assessed the risks to your own staff to others and to the public in the workplaces you control do you set standards for the premises plant substances procedures and people you control or the products you produce are these standards in place and the risks effectively controlled do you have an emergency plan to deal with serious or imminent danger eg fires process deviations gas leaks the effects of poor weather floods etc does your staff have sufficient information about the risks they are exposed to and the preventive measures they must take do you have the right levels of safety and health expertise are your employees properly trained and do they attend the training provided by you do you

safety and health management system be monitored it should be a linemanagement responsibility to monitor safety and health performance against predetermined plans and standards monitoring reinforces management’s commitment to safety and health objectives in general and helps to develop a positive safety and health culture by rewarding positive work done to control risk two types of monitoring are required active systems that monitor the design development installation and operation of management arrangements safety systems and workplace precautions reactive systems that monitor accidents ill health incidents and other evidence of deficient safety and health performance1 active monitoring every organisation should collect information to investigate the causes of substandard performance or conditions adequately documented procedures for carrying out these activities on a regular basis for key operations should be established and maintained the monitoring system should

machinery inspections eg statutory plant inspections and certificationenvironmental sampling for dusts chemical fumes noise or biological agentsanalysis of safety and health management system records2 reactive monitoring a system of internal reporting of all accidents which includes ill health cases and incidents of noncompliance with the safety and health management system should be set up so that the experience gained may be used to improve the management system the organisation should encourage an open and positive approach to reporting and followup and should also put in place a system of ensuring that reporting requirements are met the organisation should establish procedures for investigating accidents and incidents to identify their causes including possible deficiencies in the

should the management of safety and health be audited in addition to monitoring performance monitoring provides the information to let the organisation review activities and decide how to improve performance auditing and performance review are the final steps in the safety and health management control cycle they constitute the ‘feedback loop’ that enables an organisation to reinforce maintain and develop its ability to reduce risks to the fullest extent and to ensure the continued effectiveness of its safety and health management system audits by the organisation’s own staff or by external bodies complement monitoring activities by looking to see if the safety and health management systems are actually achieving the right results combine the results from measuring performance with information from audits to improve the organisation’s overall approach to safety and health management the organisation should establish and maintain a programme and procedures for periodic safety and health management system audits to be carried out this enables a critical appraisal of all the elements of the safety and health management system to be made auditing is the structured process of collecting independent information on the efficiency effectiveness and reliability of the total safety and health management system and drawing up plans for corrective action these audits should be carried out i n addition to routine monitoring inspection and surveillance of the safety and health management system the purpose of these audits is to ensure the continued suitability adequacy and effectiveness of the safety and health management system the audit process should ensure that the necessary information is collected to allow management to carry out this evaluation adequately the

direct indicator of safety and health performance however some cautions relating to their use aremost organisations have too few injury accidents or cases of workrelated ill health to distinguish real trends from random effectsif more work is done by the same number of people in the same time increased workload alone may account for an increase in accident ratesthe length of absence from work attributed to injury or workrelated ill health may be influenced by factors other than the severity of injury or occupational ill health such factors can include poor morale monotonous work stressful working conditions poor management  employee relations and local advice or traditionsaccidents are often underreported and occasionally overreported levels of reporting can change they can improve as a result of increased workforce awareness and better reporting and recording systemsa time delay can occur between safety and health management system failures and harmful effects moreover many
