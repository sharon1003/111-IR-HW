first class vs standard mail what’s the difference and which should i choose september 11 2012 by chase nuuhiwa in a lot of work that we’ve encountered so much time and energy goes in to making and designing the look and voice that clients lose sight of how the mailings get where they need to go and believe us when we say that the postal service like most government offices is a pretty complex beast here’s a short checklist of how to navigate the “in’s and out’s” of mail first don’t worry we’ll help handle this beast second how soon does your message need to get to homes a few days a week third oh wait… you’re done shoot… where’d i put that “easy button” class description first class first class mail is processed by the usps on a priority basis… it goes to the front of the usps line locally first class will typically be delivered in 12 days and nationally all of it should be delivered by about 4 days if your party has moved your mail will be forwarded at no charge for a period of 1 year if it’s undeliverable it will be returned to you at no charge with the reason for nondelivery first class presort if you have 500 or more mail pieces first class presort offers about a 20 postage savings it’s handled with the same first class priority processing but to receive the lower postage rate the addresses must be ncoa address updated cass certified and put in to a presort order leave that to us just send us your mailing list and we can beginstandard mail standard mail is the new term for “bulk mail” and if you want to go way back it used to be called 3rd class mail standard mail is processed by the usps on a “time available” basis there is no guaranteed delivery time only “typicals” local mail is typically delivered in about 36 work days national mail can be 14 weeks… sometimes its faster… but sometimes its slower the “ pros ” it’s the least expensive postage mode a bit more than half the price of 1st class which enables you to mail lots more for less it also allows up to 33 ounces all for the same low postage rate and if your mail is heavier than 33 the weight surcharge increase isn’t too much more the “ cons ” due to the delivery time never use standard mail if you have a rapidly approaching event or expiration date standard mail is not forwarded and not returned if undeliverable it merely goes in to the usps recycling bin nonprofit rate nonprofit is simply a favored postage rate within standard mail it’s processed exactly the same so the same delivery times apply but gets even deeper discounts that can be 70 less than the cost of first class if you are a nonprofit you can apply to the usps for these special rates by completing application form 3624 more info can be found here so whatever the method just let us know the timeframe and we’ll get the most cost effective postage rate possible to meet your deadlinefiled under digital ink
