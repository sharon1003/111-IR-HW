of his school and fellow xmen some time ago and says that logan is just waiting for him to die logan argues with caliban about obtaining enough medicine for xavier caliban explains that its hard

she was in the process of sending him a text telling him to hurry as theyve been found logan returns home dejected but is stunned to find that laura has stowed away in the trunk of his limo xavier

claims laura is not there and when pierce persists laura throws a pipe at his head knocking him out logan tells caliban to take pierce out into the desert and leave him there caliban dresses heavily to protect his sensitive skin from the sun and carts pierces body away but a squad of elites from transigen the reavers arrive they pick up pierce and capture caliban the reavers return to the plant and two enter to retrieve laura who is calmly eating a bowl of cereal while logan and the others wait outside after some commotion laura appears throwing the head of one of the reavers at pierces feet

with xavier and laura in the backseat caliban is taken by the reavers and tortured with sunlight in order to get him to use his powers to track the trio logan demands to know who laura is and xavier responds that she is very much like him logan looks through gabrielas phone for clues and finds a video which reveals that she used to work for transigen in the genetics department however the phone dies before the video can finish they stop at a convenience store to stock up on supplies the clerk  dave davis attempts to stop laura from shoplifting some chips and sunglasses but she easily flips him over and nearly claws him before logan intervenes saying not okay he then takes a phone charger and cigar and leaves that night as the phone charges logan watches the rest of gabrielas video she had documented her role as a nurse in the genetic experimentation of new mutant children led by dr zander rice  richard e grant  with the intention of turning them into super soldiers using dna from known mutants most of whom were deceased the children were conceived and born to anonymous mothers who would not be missed the children including laura were dubbed x23 and raised under harsh conditions simple pleasures such as birthdays were frowned upon the experiment was deemed a failure due to the fact that the children sustained too much emotion and often refused to follow orders with the introduction of x24 it was decided the children would be terminated rather than see them killed gabriela helped orchestrate an escape and the location of eden was designated as a safe point so the children could live free in canada in the videos final moments gabriela admits that she is not lauras mother but loves her all the same addressing logan she apologizes for lying about the total fee that she would pay him but hopes that as her biological father he will keep her safe the trio enter oklahoma city and take residence in a hotel where logan discovers that laura has been reading an xmen comic book he finds that the coordinates to eden are included in the book and is convinced that the whole trip is a charade angry he confronts laura to xaviers disdain and tells her the xmen stories shes been reading are fantasized and that eden does not exist logan leaves xavier and laura in their room and goes downstairs where he sees that the reavers have followed them suddenly everyone becomes paralyzed and logan realizes xavier is suffering another seizure having ever been the only one to partially resist the effects logan struggles to make it back to the room where some of the reavers have already found laura and xavier logan kills them all before injecting xavier with his serum ending the paralysis and the three escape in a new vehicle on the road a report goes over the incident in oklahoma city and relates the similarity to an event that occurred in westchester one year prior but logan turns off the radio they are nearly run off the road by a robotic freight truck and swerve to avoid a pickup hauling a trailer full of horses xavier convinces logan to help and uses his telepathic powers to bring the horses back the driver introduces himself as will munson  eriq la salle accompanied by his wife kathryn  elise neal and son nate  quincy fouse  logan then helps push their pickup out of a ditch kathryn offers logan and his family to have dinner with them which xavier happily accepts logan is eager to leave immediately after dinner but kathryn offers them to spend the night as its late logan only agrees for xaviers sake and carries him upstairs to bed seeing that their water supply has been tampered with will goes out to investigate and logan tags along they find and fix the obvious leak at the pump some distance away and are confronted by a group of thugs led by a man who owns the land he harasses will saying hes been skimping on payments but logan hits one of the thugs in the face with his own rifle and breaks it over his knee scaring them off back at the house xavier lies in bed and senses logan entering the room he tearfully pleads with him to be patient with laura asleep on the floor beside him and expresses regret and remorse over what happened a year ago it is implied that xavier suffered a massive seizure at his school in westchester which resulted in the deaths of most of the xmen he apologizes but logan pushes his claws through xaviers chest laura attacks in charles defense and the attacker turns out to be a clone of logan the x24 model the mutant abducts laura and slaughters nate and kathryn upon returning will is struck down by the x24 and logan rushes upstairs to get xavier who is just barely alive logan consoles him it wasnt me as he carries him downstairs outside the reavers wait with pierce and dr rice

a pickup truck charles utters the name of their boat and dies bereaved logan engages the x24 in a furious fight meanwhile caliban fights back against his captors and sets off two grenades muttering the phrase his mother once told him beware the light the van explodes and pierce is thrown out while rice escapes logan is nearly overpowered by the x24 until will rams into the mutant with his truck pinning him against some farm equipment will repeatedly shoots x24 with a shotgun and then turns the gun on logan however its out of bullets and will collapses dead logan retrieves laura and takes her with xaviers body and drives away the following morning dr rice and his crew take care of the scene and inject x24 with an agent to help him heal logan buries charles in an unmarked grave in the woods while laura watches afterwards he goes back to their truck and begins smashing it in fury before passing out later logan wakes up in a clinic the doctor  james handy tells logan he knows hes a mutant and says he wants to help him aware that the adamantium in his body is killing him logan refuses and leaves with laura he begrudgingly thanks her and she finally speaks by responding youre welcome in spanish logan is perplexed as to why she never spoke before but laura begins rattling in spanish the names of her friends from transigen she tells logan they must meet up with them in eden and presses him with such persistence that logan finally concedes but only to prove eden doesnt exist the two just barely make it and logan is drained to the point of unconsciousness so much that laura had to drive the remaining miles there at a cliff a lift is dropped for logan so they can ascend and he and laura are finally able to rest along with the remaining children led by rictor  jason genao  the kids prank logan by shaving his beard in his sleep to more closely resemble how he looked in his youth but logan is not amused rictor gives logan a serum that was used on them in transigen to help him reenergize and heal but he warns logan not to use it all at once logan then tells laura that hes done his job in delivering her to eden and emotionally explains that everyone he cares about dies and its better he leaves laura bitterly responds that she should be fine then in the morning the children are gone and logan is about to leave when he sees that the reavers have caught up to them tracking the children logan runs to intercept them as the reavers pick off the children one by one despite using their powers the children are outnumbered injecting all of the healing agent at once logan kills most of the reavers and confronts dr rice who has rounded up the children and is holding them at gunpoint rice reveals that he is actually the son of the man killed by wolverine when he escaped the weapon x project rice admits responsibility for the extinction of mutants thanks to a virus developed by transigen that was seeped into food supplies before he can continue his monologue logan shoots him dead in a desperate move and goes after pierce however x24 is released and logan fights his clone once more seeing that pierce is in complete control of x24 the children gang up on him and use their collective powers electrocution freezing plant manipulation etc to kill him as the healing agent in logans body wears off he becomes overpowered by his younger clone until x24 finally impales logan on a dead tree limb laura then uses the adamantium bullet logan carried with him to blow x24s head off she runs to logan and cuts him down from the tree but logans wounds arent healing logan tearfully tells laura to run with the others theyre free she cries calling him daddy and logan responds sothis is what it feels like before he dies the children bury logan and raise a cross at the
