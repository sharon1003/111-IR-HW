established a farm colony in hadleigh essex george scott railton – first commissioner of the salvation army the salvation armys main converts were at first alcoholics morphine addicts prostitutes and other undesirables unwelcome in polite christian society which helped prompt the booths to start their own church 11 the booths did not include the use of sacraments mainly baptism and holy communion

refrain from drinking alcohol holy communion is not practiced smoking taking illegal drugs and gambling 13 its soldiers wear a uniform tailored to the country in which they work the uniform can be white grey navy fawn and are even styled like a sari in some areas any member of the public is welcome to attend their meetings as the salvation army grew rapidly in the late 19th century it generated opposition in england opponents grouped under the name of the skeleton army disrupted salvation army meetings and gatherings with tactics such as throwing rocks bones rats and tar as well as physical assaults on members of the salvation army much of this was led by pub owners who were losing business because of the armys opposition to alcohol and targeting of the frequenters of saloons and public houses 14the salvation armys reputation in the united states improved as a result of its disaster relief efforts following the galveston hurricane of 1900 and the 1906 san francisco earthquake the

a charity shop attached in worthing west sussex the sacred text of the salvation army is the bible 53 and the beliefs of the salvation army rest upon these eleven doctrines 54we believe that the scriptures of the old and new testaments were given by inspiration of god and that they only constitute the divine rule of christian faith and practice we believe that there is only one god who is infinitely perfect the creator preserver and governor of all things and who is the only proper object of religious worship we believe that there are three persons in the godhead  the father the son and the holy ghost  undivided in essence and coequal in power and glory we believe that in the person of jesus christ the divine and human natures are united so that he is truly and properly god and truly and properly man we believe that our first parents were created in a state of innocency but by their disobedience they lost their purity and happiness and that in consequence of their fall all men have become sinners totally depraved and as such are justly exposed to the wrath of god we believe that the lord jesus christ has by his suffering and death made an atonement for the whole world so that whosoever believes in him will not perish but have eternal life we believe that repentance towards god faith in our lord jesus christ and regeneration by the holy spirit are necessary to salvation we believe that we are justified by grace through faith in our lord jesus christ and that he that believeth hath the witness in himself we believe that continuance in a state of salvation depends upon continued obedient faith in christ we believe that it is the privilege of all believers to be wholly sanctified and that their whole spirit and soul and body may be preserved blameless unto the coming of our lord jesus christ we believe in the immortality of the soul in the resurrection of the body in the general judgment at the end of the world in the eternal happiness of the righteous and in the endless punishment of the wicked the denomination does not celebrate the christian sacraments of baptism and holy communion the international spiritual life commission opinion on baptism is that enrolment as a soldier by accepting the call to discipleship should be followed by a lifetime of continued obedient faith in christ 55 the commissions considered option of holy communion is that gods grace is readily accessible in all places and at all times although salvationists may participate in holy communion if attending a service of worship in another christian denomination if the host church allows 56 although its officers conduct marriages it holds a traditional protestant belief that marriage was not instituted by christ and therefore is not a sacrament the mercy seat is a focal point in a salvation army church symbolising gods call to his people and a place for commitment and communion and is available for anyone to kneel at in prayer 57positional statements 58 describe salvation army policy on various social and moral issues are carefully considered and subject to review they are derived from work by the international moral and social issues council the salvation army opposes euthanasia and assisted suicide its official stance on abortion is that the salvation army believes in the sanctity of all human life and considers each person to be of infinite value and each life a gift from god to be cherished nurtured and redeemed human life is sacred because it is made in the image of god and has an eternal destiny genesis 127 sacredness is not conferred nor can it be taken away by human agreement the salvation army official stance admitted in 2010 exceptions in cases such as rape and incest in addition rape and incest are brutal acts of dominance violating women physically and emotionally this situation represents a special case for the consideration of termination as the violation may be compounded by the continuation of the pregnancy 59 it is also against the death penalty the salvation army recognises that the opinions of salvationists are divided on the moral acceptability of capital punishment and its effectiveness as a deterrent however to advocate in any way the continuance or restoration of capital punishment in any part of the world would be inconsistent with the armys purposes and contrary to the armys belief that all human life is sacred and that each human being however wretched can become a new person in christ in 2012 the salvation army published a positional statement on homosexuality after receiving adverse publicity about their position on homosexuality 60the bible teaches that gods intention for humankind is that society should be ordered on the basis of lifelong legally sanctioned heterosexual unions  a disposition towards homosexuality is not in itself blameworthy nor is the disposition seen as rectifiable at will  homosexual practice however is in the light of scripture clearly unacceptable such activity is chosen behaviour and is thus a matter of the will it is therefore able to be directed or restrained in the same way heterosexual urges are controlled homosexual practice would render any person ineligible for full membership soldiership in the army 61as of 2016 the organisation will not appoint homosexual people to posts as ministers preferring individuals whose values are consistent with the churchs philosophy 62 see also § criticism by lgbt activists section the ordination of women is permitted in the salvation army salvation army officers were previously

casual salvation army uniform it is now official salvation army policy in the uk that the red shield should be used as the external symbol of the salvation army with the crest only being used internally therefore any new salvation army building will now have the red shield on the outside rather than the crest which certainly would have been used on its corps church buildings 65in australia

year book 2018 paperback 110 ebook 111controversy  editbaptism and holy communion  editthe salvation army does not celebrate the holy sacraments of baptism and holy communion this has led to allegations of cultism due to the common belief that baptism for the salvationist comes when they first put on the uniform even though communion is believed by most christians in the world to be divinely commanded by jesus christ the salvation army does not participate in holy communion this is usually addressed by stating that communion and baptism are not what gains one salvation this leads many in the world of the church to see the salvation army more as a parachurch organization rather than a church that holds to orthodox christian belief tradition and revelation criticism by lgbt activists  editsome in the united states have alleged that the salvation army discriminates against lesbian gay bisexual and transgender  lgbt individuals in its hiring practices 112 113 the salvation army states that it does not discriminate against hiring gays and lesbians for the majority of its roughly 55000 jobs 114 because the salvation army is a church title vii of the u s civil rights act of 1964 allows it to inquire into peoples religious beliefs in its hiring practices in 1997 the city of san francisco enacted a law requiring all companies doing business with the city government to extend domestic benefits to samesex partners of employees in refusing to do so the salvation army declined a us35 million contract 115 in 2001 the salvation army pressed the bush administration to exempt it and other religious groups from antidiscrimination legislation which it felt infringed on the organizations religious freedoms this request was denied and was sharply rebuked by david smith thenspokesperson for the human rights campaign gays and lesbians are taxpayers too said smith their money should not be used by religious groups to fund discriminatory practices against them 114 116 117the salvation army western territory approved a plan in october 2001 to start offering domestic partnership benefits to employees in samesex relationships 118 members of various evangelical christian interest groups protested the decision focus on the family founder james dobson excoriated the salvation army for abandoning its moral integrity and urged his radio listeners to bombard the organisations offices with phone calls and letters the american family association also accused the salvation army of a monstrous  appeasement of sin that resulted in a betrayal of the church in november 2001 the salvation army nationwide rescinded the western territorys decision with an announcement that it would only provide benefits coverage for differentsex spouses and dependent children of its employees in 2004 the salvation army said that it would close operations in new york city unless it was exempted from a municipal ordinance requiring them to offer benefits to gay employees partners the city council refused to make the exemption mayor michael r bloombergs administration chose not to enforce the ordinance the administrations right to decline to enforce the ordinance was upheld by the new york state court of appeals in 2006 119on 15 december 2012 in canada andrea le good noticed a salvation army bellringer carrying a sign reading if you support gay rights please do not donate while the bellringer claimed he had permission from the charity to wear the sign salvation army spokeswoman kyla ferns said that it had no part in the sign and that the bellringer was pulled away immediately when the charity learned about it 120 the charitys website describes marriage as heterosexual by definition and a published document called on homosexuals to embrace celibacy as a way of life the same document also states that there is no scriptural support for the mistreatment of homosexuals 120in february 2000 the salvation army in the united kingdom publicly opposed in their publication the war cry and in a letter to a scottish parliament committee the repeal of section 28 of the local government act 1988 which prevented local authorities from intentionally promot ing homosexuality 121 however the organisations uk website states that it offers unconditional assistance and support regardless of race religion gender or sexual orientation respecting the identity and choices of all those referred to them  as well as having a right to be dealt with professionally people can expect from us encouragement and a respect for their individual beliefs ambitions and preferences 122before the passing of the homosexual law reform act 1986 by the new zealand parliament the salvation army was active throughout new zealand gathering signatures for a petition seeking to prevent the bills passing in 2006 the army released a statement regretting the ill feelings that persisted following this activity it stated in part we do understand though that the salvation armys official opposition to the reform bill was deeply hurtful to many and are distressed that illfeeling still troubles our relationship with segments of the gay community we regret any hurt that may remain from that turbulent time and our present hope is to rebuild bridges of understanding and dialogue between our movement and the gay community 123despite documented events of salvation armys volunteers and their views the organisation has issued an lgbt statement as a response the statement does not address any documented news events of discrimination and claims to debunk these events as urban myth 124in november 2013 it was made known that the salvation army was referring lgbt individuals to one of several conversion therapy groups 124 as a response the salvation army removed such referrals from their website 125the salvation armys response  edita positional statement on the salvation army uk and ireland site stated but has since been taken down the salvation army teaches that sexual acts should take place only in a monogamous heterosexual marriage believing that this reflects gods intentions for sexual behaviour and provides the best environment for raising children 126the positional statement is however intended explicitly for members of the salvation army 127 and the salvation army mission statement as of 2013 states the salvation army stands against homophobia which victimises people and can reinforce feelings of alienation loneliness and despair we want to be an inclusive church community where members of the lgbt community find welcome and the encouragement to develop their relationship with god  our international mission statement is very clear on this point when it says we will meet human needs in jesus name without discrimination anyone who comes through our doors will be welcomed with love and service based on their need and our capacity to provide 128as of late 2013 activists were still calling on the salvation army to change its stance on lgbt issues citing ongoing discrimination 129 130as of april 2018 the inclusion page on the official uk website states that the salvation army stands against homophobia and does not permit discrimination in its employment practices or delivery of care 131canadian charity work  editduring the 2010 christmas season the salvation army in calgary alberta refused to accept toys based on the harry potter and twilight franchises because of a perceived conflict with the organisations religious principles one volunteer claimed that the toys were destroyed instead of being given to other agencies the volunteer also criticised the salvation army for accepting violencethemed toys such as plastic rifles while not accepting harry potter or twilight toys a salvation army captain said that the toys were given to other organisations not disposed of 132 this policy is however not universal as the wetaskiwin chapter of the salvation army has accepted harry potter toys one captain called the series a classic story of good winning over evil 133also during the 2010 christmas season the salvation army in vancouver bc came under fire for a program that provided goodie bags to federal inmates for christmas by playing santa to incarcerated criminals 134 this was however simply an extended outreach as part of the salvation armys prisoner visitation program established over a century ago proselytising during governmentfunded social service in new york  editin 2004 the salvation armys new york division was named in a lawsuit filed by 18 current and former employees of its social service arm claiming that the organisation asked about the religious and sexual habits of employees in programs funded by local and state government one member claimed the organisation forced them to agree to preach the gospel of jesus christ 135 proselytising or otherwise pursuing religious motives in a governmentfunded program is generally considered a violation of the establishment clause of the us constitution while the employmentdiscrimination portion of the lawsuit was dismissed in 2005 government agencies agreed in a 2010 settlement to set up monitoring systems to ensure that the army did not violate churchstate separation in its publicly funded projects the organisation did not dispute allegations that nineyearolds in a cityfunded foster care program were put through a confirmationlike ceremony where they were given bibles and prayed over 136australian sex abuse cases  editfrom the 1940s to the 1980s the salvation army in australia sheltered approximately 30000 children in 2006 the australian division of the salvation army acknowledged that sexual abuse may have occurred during this time and issued an apology in it the army explicitly rejected a claim made by a party unnamed in the apology that there were as many as 500 potential claimants 137in 2013 it was reported that private settlements totalling a 155 million had been made in victoria relating to 474 abuse cases a salvation army spokesman said that this should not have happened and this was a breach of the trust placed in us and that they were deeply sorry whilst claiming that the abuse was the result of individuals and not a culture within the organization 138 139 140on 28 january 2014 the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse a royal commission of inquiry
