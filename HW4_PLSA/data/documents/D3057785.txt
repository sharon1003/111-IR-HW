we have been in the process of improving the site throughout 2017 and as a result of an issue we recently became aware of we have taken the site offline while we work to resolve it we take the security of our contributors and our viewers seriously we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause but protecting our users’ personal information is our top priority update march 6 2018we have some good news on our progress to bring roots web back online as of today the roots web mailing lists are now available to use meaning you can now send and receive email on roots web email lists just like you used to in the past in addition to making the site more secure we’ve upgraded our backend system to provide an easiertouse interface to manage your email list subscriptions to get started managing your subscriptions go to setting up my new mailman login and if you are an administrator you will find more info at setting up my new mailman admin login as of today any email that is sent will go directly into a new archive we are in the process of importing the old archives into the new archives and due to the massive amount of content that process will take time we will continue to update you on the progress when we can thank you for your patience as we continue to bring these features back online update january 25 2018we have taken the roots web mail system offline for the next few weeks so that we can upgrade the mailman system mailman is the software which runs the mailing lists while the system is down you will not be able to send or receive email we thank you for your patience update january 23 2018great news on the progress of getting roots web back online today we are bringing world connect one of our most valued features back online as we make world connect available it will initially be in a read only state you can now search for people and view information as you did in the past but for now we cannot accept new uploads or modifications to existing gedcom files we expect to add this additional functionality in the coming weeks also here are answers to a few questions we’ve heard from the community why is this taking so long roots web has many terabytes of data uploaded by users across its various features the site also has hundreds of thousands of lines of code we have been scanning the data using a variety of tools and that takes time we’ve also been examining the code and the underlying systems some code is being refurbished and some will need to be more fully rewritten to add the layers of security needed in this day and age we know it may be frustrating but we are committed to returning data to you in a safe manner have you found any other security problems we haven’t found any other problems but we want to thoroughly update systems to ensure the safety of your information is ancestry going to start charging for roots web ancestry is not going to start charging for roots web when functionality returns to the site you will still be able to view content for free i’ve heard not everything is coming back online is that true we will be returning world connect and mailing lists back to their full functionality other features are still being evaluated in cases where we are unable to bring back previous functionality or content we will explore ways for people who uploaded data to retrieve it if we don’t feel we can put it back online safely care to share your thoughts with us update january 9 2018we have spent the last few weeks reviewing the functionality on roots web and have created a plan to bring many of your contributions back online over the next few months as we stated before our first priority is security and ensuring that every part of roots web meets our stringent security standards our next priority is getting you the users of roots web and its services access to your content right now the best way for us to meet both goals is to begin bringing portions of roots web back online in a readonly state this means you will have access to content but you will not be able to load new content in these sections while this may not be ideal it is the best way for us to protect roots web users while also providing the ability to use the content you value this is an interim step while we continue to evaluate the potential for bringing more of the roots web services back online in a more complete manner here’s our current plan hosted web sites soon we will begin bringing hosted web sites back online we will start with a few hundred and then add more over time giving us a chance to scan the content family treesworld connect family trees or world connect allows you to upload a gedcom file and publish it for others to see it is currently being reviewed by our software engineers and security team and we plan on having a readonly searchable version up in the next few weeks the ability to upload new gedcom files will be available in the coming months mailing lists mailing lists have been functioning as normal but the archives have been unavailable we plan to make the archives available to you once we have world connect available to you in a readable version we will be making decisions about other functionality over time we appreciate your patience as we bring the different pieces of roots web back online in a secure manner you our contributors and viewers are what has made roots web the vibrant free genealogy community it is the roots web team
