a hot dry sunny site plants for troughs and containers plants with silver leaves plants for seaside gardens1 hints tips and advice on growing alpine plants as the title says but aimed at those who are new or relatively new to the wonderful world of growing alpine plants what exactly is an alpine plant how to use alpines in your garden growing conditions soil etc where to find further advice what exactly is an alpine plant that is a good question and not so easy to answer there is no definitive description but basically it is a plant which grows in alpine regions of the world ie at elevation on or around mountains to withstand the conditions found in such regions  cold wind snow cover etc the plants have become adapted to suit their environment typically they are slowgrowing longlived short in stature and may have small hard or downy leaves to resist the cold many have a short but abundant flowering period as typified by this picture of saxifraga oppositifolia which can even be found growing on the mountains of britain the plants might be snowcovered for long periods then have to contend with copious amounts of water as the snows melt the soil is typically stony and very freedraining and the plants roots might have to search deeply for nourishment especially in the scree area where gravel and stones have fallen and accumulated so an alpine is a mountain plant well mostly but not always as some beautiful alpines grow on cliffs by the sea such as our native sea thrift or armeria like this armeria maritima dusseldorfer stolz seen here growing happily in a large pot other alpines may even grow right on the beach among the shingle  hardly a mountain plant and yet the plants still have to endure a harsh environment especially wind and the beach could be in alaska or other cold place but the plants survive in their stony surroundings some prefer the term rock plant as many alpines associate so well with rocks and stones it still amazes me that when planting alpines in the garden or in a container how much better they look and perform with layer of small gravel is spread around the plants  it would have made this pot of thrift look better tooother alpines grow in more of a woodland habitat like this ranunculus ficaria aurantiaca which is a form of ournative celandine often seen around wood edges and along hedge bottoms in spring as we get more and more confused about what makes an alpine in much of europe the equivalent of alpine or rock plant doesnt even exist  they are simply lowgrowing perennials to summarise the term alpine plant is a catchall term and whatever your own growing conditions might be  wet dry sunny or shady with careful selection you will find a lowgrowing spreading plant that needs minimal care to fill that spot and that will be an alpine or a rock plant  how to use alpine plants in you garden well the obvious answer would be on your rock garden but not many people can afford or have space for such a feature many more people have a rockery  a mounded or sloping area with a few stones dotted about  and alpines can thrive here  but they are by no means essential many alpines look stunning planted in an old stone sink or trough again its the association with stone but the same effect can be had with artificial stone replicas some are even made from polystyrene so weigh very little and could even be placed on a balcony you dont even need a garden as such to grow and enjoy alpines a group of any type of containers stone plastic or whatever planted with alpines will make a charming feature and be attractive in all seasons continuing the stone association many of the low spreading alpines look good when planted near paving their natural informal shapes relieving the hard feature of paving slabs likewise in and around gravel areas where the gravel mimics the plants domain in nature such as the geranium laurence flatman seen here sprawling over a gravel path and softening those hard edges you must have seen the usually purple aubretia hanging from walls in the spring  an alpine type plant being used in a situation that mimics nature many alpines will spread and cover walls as long as their roots can reach the soil within or behind the structure growing conditions soil etc a quick word about drainage  we often use the terms freedraining needs good drainage etc what does this mean all it means is that water cannot rest around the plant or its roots if one thing most alpines do not like it is water around them  any excess must drain away quickly this is helped by having or making a gritty or sandy soil and by placing grit or small gravel around and under the leaves of the plants if you have read from the top of this page you will now know that alpines are a very varied lot but for the majority their requirements are a sunny site not overhung by trees a fairly poor soil in so far as not being well fed or manured and if the soil is slightly sandy or gritty or can made so then so much the better such condtions will satisfy a huge range of diverse and interesting plants providing lasting colour shape and interest all year  and for years to come further advice there are two major clubs in the uk and worldwide for alpine plants  one is the alpine garden society ags the other the scottish rock garden club srgc each of their websites is well worth a look the srgc also has an online forum  someone on there knows the answer to your question they are very helpful and friendly and beginners are welcomed the royal horticultural society also has an excellent website packed full of useful and interesting information one book i would recommend is alpines an essential guide by michael mitchell crowood press written by an experienced alpine grower and nurseryman it covers just about every question you might have about alpines and how to grow them our online plant shop offers a huge range of plants for you to choose from and gives some guidance on what conditions many of the plants prefer if you cant decide what to order or are unsure if you are selecting the best plants then our special collections are a simple solution and ideal for the beginner or someone needing to fill a large area at reduced cost happy alpine gardening2 plants for special situations alpine plants for shade it is largely true that most alpine and rockery plants prefer a sunny site but not in every case some plants will undoubtedly do better in a sunny site but that same plant might do well enough in a lightly shaded site it all depends on the depth of shade how dark it is and the duration of shade a site might get a couple of hours of sunshine in the mornings or evenings or it might get no direct sun at all but some dappled shade and light from a nearby tree if your site gets some direct sunshine at some time during the day then you can choose from the list below plants can be very adaptable  even true sunlovers like some sedums will do well enough in light shade another factor you must consider is the how dry the site is  dry shade especially where nearby trees block light and draw moisture is especially difficult but not impossible if you water plants until they properly establish acaena aquilegia arenaria balearica astilbe campanula foerster kathy resholdts varietychiastophyllum oppositifolium cyananthus  for acid no lime soil

rockery plants will thrive in these conditions not merely survive the plants listed in bold will survive the hottest and driest conditions best of all many other plants would do well in these conditions too especially if their roots can penetrate deeply to find moisture or you can water them occasionally during drought acaena kupferteppichaethionema warley rose alyssum spinosum roseum

wide range sempervivum  a very wide range thymus  the thymes alpines suitable for troughs and containers we grow a very wide range of plants which are truly suitable for growing in troughs if you are a novice you probably couldnt do better than with one of our specially selected trough plant collections other containers are equally suitable but we simply refer to them as troughs or plants for troughs a web search for planting alpine troughs or similar will yield a bounty of generally good advice i list some links below that are worth reading and offer honest reliable advice i will add a few basic tips  all containers must have drainage holes in the base use a good soilbased compost yes you can grow perfectly good plants in a the more common peatbased composts or even peat substitutes but its my opinion that nothing will ensure better chances of longterm success than incorporating some soil or loam in the compost a good basic recipe is to select a john innes compost from any garden centre or diy store and mix in a good amount of small grit  perhaps 1 part grit to 3 parts of preprepared john innes this will improve drainage but it will also make the container very heavy so first place the container where it is to stay another tip is to fill the container to the brim with compost mixture even overfill it mounding it slightly as you plant nothing looks worse than a loosely filled container where the compost and plants have settled a few inches below the rim of the container  it just looks wrong firm the compost around the edges as you fill the container a carefully selected and placed stone or two often looks good as can broken slate arranged almost vertically or sloped at an angle these offer different planting opportunities for some of the little gems after you have planted your trough top it off with generous layer of grit or small gravel feeding the initial compost will contain enough nutrients to last the plants for the first season thereafter only a light sprinkling of powdered fertiliser should be needed once in spring and again in late junejuly only use at half the rate recommended for other garden plants a fertiliser containing more potash  high k or fruit and flower feed  is ideal liquid feeding works well too  a liquid tomato fertiliser is ideal but again only at halfrate this can be given perhaps every 3 or 4 weeks or so when watering during the growing season the aim is just to keep the plants healthy and active in their limited volume of soil not to encourage lush rapid growth  hence the use of fertilisers at low rate only when compliling this list i have restricted it to those smaller neatergrowing alpines that will enjoy growing in a stone trough or similar container androsace  all of them a sempervivoides will form a mat

encourage and educate others on making troughs and growing alpine plants gardening people are some of the most generous people around happily giving their time knowledge and often plants free for the benefit of others here are a few of the best sites i have come across in no particular order jan tholhuijsen has made a remarkably informative video and ebook explaining how he makes his own troughs  from polystyrene boxes but you would never guess its well worth reading and a rich source of additional information  and inspiration thank you jan portraits of alpine plants is another wonderful website from a very experienced grower of alpine plants everything is covered  buying or making your own stone sink various methods choosing plants siting compost  its a very good read although the site is some years old the authors knowledge and enthusiasm for plants is peerless growing with plants is a useful read and has lots of good photos to help you along the way one minor word of caution  it is american so some of the references may be lost on us and its written in a very informal style not a criticism ian young from aberdeen has excellent information on his bulb log the scottish rock garden club forum has a specific topic on troughs with some amazing images for inspiration and some useful tips it is fairly lengthy silver leaved plants several of the plants we offer have silver or grey leaves and nothing looks better in the sunshine silver is also the ideal neutral backdrop to all those colourful flowers most prefer a welldrained and sunny position artemisia schmidtiana

frances cade and others sempervivum boule de neigetanacetum densum thymus silver posie and silver queenplants for seaside gardens coastal gardens bring their own challenges  wind salt and usually poor sandy soils fortunately many alpine plants will not only survive in these conditions but thrive in them most alpine plants are naturally lowgrowing and their low spreading growth means they are less troubled by wind similarly freedraining sandy soils will suit many alpines perfectly  indeed many alpines are thoroughly droughttolerant more so than most plants salt picked up from the sea and carried by the wind brings a particular problem  it will scorch or brown leaves and can kill plants stone dead but here again alpines are your friends because they have different means of lessening any damage some have thick waxy coatings on their leaves like most of the sedums that reduces any damage or have very small leaves other alpine or rockery plants are herbaceous  the top leaves of the plant die back for winter avoiding the worst storms and regrow afresh in spring and some plants are naturally adapted over thousands of years to grow and thrive right on the beach or on the rocks armeria maritima  maritima of the sea is the classic example our native thrift that can be found on practically every shore of the u k your selection of suitable plants will be determined by the severity of your gardens exposure  if it really is right by the seaside then you will need to choose more carefully and possibly be prepared for some trial and error and disappointments along the way however the merest bit of shelter can extend your selection  perhaps a wall or fence or some windpruned shrubs will offer just enough protection to make growing beautiful plants possible if you are near the sea rather than immediately on the beach then you have many more options of plants a final word on soil  if it is almost pure sand it will be best to improve that by adding organic matter garden compost wellrotted manure used growbags or any of the peat substitutes will do the job of retaining moisture just be careful not to improve the soil too much alpines dislike rich soil full of nutrients so dont go mad soil improvement isnt absolutely essential  remember many alpines are naturally drought resistant  but it can increase the range of plants you can grow many many alpines will do well if you can get them established through their first full year here is a list of the most obvious seaside alpine plants acaena achillea alyssum antennaria anthemis armeria  all will do well artemisia aubrieta campanula  most die back or nearly so in winter cotula hispida crepis incana delosperma dianthus especially spreading types like feuerhexe and tiny rubies erodium geranium helianthemum  will regrow in spring if winter damaged leptinella potentilla eriocarpa sedum  all of them sempervivum  especially those with small rosettes silene uniflora rosea thymus  the thymes are evergreen but the small creeping ones t serpyllum pink chintz purple beauty etc can take some abuse veronica prostrata  and varieties we also offer a range of different plant collections which we can make up to your requirements
