top 10 world’s slowest moving animals animals by rahul khorwal on june 30 2016 no comments all over the world you can certainly find a number of cute and not so cute animals some of them are even already endangered species that it is very rare to find them apart from the appearance they also vary in some other ways like their sizes their body color and even how they move there are those that can run fast and there are also those that cannot move as quick as the others in relation to this here are the top 10 world’s slowest moving animals that you might don’t know yet10 gila monster gila monster belongs to the family of lizards even so its size is not that the same with the typical lizards that you might always see the maximum size that it can have is around 60 cm while its weight can reach as much as 700 grams it can be commonly found in the united states and it is a venomous kind of a lizard however there is nothing to fear about it since it is a very slow moving animal it can only travel 667 cm in every second9 koala bear who would not know about koala bear by the way it is such an adorable animal but this is not actually a bear it belongs to the family of endangered arboreal herbivorous marsupials but if you are crazy enough to disturb it you’ll definitely don’t like what it will do to you you can always see this animal climbing up on trees its highest speed being recorded is around 447 cm in every second8 american woodcock the american woodcock is a smallsize chunky shorebird and it is colloquially being called the timberdoodle this is considered to be the slowest bird that can you can ever see in the entire world in the northern areas this bird is known as the harbinger of spring when it comes to speed it can only move around 222 cm in every second7 manatee the other name of manatee is sea cow and this is a kind of mammal that can be seen on seas it is a herbivorous ocean animal that may grow as long as 4 meters and it can weigh as much as 590 kilograms well probably this is one reason why it is a slow moving animal it is even seldom to make use of its paddlelike flippers because of its natural laziness in every second it can only move around 139 up to 222 cm6 loris loris is a kind of primate and it is known for its medium size it has tennis ball eyes and humanlike hands but strangely long ones this is why it is considered by many as a horrifying creature well there is no one to blame since it really looks strange not to mention the fact that it always love to be in the dark because it’s a nocturnal animal it can move very slow though for just a speed of 555 cm in every second5 giant tortoise well there is no need more introduction about it since tortoise is wellknown for its very slow movement in fact it is branded to be the slowest moving animal available on earth a giant tortoise has very thick legs and heavy shells and these are the main reasons why it moves so slow for 76 cm in every second its lifespan however can reach as longer as 100 years4 starfish well even though it has a fish on its name starfish is really not a fish in the ocean you can find more or less 2000 species of starfishes of course these starfishes vary when it comes to speed and some other things nonetheless the average speed of starfishes being recorded is around 08927 cm in every second the fastest starfish specie is the sand starfish but it only moves 47 cm in every second3 threetoed sloth the word “sloth” simply means laziness but it is not confirmed that the threetoed sloth animal is named this way because of its very slow speed the other kinds of sloths only have the maximum speed of 3 cm in every second however a threetoed sloth is a bit faster than that which is 67 cm in every second in one long day this sloth can only go around 56 kilometers2 garden snail garden snail is commonly being referred to as the terrestrial mollusc it is called a garden snail since it literally lives on land specially on where many plants are growing every trail it passes on can become wet because of the slippery water that it produces from its body in every second its maximum speed can only be 13 centimeter1 seahorse seahorse is of course not the same with the horse living on land it is the exact opposite of the land horse when it comes to speed the highest speed being recorded done by this weird sea creature is around 004 centimeter in every second it is weird because apart from its appearance it swims with a super erect body these are the top 10 world’s slowest moving animals the slowliness of these animals
