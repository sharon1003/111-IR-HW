and those in the tipservice industry the increase is part of a state law approved in march that will boost the minimum wage in new york city and downstate to 15 an hour by 2021 the first increase starts saturday dec 31 — when the minimum wage for workers in new york city will increase to 11 an hour or 1050 an hour for employers with less than 10 workers it will rise to 10 an hour in nassau suffolk and westchester counties outside the metropolitan area the wage will be raised to 970 an hour cuomo and advocates of the higher wages said the move will boost the economy and help 23 million lowincome workers“these policies will not only lift up the current generation of lowwage workers and their families but ensure fairness for future generations and enable them to climb the ladder of opportunity” cuomo said in a statement april 4 when the bill was ceremoniously signed into law by the end of 2018 the wage will increase to 15 an hour in new york city for large businesses and a year later for small companies with 10 or fewer employees on long island and westchester the wage will hit 15 by the end of 2021 for the rest of the state the wage will grow to 1250 at the end of 2020 and go on a schedule toward 15 set by the state budget division and department of labor the increases worry local businesses who said they have already felt the impact of previous wage increases a year ago the minimum wage was increased to 9 an hour and it rose higher for fastfood and state workers 1050 in new york city and 975 for the rest of the state at the end of this year the fastfood wages will grow to 12 in the city and 1075 in the rest of the state the fastfood wages will hit 15 at the end of 2018 in the city and 15 an hour elsewhere on july 1 2021 there was also an increase this year for tipped workers to 750 an hour a 250 bump from 5 an hour last year the higher wages will ultimately lead to nearly 16 billion in new spending in local communities the state has estimated“increasing the minimum wage is proven to reduce worker turnover and improve productivity” said cullen burnell a spokesperson for the state labor department“additionally when lowwage workers receive a pay increase they tend to spend it locally”some business owners said the minimumwage increase has negatively impacted their operations tipped wage impact after the increase in tipped wages tim ward the owner of mc girk’s irish pub in chenango county was forced to cut back on his employee’s hours and give shifts to individuals who outperformed their coworkers in order to refrain from passing the cost of the increases onto customers the higher wages also backfired he said“believe it or not some people know they the employees got a 50 percent raise and they’re tipping them less” ward said “my employees were furious they are taking home less in their pocket now than they were in 2015”currently tipped workers receive a minimum cash wage of 750 if they earn enough in tips to make up the difference for 9 an hour for other tipped workers the rate is 765 an hour if they earn at least 135 an hour in tips if they earn at least 220 in tips an hour then they must be paid an hourly wage of 680 according to the department of labor the increases for those in the tipservice industry had a more profound effect on mike polasek owner the poughkeepsiebased catering service simply gourmet and his employees in june he said he was forced to close bluestone bistro in poughkeepsie because he could not afford to pay his employees at the increased rate without passing the burden onto consumers in addition to closing bluestone’s doors this summer polasek said he had to eliminate meritbased raises for his employees and increase booking costs for simply gourmet pushback continues business owners continue to oppose the higher wages last spring the business council of westchester released a poll to its members and found that twice as many of the business owners surveyed were against raising the minimum wage compared with those who supported it the greater rochester chamber of commerce found similar results after surveying over 200 of their members last year the chamber found that roughly 70 percent of members opposed the wage increase according to christopher wiest vice president of the chamber“when you pass wide sweeping legislation like minimum wage you sometimes forget about what the cause and effects are going to be on a daily basis for people who are now going to have to live under this new law — and that’s what we’re going to have to wait and see” said john ravitz the executive vice president of the westchester council after the dec 31 raise the new york city wage will grow 2 each year before hitting 15 at the end of 2018 it will grow 150 a year for the city’s small businesses until reaching 15 a year later for long island and westchester the increases will be 1 an hour until the end of 2021 while it will rise 70 cents each year until dec 31 2020 for the rest of the state frank castella jr the ceo of dutchess county regional chamber of commerce knocked the plan“these increases will also make us less competitive across state lines as forced inflation is inevitable our businesses will no longer be able to compete on price and sales will be lost to neighboring states” castella said unintended consequences the law includes a socalled “safety valve” that would allow the state starting in 2019 to consider whether to continue the increases based on the economy at the time brendan o’bryan the manager of government relations at the greater binghamton chamber of commerce said the higher wages have “opened up a whole other can of worms”some businesses are currently paying their employees above the minimum wage particularly those in the nonprofit sector who depend on state funding now those organizations and employers are left wondering if they too will have to increase salaries to stay further ahead of the minimum wage“the state’s already said that they’re not going to increase the funding to maintain the nonprofit organizations” o’bryan said for example fernan cepera the chief human resources officer at the ymca of greater rochester calculated the higher minimum wage would cost the organization 400000 per year until 2020 resulting in a total impact of 2 million“if they raise the minimum wages for dishwasher to 1250 an hour then i have to pay 19 or 20 an hour for a good chef” ward said weist said companies and nonprofits are reporting that they will have three choices cut employee benefits downsize their workforce or reduce the services and programs they provide higher wage support nonprofits in particular should lobby for more state funding said bill lipton the director of state’s working families party the unionbacked group that helped lead the “fight for 15” effort this year“we need to join together with socialservice workers unions and other progressive forces to ensure that there is enough money in the budget so they can continue to provide their vital services” he said the working families party has advocated for smallbusiness property tax relief to prevent them from having to cut back on their employees’ hours or raising their service costs“local businesses are critical to our economy and we should be changing our policies” lipton said the national employment law project a manhattanbased organization that advocates for the rights of lowwage workers believes that raising the minimum wage will allow smallbusiness owners to attract talented workers at the same rate that bigger companies do“we believe that raising the minimum wage would actually level the playing field so that small businesses are not overburdened by having to compensate workers at a higher rate to compete with large businesses for the most talented employees” yannet lathorp its policy analyst said the increase to 10 an hour is welcomed by rockland county resident norma criollo who works in the kitchen of a nanuet mc donald’s criollo works to support herself her children and her parents who live in mexico“this increase will enable me to keep up with my bills and i hope to put a little more aside to send to my family” criollo said“i have been happy to see our paychecks go up and look forward to seeing them go up even more in the new year”lribackgannettcom lindsey riback is a staff writer
