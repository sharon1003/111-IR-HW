standardized test widely used for college admissions in the united states introduced in 1926 its name and scoring have changed several times originally called the scholastic aptitude test it was later called the scholastic assessment test then the sat i reasoning test then the sat reasoning test and now simply the sat the sat is owned developed and published by the college board a private nonprofit organization in the united states it is administered on behalf of the college board by the educational testing service 3 which until recently developed the sat as well 4 the test is intended to assess students readiness for college the sat was originally designed to not be aligned with high school curricula 5 but several adjustments were made for the version of the sat introduced in 2016 and college board president david coleman has said that he also wanted to make the test reflect more closely what students learned in high school 6on march 5 2014 the college board announced that a redesigned version of the sat would be administered for the first time in 2016 7 the current sat introduced in 2016 takes three hours to finish plus 50 minutes for the sat with essay and as of 2017

seniors 11 the college board states that the sat measures literacy numeracy and writing skills that are needed for academic success in college they state that the sat assesses how well the test takers analyze and solve problems—skills they learned in school that they will need in college however the test is administered under a tight time limit speeded to help produce a range of scores 12the college board also states that use of the sat in combination with high school grade point average gpa provides a better indicator of success in college than high school grades alone as measured by college freshman gpa various studies conducted over the lifetime of the sat show a statistically significant increase in correlation of high school grades and college freshman grades when the sat is factored in 13 a large independent validity study on the sats ability to predict college freshman gpa was performed by the university of california the results of this study found how well various predictor variables could explain the variance in college freshman gpa it found that independently high school gpa could explain 154 of the variance in college freshman gpa sat i the sat math and verbal sections could explain 133 of the variance in college freshman gpa and sat ii also known as the sat subject tests in the ucs case specifically writing mathematics ic or iic plus a third subject test of the students choice could explain 16 of the variance in college freshman gpa when high school gpa and the sat i were combined they explained 208 of the variance in college freshman gpa when high school gpa and the sat ii were combined they explained 222 of the variance in college freshman gpa when sat i was added to the combination of high school gpa and sat ii it added a 1 percentage point increase in explaining the variance in college freshman gpa for a total of 223 14there are substantial differences in funding curricula grading and difficulty among u s secondary schools due to u s federalism local control and the prevalence of private distance and home schooled students sat and act scores are intended to supplement the secondary school record and help admission officers put local data—such as course work grades and class rank—in a national perspective 15 however independent research has shown that high school gpa is better than the sat at predicting college grades regardless of high school type or quality 16this map of the united states shows the states in which blue color more seniors in the class of 2006 took the sat than the act and the states in which red color more seniors took the act than the sat this map of the united states shows the states in which blue color more seniors in the class of 2017 took the sat than the act and the states in which red color more seniors took the act than the sat historically the sat was more widely used by students living in coastal states and the act was more widely used by students in the midwest and south in recent years however an increasing number of students on the east and west coasts have been taking the act 17 18 since 2007 all fouryear colleges and universities in the united states that require a test as part of an application for admission will accept either the sat or act and over 950 fouryear colleges and universities do not require any standardized test scores at all for admission 19 20structure  editthe sat has four sections reading writing and language math no calculator and math calculator allowed the test taker may optionally write an essay which in that case is the fifth test section the total time for the scored portion of the sat is three hours or three hours and fifty minutes if the optional essay section is taken some test takers who are not taking the essay may also have a fifth section which is used at least in part for the pretesting of questions that may appear on future administrations of the sat these questions are not included in the computation of the sat score two section scores result from taking the sat evidencebased reading and writing and math section scores are reported on a scale of 200 to 800 and each section score is a multiple of ten a total score for the sat is calculated by adding the two section scores resulting in total scores that range from 400 to 1600 there is no penalty for guessing on the sat scores are based on the number of questions answered correctly in addition to the two section scores three test scores on a scale of 10 to 40 are reported one for each of reading writing and language and math the essay if taken is scored separately from the two section scores 21reading test  editthe reading test of the sat is made up of one section with 52 questions and a time limit of 65 minutes 21 all questions are multiplechoice and based on reading passages tables graphs and charts may accompany some passages but no math is required to correctly answer the corresponding questions there are five passages up to two of which may be a pair of smaller passages on the reading test and 1011 questions per passage or passage pair sat reading passages draw from three main fields history social studies and science each sat reading test always includes one passage from u s or world literature one passage from either a u s founding document or a related text one passage about economics psychology sociology or another social science and two science passages answers to all of the questions are based only on the content stated in or implied by the passage or passage pair 22writing and language test  editthe writing and language test of the sat is made up of one section with 44 multiplechoice questions and a time limit of 35 minutes 21 as with the reading test all questions are based on reading passages which may be accompanied by tables graphs and charts the test taker will be asked to read the passages find mistakes or weaknesses in writing and to provide corrections or improvements reading passages on this test range in content from topic arguments to nonfiction narratives in a variety of subjects the skills being evaluated include increasing the clarity of argument improving word choice improving analysis of topics in social studies and science changing sentence or word structure to increase organizational quality and impact of writing and fixing or improving sentence structure word usage and punctuation 23mathematics  editan example of an sat gridin math question and the correctly gridded answer the mathematics portion of the sat is divided into two sections math test – calculator and math test – no calculator in total the sat math test is 80 minutes long and includes 58 questions 45 multiple choice questions and 13 gridin questions 24 the multiple choice questions have four possible answers the gridin questions are free response and require the test taker to provide an answer the math test – no calculator section has 20 questions 15 multiple choice and 5 gridin and lasts 25 minutes the math test – calculator section has 38 questions 30 multiple choice and 8 gridin and lasts 55 minutes several scores are provided to the test taker for the math test a subscore on a scale of 1 to 15 is reported for each of three categories of math content heart of algebra linear equations systems of linear equations and linear functions problem solving and data analysis statistics modeling and problemsolving skills and passport to advanced math nonlinear expressions radicals exponentials and other topics that form the basis of more advanced math a test score for the math test is reported on a scale of 10 to 40 and a section score equal to the test score multiplied by 20 is reported on a scale of 200 to 800 25 26 27calculator use  editall scientific and most graphing calculators including computer algebra system cas calculators are permitted on the sat math – calculator section only all fourfunction calculators are allowed as well however these devices are not recommended all mobile phone and smartphone calculators calculators with typewriterlike  qwerty keyboards laptops and other portable computers and calculators capable of accessing the internet are not permitted 28research was conducted by the college board to study the effect of calculator use on sat i reasoning test math scores the study found that performance on the math section was associated with the extent of calculator use those using calculators on about one third to one half of the items averaged higher scores than those using calculators more or less frequently however the effect was more likely to have been the result of able students using calculators differently than less able students rather than calculator use per se 29 there is some evidence that the frequent use of a calculator in school outside of the testing situation has a positive effect on test performance compared to those who do not use calculators in school 30style of questions  editmost of the questions on the sat except for the optional essay and the gridin math responses are multiple choice all multiplechoice questions have four answer choices one of which is correct thirteen of the questions on the math portion of the sat about 22 of all the math questions are not multiple choice 31 they instead require the test taker to bubble in a number in a fourcolumn grid all questions on each section of the sat are weighted equally for each correct answer one raw point is added 32 no points are deducted for incorrect answers the final score is derived from the raw score the precise conversion chart varies between test administrations section average score 1time minutes content mathematics 527 80 number and operations algebra and functions geometry statistics probability and data

administration six weeks for mailed paper scores with each section graded on a scale of 200–800 and two sub scores for the writing section the essay score and the multiple choice sub score in addition to their score students receive their percentile the percentage of other test takers with lower scores the raw score or the number of points gained from correct answers and lost from incorrect answers is also included 35 students may also receive for an additional fee the question and answer service which provides the students answer the correct answer to each question and online resources explaining each question the corresponding percentile of each scaled score varies from test to test—for example in 2003 a scaled score of 800 in both sections of the sat reasoning test corresponded to a percentile of 999 while a scaled score of 800 in the sat physics test corresponded to the 94th percentile the differences in what scores mean with regard to percentiles are due to the content of the exam and the caliber of students choosing to take each exam subject tests are subject to intensive study often in the form of an ap which is relatively more difficult and only those who know they will perform well tend to take these tests creating a skewed distribution of scores the percentiles that various sat scores for collegebound seniors correspond to are summarized in the following chart 36

scores of collegebound seniors many college entrance exams in the early 1900s were specific to each school and required candidates to travel to the school to take the tests the college board a consortium of colleges in the northeastern united states was formed in 1900 to establish a nationally administered uniform set of essay tests based on the curricula of the boarding schools that typically provided graduates to the colleges of the ivy league and seven sisters among others 44 45in the same time period lewis terman and others began to promote the use of tests such as alfred binet s in american schools terman in particular thought that such tests could identify an innate  intelligence quotient  iq in a person the results of an iq test could then be used to find an elite group of students who would be given the chance to finish high school and go on to college 44 by the mid1920s the increasing use of iq tests such as the army alpha test administered to recruits in world war i led the college board to commission the development of the sat the commission headed by carl brigham argued that the test predicted success in higher education by identifying candidates primarily on the basis of intellectual promise rather than on specific accomplishment in high school subjects 45 in 1934 james conant and henry chauncey used the sat as a means to identify recipients for scholarships to harvard university specifically conant wanted to find students other than those from the traditional northeastern private schools that could do well at harvard the success of the scholarship program and the advent of world war ii led to the end of the college board essay exams and to the sat being used as the only admissions test for college board member colleges 44the sat rose in prominence after world war ii due to several factors machinebased scoring of multiplechoice tests taken by pencil had made it possible to rapidly process the exams 46 the g i bill produced an influx of millions of veterans into higher education 46 47 the formation of the educational testing service ets also played a significant role in the expansion of the sat beyond the roughly fifty colleges that made up the college board at the time 48 the ets was formed in 1947 by the college board carnegie foundation for the advancement of teaching and the american council on education to consolidate respectively the operations of the sat the gre and the achievement tests developed by ben wood for use with conants scholarship exams 46 the new organization was to be philosophically grounded in the concepts of openminded scientific research in testing with no doctrine to sell and with an eye toward public service 49 the ets was chartered after the death of brigham who had opposed the creation of such an entity brigham felt that the interests of a consolidated testing agency would be more aligned with sales or marketing than with research into the science of testing 46 it has been argued that the interest of the ets in expanding the sat in order to support its operations aligned with the desire of public college and university faculties to have smaller diversified and more academic student bodies as a means to increase research activities 44 in 1951 about 80000 sats were taken in 1961 about 800000 and by 1971 about 15 million sats were being taken each year 50a timeline of notable events in the history of the sat follows1901 essay exams  editon june 17 1901 the first exams of the college board were administered to 973 students across 67 locations in the united states and two in europe although those taking the test came from a variety of backgrounds approximately one third were from new york new jersey or pennsylvania the majority of those taking the test were from private schools academies or endowed schools about 60 of those taking the test applied to columbia university the test contained sections on english french german latin greek history mathematics chemistry and physics the test was not multiple choice but instead was evaluated based on essay responses as excellent good doubtful poor or very poor 511926 test  editthe first administration of the sat occurred on june 23 1926 when it was known as the scholastic aptitude test 52 53 this test prepared by a committee headed by princeton psychologist carl campbell brigham had sections of definitions arithmetic classification artificial language antonyms number series analogies logical inference and paragraph reading it was administered to over 8000 students at over 300 test centers men composed 60 of the testtakers slightly over a quarter of males and females applied to yale university and smith college 53 the test was paced rather quickly testtakers being given only a little over 90 minutes to answer 315 questions 52 the raw score of each participating student was converted to a score scale with a mean of 500 and a standard deviation of 100 this scale was effectively equivalent to a 200 to 800 scale although students could score more than 800 and less than 200 461928 and 1929 tests  editin 1928 the number of sections on the sat was reduced to seven and the time limit was increased to slightly under two hours in 1929 the number of sections was again reduced this time to six these changes were designed in part to give testtakers more time per question for these two years all of the sections tested verbal ability math was eliminated entirely from the sat 521930 test and 1936 changes  editin 1930 the sat was first split into the verbal and math sections a structure that would continue through 2004 the verbal section of the 1930 test covered a more narrow range of content than its predecessors examining only antonyms double definitions somewhat similar to sentence completions and paragraph reading in 1936 analogies were readded between 1936 and 1946 students had between 80 and 115 minutes to answer 250 verbal questions over a third of which were on antonyms the mathematics test introduced in 1930 contained 100 free response questions to be answered in 80 minutes and focused primarily on speed from 1936 to 1941 like the 1928 and 1929 tests the mathematics section was eliminated entirely when the mathematics portion of the test was readded in 1942 it consisted of multiple choice questions 521941 and 1942 score scales  edituntil 1941 the scores on all sats had been scaled to a mean of 500 with a standard deviation of 100 although one testtaker could be compared to another for a given test date comparisons from one year to another could not be made for example a score of 500 achieved on an sat taken in one year could reflect a different ability level than a score of 500 achieved in another year by 1940 it had become clear that setting the mean sat score to 500 every year was unfair to those students who happened to take the sat with a group of higher average ability 54in order to make crossyear score comparisons possible in april 1941 the sat verbal section was scaled to a mean of 500 and a standard deviation of 100 and the june 1941 sat verbal section was equated linked to the april 1941 test all sat verbal sections after 1941 were equated to previous tests so that the same scores on different sats would be comparable similarly in june 1942 the sat math section was equated to the april 1942 math section which itself was linked to the 1942 sat verbal section and all sat math sections after 1942 would be equated to previous tests from this point forward sat mean scores could change over time depending on the average ability of the group taking the test compared to the roughly 10600 students taking the sat in april 1941 the 1941 and 1942 score scales would remain in use until 1995 54 551946 test and associated changes  editparagraph reading was eliminated from the verbal portion of the sat in 1946 and replaced with reading comprehension and double definition questions were replaced with sentence completions between 1946 and 1957 students were given 90 to 100 minutes to complete 107 to 170 verbal questions starting in 1958 time limits became more stable and for 17 years until 1975 students had 75 minutes to answer 90 questions in 1959 questions on data sufficiency were introduced to the mathematics section and then replaced with quantitative comparisons in 1974 in 1974 both verbal and math sections were reduced from 75 minutes to 60 minutes each with changes in test composition compensating for the decreased time 521960s and 1970s score declines  editfrom 1926 to 1941 scores on the sat were scaled to make 500 the mean score on each section in 1941 and 1942 sat scores were standardized via test equating and as a consequence average verbal and math scores could vary from that time forward 54 in 1952 mean verbal and math scores were 476 and 494 respectively and scores were generally stable in the 1950s and early 1960s however starting in the mid1960s and continuing until the early 1980s sat scores declined the average verbal score dropped by about 50 points and the average math score fell by about 30 points by the late 1970s only the upper third of test takers were doing as well as the upper half of those taking the sat in 1963 from 1961 to 1977 the number of sats taken per year doubled suggesting that the decline could be explained by demographic changes in the group of students taking the sat commissioned by the college board an independent study of the decline found that most up to about 75 of the test decline in the 1960s could be explained by compositional changes in the group of students taking the test however only about 25 percent of the 1970s decrease in test scores could similarly be explained 50 later analyses suggested that up to 40 percent of the 1970s decline in scores could be explained by demographic changes leaving unknown at least some of the reasons for the decline 561994 changes  editin early 1994 substantial changes were made to the sat 57 antonyms were removed from the verbal section in order to make rote memorization of vocabulary less useful also the fraction of verbal questions devoted to passagebased reading material was increased from about 30 to about 50 and the passages were chosen to be more like typical collegelevel reading material compared to previous sat reading passages the changes for increased emphasis on analytical reading were made in response to a 1990 report issued by a commission established by the college board the commission recommended that the sat should among other things approximate more closely the skills used in college and high school work 52 a mandatory essay had been considered as well for the new version of the sat however criticism from minority groups as well as a concomitant increase in the cost of the test necessary to grade the essay led the college board to drop it from the planned changes 58major changes were also made to the sat mathematics section at this time due in part to the influence of suggestions made by the national council of teachers of mathematics testtakers were now permitted to use calculators on the math sections of the sat also for the first time since 1935 the sat would now include some math questions that were not multiple choice instead requiring students to supply the answers additionally some of these studentproduced response questions could have more than one correct answer the tested mathematics content on the sat was expanded to include concepts of slope of a line probability elementary statistics including median and mode and counting problems 521995 recentering raising mean score back to 500  editby the early 1990s average total sat scores were around 900 typically 425 on the verbal and 475 on the math the average scores on the 1994 modification of the sat i were similar 428 on the verbal and 482 on the math 59 sat scores for admitted applicants to highly selective colleges in the united states were typically much higher for example the score ranges of the middle 50 of admitted applicants to princeton university in 1985 were 600 to 720 verbal and 660 to 750 math 60 similarly median scores on the modified 1994 sat for freshmen entering yale university in the fall of 1995 were 670 verbal and 720 math 61 for the majority of sat takers however verbal and math scores were below 500 in 1992 half of the collegebound seniors taking the sat were scoring between 340 and 500 on the verbal section and between 380 and 560 on the math section with corresponding median scores of 420 and 470 respectively 62the drop in sat verbal scores in particular meant that the usefulness of the sat score scale 200 to 800 had become degraded at the top end of the verbal scale significant gaps were occurring between raw scores and uncorrected scaled scores a perfect raw score no longer corresponded to an 800 and a single omission out of 85 questions could lead to a drop of 30 or 40 points in the scaled score corrections to scores above 700 had been necessary to reduce the size of the gaps and to make a perfect raw score result in an 800 at the other end of the scale about 15 percent of test takers would have scored below 200 on the verbal section if that had not been the reported minimum score although the math score averages were closer to the center of the scale 500 than the verbal scores the distribution of math scores was no longer well approximated by a normal distribution these problems among others suggested that the original score scale and its reference group of about 10000 students taking the sat in 1941 needed to be replaced 54beginning with the test administered in april 1995 the sat score scale was recentered to return the average math and verbal scores close to 500 although only 25 students had received perfect scores of 1600 in all of 1994 137 students taking the april test scored a 1600 63 the new scale used a reference group of about one million seniors in the class of 1990 the scale was designed so that the sat scores of this cohort would have a mean of 500 and a standard deviation of 110 because the new scale would not be directly comparable to the old scale scores awarded on april 1995 and later were officially reported with an r for example 560r to reflect the change in scale a practice that was continued until 2001 54 scores awarded before april 1995 may be compared to those on the recentered scale by using official college board tables for example verbal and math scores of 500 received before 1995 correspond to scores of 580 and 520 respectively on the 1995 scale 641995 recentering controversy  editcertain educational organizations viewed the sat recentering initiative as an attempt to stave off international embarrassment in regards to continuously declining test scores even among top students as evidence it was presented that the number of pupils who scored above 600 on the verbal portion of the test had fallen from a peak of 112530 in 1972 to 73080 in 1993 a 36 backslide despite the fact that the total number of testtakers had risen over 500000 65 other authors have argued that the evidence for a decline in student quality is mixed citing that top scorers on the act have shown little change in the same period and that the proportion of 17yearolds scoring at the highest performance level on the naep longterm trend assessment has been roughly stable for decades 662002 changes – score choice  editsince 1993 using a policy referred to as score choice students taking the satii subject exams were able to choose whether or not to report the resulting scores to a college to which the student was applying in october 2002 the college board dropped the score choice option for satii exams matching the score policy for the traditional sat tests that required students to release all scores to colleges 67 the college board said that under the old score policy many students who waited to release scores would forget to do so and miss admissions deadlines it was also suggested that the old policy of allowing students the option of which scores to report favored students who could afford to retake the tests 682005 changes including a new 2400point score  editin 2005 the test was changed again largely in response to criticism by the university of california system 69 in order to have the sat more closely reflect high school curricula certain types of questions were eliminated analogies from the verbal section and quantitative comparison items from the math section 52 a new writing section with an essay based on the former sat ii writing subject test was added 70 in part to increase the chances of closing the opening gap between the highest and midrange scores other factors included the desire to test the writing ability of each student hence the essay the essay section added an additional maximum 800 points to the score which increased the new maximum score to 2400 71 the new sat was first offered on march 12 2005 after the last administration of the old sat in january 2005 the mathematics section was expanded to cover three years of high school mathematics to emphasize the importance of reading the verbal sections name was changed to the critical reading section 52scoring problems of october 2005 tests  editin march 2006 it was announced that a small percentage of the sats taken in october 2005 had been scored incorrectly due to the test papers being moist and not scanning properly and that some students had received erroneous scores 72 the college board announced they would change the scores for the students who were given a lower score than they earned but at this point many of those students had already applied to colleges using their original scores the college board decided not to change the scores for the students who were given a higher score than they earned a lawsuit was filed in 2006 on behalf of the 4411 students who received an incorrect score on the sat 73 the classaction suit was settled in august 2007 when the college board and pearson educational measurement the company that scored the sats announced they would pay 285 million into a settlement fund under the agreement each student could either elect to receive 275 or submit a claim for more money if he or she felt the damage was greater 74 a similar scoring error occurred on a secondary school admission test in 2010–2011 when the erb  educational records bureau announced after the admission process was over that an error had been made in the scoring of the tests of 2010 17 of the students who had taken the independent school entrance examination for admission to private secondary schools for 2011 commenting on the effect of the error on students school applications in the new york times david clune president of the erb stated it is a lesson we all learn at some point—that life isnt fair 752008 changes  editas part of an effort to “reduce student stress and improve the testday experience in late 2008 the college board announced that the score choice option recently dropped for sat subject exams would be available for both the sat subject tests and the sat starting in march 2009 at the time some college admissions officials agreed that the new policy would help to alleviate student test anxiety while others questioned whether the change was primarily an attempt to make the sat more competitive with the act which had long had a comparable score choice policy 76 recognizing that some colleges would want to see the scores from all tests taken by a student under this new policy the college board would encourage but not force students to follow the requirements of each college to which scores would be sent 77 a number of highly selective colleges and universities including yale the university of pennsylvania cornell and stanford rejected the score choice option at the time 78 and continue to require applicants to submit all scores 79 others such as mit and harvard allow students to choose which scores they submit and use only the highest score from each section when making admission decisions still others such as oregon state university and university of iowa allow students to choose which scores they submit considering only the test date with the highest combined score when making admission decisions 792012 changes  editbeginning in 2012 test takers were required to submit a current recognizable photo during registration students are required to present their photo admission ticket – or another acceptable form of photo id – for admittance to their designated test center student scores and registration information including the photo provided are made available to the student’s high school in the event of an investigation involving the validity of a student’s test scores their photo may be made available to institutions to which they have sent scores any college that is granted access to a student’s photo is first required to certify that they are all admitted students 802016 changes including the return to a 1600point score  editon march 5 2014 the college board announced its plan to redesign the sat in order to link the exam more closely to the work high school students encounter in the classroom 7 the new exam was administered for the first time in march 2016 81 some of the major changes are an emphasis on the use of evidence to support answers a shift away from obscure vocabulary to words that students are more likely to encounter in college and career a math section that is focused on fewer areas a return to the 1600point score scale an optional essay and the removal of penalty for wrong answers rightsonly scoring 82 to combat the perceived advantage of costly test preparation courses the college board announced a new partnership with khan academy to offer free online practice problems and instructional videos 7name changes  editthe sat has been renamed several times since its introduction in 1926 it was originally known as the scholastic aptitude test 83 52 in 1990 a commission set up by the college board to review the proposed changes to the sat program recommended that the meaning of the initialism sat be changed to scholastic assessment test because a test that integrates measures of achievement as well as developed ability can no longer be accurately described as a test of aptitude 84 85 in 1993 the college board changed the name of the test to sat i reasoning test at the same time the name of the achievement tests was changed to sat ii subject tests 83 the reasoning test and subject tests were to be collectively known as the scholastic assessment tests according to the president of the college board at the time the name change was meant to correct the impression among some people that the sat measures something that is innate and impervious to change regardless of effort or instruction 86 the new sat debuted in march 1994 and was referred to as the scholastic assessment test by major news organizations 57 87 however in 1997 the college board announced that the sat could not properly be called the scholastic assessment test and that the letters sat did not stand for anything 88 in 2004 the roman numeral in sat i reasoning test was dropped making sat reasoning test the new name of the sat 83math–verbal achievement gap  editmain article math–verbal achievement gap in 2002 richard rothstein education scholar and columnist wrote in the new york times that the u s math averages on the sat and act continued their decadelong rise over national verbal averages on the tests 89reuse of old sat exams  editthe college board has been accused of completely reusing old sat papers previously given in the united states 90 the recycling of questions from previous exams has been exploited to allow for cheating on exams and impugned the validity of some students test scores according to college officials test preparation companies in asia have been found to provide test questions to students within hours of a new sat exams administration 91 92perception  editassociation with culture  editfor decades many critics have accused designers of the verbal sat of cultural bias as an explanation for the disparity in scores between poorer and wealthier testtakers 93 a famous and long past example of this bias in the sat i was the oarsman – regatta analogy question the object of the question was to find the pair of terms that had the relationship most similar to the relationship between runner and marathon the correct answer was oarsman and regatta the choice of the correct answer was thought to have presupposed students familiarity with rowing a sport popular with the wealthy however according to murray and herrnstein the blackwhite gap is smaller in cultureloaded questions like this one than in questions that appear to be culturally neutral 94 analogy questions have since been replaced by short reading passages association with family income  edita report from the new york times stated that family income can explain about 95 of the variance in sat scores 95 in response lisa wade contributor at the website the society pages commented that those with higher family income “tend to have better teachers more resourcerich educational environments more educated parents who can help them with school and sometimes expensive sat tutoring” 96 however university of california system research found that after controlling for family income and parental education the already low ability of the sat to measure aptitude and college readiness fell sharply while the more substantial aptitude and college readiness measuring abilities of high school gpa and the sat ii each remained undiminished and even slightly increased the university of california system required both the sat and the sat ii from applicants to the uc system during the four years included in the study they further found that after controlling for family income and parental education the socalled achievement tests known as the sat ii measure aptitude and college readiness 10 times higher than the sat 97 as with racial bias correlation with income could also be due to the social class of the makers of the test although according to the authors of the bell curve empirical research suggests that poorer students actually perform worse on questions the authors believed to be neutral compared to the ones they termed as privileged 98association with gender  editthis section needs expansion you can help by adding to it september 2015the largest association with gender on the sat is found in the math section where male students on average score higher than female students by approximately 30 points 99 in 2013 the american college testing board released a report stating that boys outperformed girls on the mathematics section of the test 100association with race and ethnicity  editafrican american hispanic and native american students on average perform an order of one standard deviation lower on the sat than white and asian students 101 102 103 104researchers believe that the difference in scores is closely related to the overall achievement gap in american society between students of different racial groups this gap may be explainable in part by the fact that students of disadvantaged racial groups tend to go to schools that provide lower educational quality this view is supported by evidence that the blackwhite gap is higher in cities and neighborhoods that are more racially segregated 105 it has also been suggested that stereotype threat has a significant effect on lowering achievement of minority students for example african americans perform worse on a test when they are told that the test measures verbal reasoning ability than when no mention of the test subject is made 106 other research cites poorer minority proficiency in key coursework relevant to the sat english and math as well as peer pressure against students who try to focus on their schoolwork  acting white  107 cultural issues are also evident among black students in wealthier households with high achieving parents john ogbu a nigerianamerican professor of anthropology found that instead of looking to their parents as role models black youth chose other models like rappers and did not put forth the effort to be a good student however they felt that racism was wrong 108one set of studies has reported differential item functioning – namely some test questions function differently based on the racial group of the test taker reflecting some kind of systematic difference in a groups ability to understand certain test questions or to acquire the knowledge required to answer them in 2003 freedle published data showing that black students have had a slight advantage on the verbal questions that are labeled as difficult on the sat whereas white and asian students tended to have a slight advantage on questions labeled as easy freedle argued that these findings suggest that easy test items use vocabulary that is easier to understand for white middle class students than for minorities who often use a different language in the home environment whereas the difficult items use complex language learned only through lectures and textbooks giving both student groups equal opportunities to acquiring it 109 110 111 the study was severely criticized by the ets board but the findings were replicated in a subsequent study by santelices and wilson in 2010 112 113there is no evidence that sat scores systematically underestimate future performance of minority students however the predictive validity of the sat has been shown to depend on the dominant ethnic and racial composition of the college 114 some studies have also shown that african american students underperform in college relative to their white peers with the same sat scores researchers have argued that this is likely because white students tend to benefit from social advantages outside of the educational environment for example high parental involvement in their education inclusion in campus academic activities positive bias from samerace teachers and peers which result in better grades 106christopher jencks concludes that as a group african americans have been harmed by the introduction of standardized entrance exams such as the sat this according to him is not because the tests themselves are flawed but because of labeling bias and selection bias the tests measure the skills that african americans are less likely to develop in their socialization rather than the skills they are more likely to develop furthermore standardized entrance exams are often labeled as tests of general ability rather than of certain aspects of ability thus a situation is produced in which african american ability is consistently underestimated within the education and workplace environments contributing in turn to selection bias against them which exacerbates underachievement 106dropping sat  edita growing number of colleges have joined the sat optional movement these colleges do not require the sat for admission one example of a college that did this is drew university in new jersey after they adopted an optional sat policy they had a 20 increase in applications dean of admissions mary beth carey says that our own research showed us that high school grade point average is by far the most important predictor of success in college the college reported that they accepted their most diverse class ever as a result of the policy 115in a 2001 speech to the american council on education richard c atkinson the president of the university of california urged dropping the sat as a college admissions requirement anyone involved in education should be concerned about how overemphasis on the sat is distorting educational priorities and practices how the test is perceived by many as unfair and how it can have a devastating impact on the selfesteem and aspirations of young students there is widespread agreement that overemphasis on the sat harms american education 116in response to threats by the university of california to drop the sat as an admission requirement the college entrance examination board announced the restructuring of the sat to take effect in march 2005 as detailed above in the 1960s and 1970s there was a movement to drop achievement scores after a period of time the countries states and provinces that reintroduced them agreed that academic standards had dropped students had studied less and had taken their studying less seriously they reintroduced the tests after studies and research concluded that the highstakes tests produced benefits that outweighed the costs 117iq studies  editfrey and detterman 2003 investigated associations of sat scores with intelligence test scores using an estimate of general mental ability or g based on the armed services vocational aptitude battery which can be best thought of as representing crystallized intelligence learned abilities they found sat scores to be highly correlated with g r82 in their sample 857 when adjusted for nonlinearity in their sample taken from a 1979 national probability survey additionally they investigated the correlation between sat results using the revised and recentered form of the test and scores on the ravens advanced progressive matrices a test of fluid intelligence reasoning this time using a nonrandom sample they found that the correlation of sat results with scores on the ravens advanced progressive matrices was 483 they estimated that this latter correlation would have been about 072 were it not for the restriction of ability range in the sample they also noted that there appeared to be a ceiling effect on the raven’s scores which may have suppressed the correlation 118 beaujean and colleagues 2006 have reached similar conclusions to those reached by frey and detterman 119preparation  editsat preparation is a highly lucrative field 120 the field was pioneered by stanley kaplan whose sat preparation course began in 1946 as a 64hour course 121 many companies and organizations offer test preparation in the form of books classes online courses and tutoring the test preparation industry began almost simultaneously with the introduction of university entrance exams in the u s and flourished from the start 122the college board maintains that the sat is essentially uncoachable and research by the college board and the national association of college admission counseling suggests that tutoring courses result in an average increase of about 20 points on the math section and 10 points on the verbal section 123 other studies have shown significantly different results a longitudinal study from ohio state showed that taking private sat prep classes correlated with scores higher by 60 points 124 a study from oxford showed that coaching courses boosted scores by an average of 56 points 122montgomery and lilly 2012 performed a systematic literature review of all published sat coaching research in search of high quality studies defined as those with randomized controlled trials  they found that the randomized treatments resulted in vm gains of 2332 points for a total of 56 the high quality study that showed the highest score increase was johnson 1984 san francisco which was based on a 30hour prep course that showed an average increase of 178 points the johnson san francisco study was also the only high quality study found on a prep course of 30 hours or more in length although validity of this outlier study is uncertain due to the attrition of half the participants 122use by highiq societies  editcertain high iq societies like mensa the prometheus society and the triple nine society use scores from certain years as one of their admission tests for instance the triple nine society accepts scores verbal and math combined of 1450 or greater on sat tests taken before april 1995 and scores of at least 1520 on tests taken between april 1995 and february 2005 125the sat is sometimes given to students younger than 13 by organizations such as the study of mathematically precocious youth johns hopkins center for talented youth duke tip and other organizations who use the results to select study and mentor students of exceptional ability writing section  editin 2005 mit writing director pavan sreekireddy plotted essay length versus essay score on the new sat from released essays and found a high correlation between them after studying over 50 graded essays he found that longer essays consistently produced higher scores in fact he argues that by simply gauging the length of an essay without reading it the given score of an essay could likely be determined correctly over 90 of the time he also discovered that several of these essays were full of factual errors the college board does not claim to grade for factual accuracy perelman along with the national council of teachers of english also criticized the 25minute writing section of the test for damaging standards of writing teaching in the classroom they say that writing teachers training their students for the sat will not focus on revision depth accuracy but will instead produce long formulaic and wordy pieces 126 youre getting teachers to train students to be bad writers concluded perelman 127see also  editact test a college entrance exam competitor to the satcollege admissions in the united states list of admissions tests psatnmsqtsat
