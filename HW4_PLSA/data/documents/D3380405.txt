journey towards a freedom that is not guaranteed to be there once you arrive in 2001 i went to my sentencing hearing and received a 16 year to life sentence for the crime of second degree murder this was an extremely harsh reality for someone who had never been to prison before i had almost no idea of what to expect and would be lying if i said i wasnt at least a little bit nervous i remember several of the men in the county jail warning me not to take a deal with life on the end of it because whether it was 7 to life 15 to life or 25 to life the governor was not letting lifers go and life would mean my whole life in the end i chose to go against their advice and accepted the district attorneys plea bargain offer for 16 to life this was an excruciating decision but it came down to the fact that no matter how badly i wanted to avoid prison i was guilty and knew it if i had taken it to trial and lost i might have wound up with 25 to life or even worse life without the possibility of parole there is no coming back from that one my 16 year to life sentence means that i must serve 16 years first and then i will start going in front of the board of prison terms to try to exhibit my suitability for parole the board looks at things like psychiatric evaluations disciplinary records supervisor reports vocational training education certificates selfhelp participationparole plansand letters of support they will also ask questions to determine if i have gained insight into the causative factors that led to my crime what ive done to address those issues and my plans for making sure it never happens again i learned very early on what an uphill climb lay in front of me from the other lifers who had already received several denials from the board for the most part the guys in the county had been right only a handful of lifers were being found suitable for release and even some of them had their dates taken back by a reversal of decision from the governor there was almost no light at the end of the tunnel but i made the decision to put my fate in gods hands and committed myself to doing everything in my power to prepare myself for a hearing that was still 16 years down the road for a lifer who is trying to earn his freedom and not all are because many are still caught up in their addictions and criminal thinking the margin for error is razor thin any rules violations from a fistfight to a dirty urinalysis test could be grounds for a parole board denial and add several years to your sentence ive even seen guys get written up for things like smoking or other minor things these infractions are documented in a lifers cfile and usually result in them receiving a denial currently the board is looking for a 5 to 10 year span of disciplinary free behavior before finding a lifer suitable for parole its definitely something to think about the next time your craving that cigarette when i first came into the system the parole board was issuing 1 to 5 year denials if you were close to being found suitable maybe youd receive a 1year denial which meant youd go back to the board and try again in a year if you were still screwing up see you in 5 years or somewhere in between then in 2008 california passed marsys law which extended denials to 3 5 7 10 and 15 years crazy a 1 year became a 3 yeara 2 became a 5 and so on imagine serving a 15 to life sentence and then going to the board and receiving a 15year denial thats equal to your time in the constitutionality of this law is being challenged in the courtsbecause it essentially lengthens prison sentences ex post facto i certainly dont understand it but nevertheless it has become just another hurdle a lifer must overcome i think the hardest part about serving a life sentence is not being able to tell your loved ones when youre coming home going in front of the parole board is a highly subjective process and as yet there is no magic formula for being found suitable ive seen lifers seemingly do everything right and still be denied for things like the nature of their crime this has also been ruled unconstitutional because the commitment of the crime is the one thing that a lifer doesnt have the power to change technically the parole board is supposed to base a lifers suitability on his time in and his current threat to society i know lifers with more than 30 years in on their sentences and i often wonder why theyre still here i was seven years into my own life sentence before i saw my first lifer go home his name was irish and it happened right here at san quentin honestly it was like witnessing a miracle because it made me believe that maybe all my hard work could result in me getting out one day since that time ive seen a multitude of lifers who have served their time and done the work go home im still surrounded by darkness but now i know that if i remain vigilant there is the light of freedom waiting for me at the end of the the journey all
