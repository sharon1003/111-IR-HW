science  mathematics botany what is the function of nucleus in plant and animal cell follow 4 answers answers relevance rating newest oldest best answer nucleus is a spherical body containing many organelles including the nucleolus the nucleus controls many of the functions of the cell by controlling protein synthesis and contains dna in chromosomes the nuclear envelope is composed of two membranes joined at regular intervals to form circular openings called nuclear pores the pores allow rna molecules and proteins modulating dna expression to move through the pores and into the cytosol the selection process is controlled by an energydependent process that alters the diameter of the pores in response to signals inside the nucleus dna and proteins associate to form a network of threads called chromatin the chromatin becomes vital at the time of cell division as it becomes tightly condensed thus forming the rodlike chromosomes with the enmeshed dna inside the nucleus is a filamentous region called the nucleolus this serves as a site where the rna and protein components of ribosomes are assembled the nucleolus is not membrane bound but rather just a region shivraj naik · 7 years ago0 0 1 comment nucleus function in animal cell source shttpsshrinkima9b cnmaughan · 2 years ago0 0 comment the nucleus is an organelle found in eukaryotic cells inside its fullyenclosed nuclear membrane it contains the majority of the cell s genetic material this material is organized as dna molecules along with a variety of proteins to form chromosomes the nucleus is made up of a double membrane nuclear envelope that keeps the entire organelle encased isolating its contents from the rest of the cell and the nucleoskeleton which supports the cell as a whole the nucleus maintains the security of the genes and controls the functions of the entire cell by regulating gene expression this is why the nucleus is sometimes referred to as the control center or the brain of the cell is the site for genetic marianne · 3 years ago0 0 comment although neither are related they do the same job they are there so when reproduction happens the male cell and the female cell both have a nucleus bond by the nucleus sammy leyton · 7 years ago0 1 commentit is not giving me answer my question is that nucleus of plant and animal cell are totally same or not · 4 years ago0 0 commentcentral part of living cell the central body usually spherical within a eukaryotic cell that is a membraneencased mass of protoplasm containing the chromosomes and other genetic information necessary to control cell growth and reproductionjvampirelover · 7 years ago0 0 commentit is called the control centerangie w · 4 years ago1 0 comment perhaps you would like to learn more about one of these look for franchises for sale looking for a new chandelier need a home security safe considering an online college
