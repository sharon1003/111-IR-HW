the tutorial demonstrates different techniques to quickly merge two cells in excel and combine multiple cells without losing data in excel 2016 2013 2010 and lower in your excel worksheets you may often need to merge two or more cells into one large cell for example you may want to combine several cells for a better data presentation or structure in other cases there may be too much content to be displayed in one cell and you decide to merge it with adjacent blank cells whatever the reason combining cells in excel is not as straightforward as it may seem if at least two cells you are trying to join contain data the standard excel merge cells feature will only keep the upperleft cell value and discard values in other cells but is there a way to merge cells in excel without losing data of course there is and further on in this tutorial you will find a few solutions that work in all versions of excel 2016 excel 2013 excel 2010 and lower excels merge  center feature merge two or more cells without losing data shortcut to merge cells in excel how to find merged cells how to unmerge cells alternatives to merging cells in excel combine cells using excels merge and center feature the fastest and easiest way to combine two or more cells in excel is to use the builtin merge and center option the whole process takes only 2 quick steps select the contiguous cells you want to combine on the home tab  alignment group click the merge  center in this example we have a list of fruits in cell a1 and we want to merge it with a couple of empty cells to the right b2 and c2 to create a large cell that fits the entire list once you click merge and center the selected cells will be combined into one cell and the text is centered like in the following screenshot other merging options in excel to access a couple more merge options provided by excel click the little dropdown arrow next to the merge  center button and choose the option you want from the dropdown menu merge across  combine the selected cells in each row individually merge cells  join the selected cells into a single cell without centering the text tip to change the text alignment after merging simply select the merged cell and click the desired alignment in the alignment group on the home tab excels merging features  limitations and specificities when using excels builtin features to combine cells there are a few things to keep in mind make sure that all the data you want to include in a merged cell is entered in the leftmost cell of the selected range because only the content of the upperleft cell will survive after merging data in all other cells will be deleted if you are looking to combine two or more cells with data in them check out how to merge cells without losing data if the merge and center button is greyed out most likely the selected cells are in edit mode press the enter key to cancel the edit mode and then try to merge cells none of standard excel merging options works for the cells inside an excel table you have to convert a table to a usual range first right click the table and select table  convert to range from the context menu and then combine the cells its not possible to sort a range containing both merged and unmerged cells how to merge cells in excel without losing data as already mentioned the standard excel merge features keep the content of the topleft cell only and although microsoft has made quite a lot of improvements in the recent versions of excel the merge cells functionality seems to have slipped out of their attention and this critical limitation persists even in excel 2013 and excel 2016 well where there is no obvious way there is a workaround method 1 combine cells within one column justify featurethis is a quick and easy method of merging cells keeping all their content however it requires that all the cells to be merged reside in one area in one column select all the cells you want to combine make the column wide enough to fit the contents of all cells on the home tab in the editing group click fill  this will move the contents of the selected cells to the topmost cell click merge and center or merge cells depending on whether you want the merged text to be centered or not if the combined values spread across two or more rows make the column a bit wider and repeat the process this merging technique is easy to use however it does have a number of limitations using justify you can only join cells in a single column it works for text only numerical values or formulas cannot be merged in this way it does not work if there are any blank cells in between the cells to be merged method 2 merge multiple cells with data in any range merge cells addinto be able to merge two or more cells in excel without losing data and without extra tricks we created a special tool  merge cells for excel using this addin you can quickly combine multiple cells containing any data types including text numbers dates and special symbols also you can separate the values with any delimiter of your choosing such as a comma space slash or line break to join cells exactly the way you want them configure the following options choose cells into one under  what to merge  select the delimiter under  separate values with  specify the cell where you want to place the result topleft topright bottomleft or bottomright make sure the merge all areas in the selection option is selected if this box is not checked the addin will work like the excel concatenate function ie combine the values without merging the cells apart from joining cells this tool can quickly merge rows and columns you just have to select the corresponding option in the  what to merge  dropdown list to give the merge cells addin a try you are welcome to download the evaluation version that works with excel 2016 2013 2010 2007 and 2003 method 3 use the concatenate function to combine two or multiple cells users who feel more comfortable with excel formulas may like this way to combine cells in excel you can employ the concatenate function or excel  operator to join the cells values first and then merge the cells if needed the detailed steps follow below supposing you want to combine two cells in your excel sheet a2 and b2 and both cells have data in them not to lose the value in the second cell during merging concatenate the two cells by using either of the following formulasconcatenate a2 b2a2 b2the formula however inserts the concatenated values in another cell if you do need to merge two cells with the original data a2 and b2 in this example then a few extra steps are required copy the cell with the concatenate formula d2 paste the copied value in the topleft cell of the range you want to merge a2 to do this right click the cell and select paste special  values from the context menu select the cells that you want to join a2 and b2 and click merge and center in a similar manner you can merge multiple cells in excel the concatenate formula will be just a little bit longer in this case an advantage of this approach is that you can separate values with different delimiters within a single formula for exampleconcatenate a2   b2   c2you can find more formula examples in the following tutorial  concatenate in excel combine text strings cells and columns shortcut for merging cells in excel if you merge cells in your excel worksheets on a regular basis you may find useful the following merge cells shortcut select the cells you want to merge press the alt key that provides access the commands on the excel ribbon and hold it until an overlay appears hit h to select the home tab press m to switch to merge  center press one of the following keys c to merge and center the selected cells a to merge cells in each individual row m to merge cells without centering at first sight the merge shortcut seems a bit longwinded but with a little practice you may find this way to combine cells faster than clicking the merge and center button with the mouse how to quickly find merged cells to find merged cells in your excel sheet perform the following steps press ctrl  f to open the find and replace dialog or click find  select  find on the find tab click options  format on the alignment tab select the merge cells box under text control and click ok finally click either find next to select the next merged cell or find all to find all merged cells on the sheet if you choose the latter microsoft excel will display a list of all found merged cells and let you navigate between them by selecting one of the merged cells in this list how to unmerge cells in excel if you changed your mind immediately after merging cells you can quickly unmerge them by pressing the shortcut ctrl  z or clicking the undo button on the quick access toolbar to split the previously merged cell select that cell and click merge  center or click the little arrow next to merge  center and select unmerge cells after unmerging the cells the entire contents will appear in the topleft cell alternatives to merging cells in excel it goes without saying that merged cells can help present the information in your excel worksheets in a better and more meaningful wayâ€¦ but they spawn numerous sideeffects that you may not be even aware of here are just a few examples you cant sort a column with merged cells neither auto fill nor fill flash feature works if a range of cells to be filled contains merged cells you cannot turn a range containing at least one merged cell into a fullfledged excel table let alone a pivot table so my advice would be to think twice before merging cells in excel and do this only when really needed for presentation or similar purposes eg to center the table title across the table if you want to combine cells somewhere in the middle of your excel sheet you may consider using the center across selection feature as an alternative select the cells that youd like to join b4 and c4 in this example press ctrl  1 to open the format cells switch to the alignment tab and select the center across selection option from the horizontal dropdown list and then click ok in terms of look the result is indistinguishable from the merged cell to prove that we did not really merge two cells we can select each one individually this is how you can combine two cells in excel or merge multiple cells
