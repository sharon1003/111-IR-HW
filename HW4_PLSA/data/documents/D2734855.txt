security council the u s the u k france russia china and germany reached what amounts to a temporary deal on iran’s controversial nuclear program for the next six months the iranians have agreed to halt any activity that could boost their ability to build a nuclear weapon and agreed as well to what seems to be rigorous new international inspections in return the u s and its allies will afford iran some relief — though the roughly 7 billion on offer is not much — to the crippling regime of international sanctions that has hobbled the iranian economy in recent years why is iran’s nuclear program considered such a threat iran’s nuclear program launched in the late 1950s with considerable american aid — at the time the country’s ruling monarchy was firmly in washington’s geopolitical camp that all ended when the 1979 revolution toppled the shah and ushered in the islamic republic thereafter successive iranian governments have insisted their nuclear program is intended entirely for peaceful civilian purposes and that they have no interest in building a bomb the west chiefly the u s and israel looks upon this claim with great skepticism  more not everyone’s happy hardliners in iran criticize geneva nuclear dealin the past decade tensions have deepened with former u s president george w bush lumping iran into the “axis of evil” and iranian counterpart mahmoud ahmadinejad earning notoriety for his bellicose rhetoric particularly when aimed at israel critics of tehran see it as a destabilizing force with unsavory friends propping up syrian president bashar assad and the powerful lebanese militant organization hizballah israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu has claimed repeatedly that an iranian nuclear weapon poses an existential threat to his country israel is believed to have waged a covert war against iran’s nuclear interests ranging from stealthmissile strikes to computer viruses to the assassination of iranian scientists nato justifies its own longrunning plan to build a european missile shield on the existence of an iranian nuclear threat finally an iranian nuclear weapon some analysts fear would spur an arms race in the middle east leading regional rivals like saudi arabia to pursue their own nuclear deterrents have other budding nuclear powers faced this scrutiny no not really it’s an open secret that israel already has nukes like israel india and pakistan are not signatories to the u n’s nonproliferation treaty on nuclear weapons iran is when the two south asian archrivals tested their own nuclear bombs in quick succession in 1998 it triggered a fair amount of international outrage and handwringing but that didn’t last too long — most glaringly the u s inked a potentially lucrative nuclearenergy deal with india in 2005 the spotlight shined on iran’s nuclear program has little to do with upholding international norms and much more with the realpolitik of the fractious middle east we keep hearing about uranium enrichment what’s that all about you have to enrich uranium for both reactors and bombs because natural uranium is mostly u238 which means the atoms have three extra neutrons in their nuclei but u238 nuclei don’t break apart or fission to use the technical term very easily that means they can’t generate a selfsustaining nuclear reaction to make that happen you need atoms of u235 which are more fissionable but also much rarer — less than 1 of a chunk of natural uranium by weight the most efficient way to boost the percentage of u235 is with a series of centrifuges that whirl uranium gas around at very high speeds some of the heavier u238 atoms are whipped out to the edges leaving the gas in the core slightly enriched with u235 then take out the enriched gas put it in another centrifuge and repeat the process until you get the purity you need  more israel renews warnings of military action after iran nuclear dealso what does the deal do to iran’s nuclear capabilities at least for the next six months iran will cease enrichment of uranium beyond 5 will not install new centrifuges in its facilities and will have to keep some of its existing centrifuges inactive iran has also agreed to dilute or convert into oxide its existing stockpile of uranium enriched at 20 the deal also puts a freeze on work at the heavy water reactor at arak and iran has agreed to a strict new regime of monitoring by the u n’s atomic energy agency that will make it much harder for the international community to be taken by surprise should the iranians attempt what is known as nuclear breakout what’s the difference between 5 or 20 or 90 enriched uranium uranium that’s been enriched to 5 is pure enough to be used in many types of powergenerating reactors some power reactors and some research reactors used to make radioactive isotopes for medical treatments need uranium enriched to 20 an atomic bomb requires much purer u235 — up to 90 enriched although some crude bombs can be made with slightly lowerenriched uranium this all applies to a conventional atomic bomb like the one dropped on hiroshima in 1945 a hydrogen bomb uses an atomic bomb as a trigger to ignite a much more powerful thermonuclear explosion a fusion not a fission reaction it’s important to note that it’s much more difficult to get from 1 u235 up to 20 than it is to get from 20 to 90 is it easy to dispose of enriched uranium stockpiles it’s laborious but not complicated you thoroughly mix enriched uranium with u238 until the percentage drops back down to natural levels once you’ve done that it’s just as tough to purify the uranium as it was the first time around what is plutonium then and is the process to use it different plutonium is an entirely different element from uranium but it’s radioactive as well and like u235 it’s fissionable so you can use it in bombs or reactors the bomb that the u s dropped on hiroshima used uranium the one that destroyed nagasaki used plutonium plutonium bombs are technically more difficult to manufacture the reason why the facility at arak concerns those who want to halt iran’s nuclear program is that it uses plutonium which is even more dangerous and toxic than uranium and an air strike on the arak plant would lead to unconscionable deadly fallout  more iranians celebrate nuclear dealso what does iran get in return for its concessions and cooperation some 42 billion of the less than 7 billion of sanction relief tendered to iran comes from the country’s own assets frozen in foreign banks moreover the grinding sanctions on iran’s oil exports and banking sector put into place by the e u remain almost totally intact the concessions involve loosening commercial restrictions on gold automobiles and pharmaceuticals as londonbased analyst shashank joshi puts it “iran will still be forfeiting over three times as much in foregone oil revenue as it will gain in relief” but what iran does come away with from geneva is an implicit recognition of its right to enrich uranium — a sticking point for a nation that stressed repeatedly ahead of the geneva talks the importance of recognizing iranian dignity and sovereignty given the celebrations that greeted the returning iranian negotiating team it’s clear many iranians welcome what is an important step away from the isolationist drift of the ahmadinejad years who’s unhappy with the deal not long after the deal was brokered late saturday night israel’s hawkish netanyahu deemed it a “historic mistake” the stock market in his own country seemed to disagree  though far less outspoken the largely sunni gulf states chiefly saudi arabia are wary of american rapprochement with iran a shi‘ite theocracy and main regional rival some reports suggest the saudis are poised to kickstart their own nuclear program perhaps with pakistani help congressional republicans have criticized the obama administration for being supposedly soft on an untrustworthy regime some hardliners in iran have also found cause to complain opposition factions in both tehran and washington could yet scuttle the whole process what changed in u siran relations for the deal to happen the surprise election of the moderate cleric hassan rouhani as president of iran earlier this year did much to dispel the bad odor left behind by eight years of ahmadinejad rouhani’s historic overtures to the u s that followed were received by a cautious yet willing obama administration and rouhani’s appointment of the suave former iranian ambassador to the u n mohammad javad zarif as the country’s foreign minister and lead nuclear negotiator proved crucial so too it seems were secret backchannel meetings between american and iranian officials in oman for the moment diplomacy and dialogue have won the day but the talks will have to continue — and trust between iran and its western interlocutors will have to deepen — before a lasting deal can be reached more the iran deal a humanizing
