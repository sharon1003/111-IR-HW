treated and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts if opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available risks from concomitant use with benzodiazepines or other cns depressants concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system cns depressants including alcohol may result in profound sedation respiratory depression coma and death reserve concomitant use for patients for whom

the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals proper dosing and titration of this drug are essential to reduce the risk of respiratory depression for patients receiving other opioid analgesics and switching to this drug it is safer to underestimate a patients 24hour oral requirement and provide rescue medication than overestimate and manage an adverse reaction there is substantial interpatient variation in the relative potency of different opioid drugs that conversion tables are not able to capture monitoring cardiovascular monitor for signs of hypotension upon initiating therapy and following dose increases especially those whose blood pressure is compromised respiratory monitor for respiratory depression especially within the first 24 to 72 hours of initiation and with dose increases gastrointestinal monitor for constipation and decreased bowel motility in postoperative patients general monitor routinely for maintenance of pain control and
