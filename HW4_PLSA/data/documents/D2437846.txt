date younger men55 women still value sexual compatibility and are pickiest daters by bianca london for mail online published 0637 edt 14 december 2012  updated 0700 edt 14 december 2012200view comments many of us look back on our dating past and wonder how on earth we could ever have considered romancing men so incompatible but new research has found that this is perfectly normal revealing that women’s tastes change as they get older andproving that there is indeed a ‘perfect man’ for every stage in a woman’s life from bright young things on the hunt for a hunk to ‘later daters’ looking for a cerebral soulmate the research shows that a woman’s age will often dictate the different characteristics they look for in a partner men of all ages the new infographic reveals that there is a perfect man for each stage of a womans life the research in matchcoms annual love geist report which tracks the nations changing attitudes towards dating and relationships also disproves the notion that standards drop later in life as women over 55 were shown to be most picky about who they date dr cecilia d’felice clinical psychologist and relationship expert at matchcom said it is natural that as women mature our tastes adjust to our developing expectations related articlesprevious 1 2 next smoking hot the velvet jacket is this seasons biggest prince harry crowned worlds coolest uncle and kate hasnt im the hobbits other half but after 11 years i still share this articlewhen younger looks predominate as we seek out someone with whom we want to share our genes but these surface attributes become less important as we look for depth and new experiences later in life so what makes a perfect man for each age in a woman’s life age 1824first and foremost young women want a man they can show off to their friends 47 per cent said they would look for a relationship with someone their friends would approve of they are also suckers for a sixpack 1824s are most willing to date a man in better physical shape than them shared tastes in music films and books are far more important at this age than later in life dr d’felice said when we first start dating we carry over the desire to fit in and belong from our adolescence and seek approval from our friends to validate our choices we are building confidence at this age and it’s important to us to know that we are choosing well age 2534as they forge ahead in their careers women at this age begin to take a more longterm view but are still susceptible to a dashing man physical attraction is more important than ever sexual compatibility is more important to 2534s than at any other stage in their lives ambition is also important with almost two thirds citing this as a key trait in a man dr d’felice said as we grow in confidence and invest in our own careers partners who are doing the same become very attractive to us and while we’re young and sexy it is natural that we want our dates to reflect this aspect of ourselves as well this mirroring of ambition and looks reflects these years when we are consolidating our persona working out who we are and what we want all about the pack six packs are a key criteria for women aged 1824 so kelly brooks boyfriend thom evans is a great fit ambition ambition is very important for the 2534s with almost two thirds citing this as a key trait in a man would successful richard branson qualify age 3544as they look to settle down women aged 3544 are most likely to have their head turned by an older man 73 per cent would be willing to date someone more than five years their senior social graces are also an absolute musthave at this stage in life less than 1 per cent of the females surveyed said they would date a man with bad manners dr d’felice priorities shift as we begin to think of commitment and family life men who are established stable successful and have life experience become very attractive to women at this age offering the depth of resources both material and emotional required for successful partnership age 4554security is a key concern with 95 per cent looking to find a partner with whom they felt secure finding a man with a high income is as important to this age group as any other women in this age range are less picky about who they date than any other in contrast to those just a few years younger women aged 4554 are most likely to considerdating a younger man 54 per cent would be willing to date someone more than five years younger dr d’felice said at this stage women are becoming increasingly confident with hormone levels changing they become more assertive experimenting more and celebrating their wisdom they are prepared to take risks and perhaps seek out new adventures they are not afraid to search for passion but still understand that feeling secure is a vital ingredient for happiness silver fox women between 3544 are happy to date someone five years older brad pitt fills this age gap perfectly cougar women over 45 are likely to opt for a younger man just like courtney coxs character in cougar town age 55in later life women look for more cerebral delights intelligence and shared values are more important to the over55s as is sharing a similar sense of humour but they don’t drop their standards as they get older in fact those aged 55 and over are pickier about who they romance than at any other age they also continue to value sexual compatibility 45 per cent strongly agreed that this was an important factor when forming a relationship dr d’felice said subtle shifts in development create a wellrounded perspective on relationships stressing the importance of friendship as well as sexual resonance these women take the longterm view that commitment requires humour intelligence and shared values to stand the test of time meaning they are not prepared to settle for anything else having experienced different relationships they know exactly what they want and importantly what they
