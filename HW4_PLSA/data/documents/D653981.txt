finding lucy don johanson describes finding the knee joint in hadar ethiopia that first indicated a bipedal hominid had lived 3 million years ago his subsequent expedition led to the discovery of lucy a 40 percent complete skeleton of a new species of hominid now known as australopithecus afarensis the final piece of the puzzle was a skull from the same site which clearly demonstrated that lucys kind were smallbrained although they walked upright credits Â© 2001 wgbh educational foundation and clear blue sky productions inc all rights reserved view in quick time  real player resource type video format quick time or real player length 4 min 33 sec topics covered human evolution backgrounder finding lucy what was the crucial change that set us on the path to becoming human our big brains with their capacity for language and making complex tools set us apart from other animals our ability to walk upright freeing our hands for other purposes also distinguishes us from other apes in darwins day and for many decades afterwards too few fossils had been found to solve the mystery of which came first to many people it seemed logical that our earliest ancestors must have been smarter than the average ape the first sign that there might be a different road to humanness came in the 1920s when raymond dart described the fossil skull known as the taung child the angle at which the childs spine had joined its skull suggested to dart that it had walked upright though its brain was not much bigger than that of a chimpanzee the question was not fully resolved for many years in 1973 when don johanson found a surprisingly humanlooking fossil knee at hadar in ethiopia that tuned out to be more than 3 million years old it was the one of the most compelling pieces of evidence yet found that our ancestors first stood up and did not get smart until much later the knee was much older than the earliest known stone tools the following year johansons team discovered another fossil that is still a landmark in the story of human origins lucy  named for the beatles song lucy in the sky with diamonds which was played in the camp when the scientists celebrated their discovery  was the most complete hominid skeleton that had been found up to that time although lucys skull was incomplete enough of it remained to show that she had a small apelike brain and other skulls of her species found at the same site confirmed it some experts argue that lucy was in some ways more adapted to walking upright than a modern human whose pelvis has to be a compromise between bipedal locomotion and the ability to give birth to large brained babies others point out that her arms were longer than a modern humans and the bones of her fingers were curved  features seen in treedwelling primates how much she used her climbing abilities or whether they were simply evolutionary leftovers from arboreal ancestors is a matter of debate although her hip and knee joints were less specialized for an upright posture than our own lucy was clearly capable of walking bipedally although running like a modern human was probably beyond her her funnel shaped ribcage and broad pelvis indicate that she probably had a rather large belly like a modern ape reflecting an adaptation to a relatively lowquality highbulk diet the thick waist this gave her would have hindered her flexibility and her high shoulders and the shape of her torso suggest it would have been difficult for her to swing her arms as we do we running because her skeleton was so complete lucy gave us an unprecedented picture of her kind in 1974 lucy showed that human ancestors were up and walking around long before the earliest stone tools were made or brains got bigger and subsequent fossil finds of much earlier bipedal hominids have confirmed that conclusion bipedalism it seems was the first step towards becoming human
