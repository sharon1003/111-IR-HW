need are smooth rocks that you find or buy regular acrylic craft paint varnish and brushes you can start with a simple ladybug and work your way up to more realistic dog and cat rocks i started painting rocks in 1999 after buying a book called painting animals on rocks by lin wellford i was intrigued that something so simple and unusual as a rock could be turned into an animal i had the desire and passion to learn how to turn rocks into 3d animals you actually take the whole rock and make it look like an animal it helps to have the correct shape of a rock for some animals but the easy to find round or oval shaped rocks make great cats dogs and other animals i created my rock painting web site pet a rock to share pictures of rocks i painted and provide information called how to paint — step by step pictures for the beginner i took stepbystep photos of how to paint a rock and typed up instructions for various projects youll find free instructions for a raccoon hosta plant colt rabbits gnome hut house barn daisy plant and skunks i also have sections called books to help you paint how to repair a damaged rock and supplies for rock painting although i have a lot of free information on my web site to help anyone learn to paint rocks i also wrote a rock painting tips book for those who want extra information along with rock painting i started collecting memorabilia related to the old 70s pet rock there is a section showing pictures of the original pet rock the manual it came with and morerock painting has allowed me to make a nice little home business for myself once i felt confident and built up my inventory of painted rocks i started selling them at craft shows before long people asked if i could paint their pet on a rock since my goal was always to be able to do custom pet orders someday i nervously accepted my first order the customer sent me photos of their pet and i painted it on a rock with the help of my digital camera and the internet im able to send my customers progress photos of their pets as im painting them this allows me to make any changes per the customers suggestions if they have any once they approve the finished rock they make payment and i mail it off currently i get most of my orders from my web site so i have slowed down on the craft shows my favorite part of my web site is now the your pet section it shows all the pets i have painted for customers along side the photos that were sent to me for reference so if rock painting sounds interesting to you check out my web site at wwwpetarockcom •updated 7714
