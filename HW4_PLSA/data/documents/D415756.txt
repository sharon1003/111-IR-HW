hypothyroidism more informationiodine i a nonmetallic trace element is required by humans for the synthesis of thyroid hormones iodine deficiency is an important health problem throughout much of the world most of the earths iodine in the form of the iodide ion i   is found in oceans and iodine content in the soil varies with region the older an exposed soil surface the more likely the iodine has been leached away by erosion mountainous regions such as the himalayas atlas andes and alps flooded river valleys such as the ganges river plain in india and many inland regions such as central asia and africa central and eastern europe and the midwestern region of north america are among the most severely iodinedeficient areas in the world 1  function iodine is an essential component of the thyroid hormones triiodothyronine t 3 and thyroxine t 4  and is therefore essential for normal thyroid function to meet the bodys demand for thyroid hormones the thyroid gland traps iodine from the blood and incorporates it into the large 660 k da glycoprotein thyroglobulin the hydrolysis of thyroglobulin by lysosomal enzymes gives rise to thyroid hormones that are stored and released into the circulation when needed in target tissues such as the liver and the brain t 4 the most abundant circulating thyroid hormone can be converted to t 3 by selenium containing enzymes known as iodothyronine deiodinases dios  figure 1 see also nutrient interactions  t 3 is the physiologically active thyroid hormone that can bind to thyroid receptors in the nuclei of cells and regulate gene expression in this manner thyroid hormones regulate a number of physiologic processes including growth development metabolism and reproductive function 2 figure 1  click to enlargethe regulation of thyroid function is a complex process that involves the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland in response to thyrotropinreleasing hormone trh secretion by the hypothalamus the pituitary gland secretes thyroidstimulating hormone tsh which stimulates iodine trapping thyroid hormone synthesis and release of t 4 and t 3 by the thyroid gland the presence of adequate circulating t 4 and t 3 feeds back at the level of both the hypothalamus and pituitary decreasing trh and tsh production  figure 2  when circulating t 4 levels decrease the pituitary gland increases its secretion of tsh resulting in increased iodine trapping as well as increased production and release of both t 3 and t 4 iodine deficiency results in inadequate production of t 4 in response to decreased blood t 4 concentrations the pituitary gland increases its output of tsh persistently elevated tsh levels may lead to hypertrophy enlargement of the thyroid gland also known as goiter see deficiency 3 figure 2  click to enlargedeficiency the thyroid gland of a healthy adult concentrates 7080 of a total body iodine content of 1520 mg and utilizes about 80 μg of iodine daily to synthesize thyroid hormones in contrast chronic iodine deficiency can result in a dramatic reduction of the iodine content in the thyroid well below 1 mg 1 iodine deficiency is recognized as the most common cause of preventable brain damage in the world the spectrum of iodine deficiency disorders idd includes mental retardation hypothyroidism goiter and varying degrees of other growth and developmental abnormalities 4 the world health organization who estimated that over 30 of the world’s population 2 billion people have insufficient iodine intake as measured by median urinary iodine concentrations below 100 μgl 5 moreover about onethird of schoolage children 612 years old worldwide 241 million children in 2011 have insufficient iodine intake 6 7 major international efforts have produced dramatic improvements in the correction of iodine deficiency in the 1990s mainly through the use of iodized salt in iodinedeficient countries 4 although about 70 of households in the world now have access to iodized salt 8 mildtomoderate iodine deficiency remains a public health concern in at least 30 countries there are no iodine excretion data available for 42 other countries including israel syria and sierra leone 7 for more information on the international effort to eradicate iodine deficiency visit the websites of the iodine global network formerly the international council for the control of iodine deficiency disorders and the who biomarkers of iodine status more than 90 of ingested iodine is excreted in the urine within 2448 hours such that daily iodine intakes in a population can be extrapolated from measures of median spot urinary iodine concentrations 9 10 according to who criteria population iodine deficiency is defined by median urinary iodine concentrations lower than 150 micrograms μgl for pregnant women and 100 μgl for all other groups  table 1  adequate intakes correspond to median urinary iodine concentrations of 100199 μgl in schoolage children and 150249 μgl in pregnant women  table 1  while median urinary iodine concentration is a population indicator of recent dietary iodine intake multiple collections of 24hour urinary iodine are preferable to estimate intake in individuals 911 table 1 who criteria for assessment of iodine nutrition through populationbased median urinary iodine concentrations 4population group medianrange of urinary iodine concentrations μgl

in breastfeeding women see the rda  the numbers for median urinary excretion concentrations are lower than one would expect because iodine is also excreted in breast milk in many countries serum tsh concentration is used in the screening for congenital hypothyroidism in newborns newborn tsh can be used as an indicator of population iodine status yet in older children and adults serum tsh is not a sensitive indicator of iodine status as concentrations are usually maintained within a normal range despite frank iodine deficiency 12 serum thyroglobulin concentration in schoolage children is a sensitive marker of iodine status in populations 13 in areas of endemic goiter changes in thyroid size reflect longterm iodine nutrition months to years assessment of the goiter rate in a population is used to define the severity of iodine deficiency as well as to monitor the longterm impact of sustained salt iodization programs 4 10 finally serum thyroid hormone concentrations do not adequately reflect iodine nutrition in populations 1 iodine deficiency disorders all the adverse effects of iodine deficiency in animals and humans are collectively termed iodine deficiency disorders reviewed in 1  thyroid enlargement or goiter is one of the earliest and most visible signs of iodine deficiency it is a physiologic adaptation of the thyroid gland in response to persistent stimulation by tsh see function  in mild iodine deficiency thyroid enlargement may be enough to maximize the uptake of available iodine and provide the body with sufficient thyroid hormones yet large goiters can obstruct the trachea and esophagus and damage the recurrent laryngeal nerves more severe cases of iodine deficiency result in impaired thyroid hormone synthesis known as hypothyroidism adequate iodine intake will generally reduce the size of goiters but the reversibility of the effects of hypothyroidism depends on an individuals life stage iodine deficiencyinduced hypothyroidism has adverse effects in all stages of development but is most damaging to the developing brain in addition to regulating many aspects of growth and development thyroid hormones are important for the migration proliferation and differentiation of specific neuronal populations the overall architecture of the brain’s cortex the formation of axonal connections and the myelination of the central nervous system which occurs both before and shortly after birth reviewed in 14  the effects of iodine deficiency at different life stages are discussed below pregnancy and lactation daily iodine requirements are significantly increased in pregnant and breastfeeding women because of 1 the increased thyroid hormone production and transfer to the fetus in early pregnancy before the fetal thyroid gland becomes functional 2 iodine transfer to the fetus during late gestation 3 increased urinary iodine excretion and 4 iodine transfer to the infant via breast milk see also the rda 12 15 during pregnancy the size of the thyroid gland is increased by 10 in women residing in iodinesufficient regions and increased by 2040 in those living in iodinedeficient regions 16 iodine deficiency during pregnancy can result in hypothyroidism in women maternal hypothyroidism has been associated with increased risk for preeclampsia miscarriage stillbirth preterm birth and lowbirthweight infants reviewed in 16  in addition severe iodine deficiency during pregnancy may result in congenital hypothyroidism and neurocognitive deficits in the offspring see prenatal development 12 iodinedeficient women who are breastfeeding may not be able to provide sufficient iodine to their infants who are particularly vulnerable to the effects of iodine deficiency see newborns and infants 17 a daily prenatal supplement of 150 μg of iodine as recommended by the american thyroid association ata 16 will help to ensure that us pregnant and breastfeeding women consume sufficient iodine during these critical periods in iodinedeficient areas where iodized salt is not available the iodine global network ign formerly the international council for the control of iodine deficiency disorders the world health organization who and unicef recommend that lactating women receive a single annual dose of 400 mg of iodine or 250 μgday and exclusively breastfeed for at least six months when breastfeeding is not possible direct supplementation of the infant 2 years old with a single annual dose of 200 mg of iodine or 90 μgday is advised 4 a randomized and placebo controlled trial recently demonstrated that maternal supplementation with a single 400mg dose of iodine improved the iodine status of breastfed infants more efficiently than direct infant supplementation with a single 100 mgdose of iodine for a period of at least six months 18 yet supplementation of lactating women failed to increase maternal urinary iodine concentrations above 100 μgl suggesting that supplemented mothers remained deficient in iodine 18 prenatal development fetal iodine deficiency is caused by iodine deficiency in the mother see pregnancy and lactation  during pregnancy before the fetal thyroid gland becomes functional at 1620 weeks’ gestation maternal thyroxine t 4 crosses the placenta to promote normal embryonic and fetal development hence maternal iodine deficiency and hypothyroidism can result in adverse pregnancy complications including fetal loss placental abruption preeclampsia preterm delivery and congenital hypothyroidism in the offspring 16 the effects of maternal hypothyroidism on the offspring depend on the timing and severity of in utero iodine deficiency a severe form of congenital hypothyroidism may lead to cretinism a condition associated with irreversible mental retardation the clinical picture of neurological cretinism in the offspring includes severe mental and physical retardation deafness mutism and motor spasticity a myxedematous form of cretinism has been associated with coexisting iodine and selenium deficiency in central africa see nutrient interactions and is characterized by a less severe degree of mental retardation than in neurological cretinism yet affected individuals exhibit all the features of severe hypothyroidism including severe growth retardation and delayed sexual maturation 12 two longitudinal cohort studies one in the uk and one in australia recently observed that even mildtomoderate iodine deficiency during pregnancy was associated with reduced scores of iq and various measures of literacy performance in children 8 to 9 years of age 19 20  newborns and infants up to one year of ageinfant mortality is higher in areas of severe iodine deficiency than in iodine replete regions and several studies have demonstrated an increase in childhood survival upon correction of the iodine deficiency 8 21 22 infancy is a period of rapid brain growth and development sufficient thyroid hormone which depends on adequate iodine intake is essential for normal brain development even in the absence of congenital hypothyroidism iodine deficiency during infancy may result in abnormal brain development and consequently impaired intellectual development 23 24 children and adolescents iodine deficiency in children and adolescents is often associated with goiter the incidence of goiter peaks in adolescence and is more common in girls than boys schoolage children in iodinedeficient areas show poorer school performance lower iqs and a higher incidence of learning disabilities than matched groups from iodinesufficient areas three metaanalyses of mainly crosssectional studies concluded that chronic iodine deficiency was associated with reduced mean iq scores by 7135 points in participants primarily children 2527 however these observational studies did not distinguish between iodine deficiency during pregnancy and during childhood and such observational studies may be confounded by social economic and educational factors that influence child development adults inadequate iodine intake may also result in goiter and hypothyroidism in adults although the effects of hypothyroidism are more subtle in the brains of adults than children research suggests that hypothyroidism results in poor social and economic achievements due to low educability apathy and reduced work productivity 28 other symptoms of hypothyroidism in adults include fatigue weight gain cold intolerance and constipation finally because iodine deficiency induces an increase in the iodine trapping capacity of the thyroid iodinedeficient individuals of all ages are more susceptible to radiationinduced thyroid cancer see disease prevention  as well as to iodineinduced hyperthyroidism after an increase in iodine intakes see safety 2 individuals and populations at risk of iodine deficiency while the risk of iodine deficiency for populations living in iodinedeficient areas without adequate iodine fortification programs is well recognized concerns have been raised that certain subpopulations in countries considered iodinesufficient may not consume adequate iodine 7 29 the greater use of methods assessing iodine status see biomarkers of iodine status has shown that iodine deficiency also occurs in areas where the prevalence of goiter is low in coastal areas in highly developed countries and in regions where iodine deficiency was previously eliminated 4 the us is currently considered to be iodinesufficient yet in recent years dietary intakes of iodine in the us population have decreased data from the latest us national health and nutrition examination survey nhanes 20092010 indicated that the median urinary iodine concentration for the general population was 144 μgl compared to 164 μgl reported in previous assessments nhanes 20052006 and 20072008 30 31 in addition to regional differences across the us ethnic variations have been found in all age groups median urinary iodine concentrations were shown to be lower in african americans than in hispanics and caucasians in addition median urinary iodine concentrations in nonpregnant women of childbearing age and pregnant women indicate that mild iodine deficiency has reemerged in the us in recent years 31 nonpregnant women data from us nhanes 20072010 indicated that 373 of nonpregnant women ages 1544 years had urinary iodine concentrations lower than 100 μgl reflecting potentially insufficient iodine intakes see biomarkers of iodine status 31 only onefifth of nonpregnant women reported using iodinecontaining supplements in an earlier nhanes 20012006 32 yet adequate intakes of iodine in women of childbearing age 150 μgday see the rda are essential for optimum stores of iodine especially if they are considering pregnancy some experts suggested a daily consumption of 250 μg of iodine before conception to ensure adequate thyroid hormone production and iodine supply to the embryo and fetus during pregnancy see pregnancy and lactation 12 pregnant women there are no statistics on the global burden of iodine deficiency in pregnant women but national and regional data suggest that this group is especially vulnerable given the increased iodine requirements during pregnancy the median urinary iodine concentration should be at least of 150 μgl see biomarkers of iodine status  pooled data from nhanes 20052010 reported that us pregnant women had a median urinary iodine concentration of 129 μgl and the lowest median concentration 109 μgl was observed during the first trimester of gestation when the embryofetus relies exclusively on maternal thyroid hormones 31 breastfeeding women while data regarding the iodine status of breastfeeding women in the us are limited dietary intakes that were inadequate during pregnancy are likely to be insufficient in a significant fraction of breastfeeding women 33 34 a systematic review of the literature recently reported suboptimal dietary iodine intakes in breastfeeding women in some countries with a mandatory fortification program including denmark australia and india 35 the american thyroid association ata recommends that all north american women who are pregnant or breastfeeding supplement their dietary iodine intake with 150 μgday of iodine 36 breastfed and weaning infants the body of a healthy newborn contains only about 300 μg of iodine which makes newborns extremely vulnerable to iodine deficiency 28 and breastfed infants are entirely reliant on maternal iodine intakes for thyroid hormonesynthesis even in areas covered by a salt iodization program weaning infants are at high risk of iodine deficiency especially if they are not receiving iodinecontaining infant formula 17 individuals consuming special diets diets that exclude iodized salt fish and seaweed have been found to contain very little iodine 9 individuals consuming branded weightloss foods may also be at risk of inadequate intakes 37 a small us crosssectional study in 78 vegetarians and 63 vegans reported median urinary iodine concentrations of 147 μgl and 785 μgl respectively suggesting inadequate iodine intakes among vegans 38 two cases of goiter andor hypothyroidism have also been recently reported in children following restrictive diets to control esophagealinflammation eosinophilic esophagitis 39 or allergies 40 patients requiring parenteral nutrition although iodine is usually not added to parenteral nutrition pn solutions topical iodinecontaining disinfectants and other adventitious sources provide substantial amounts of iodine to some pn patients such that the occurrence of iodine deficiency is unlikely yet deficiency might occur especially in preterm infants with limited body stores if chlorhexidinebased antiseptics replace iodinated antiseptics 28 41 nutrient interactions concurrent deficiencies in selenium iron or vitamin a may exacerbate the effects of iodine deficiency reviewed in 42  selenium while iodine is an essential component of thyroid hormones the selenium containing iodothyronine deiodinases dios are enzymes or selenoenzymes required for the conversion of t 4 to the biologically active thyroid hormone t 3 see the article on selenium  dio1 activity may also be involved in regulating iodine homeostasis 43 in addition glutathione peroxidases are selenoenzymes that protect the thyroid gland from hydrogen peroxideinduced damage during thyroid hormone synthesis 44 a randomized placebo controlled study in 151 pregnant women at risk of developing autoimmune thyroid disease found that selenium supplementation 200 μgday in the form of selenomethionine at 12 weeks of gestation until 12 months’ postpartum reduced the risk of thyroid dysfunction and permanent hypothyroidism 45 however another trial the selenium in pregnancy intervention trial found no benefit of selenium supplementation 60 μgday from 1214 weeks of gestation to delivery over placebo on circulating autoantibody concentrations in pregnant women mildly deficient in iodine 46 the epidemiology of coexisting iodine and selenium deficiencies in central africa has been linked to the prevalence of myxedematous cretinism a severe form of congenital hypothyroidism accompanied by mental and physical retardation selenium deficiency may be only one of several undetermined factors that might exacerbate the detrimental effects of iodine deficiency 42 besides results from randomized controlled intervention trials have shown that correcting only the selenium deficiency may have a deleterious effect on thyroid hormone metabolism in schoolage children with coexisting selenium and iodine deficiency 47 48 finally selenium deficiency in rodents was found to have little impact on dio activities as it appears that selenium is being supplied in priority for adequate synthesis of dios at the expense of other selenoenzymes 44  iron severe iron deficiency anemia can impair thyroid metabolism in the following ways 1 by altering the tsh response of the pituitary gland 2 by reducing the activity of thyroid peroxidase that catalyzes the iodination of thyroglobulin for the production of thyroid hormones and 3 in the liver by limiting the conversion of t 4 to t 3 increasing t 3 turnover and decreasing t 3 binding to nuclear receptors 49 it is estimated that goiter and irondeficiency anemia coexist in up to 25 of schoolage children in west and north africa 42 a randomized controlled study in irondeficient children with goiter showed a greater reduction in thyroid size following the consumption of iodized salt together with 60 mgday of iron four times per week compared to placebo 50 additional interventions have confirmed that correcting irondeficiency anemia improved the efficacy of iodine supplementation to mitigate thyroid disorders reviewed in 42 49  vitamin ain north and west africa vitamin a deficiency and iodine deficiencyinduced goiter may coexist in up to 50 of children vitamin a status like other nutritional factors appears to influence the response to iodine prophylaxis in iodinedeficient populations 51 vitamin a deficiency in animal models was found to interfere with the pituitary  thyroid axis by 1 increasing the synthesis and secretion of thyroidstimulating hormone tsh by the pituitary gland 2 increasing the size of the thyroid gland 3 reducing iodine uptake by the thyroid gland and impairing the synthesis and iodination of thyroglobulin and 4 increasing circulating concentrations of thyroid hormones reviewed in 52  a crosssectional study of 138 children with concurrent vitamin a and iodine deficiencies found that the severity of vitamin a deficiency was associated with higher risk of goiter and higher concentrations of circulating tsh and thyroid hormones 51 these children received iodineenriched salt together with vitamin a 200000 iu at baseline and at 5 months or a placebo in a randomized doubleblind 10month trial vitamin a supplementation significantly decreased tsh concentration and thyroid volume compared to placebo 51 in another trial vitamin a supplementation alone without iodine to iodinedeficient children reduced the volume of the thyroid gland as well as tsh and thyroglobulin concentrations 53 yet supplemental vitamin a had no additional effect on thyroid functionhormone metabolism when children were also given iodized oil goitrogens some foods contain substances that interfere with iodine utilization or thyroidhormone production these substances are called goitrogens the occurrence of goiter in the democratic republic of congo has been related to the consumption of cassava which contains linamarin a compound that is metabolized to thiocyanate and blocks thyroidal uptake of iodine 1 in iodinedeficient populations tobacco smoking has been associated with an increased risk for goiter 54 55 cyanide in tobacco smoke is converted to thiocyanate in the liver placing smokers with low iodine intake at risk of developing a goiter moreover thiocyanate affects iodine transport into the lactating mammary gland leading to low iodine concentrations in breast milk and impaired iodine supply to the neonatesinfants of smoking mothers 2 some species of millet sweet potatoes beans and cruciferous vegetables eg cabbage broccoli cauliflower and brussels sprouts also contain goitrogens 1 further the soybean isoflavones genistein and daidzein have been found to inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis 56 most of these goitrogens are not of clinical importance unless they are consumed in large amounts or there is coexisting iodine deficiency industrial pollutants such as perchlorate see safety  resorcinol and phthalic acid may also be goitrogenic 1 57 the recommended dietary allowance rdathe rda for iodine was reevaluated by the food and nutrition board fnb of the institute of medicine iom in 2001  table 2  the recommended amounts were calculated using several methods including the measurement of iodine uptake in the thyroid glands of individuals with normal thyroid function 9 similar recommendations have been made by several organizations including the american thyroid association ata 16 58 the world health organization who the iodine global network ign formerly the international council for the control of iodine deficiency disorders and the united nations

released into the environment as a result of nuclear reactor accidents such as the 1986 chernobyl nuclear accident in ukraine and the 2011 fukushima daiichi nuclear accident in japan thyroid accumulation of radioactive iodine increases the risk of developing thyroid cancer especially in children 59 the increased iodine trapping activity of the thyroid gland in iodine deficiency results in increased thyroid accumulation of radioactive iodine  131 i thus iodinedeficient individuals are at increased risk of developing radiationinduced thyroid cancer because they will accumulate greater amounts of radioactive iodine potassium iodide administered in pharmacologic doses up to 130 mg for adults within 48 hours before or eight hours after radiation exposure from a nuclear reactor accident can significantly reduce thyroid uptake of 131 i and decrease the risk of radiationinduced thyroid cancer 60 the prompt and widespread use of potassium iodide prophylaxis in poland after the 1986 chernobyl nuclear reactor accident may explain the lack of a significant increase in childhood thyroid cancer compared to fallout areas where potassium iodide prophylaxis was not widely used 61 in the us the nuclear regulatory commission nrc requires that consideration be given to potassium iodide as a protective measure for the general public in the case of a major release of radioactivity from a nuclear power plant 62 see also the us fda’s potassium iodide information disease treatment fibrocystic breast changes fibrocystic breast changes constitute a benign noncancerous condition of the breasts characterized by lumpiness and discomfort in one or both breasts cyst formation and fibrous changes in the appearance of breast tissue occur in at least 50 of premenopausal women and are not usually associated with an increased risk of breast cancer 63 the cause of fibrocystic changes is not known but variations in hormonal stimulation during menstrual cycles may trigger changes in breast tissue 63 a few observational studies also suggested an association between benign breast diseases including but not limited to fibrocystic changes and thyroid disorders recently a small casecontrol study 166 cases vs 72 controls showed that the frequency of benign breast diseases was greater in women with nodular goiter 549 or hashimoto thyroiditis 474 than in euthyroid controls 292 64 conversely the prevalence of antithyroid autoimmunity and hypothyroidism was found to be significantly higher in women with benign breast diseases compared to controls 65 66 interestingly correcting hypothyroidism with supplemental t 4 was found to improve some of the benign breast disease symptoms including breast pain mastalgia and nipple discharge 65 in estrogen treated rats iodine deficiency leads to changes similar to those seen in fibrocystic breasts while iodine repletion reverses those changes 67 an uncontrolled study of 233 women with fibrocystic changes found that treatment with aqueous molecular iodine i 2 at a dose of 008 mg of i 2 kg of body weight daily over 6 to 18 months was associated with improvement in pain and other symptoms in over 70 of participants 68 about 10 of the study participants reported side effects that were described by the investigators as minor a doubleblind placebo controlled trial of aqueous molecular iodine 007009 mg of i 2 kg of body weight daily for six months in 56 women with fibrocystic changes found that 65 of the women taking molecular iodine reported improvement compared to 33 of those taking the placebo 68 a doubleblind placebocontrolled trial in 87 women with documented breast pain reported that molecular iodine 15 3 or 6 mgday for six months improved overall pain 69 in this study 385 of the women receiving 15 mgday 379 of those receiving 3 mgday and 517 of those receiving 6 mgday reported at least a 50 reduction in selfassessed breast pain compared to 83 in the placebo group largescale controlled clinical trials are needed to determine the therapeutic value of molecular iodine in fibrocystic breasts besides the doses of iodine used in these studies 15 to 6 mgday for a 60 kg person are higher than the tolerable upper intake level  ul recommended by the food and nutrition board of the institute of medicine and should only be used under medical supervision see safety  sources food sources data from the ongoing us total diet study which monitors the levels of some contaminants and nutrients in food products indicates that dietary iodine intakes in adults range between 138 and 268 micrograms μgday considerably higher average intakes 304353 μgday of iodine were reported for boys 14 to 16 years of age 70 seafood is rich in iodine because marine animals can concentrate the iodine from seawater certain types of edible seaweed eg wakame are also very rich in iodine 71 the iodine content of food that is grown or raised on a particular soil depends on the iodine content of this soil in the us dairy products contribute up to 90 of total estimated iodine intakes in infants at least 70 in children ages 210 years 5363 in adolescents ages 1416 years and about 50 in adults 70 in the uk and northern europe iodine levels in dairy products tend to be lower in summer when cattle are allowed to graze in pastures with low soil iodine content 9 other good sources of dietary iodine include eggs fruit grain products and poultry 70 processed foods can contribute to iodine intake if iodized salt or food additives such as calcium iodate and potassium iodate are added during production yet in the us virtually no iodized salt is used in the manufacturing of processed food and fast food products and the food industry is not required to list the iodine content on food packaging 72 table 3 lists the iodine content of some iodinerich foods in micrograms μg because the iodine content of foods can vary considerably these values should be considered approximate 73 table

provides 150 μg of iodine although most people in the us consume sufficient iodine in their diets see sources  an additional 150 μgday is unlikely to result in excessive iodine intake the american thyroid association ata recommends prenatal supplementation with 150 μgday of iodine and advises against the ingestion of ≥500 μgday of iodine from iodine potassium iodine and kelp supplements for children and adults and during pregnancy and lactation see also safety 36 74 iodine fortification programs the fortification of salt with iodine is a feasible and inexpensive method to eliminate iodine deficiency and salt iodization programs have been implemented in almost all countries in north america salt fortification with iodine is mandated in canada and some parts of mexico but only voluntary in the us such that only 52 of us table salt is iodized and only onefifth of the total salt consumed in the us is iodized 72 75 potassium iodide ki cuprous iodide cu i and potassium iodate kio 3 are used to iodize salt the us food and drug administration fda recommends between 46 and 76 μg of iodine per gram of salt in iodized salt however the recent analysis of 88 us iodized foodgrade salt samples revealed that the iodine content was below the recommended range in 52 of the samples and above the range in 7 of the samples 76 in other countries salt commonly contains 2050 μg of iodine per gram of salt depending on local regulations 76 in countries like denmark 77 australia 78 79 and new zealand 80 the use of iodized salt in the breadmaking process is mandated additional approaches have been explored including sugar fortification 81 egg fortification 82 use of iodized salt in the preparation of fermented fish and fish sauce 83 and use of iodinerich crop fertilizers 84 in addition fortification of livestock feeds with iodine and the use of iodophors for sanitation during milking contribute to increasing iodine content in dairy products 85 finally annual doses of iodized vegetable oil are administered orally or intramuscularly to individuals in iodinedeficient populations who do not have access to iodized salt 4 56 safety acute toxicity acute iodine poisoning is rare and usually occurs only with doses of many grams symptoms of acute iodine poisoning include burning of the mouth throat and stomach fever nausea vomiting diarrhea a weak pulse cyanosis and coma 1 excessive iodine intakes risk of iodineinduced hyperthyroidism in iodinedeficient individuals iodine supplementation programs in iodinedeficient populations have been associated with an increased incidence of iodineinduced hyperthyroidism iih especially in older people with multinodular goiter 86 iodine intakes of 150200 μgday have been found to increase the incidence of iih in iodinedeficient populations iodine deficiency increases the risk of developing autonomous thyroid nodules that are unresponsive to tsh control see function  these autonomous nodules may then overproduce thyroid hormones in response to sudden iodine supply iih symptoms include weight loss tachycardia high pulse rate muscle weakness and skin warmth iih can be dangerous in individuals with underlying heart disease yet because the primary cause of nodular goiter and iih is chronic iodine deficiency the benefit of iodization programs largely outweighs the risk of iih in iodinedeficient populations 1 risk of hypothyroidism in iodinesufficient individuals in iodinesufficient individuals excess iodine intake is most commonly associated with elevated blood concentrations of thyroid stimulating hormone tsh that inhibit thyroid hormone production leading to hypothyroidism and goiter a slightly elevated serum tsh concentration without a decrease in serum t 4 or t 3 is the earliest sign of abnormal thyroid function when iodine intake is excessive in iodinesufficient adults elevated serum tsh has been found at chronic iodine intakes of ≥750 μgday in children and ≥1700 μgday in adults because various edible seaweed species substantially contribute to traditional asian meals average japanese dietary intakes are estimated to range between 1000 and 3000 μg of iodineday 71 iodineinduced goiter and hypothyroidism are not uncommon in japan and can be reversed by restricting seaweed intake 71 prolonged intakes of more than 18000 μgday 18 mgday increase the incidence of goiter in adults in newborns iodineinduced goiter and hypothyroidism can be due to either high maternal intakes or high exposure to iodized antiseptics 87 in order to minimize the risk of adverse health effects the food and nutrition board of the us institute of medicine set a tolerable upper intake level  ul for iodine that is likely to be safe in almost all individuals the ul values for iodine are listed in table 4 by age group the ul does not apply to individuals who are being treated with iodine under medical supervision 74 table 4 tolerable upper intake level ul for iodine age

should be from food and formula only individuals with increased sensitivity to excess iodine intake individuals with iodine deficiency and those with preexisting thyroid disease including nodular goiter autoimmune hashimoto thyroiditis graves disease and a history of partial thyroidectomy may be sensitive to iodine intake levels considered safe for the general population and may not be protected by the ul for iodine 9 infants the elderly and pregnant and lactating women may also be more susceptible to excess iodine see supplements 74 do elevated andor insufficient iodine intakes increase the risk of thyroid cancer over the past decades the incidence of thyroid cancer has increased worldwide in the us the incidence of thyroid cancer — representing 4 of all newly diagnosed cancers — has increased from 49 cases per persons in 1983 to 147 cases per 100000 persons in 2011 but mortality rate from thyroid cancer has remained low about 05 per 100000 persons 88 accounting for over 80 of all thyroid cancers thyroid papillary cancer is less aggressive and has a better prognosis than thyroid follicular cancer or anaplastic thyroid cancer the increasing incidence of thyroid cancer worldwide is likely due at least in part to the improved screening and diagnosis activities however because it has coincided with the introduction of iodine fortification programs a possible contribution of increased iodine intakes has been hypothesized yet in the us the increasing incidence of thyroid cancers primarily papillary cancer over the last few decades was paralleled with a reduction in average iodine intake 89 ecologic studies also suggested that iodine prophylaxis in populations that were previously iodine deficient was associated with an increased incidence of the papillary rather than the follicular cancer subtype and with a reduced incidence of the more aggressive anaplastic thyroid cancer 89 while changes in iodine intakes appear to affect the histological type of thyroid cancer it is not yet clear whether iodine deficiency andor iodine excess increase the risk of thyroid cancer 88 drug interactions amiodarone a medication used to prevent abnormal heart rhythms contains high levels of iodine and may affect thyroid function 90 antithyroid drugs used to treat hyperthyroidism such as propylthiouracil ptu methimazole and carbimazole may increase the risk of hypothyroidism additionally the longterm use of lithium to treat mood disorders may increase the risk of hypothyroidism 91 further the use of pharmacologic doses of potassium iodide may decrease the anticoagulant effect of warfarin coumarin 92 contaminants perchlorate is an oxidizing agent found in rocket propellants airbags fireworks herbicides and fertilizer mainly as a result of human activity perchlorate has been found to contaminate drinking water and many foods 57 chronic exposure to perchlorate concentrations at levels greater than 20 μg per kg body weight bw per day interferes with iodine uptake by the thyroid gland and may lead to hypothyroidism 93 the us environment protection agency epa recommends that daily oral exposure to perchlorate should not exceed 07 μgkg bw to protect the most sensitive population ie the fetuses of pregnant women who might be deficient in iodine andor hypothyroid 94 among all age groups children aged two years have the highest estimated perchlorate intakes per day with 035039 μgkg bwday average estimated intakes of perchlorate in us adults range between 008 and 011 μgkg bwday 70 linus pauling institute recommendation the rda for iodine is sufficient to ensure normal thyroid function there is presently no evidence that iodine intakes higher than the rda are beneficial most people in the us consume sufficient iodine in their diets making supplementation unnecessary pregnant and breastfeeding women given the importance of sufficient iodine during prenatal development and infancy pregnant and breastfeeding women should take a supplement that provides 150 μg of iodine per day see deficiency  older adults 50 yearsbecause aging has not been associated with significant changes in the requirement for iodine the lpi
