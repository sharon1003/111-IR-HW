rates yes female performers are often paid higher than male performers at least to start with new girls can get 6001000 starting out for a boygirl scene but the average female performer gets shot out within 36 months and then leaves porn altogether because there is no more money to be made for her i see this all the time to last longer than that 6 month introductory period you have to be really good at what youre doing and have something unique that makes studios want to keep hiring you its also important to have a large and loyal fan base clamoring to see new scenes doesnt matter how hot a girl is if there arent devoted fans writing to studios and posting on message boards saying how badly they cant wait to see her next scene the girl wont be getting hired and she will disappear male performers are generally a much smaller pool there is less competition among male performers than females their job is hard  they have to get hard on command stay hard as long as the director needs them to in order to finish the scene not cum early and cum on command all in an incredibly hot room often with no ac and bright lights all around and often with multiple other clothed dudes crew members watching a desirable popular male performer will be paid 5001000 for a boygirl scene depending on the studio and what their budget is best case scenario not necessarily typical by any means day in the life as a female performer an ideal day for me filming a boygirl scene goes like this often enough a day can be drawn out to over 10 hours long this is the best case scenario for a day on set shooting a boygirl scene9am wake up get my suitcase together10am drive 30 mins1hour to set arrive for my 11am call time1100 do my paperwork get in hairmakeup for 15 hours1200 shoot a set of solo stills which usually takes about an hour1200 the male talent arrives between 12 and does his paperwork while crew resets lights200 shoot intro video for scene may take up to 2 hours depending on complexity of scenario and setups400 shoot boygirl sex stills500 shoot boygirl video including cum shot600 if there is a softcore version to be shot then wed shoot the softcore photos and videos now that would take another 15 hours615 if there is no softcore stuff then were done for the day talent collects their checks if it is sameday pay otherwise the check is mailed after 2 weeks as you can see female talent always arrives several hours before male talent but we finish the scene at the same time imo its only fair that female talent is paid more than male talent if you look at it on a perhour basis also a lot of male performers can and will book two boygirl scenes in a day because there is a smaller pool of male talent guys who are indemand can easily shoot 1015 boygirl scenes a month while its almost unheard of for female talent to shoot more than 4 boygirls in a month personally i have averaged 2 per month since the beginning of my career  so one could say that shooting bg scenes just pays my rent challenges there are a multitude of challenges that might get in the way of talent being able to work regularly physically we depend on our bodies staying healthy to even be able to work if i just get a cold i might be sent home from a shoot because my nose is running and im sniffling a lot for example if i shoot a bondage scene one week that results in bruises on my thighs then my bg scene the following week will likely be cancelled because i cannot appear on camera with bruises on my skin the studio would send me home and call in another girl to substitute in my place many female performers have their own boundaries for what they can do physically and how often for example i cannot film more than 1 boygirl scene in a week because the sex is so intense and usually with a muchlargerthanaverage sized penis my vagina needs a few days to recuperate mentally being in such a highly competitive industry can be challenging you really have to develop a thick skin and not let anything get to you im a curvier girl so if i sat around all day wondering why my petite peers get jobs that i dont get i would go nuts out of necessity ive had to work on developing a very thick skin so that i dont take things like that personally personally its my toughest challenge most of my worktakes place on the internet  on social networks like twitter via blogging and posting on message boards and via email communications with my fans i get 100 emails every day and i read and respond to every single one even though it might take me a week or two in some cases in order to retain my loyal fan base and create new fans i have to keep myself out there in front of them its several hours of work every day which i am thrilled to be doing  but its not necessarily easy money as another users answer claimed remember this im only shooting a handful of scenes every month and the rest of my workevery day in betweenis not actually paid its me managing my daily business the aforementioned social networkingemail communications shooting my own scenes at home for my membership site and editing videos and laying groundwork to hopefully get more opportunities in the future the minority of my income is from being hired to film scenes the majority comes from a plethora of smaller more consistent income streams that require constant upkeep such as managing multiple online stores like clips4sale and free ones where i sell video clips auctioning off or selling my own merchandise online creating customordered videos for fans and from fans joining my official membership site which i update 2x per week with new content508k views · view upvoters · answer requested by manish nath your response is private is this answer still relevant and up to date related

in real life what was heshe like ask new question jenniferyt holloway answered oct 10 2015 · upvoted by garion hall owns leading porn site abbywinterscom since 2000 i’m a struggling porn star working in the asian porn industry trying to get a name for myself i’m not doing this fulltime since i’m also studying and completing my bachelors degree most people think that being a female pornstar is easy as you get paid handsomely for just having a few minutes of fun what they don’t realize is the amount of time and effort that goes in perfecting a scene for example i wake up at 5 am in the morning and have a light breakfast after which i hit the gym needless to say that in porn industry your body is your bread and butter you’ve to stay healthy and in perfect shape if you want to increase your odds of surviving in this highly competitive industry once i get home i start preparing myself for the scene i undergo a lot of beautifying treatments including waxing tanning and makeup once that’s done i have my lunch following which we start doing a few photoshoots most of the times i need to also shoot a short demo or an interview before taping the actual sex video at probably around 5 i complete all my sex scenes after which i packup and head home now being a pornstar is easy but staying a pornstar is difficult you need to constantly stay on top of your game and entice your fans so that they keep asking for more and the agency signs you up for more videos so once i’m home i checkup my emails and ensure that i reply to each one of them once that’s done i go back to making dinner completing assignments cleaning up my place and doing the laundry by the time i hit the bed i’m damn tired and usually asleep within a few minutes most people think it’s unfair that we get around 600  1000 for just a few minutes what they underestimate is the amount of effort that goes behind making those few minutes pictureperfect like siri mentioned in her answer i think every pornstar has more of the same lifestyle we put in way more efforts to stay in the industry and to ensure that we look the best in the scenes i recommend reading this is what its actually like to work as a female porn star it shares the untold unadulterated and slightly bitter reality of making yourself a name in the highly competitive porn industry1596k views · view upvoters your response is private is this answer
