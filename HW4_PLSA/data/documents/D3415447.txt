rare progressive condition that affects blood vessels it is primarily characterized by livedo reticularis netlike patterns of discoloration on the skin and neurological abnormalities 1 2 symptoms may include transient ischemic attacks ministrokes and strokes headache dizziness high blood pressure and heart disease 1 2 reduced blood flow to the brain may cause reduced intellectual ability memory loss personality changes andor other neurological symptoms 1 the cause of sneddon syndrome is often unknown but it is sometimes associated with an autoimmune disease most cases are sporadic but some familial cases with autosomal dominant inheritance have been reported treatment usually involves anticoagulation bloodthinning with warfarin andor the use of other medications 2last updated 11152016symptoms listen sneddon syndrome is primarily characterized by livedo reticulari s netlike patterns of discoloration on the skin and neurological abnormalities 1 2 the average age of onset of neurological symptoms is 39 years though the livedo generally occurs up to 10 years earlier sometimes since childhood 3 the type of livedo reticularis that occurs is called livedo racemosa a generalized and persistent form of livedo it may affect the arms and legs buttocks trunk face hands and feet 3 some affected individuals also have signs of raynaud’s phenomenon andor widespread mottledpurple discoloration on the body 3 neurological symptoms may include transient ischemic attacks ministrokes and strokes headache and dizziness 1 2 reduced blood flow to the brain may cause reduced intellectual ability memory loss psychiatric disturbances personality changes andor other neurological symptoms 1 3 concentration attention memory visual perception and visuospatial construction are the most commonly described cognitive impairments dementia ultimately occurs in many affected people rarer neurological symptoms include seizures chorea and myelopathies disorders of the spinal cord 3 other signs and symptoms may include high blood pressure heart disease ophthalmologic eye complications and impaired renal kidney function 3last updated 11152016this table lists

idiopathic of unknown cause in some cases it is associated with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus antiphospholipid syndrome behçet disease or mixed connective tissue disease 2 genetic factors are thought to play a role in the development of sneddon syndrome as familial cases have been reported 2 in one family a mutation in the cecr1 gene was identified as the cause of the condition 4 mutations in this gene have been found to cause adenosine deaminase 2 deficiency a condition that also causes livedo racemosa and other symptoms and has earlier onset than sneddon syndrome the signs and symptoms of the condition are caused by excessive growth of the inner surface of blood vessels endothelium leading to occlusion of the arteries with impaired blood flow and clotting 2last updated 11152016inheritance listen most cases of sneddon syndrome are sporadic not inherited  occurring in people with no family history of the disorder however some familial cases with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern have been reported in these cases a genetic susceptibility is likely 2 a person who is genetically predisposed to a disorder carries a gene or genes for the disease but it may not be expressed unless it is triggered or “activated” under certain circumstances 1last updated 11152016diagnosis listen the main criteria for a diagnosis of sneddon syndrome are general livedo racemosa with characteristic findings on skin biopsy and focal neurological deficits supportive criteria include a history of transient ischemic attacks or stroke and evidence of small bright foci on t2weighted mri 3 anyone suspected to have sneddon syndrome may undergo 3 2blood tests see belowa thorough cardiovascular heart evaluationbrain mri which may reveal white matter changes infarcts microbleeds or atrophycerebral angiography abnormal in up to 75 of patients andskin biopsy which may reveal occlusion of arterioles by proliferation of the inner lining characteristic of sneddon syndromeblood tests may screen for 3 2lupus anticoagulantimmunoglobulin ig g and possibly ig m anticardiolipinantibodies types of antiphospholipid antibodies which may be positive in about 60

slast updated 11152016treatment listen the optimal management of sneddon syndrome has not been established and controlled trials have not yet been performed 3 currently the most widely accepted treatment is anticoagulation with warfarin some suggest that a plnegative patients should follow a less aggressive approach consisting of antiplatelet therapy with aspirin while others recommend warfarin with a higher international normalized ratio target 2angiotensinconverting enzyme ace inhibitors have been suggested to reduce endothelial proliferation growth of the inside lining of the vessels and prostaglandin to improve blood flow and gas exchange in small vessels microvascular perfusion 2 abstaining from smoking and abstaining from using estrogen oral contraceptives may prevent or decrease the severity of neurological symptoms 3 while the use of immunosuppressive therapy appears generally ineffective there are data indicating that rituximab may be effective in a plpositive patients 2 additional research exploring the underlying causes of sneddon syndrome may identify treatment options based on the cause in each affected person 3last updated 11152016find a specialist listen if you need medical advice you can look for doctors or other healthcare professionals who have experience with this disease you may find these specialists through advocacy organizations clinical trials or articles published in medical journals you may also want to contact a university or tertiary medical center in your area because these centers tend to see more complex cases and have the latest technology and treatments if you can’t find a specialist in your local area try contacting national or international specialists they may be able to refer you to someone they know through conferences or research efforts some specialists may be willing to consult with you or your local doctors over the phone or by email if you cant travel to them for care you can find more tips in our guide how to find a disease specialist we also encourage you to explore the rest of this page to find resources that can help you find specialists healthcare resources to find a medical professional who specializes in genetics you can ask your doctor for a referral or you can search for one yourself online directories are provided by the american college of medical genetics and the national society of genetic counselors if you need additional help contact a gard information specialist you can also learn more about genetic consultations from genetics home reference prognosis listen sneddon syndrome is a chronic progressive disease that leads to major morbidity 2 the exact neurological symptoms vary depending upon the location of arterial blockages 1 however the condition often causes progressive reduction of mental and cognitive function dementia ultimately occurs in many patients resulting in early retirement 2 aphasia the loss of ability to express or understand speech is also common 1 while we are not aware of statistics regarding the life expectancy of people with sneddon syndrome studies have estimated the six year mortality rate to be 95 5last updated 11162016statistics listen sneddon syndrome has an estimated annual incidence of approximately 1250000 2 it has been reported much more often in females than in males especially young women under the age of 45 1 it does occur occasionally in girls as young as 10 years old 3last updated 11152016do you have updated information on this disease we want to hear from you research listen research helps
