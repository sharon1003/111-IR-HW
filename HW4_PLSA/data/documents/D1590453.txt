references9 external links character development  edithermione jean granger is a muggleborn gryffindor 3 who becomes best friends with harry potter and ron weasley j k rowling states that she was born on 19 september 1979 1 and she was nearly twelve when she first attended hogwarts 4 she is an overachiever who excels academically and is described by rowling as a very logical upright and good character 5 rowling adds that hermiones parents two muggle dentists are a bit bemused by their odd daughter but very proud of her all the same 6 they are well aware of the wizarding world and have visited diagon alley with her hermione was originally intended to have a sister but the planned sibling did not make an appearance in the first harry potter novel and as rowling noted it seemed too late to introduce the character after that 6 rowling confirmed in a 2004 interview that hermione is an only child 7rowling has described the character of luna lovegood as the antihermione as they are so different 8 hermiones foil at hogwarts is pansy parkinson a bully based on reallife girls who teased the author during her school days 9rowling stated that the character of hermione carries several autobiographical influences i did not set out to make hermione like me but she isshe is an exaggeration of how i was when i was younger 5 she recalled being called a little knowitall in her youth 1 moreover she states that not unlike herself there is a lot of insecurity and a great fear of failure beneath hermiones swottiness finally according to rowling next to albus dumbledore hermione is the perfect expository character because of her encyclopaedic knowledge she can always be used as a plot dump to explain the harry potter universe 10 rowling also states that her feminist conscience is rescued by hermione whos the brightest character and is a very strong female character 11hermiones first name is taken from a character in william shakespeare s the winters tale though rowling has said that the two characters have little in common otherwise 12 rowling said that she wanted her name to be unusual since if fewer girls shared her name fewer girls would get teased for it 12 and it seemed that a pair of professional dentists who liked to prove how clever they aregave her an unusual name that noone could pronounce 13 her original last name was puckle but rowling felt the name did not suit her at all and so the less frivolous granger made it into the books 1appearances  editharry potter and the philosophers stone  edithermione first appears in harry potter and the philosophers stone when she meets harry and ron on the hogwarts express where she condemns ron for his inability to perform a spell to turn his rat yellow she proves just how much she knows by declaring that she memorized all the textbooks by heart and by performing a spell on harry she constantly annoys her peers with her knowledge so harry and ron initially consider her arrogant especially after she criticises rons incantation of the levitation charm 14 they heartily dislike her until they rescue her from a troll for which she is so thankful that she lies to protect them from punishment thus winning their friendship 15 hermiones knack for logic later enables the trio to solve a puzzle that is essential to retrieving the philosophers stone and she defeats the constrictive devils snare plant by summoning a jet of bluebell flame 16hermione is the brains behind the plan to enter the place where the stone is hidden she responds to harrys wariness of professor severus snape and is also suspicious of him she reveals to harry and ron that she does a lot of research in the library which helped her defeat the devils snare and work out the logic of the potions rowling said on her website that she resisted her editors requests to remove the troll scene stating hermione is so very arrogant and annoying in the early part of philosophers stone that i really felt it needed something literally huge to bring her together with harry and ron 1harry potter and the chamber of secrets  edithermione along with rons mother molly weasley and a few female students of hogwarts develops a liking for defence against the dark arts teacher gilderoy lockhart as he had written all the books required for the subject of defence against the dark arts in harry potter and the chamber of secrets 17 during a morning confrontation between the gryffindor and slytherin quidditch teams a brawl nearly ensues after draco malfoy calls her a  mudblood  an insulting epithet for muggleborn wizards when she defends the gryffindor quidditch team she concocts the polyjuice potion needed for the trio to disguise themselves as dracos housemates to collect information about the heir of slytherin who has reopened the chamber of secrets however she is unable to join harry and ron in the investigation after the hair plucked from the robes of slytherin student millicent bulstrode with whom hermione was previously matched up during lockharts illfated duelling club was that of her cat whose appearance she takes on in her human form it takes several weeks for the effects to completely wear off hermione is petrified by the basilisk after successfully identifying the creature through library research though she lies incapacitated in the hospital wing the information she has found and left behind is crucial to harry and ron in their successful mission to solve the mystery of the chamber of secrets hermione is revived after harry kills the basilisk but she is distraught to learn that all endofyear exams have been cancelled as a school treat 18harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban  edithermione buys a cat named crookshanks who takes to chasing rons pet rat scabbers 19 before the start of term professor mc gonagall secretly gives hermione a timeturner a device which enables her to go back in time and handle her heavy class schedule though this is not revealed until the penultimate chapter much tension comes into play between hermione and her two best friends harry is furious with her because she told mc gonagall that he had received a firebolt which was confiscated to be inspected for traces of dark magic ron is angry because he feels crookshanks is responsible for scabbers disappearance while hermione fiercely maintains that crookshanks is innocent while filling in for remus lupin in one defence against the dark arts class snape labels hermione an insufferable knowitall and penalises gryffindor after she speaks out of turn in her attempt to describe a werewolf when no one else does she correctly deduces lupins secret after completing snapes homework assignment from the class while crookshanks proves vital in exposing scabbers as peter pettigrew a friend of james and lily potter who revealed their whereabouts to lord voldemort the night of their murders and was able to wrongly implicate sirius black revealed to be harrys godfather in the potters deaths 20 21 the timeturner enables hermione and harry to rescue sirius and the hippogriff buckbeak 20 21harry potter and the goblet of fire  edithermione is horrified by the cruelty that houseelves suffer and establishes s p e w the society for the promotion of elfish welfare as an effort to gain basic rights for them she is bulgarian quidditch prodigy viktor krum s date at the yule ball of the triwizard tournament 22 the proper pronunciation of her name  hermyohnee is interjected into the plot when she teaches it to krum the best he can do is hermownninny but she has no problem with it 1 she later gets into a heated argument with ron after he accuses her of fraternising with the enemy in reference to her friendship with krum in the book hermiones feelings toward ron are hinted at when she says that ron cant see her like a girl but krum could she supports harry through the triwizard tournament helping him prepare for each task at the end of the second task krum asks her to come see him over the summer in bulgaria but she politely refuses near the end of the term she stops fraudulent tabloid reporter and unregistered animagus rita skeeter who had published defamatory material about hermione harry and hagrid during the triwizard tournament by holding her animagus form a beetle captive in a jar 23harry potter and the order of the phoenix  edithermione becomes a gryffindor prefect along with ron and befriends luna lovegood but their friendship gets off to a rocky start after hermione chastises the publication of lunas father  the quibbler s rubbish everyone knows that she also lambasts housemate lavender brown for believing the daily prophet s allegations of harry fabricating stories of voldemorts return ron and hermione spend much of their time bickering likely due to their growing romantic feelings toward one another but they show continued loyalty to harry later new headmistress professor umbridge attempts to ban the quibbler from hogwarts this effort becomes moot as the story spreads quickly through the school one turning point in the series is when hermione conceives the idea of harry secretly teaching defensive magic to a small band of students in defiance of the ministry of magic s dictum to teach only the subjects basic principles from a textbook with no handson practice hermione gets an unexpectedly huge response and the group becomes the nascent dumbledores army she is involved in the battle in the department of mysteries and seriously injured by a spell from death eater antonin dolohov but makes a full recovery 24 25harry potter and the halfblood prince  editnew potions professor horace slughorn invites hermione to join his slug club 26 and she helps ron retain his spot on the gryffindor quidditch team when she confunds cormac mc laggen causing him to miss his last save attempt during keeper tryouts hermiones feelings for ron continue to grow and she decides to make a move by inviting him to slughorns christmas party but he romances lavender instead in retaliation for his belief that hermione had kissed krum years earlier she attempts to get even by dating mc laggen at the christmas party but her plan goes bust and she abandons him midway through the party 27 28 ron and hermione continually feud with each other ron is upset with her because she set birds to attack him after seeing him and lavender kissing hermione is mostly mad because of her growing jealousy until he suffers a nearfatal poisoning from tainted mead which frightens her enough to reconcile with him following dumbledores death ron and hermione both vow to stay by harrys side regardless of what happens 29 a minor subplot in the book is that hermione and harry form a rivalry in potions as hermione is used to coming first in her subjects and is angered that harry outperforms her undeservedly by following tips and different instructions written in the margins of harrys potions book by the previous owner hermione is also the only one of the trio to successfully pass her apparition test ron failed albeit barely and harry was too young harry potter and the deathly hallows  editin the seventh and final book hermione accompanies harry on his quest to destroy voldemorts remaining horcruxes before leaving on the quest she helps ensure the safety of her parents by placing a false memory charm on them making them think they are wendell and monica wilkins whose lifetime ambition is to move to australia she inherits dumbledores personal copy of the tales of beedle the bard which allows her to decipher some of the secrets of the deathly hallows she prepared for their departure and journey by placing an undetectable extension charm on a small beaded purse so she is able to fill the infinite depths of the bag with materials they will need hermiones spell saves her and harry from lord voldemort and his snake nagini in godrics hollow although the ricochet snaps harrys wand when she ron and harry are captured by snatchers who are on the hunt for muggleborns under the ministrys orders hermione disguises harry by temporarily disfiguring his face with a stinging jinx she also attempts to pass herself off as former hogwarts student penelope clearwater and a halfblood to avoid persecution but is later recognised and taken to malfoy manor where bellatrix lestrange tortures her with the cruciatus curse in an attempt to extract information on how hermione harry and ron came to possess godric gryffindors sword which was supposed to be safe in the lestrange vault at gringotts  even under torture hermione is able to use her quick thinking to lie to bellatrix that the sword is a fake when the others are able to escape their cell bellatrix threatens to slit hermiones throat hermione harry ron and the other prisoners being held in malfoy manor are eventually rescued by dobby hermione later uses polyjuice potion to impersonate bellatrix when the trio attempt to steal hufflepuffs cup from gringotts she harry and ron join dumbledores army in the battle of hogwarts during which hermione destroys hufflepuffs cup in the chamber of secrets with a basilisk fang eliminating another horcrux hermione and ron also share their first kiss in the midst of the battle 30 in the final battle in the great hall hermione fights bellatrix with the help of ginny weasley and luna however the three of them are unable to defeat bellatrix and stop fighting her once molly weasley orders them to disengage 31epilogue  editnineteen years after voldemorts death hermione and ron have two children rose and hugo 32 though the epilogue does not explicitly say hermione and ron are married 32 news articles and other sources treat it as a fact 33 34 35characterisation  editoutward appearance  editin the books hermione is described as having bushy brown hair and brown eyes her front teeth already very large grow uncontrollably in goblet of fire after she is affected by a spell cast by draco madam pomfrey attends to her in the hospital wing and at her request shrinks the teeth down to a normal size for her mouth personality  edithermiones most prominent features include her prodigious intellect and cleverness she is levelheaded booksmart and very logical throughout the series hermione uses the skills of a librarian to gather the information necessary to defeat voldemort when in doubt it is to the library that hermione turns 36 she is often bossy yet unfailingly dutiful and loyal to her friends—a person who can be counted on rowling stated that hermione is a person that never strays off the path she always keeps her attention focused on the job that must be done 37 despite hermiones intelligence and bossy attitude rowling says that hermione has quite a lot of vulnerability in her personality 38 as well as a sense of insecurity underneath feels utterly inadequate and to compensate she tries to be the best at everything at school projecting a false confidence that can irritate people 39 during her defence against the dark arts exam at the end of harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban hermione reveals that her biggest fear is failure after a boggart takes the form of professor mc gonagall and tells her that she has failed all her exams hermione is extremely compassionate and is quick to help others especially those who are defenceless such as neville longbottom firstyears houseelves fellow muggleborns halfgiants like hagrid and werewolves like lupin it was revealed by rowling after the publication of the final book that hermiones career in the ministry was to fight for the rights of the oppressed and disenfranchised such as houseelves or muggleborns hermione is also very protective of her friends and values them so much that rowling has suggested that if hermione had looked in the mirror of erised she would have seen harry ron and herself alive and unscathed and voldemort finished 40 hermione has also learned to ignore what bullies such as draco say to her often preventing harry and ron from retaliating and thinking of some way to outsmart him she accepts her status as a muggleborn witch and states in deathly hallows that she is a mudblood and proud of it 41magical abilities and skills  edithermione is portrayed during the whole series as an exceptionally talented young witch rowling has stated that hermione is a borderline genius 42 she received ten o w ls which were nine outstandings and one exceeds expectations she is the best student in harrys year and is repeatedly the first student to master any spell or charm introduced in classes and even from more advanced years as evidenced when she is able to conjure a protean charm on the d a s fake galleon coins which is actually a n e w t level charm 43 she is also the first one to be able to cast nonverbal spells 44 hermione is a competent duellist  rowling has stated that while during the first three books hermione would have beaten harry in a magical duel by the fourth book harry had become so good at defence against the dark arts that he would have defeated hermione 45 hermione did not tend to do as well in subjects that were not learned through books or formal training as broom flying did not come as naturally to her in her first year as it did to harry 46 and she showed no affinity for divination which she dropped from her third year studies 47 48 she was also not good at wizards chess as it was the only thing at which she ever lost 49hermiones patronus is an otter rowlings favourite animal 50 her wand is made of vine wood and dragon heartstring core vine is the wood ascribed to hermiones fictional birth month september on the celtic calendar 51reception  edithermione is viewed by many as a feminist icon 52 in the ivory tower and harry potter the first booklength analysis of the harry potter series edited and compiled by lana a whited a chapter titled hermione granger and the heritage of gender by eliza t dresang discusses hermiones role in the series and its relation to feminist debates 53 the chapter begins with an analysis of hermiones name and the role of previous characters with the same name in mythology and fiction and the heritage hermione has inherited from these characters due to her name dresang also emphasises hermiones parallelism with rowling herself and how as hermione has some attributes from rowling herself she must be a strong character the chapter also points out the fact that despite being born to muggle parents hermiones magical abilities are innate her compulsion for study helps both the characters development which makes hermione a prime example that information brings power and the plot of the series as her knowledge of the wizarding world is often used to save the day dresang states that harry and ron are more dependent on hermione than she is on them however she also remarks that hermiones hysteria and crying happen far too often to be considered a believable part of the development of hermiones character and are quite out of line with her core role in the book 53ugo networks listed hermione as one of their best heroes of all time saying most of us can probably recall having a classmate like hermione when we were in grammar school—one who can at first be a little offputting but once you get to know her shes not a bad chick to have on your side 54 ign also listed hermione as their second top harry potter character praising her character development 55 in 2016 the hollywood reporter conducted a poll of hollywood professioals including actors writers and directors into their favourite female characters of all time with hermione topping the poll 2philip nel of kansas state university notes that rowling who worked for amnesty international evokes her social activism through hermiones passion for oppressed elves and the formation of her society for the promotion of elfish welfare 56however in an analysis for harry potter and the deathly hallows rowland manthrope states that seven books on we still only know her as swottish sensible hermione—a caricature not a character 57portrayals  editfilm series  editemma watson portrayed hermione in all eight harry potter films watsons oxford theatre teacher passed her name on to the casting agents of philosophers stone impressed with her school play performances 58 though watson took her audition seriously she never really thought she had any chance of getting the part 59 the producers were impressed by watsons selfconfidence and she outperformed the thousands of other girls who had applied 60rowling herself was supportive of watson after her first screen test 58 when asked if she thought actors suited the characters rowling said yes i did emma watson in particular was very very like hermione when i first spoke to her i knew she was perfect from that first phone call 6watson was wellreceived for the first film ign even commented that from hermione grangers perfect introduction to her final scene watson is better than i could have possibly imagined she steals the show 61 ign also wrote that her astute portrayal of hermione has already become a favorite among fans 62before the production of halfblood prince watson considered not returning 63 but eventually decided that the pluses outweighed the minuses and that she could not bear to see anyone else play hermione 64watson has said that hermione is a character who makes brain not beauty cool and that though hermione is slightly socially inept she is not ashamed of herself 65 when filming chamber of secrets watson was adamant that she wasnt like hermione but she reflects that as i got older i realised she was the greatest role model a girl could have 66 in 2007 before the release of order of the phoenix watson said there are too many stupid girls in the media hermiones not scared to be clever i think sometimes really smart girls dumb themselves down a bit and thats bad when i was nine or ten i would get really upset when they tried to make me look geeky but now i absolutely love it i find its so much pressure to be beautiful hermione doesnt care what she looks like shes a complete tomboy 64screenwriter steve kloves revealed in a 2003 interview that hermione was his favourite character theres something about her fierce intellect coupled with a complete lack of understanding of how she affects people sometimes that i just find charming and irresistible to write 10theatre portrayal  editin harry potter and the cursed child hermione granger is played by the south africanborn actress noma dumezweni also known for her work in linda a raisin in the sun and a human being died that night 67 dumezweni described the role as a privilege and a responsibility and said that we all aspire to be hermione 68 the choice of a black actress to play the part led to criticism on social media which j k rowling described as being by a bunch of racists adding that the books never explicitly mentioned her race or skin colour and that she has been portrayed as black in fan art 69 emma watson also expressed her support for the actress tweeting that she looked forward to seeing her in the role 70 dumezweni herself called the backlash so unimaginative 71 stating that so many young actors and actresses have told me that they’re so pleased i’m playing hermione because they can see a version of themselves on the stage 72dumezweni received praise for her performance the independent commented that she did a tremendous job as the stern witch 73 at the 2017 laurence olivier awards dumezweni received the award for best actress in a
