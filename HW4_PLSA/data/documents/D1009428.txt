3500000 claim buginese descent the buginese people are an ethnic group—the most numerous of the three major linguistic and ethnic groups of south sulawesi in the southwestern province of sulawesi third largest island of indonesia 3 the austronesian ancestors of the buginese people settled on sulawesi around 2500 b c e there is historical linguistic evidence of some late holocene immigration of austronesian speakers to south sulawesi from taiwan —which means that the buginese have possible ultimate ancestry in south china and that as a result of this immigration there was an infusion of an exogenous population from china or taiwan  4 migration from south china by some of the paternal ancestors of the buginese is also supported by studies of human ychromosome dna haplogroups 5 the bugis in 1605 converted to islam from animism 6 some buginese have retained their preislamic belief called tolotang and some bugis converted to christianity by means of marriage but they have remained a minority 7despite the population numbering only around 6 million the buginese are a very powerful people and they have heavily influenced the politics in the present day states of malaysia indonesia and singapore the current prime minister of malaysia najib razak and the current vice president of indonesia jusuf kalla are both buginese although many buginese people live in the large port cities of makassar and parepare the majority are farmers who grow wet rice on the lowland plains to the north and west of the town of maros the name bugis is an exonym which represents an older form of the

depression in the southwest peninsula of sulawesi it was here that the ancestors of the presentday bugis settled probably in the mid to late second millennium bc the area is rich in fish and wildlife and the annual fluctuation of lake tempe a reservoir lake for the bila and walannae rivers allows speculative planting of wet rice while the hills can be farmed by swidden or shifting cultivation wet rice gathering and hunting around ad 1200 the availability of prestigious imported goods including chinese and southeast asian ceramics and gujerati printblock textiles coupled with newly discovered sources of iron ore in luwu stimulated an agrarian revolution which expanded from the great lakes region into the lowland plains to the east south and west of the walennae depression this led over the next 400 years to the development of the major kingdoms of south sulawesi and the social transformation of chiefly societies into hierarchical protostates 9migration to other areas  editmalay

politics of the malay peninsula and sumatra the bugis played an important role in defeating jambi and had a huge influence in sultanate of johor apart from the malays another influential faction in johor at that time was the minangkabau both the buginese and the minangkabau realised how the death of sultan mahmud ii had provided them with the chance to exert power in johor under the leadership of daeng parani the descendants of two families settled on the linggi and selangor rivers and became the power behind the johor throne with the creation of the office of the yang dipertuan muda yam

oceangoing schooners in which they plied the trade routes intrepid and doughty they travelled as far east as the aru islands off new guinea where they traded in the skins of birds of paradise and medicinal masoya bark and to northern australia where they exchanged shells birdsnests and motherofpearl for knives and salt with aboriginal tribes the buginese sailors left their mark and culture on an area of the northern australian coast which stretches over two thousand kilometres from the kimberley to the gulf of carpentaria throughout these parts of northern australia there is much evidence of a significant bugis presence each year the bugis sailors would sail down on the northwestern monsoon in their wooden pinisi they would stay in australian waters for several months to trade and take trepang or dried sea cucumber before returning to makassar on the dry season off shore winds as thomas forrest wrote in a voyage from calcutta to the mergui archipelago 1792 s78 ff “the buggesses in

the agricultural cycle and work in the homes most buginese people live in stilted houses sometimes three meters 9 ft or more off the ground with plank walls and floors many of the marriages are still arranged by parents and ideally take place between cousins a newlywed couple often lives with the wifes family for the first few years of their marriage the buginese diet consists mainly of rice maize fish chicken vegetables fruit and coffee on festive occasions goat is served as a special dish the buginese people recognise five separate genders 11 these are makkunrai and oroané which are similar to cisgender male and female respectively as well as calabai calalai and bissu which are less easily comparable to western ideas of gender 12religion  editin the early 17th century the minangkabau ulama dato ri bandang dato ri tiro and dato ri patimang spread islam in south sulawesi 13 the bugis converted from indigenous animistic practices and beliefs to islam a few west coast rulers converted to christianity in the mid16th century but failure by the portuguese at malacca to provide priests meant that this did not last by 1611 all the makasar and bugis kingdoms had converted to islam though pockets of animists among the bugis to lotang at amparita and the makasar konja in bulukumba persist to this day because most bugis people are devout muslims the hajj is seen as a prestige by them in
