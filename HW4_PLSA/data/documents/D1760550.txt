internet protection act see what is compliance abovethis public library is undertaking action to comply with the childrens internet protection act see  undertaking actions  belowthis public library does not need to comply with the childrens internet protection act because we do not use or plan to use the funds for services which would require cipa compliance see under what conditions is cipa compliance necessary above lsta only this public library has certified cipa compliance under the erate program because we receive the erate discount on services requiring compliance ncipa requirements an internet safety policy must address the following items access by minors to inappropriate matter on the internet and the webthe safety and security of minors when using electronic mail chat rooms and other forms of direct electronic communicationsunauthorized access including socalled hacking and other unlawful activities by minors onlineunauthorized disclosure use and dissemination of personal identification information regarding minors and measures designed to restrict minors’ access to materials harmful to minors the internet safety policy must be adopted after holding at least one public hearing or meeting the law and the regulations give libraries considerable flexibility in meeting the public hearing mandate the law says simply that libraries must provide reasonable public notice and hold at least one public hearing or meeting to address the proposed internet safety policy considering this general language the hearing can be part of a regular board meeting assuming such a meeting allows for public comments notices of such a meeting must comport with any local or state open meeting laws be certain to document fully the public meeting by keeping a copy of the notice noting any actions taken etc when is the compliance deadline erate the compliance deadline varies depending on a librarys previous erate application experience a library that is asking for the erate discount on internet access or internal connections for the very first time has one year to come into compliance ie by july 1st of the next year if funding year 2005 is the first year that a library requests the erate discount on internet access or internal connections then that deadline would be july 1 2006 if funding year 2006 is the first year that a library requests the erate discount on internet access or internal connections then that deadline would be july 1 2007 libraries not already in compliance may use the one year timeframe to undertake actions to come into compliance ie develop an internet safety policy install and enforce the use of a technology protection measure see below for more information regarding  undertaking action  and see above for  what is compliance  on a form 486 where internet access or internal connections have been requested libraries must certify compliance or that they are undertaking action to be in compliance by july 1st of the appropriate year for example if filing for funding year 2005 the deadline is july 1 2006 following are a few examples of documentation that could demonstrate that a library is  undertaking action  to comply with cipa a published or circulated library board agenda with cipa compliance cited as a topic a circulated staff meeting agenda with cipa compliance cited as a topic a service provider quote requested and received by a recipient of service or billed entity which contains information on a technology protection measure a draft of an rfp or other procurement procedure to solicit bids for the purchase or provision of a technology protection measure an agenda or minutes from a meeting open to the public at which an internet safety policy was discussed an agenda or minutes from a public or nonpublic meeting of a school or library board at which procurement issues relating to the acquisition of a technology protection measure were discussed a memo to an administrative authority of a library from a staff member outlining the cipa issues not addressed by an acceptable use policy currently in place a memo or report to an administrative authority of a library from a staff member describing research on available technology protection measures a memo or report to an administrative authority of a library from a staff member which discusses and analyzes internet safety policies in effect at other libraries this list is not meant to be exhaustive some common questions regarding the form 486 certification q i am about to file a form 486 and i am not receiving a discount on anything except telecommunications services what do i need to do a certify on your form 486 that no compliance is necessary q i originally applied for and received a funding commitment for services that included internet access or internal connections this library will not be installing a technology protection measure what should i do a you can submit your form 486 accepting the discount for any telecommunications services requests that were funded services under this category do not require cipa compliance you would simply not accept the discount for those services which would require cipa compliance you would not include those funding requests on your form 486 if you already included those services on a form 486 you can cancel that request using a form 500 libraries that will not be undertaking actions to come into compliance and are not currently in compliance are not eligible for the erate discount on internet access or internal connections q if the billed entity applies only for telecommunications services would that situation constitute the administrative authoritys first funding year for the purpose of cipa a no a library who is a recipient of service is considered to have applied for funds in a funding year only when form 486 for a funding request for internet access or internal connections has been successfully data entered since the billed entity applied only for telecommunications services in this situation the administrative authoritys first funding year was not established by the funding request in this form 486 more frequently asked questions can be found at cipa and the form 486 httpwwwsluniversalserviceorgreferencecipafaqasp lsta on august 1 2003 the institute of museum and library services imls announced that program year 2004 of the library

technology restricts access to internet content through a variety of means two basic types of filters currently dominate the market filters that block content containing disapproved words keyword blocking and filters that block access according to a list of disapproved sites site blocking in either case the filter manufacturer in its own way and according to its own standards determines which words or sites will be blocked to comply with cipa a technology protection measure must “protect” users from visual depictions – the blocking of objectionable text is not covered by the legislation however most filtering solutions block based on keywords or text the choice of which technology protection measure to implement is a local decision congress requested a study of technology protection
