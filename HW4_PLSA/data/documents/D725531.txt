pungent cuisine from the other side of the globe but the secret ingredient both outlets offered was halal the islamic analog of kosher a promise that the meat has been slaughtered and prepared in accordance with islamic teachings that in turn has sparked a neighborhood contest over whose fried chicken is truly halal or more halala 21st century collision of american marketing immigrant tastes

kfc and browns quickly learned that entering the market was not as easy as it looked afzal lokhandwala opened a halal kfc franchise in west suburban lombard three years ago near a mosque and a large muslim community challenge halal claimfrom day one it started he said people were coming in and saying this is not halal this is not handslaughtered this is machine slaughtered in islam the term halal applies to anything that is permitted most food and drink can be halal except for alcohol and pork but there is no consensus on exactly what is halal and what is not and american muslims face a variety of interpretations chicken and beef can be halal but most muslims believe it must be zabihah or slaughtered according to islamic ritual said abdul malik mujahid chairman of the islamic organizations of greater chicago zabihah calls for the animal to be blessed then slaughtered its throat cut and blood drained but muslims are divided about whether that can be reconciled with poultryplant practices of machineslaughter and stunning the animal before slaughter still others are satisfied with kosher products believing the jewish rites are similar enough or do not worry about zabihah at all mujahid said lokhandwala figured he was safe three years ago with the lombard shop when he found that the poultry supplier kfc used also had halal operations for meat it supplied to singapore which has a significant muslim population but almost immediately people began questioning the authenticity of his halal meat an organization called the muslim consumer group questioned the coating ingredients and processing practices used by kfc and its supplier soon a heated debate about lokhandwalas restaurant played out on the pages of zabihahcom the halal food reviewer reject machine slaughteraccording to islamic law we do not accept machine slaughter said syed rasheeduddin ahmed founder and president of the muslim consumer group ahmed said he talked to the chicken supplier gold kist and learned that a muslim mechanic said the blessing he just stands there and the machine slaughters 142 chickens per minute ahmed said he cannot say allahu akbar god is great for each one lokhandwala devoted his franchises web site to proving that his fried chicken is halal he published slaughtering guidelines from malaysia where national authorities accept machine slaughtering as halal gold kist says it has halal certification from the al huda islamic center in athens ga and business was good in lombard so lokhandwala jumped at the opportunity last april to buy a kfc franchise located on western avenue just north of the devon shopping district he partnered with the owner of a wellknown pakistani restaurant on devon sabri nehari which was destroyed in a fire
