a us 30 million budget eastwood persuaded lakeshore entertainments tom rosenberg to put up half the budget as well as handle foreign distribution with warner bros contributing the rest 15 million eastwood shot the film in less than 40 days between june and july 2004 1 2 filming took place in los angeles and film sets at warner bros studios 2 the term million dollar baby was from the nose art of a world war ii consolidated b24 liberator heavy bomber eastwood had his daughter morgan colette appear in a brief role as a girl who waves to swanks character at a gas station 4 5eastwood had confidence in swanks acting background but upon seeing swanks small physique he had concerns i just thought yeah this gal would be great if we can get her trained up if we can get a little bit more bulk on her to make her look like a fighter she was like a feather but what happened is she had this great work ethic 6consequently to prepare for her role swank underwent extensive training in the ring and weight room gaining 19 pounds of muscle aided by professional trainer grant l roberts she trained for nearly five hours every day winding up with a potentially lifethreatening staphylococcus

from hilary swank and morgan freeman  help million dollar baby to transcend its clichés and the result is deeply heartfelt and moving 8 it also has a score of 86 out of 100 on metacritic based on 39 critics indicating universal acclaim 9 roger ebert of the chicago sun times gave the film four stars and stated that clint eastwoods million dollar baby is a masterpiece pure and simple listing it as the best film of 2004 10 michael medved stated my main objection to million dollar baby always centered on its misleading marketing and effort by warner brothers to sell it as a movie about a female rocky with barely a hint of the pitchdark substance that led andrew sarris of the new york observer  to declare that no movie in my memory has depressed me more than million dollar baby  11in early 2005 the film sparked controversy when some disability rights activists protested the ending wesley j smith in the weekly standard also criticized the film for its ending and for missed opportunities smith said the movie could have ended with maggie triumphing once again perhaps having obtained an education and becoming a teacher or opening a business managing boxers or perhaps receiving a standing ovation as an inspirational speaker 12eastwood responded to the criticism by saying the film was about the american dream 13 in an interview with the los angeles times eastwood distanced himself from the actions of characters in his films noting ive gone around in movies blowing people away with a 44 magnum but that doesnt mean i think thats a proper thing to do roger ebert stated that a movie is not good or bad because of its content but because of how it handles its content million dollar baby is classical in the clean clear strong lines of its story and characters and had an enormous emotional impact 14some commentators  who criticized the fact that the phrase mo chuisle a term of endearment meaning literally my pulse and generally my darling was misspelled in the film as mo cuishle as shown on the back of maggies robe it is translated in the film as my darling my blood although an irish gaelic translation site states that it is always translated as pulse not as blood 15 the original phrase is short for a chuisle mo chroí meaning o pulse of my heart 16 the film has been praised however for stirring renewed interest in the irish language in the u s 16accolades
