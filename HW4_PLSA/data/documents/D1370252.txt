anonymous answered dec 1 2015originally answered what is the list of food we cannot eat if we have eczema i have eczema and the first thing that the traditional chinese doctor told me to cross out of my diet was peanuts this made a lot of sense to me when i was younger and my eczema was in full swing it eventually calmed down and during that time i wasnt eating nuts at all because i was having teeth problems after those teeth problems stopped i ate a lot of peanuts because i really like peanuts and that was around the time my eczema started again also peanuts are everywhere so be very careful when eating stuff like chocolate and certain condiments because a lot of those food items also contain peanuts of course there are other food items that i am wary of such as shellfish especially fresh shellfish i am generally okay with prawns but when i eat prawns that i caught while prawning i break out into hives my eczema areas get itchier and my throat gets scratchy but im okay with frozen prawns which i am guessing is because theyve been processed until the allergenic proteins are gone363 views Â· view upvoters your response is private is this answer useful
