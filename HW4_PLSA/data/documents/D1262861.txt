set point a set point is a theory that states everyones body has a genetically determined range of weight and temperature that their body will try to maintain to stay at optimal health this means if susan has a weight set point of 136 pounds her body will try to stay around that weight if she eats less and exercises more her bodys metabolism will slow down if susan eats more and exercises less her bodys metabolism will speed up this does not mean susan cant ever weigh over 145 pounds or under 120 pounds it means that her body will attempt to compensate for susans eating habits in order to stay in that range proponents of this theory encourage individuals to stay at their bodys set point and to accept it despite social pressures to be thin they believe that the reason people have difficulty losing or gaining weight is because their weight goals are outside of their set point range add flashcard cite random
