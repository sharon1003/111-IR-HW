outline the process of prokaryotic transcription and translation the prokaryotes which include bacteria and archaea are mostly singlecelled organisms that by definition lack membranebound nuclei and other organelles a bacterial chromosome is a covalently closed circle that unlike eukaryotic chromosomes is not organized around histone proteins the central region of the cell in which prokaryotic dna resides is called the nucleoid in addition prokaryotes often have abundant plasmids which are shorter circular dna molecules that may only contain one or a few genes plasmids can be transferred independently of the bacterial chromosome during cell division and often carry traits such as antibiotic resistance because of these unique features transcription and gene regulation is somewhat different between prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic ones learning objectives understand the basic steps in the transcription of dna into rna in prokaryotic cells understand the basics of prokaryotic translation and how it differs from eukaryotic translation prokaryotic transcription initiation of transcription in prokaryotes prokaryotes do not have membraneenclosed nuclei therefore the processes of transcription translation and m rna degradation can all occur simultaneously the intracellular level of a bacterial protein can quickly be amplified by multiple transcription and translation events occurring concurrently on the same dna template prokaryotic transcription often covers more than one gene and produces polycistronic m rnas that specify more than one protein our discussion here will exemplify transcription by describing this process in escherichia coli a wellstudied bacterial species although some differences exist between transcription in e coli and transcription in archaea an understanding of e coli transcription can be applied to virtually all bacterial species prokaryotic rna polymerase prokaryotes use the same rna polymerase to transcribe all of their genes in e coli the polymerase is composed of five polypeptide subunits two of which are identical four of these subunits denoted α α β and β ′ comprise the polymerase core enzyme these subunits assemble every time a gene is transcribed and they disassemble once transcription is complete each subunit has a unique role the two α subunits are necessary to assemble the polymerase on the dna the β subunit binds to the ribonucleoside triphosphate that will become part of the nascent “recently born” m rna molecule and the β ′ binds the dna template strand the fifth subunit σ is involved only in transcription initiation it confers transcriptional specificity such that the polymerase begins to synthesize m rna from an appropriate initiation site without σ the core enzyme would transcribe from random sites and would produce m rna molecules that specified protein gibberish the polymerase comprised of all five subunits is called the holoenzyme prokaryotic promoters figure 1 the σ subunit of prokaryotic rna polymerase recognizes consensus sequences found in the promoter region upstream of the transcription start sight the σ subunit dissociates from the polymerase after transcription has been initiated a promoter is a dna sequence onto which the transcription machinery binds and initiates transcription in most cases promoters exist upstream of the genes they regulate the specific sequence of a promoter is very important because it determines whether the corresponding gene is transcribed all the time some of the time or infrequently although promoters vary among prokaryotic genomes a few elements are conserved at the 10 and 35 regions upstream of the initiation site there are two promoter consensus sequences or regions that are similar across all promoters and across various bacterial species figure 1 the 10 consensus sequence called the 10 region is tataat the 35 sequence ttgaca is recognized and bound by σ once this interaction is made the subunits of the core enzyme bind to the site the a–trich 10 region facilitates unwinding of the dna template and several phosphodiester bonds are made the transcription initiation phase ends with the production of abortive transcripts which are polymers of approximately 10 nucleotides that are made and released view this molecular movies animation to see the first part of transcription and the base sequence repetition of the tata box elongation and termination in prokaryotes the transcription elongation phase begins with the release of the σ subunit from the polymerase the dissociation of σ allows the core enzyme to proceed along the dna template synthesizing m rna in the 5′ to 3′ direction at a rate of approximately 40 nucleotides per second as elongation proceeds the dna is continuously unwound ahead of the core enzyme and rewound behind it figure 2 the base pairing between dna and rna is not stable enough to maintain the stability of the m rna synthesis components instead the rna polymerase acts as a stable linker between the dna template and the nascent rna strands to ensure that elongation is not interrupted prematurely figure 2 click for a larger image during elongation the prokaryotic rna polymerase tracks along the dna template synthesizes m rna in the 5′ to 3′ direction and unwinds and rewinds the dna as it is read prokaryotic termination signals once a gene is transcribed the prokaryotic polymerase needs to be instructed to dissociate from the dna template and liberate the newly made m rna depending on the gene being transcribed there are two kinds of termination signals one is proteinbased and the other is rnabased rhodependent termination is controlled by the rho protein which tracks along behind the polymerase on the growing m rna chain near the end of the gene the polymerase encounters a run of g nucleotides on the dna template and it stalls as a result the rho protein collides with the polymerase the interaction with rho releases the m rna from the transcription bubble rhoindependent termination is controlled by specific sequences in the dna template strand as the polymerase nears the end of the gene being transcribed it encounters a region rich in c–g nucleotides the m rna folds back on itself and the complementary c–g nucleotides bind together the result is a stable hairpin that causes the polymerase to stall as soon as it begins to transcribe a region rich in a–t nucleotides the complementary u–a region of the m rna transcript forms only a weak interaction with the template dna this coupled with the stalled polymerase induces enough instability for the core enzyme to break away and liberate the new m rna transcript upon termination the process of transcription is complete by the time termination occurs the prokaryotic transcript would already have been used to begin synthesis of numerous copies of the encoded protein because these processes can occur concurrently the unification of transcription translation and even m rna degradation is possible because all of these processes occur in the same 5′ to 3′ direction and because there is no membranous compartmentalization in the prokaryotic cell figure 3 in contrast the presence of a nucleus in eukaryotic cells precludes simultaneous transcription and translation figure 3 multiple polymerases can transcribe a single bacterial gene while numerous ribosomes concurrently translate the m rna transcripts into polypeptides in this way a specific protein can rapidly reach a high concentration in the bacterial cell visit this bio studio animation to

translation translation is similar in prokaryotes and eukaryotes here we will explore how translation occurs in e coli a representative prokaryote and specify any differences between bacterial and eukaryotic translation initiation the initiation of protein synthesis begins with the formation of an initiation complex in e coli this complex involves the small 30s ribosome the m rna template three initiation factors that help the ribosome assemble correctly guanosine triphosphate gtp that acts as an energy source and a special initiator t rna carrying n formylmethionine f mett rnaf met figure 4 the initiator t rna interacts with the start codon aug of the m rna and carries a formylated methionine f met because of its involvement in initiation f met is inserted at the beginning n terminus of every polypeptide chain synthesized by e coli in e coli m rna a leader sequence upstream of the first aug codon called the shinedalgarno sequence also known as the ribosomal binding site aggagg interacts through complementary base pairing with the r rna molecules that compose the ribosome this interaction anchors the 30s ribosomal subunit at the correct location on the m rna template at this point the 50s ribosomal subunit then binds to the initiation complex forming an intact ribosome in eukaryotes initiation complex formation is similar with the following differences the initiator t rna is a different specialized t rna carrying methionine called mett rnai instead of binding to the m rna at the shinedalgarno sequence the eukaryotic initiation complex recognizes the 5′ cap of the eukaryotic m rna then tracks along the m rna in the 5′ to 3′ direction until the aug start codon is recognized at this point the 60s subunit binds to the complex of mett rnai m rna and the 40s subunit figure 4 translation in bacteria begins with the formation of the initiation complex which includes the small ribosomal subunit the m rna the initiator t rna carrying nformylmethionine and initiation factors then the 50s subunit binds forming an intact ribosome elongation in prokaryotes and eukaryotes the basics of elongation of translation are the same in e coli the binding of the 50s ribosomal subunit to produce the intact ribosome forms three functionally important ribosomal sites the a aminoacyl site binds incoming charged aminoacyl t rnas the p peptidyl site binds charged t rnas carrying amino acids that have formed peptide bonds with the growing polypeptide chain but have not yet dissociated from their corresponding t rna the e exit site releases dissociated t rnas so that they can be recharged with free amino acids there is one notable exception to this assembly line of t rnas during initiation complex formation bacterial f met−t rna f met or eukaryotic mett rnai enters the p site directly without first entering the a site providing a free a site ready to accept the t rna corresponding to the first codon after the aug elongation proceeds with singlecodon movements of the ribosome each called a translocation event during each translocation event the charged t rnas enter at the a site then shift to the p site and then finally to the e site for removal ribosomal movements or steps are induced by conformational changes that advance the ribosome by three bases in the 3′ direction peptide bonds form between the amino group of the amino acid attached to the asite t rna and the carboxyl group of the amino acid attached to the psite t rna the formation of each peptide bond is catalyzed by peptidyl transferase an rnabased ribozyme that is integrated into the 50s ribosomal subunit the amino acid bound to the psite t rna is also linked to the growing polypeptide chain as the ribosome steps across the m rna the former psite t rna enters the e site detaches from the amino acid and is expelled several of the steps during elongation including binding of a charged aminoacyl t rna to the a site and translocation require energy derived from gtp hydrolysis which is catalyzed by specific elongation factors amazingly the e coli translation apparatus takes only 005 seconds to add each amino acid meaning that a 200 aminoacid protein can be translated in just 10 seconds termination the termination of translation occurs when a nonsense codon uaa uag or uga is encountered for which there is no complementary t rna on aligning with the a site these nonsense codons are recognized by release factors in prokaryotes and eukaryotes that result in the psite amino acid detaching from its t rna releasing the newly made polypeptide the small and large ribosomal subunits dissociate from the m rna and from each other they are recruited almost immediately into another translation init iation complex in summary there are several key features that distinguish prokaryotic gene expression from that seen in eukaryotes these are illustrated in figure 5 and listed in table 1 figure 5 a in prokaryotes the processes of transcription and translation occur simultaneously in the cytoplasm allowing for a rapid cellular response to an environmental cue b in eukaryotes transcription is localized to the nucleus and translation is localized to the cytoplasm
