science  mathematics biology what is atp used for in cellular respiration in biology i have studied all of the energy molecules and their reactions in cellular respiration atp nadh fadh2 but i dont understand what the atp is really used for i have an exam tomorrow and would really love a detailed explanation of atps role after glycolysis follow answers relevance rating newest oldest best answer atp provides energy when it reacts so it is used as an energy source for all the processes which require energy from cellular respiration to muscle contraction in glycolysis 2 atp molecules are used to phosphorylate and activate compounds that will eventually become converted to pyruvate because 4 molecules of atp are produced there is still a net gain source shttpstaffjcccnetpdecellcellresprhttptinyurlcomyj45ctt gas by fannylight 路 7 years ago0 0 comment askers rating re what is atp used for in cellular respiration in biology i have studied all of the energy molecules and their reactions in cellular respiration atp nadh fadh2 but i dont understand what the atp is really used for i have an exam tomorrow and would really love a detailed explanation of atps role after glycolysis source satp cellular respiration httpstrimurlimc25whatisatpusedforincellularrespiration dixie 路 3 years ago0 0 commentatp cellular respiration josy 路 2 years ago0 0 commentit is used for everything  know as the energy currency of the cell  it is used to drive chemical reactions needing energy input functions in cells metabolism synthesis and active transport atp is consumed in the cell by energyrequiring endothermic processes and can be generated by energyreleasing exothermic processes in this way atp transfers energy between spatiallyseparate metabolic reactions atp is the main energy source for the majority of cellular functions this includes the synthesis of macromolecules including dna and rna see below and proteins atp also plays a critical role in the transport of macromolecules across cell membranes eg exocytosis and endocytosis roles in cell structure and locomotion atp is critically involved in maintaining cell structure by facilitating assembly and disassembly of elements of the cytoskeleton in a related process atp is required for the shortening of actin and myosin filament crossbridges required for muscle contraction this latter process is one of the main energy requirements of animals and is essential for locomotion and respiration cell signalling extracellular signalling atp is also a signalling molecule atp adp or adenosine are recognised by purinergic receptors purinoreceptors might be the most abundant receptors in mammalian tissues abbracchio m p et al 2008 in humans this signalling role is important in both the central and peripheral nervous system activitydependent release of atp from synapses axons and glia activates purinergic membrane receptors known as p2 33source s ss 路 7 years ago0 0 comment maybe you would like to learn more about one of these interested in dating sites want to build your own website best home security system earn your mba online
