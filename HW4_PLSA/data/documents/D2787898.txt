straight to the pros – scandalist sep 16 14 at 719scandalist technically yes you can put a x1 in an x16 slot the extra lanes just wont be used however in real life on some computers it doesnt work because the manufacterer has made alterations  superusercomquestions89222…  – robin hood sep 17 14 at 004add a commentup vote1down vote rule of thumb tends to be you can put a smaller pcie card into a larger slot  so a x1 will fit in an x16 if youre trying to put in an pci e x1 card into a pci slot adaptors exist  these use chips that were originally meant for using gpus designed for pcie on pci most systems should have at least one x1 card slot unless this is something like mini itxhowever many modern systems do still have serial port headers its worth checking if you have one getting a suitable adaptor and using that insteadshare improve this answeranswered sep 16 14 at 700journeyman geek ♦109k 40 207 349thanks that makes sense the system does have a serial port but they have two
