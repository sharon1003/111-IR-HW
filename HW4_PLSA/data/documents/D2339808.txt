rich cline good a badly underdeveloped script leaves a fine cast without much to do in this sequel to the 2012 hit reuniting in india the actors find moments of comedy and emotion that help make the film watchable and the big bollywoodstyle finale leaves the audience with a smile on its face but the simplistic plotthreads never amount to much at all which leaves the project feeling like a missed opportunity to deepen the characters and push the premise in more interesting directions business at the hotel in jaipur is booming so managers sonny dev patel and muriel maggie smith are looking for investors to expand into a second property but this distracts sonny from his upcoming wedding to sunaina tena desae and shes not too happy about that there are also two new guests richard gere and

communication all of these momentous plots and a few more swirl around over the course of about a week which means that none ever has a chance to develop it also means that the characters are all so busy with their own stories that they dont interact very much and what contact they do have feels rather contrived as a result the film feels like an awkward mix of disconnected slapstick farce and melodrama that said these highpowered actors can hold together even the flimsiest scene dench and nighy generate some lovely emotional resonance in their contrived storyline while smith finds some quiet pathos in muriels own journey even if the filmmakers seem to have forgotten to hire someone to do her costumes hair and makeup continue reading the second best exotic marigold hotel reviewthe
