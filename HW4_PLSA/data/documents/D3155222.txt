lowlevel pesticide exposure linked to parkinsons disease0february 20 2014 • 108176 views previous next story ataglance a new study revealed 11 pesticides that increase your risk of parkinson’s disease even with very lowlevel exposure – levels lower than are currently being used people with a certain common gene variant had a two to six times greater risk of developing parkinson’s disease when exposed to pesticides separate research has further revealed that ambient exposure to organophosphate pesticides also increased the risk of developing parkinson’s disease minimizing your exposure to pesticides – around your home in your community and via your diet – is an important way to lower your risk of parkinson’s by dr mercola the risk of parkinson’s disease clearly increases with exposure to certain environmental toxins such as pesticides pesticides herbicides and fungicides are potent toxicants that may cause disruptions or damage to the neurological system including your brain what is perhaps most concerning is that even ambient exposure to pesticides has been found to increase the risk of parkinson’s disease considerably 1 and this was further confirmed by new research linking the disease to extremely lowlevel pesticide exposure11 commonly used pesticides linked to parkinson’s even at low levels last year ucla researchers linked a fungicide known as benomyl to parkinson’s disease 2 the chemical was banned by the us environmental protection agency epa after it was determined to be a potential carcinogen that study found that benomyl blocks the aldehyde dehydrogenase aldh enzyme when working properly aldh changes aldehydes which are toxic to dopamine cells into less toxic compounds when aldh is blocked however this transformation does not occur contributing to the development of parkinson’s for the most recent study the researchers revealed 11 pesticides in all that inhibit aldh and increase the risk of parkinson’s disease 3 the effects were seen even with very lowlevel exposure – levels lower than are currently being used in everyday applications the study’s lead author said 4we were very surprised that so many pesticides inhibited aldh and at quite low concentrations concentrations that were way below what was needed for the pesticides to do their job…these pesticides are pretty ubiquitous and can be found on our food supply and are used in parks and golf courses and in pest control inside buildings and homes so this significantly broadens the number of people at risk common genetic variant may raise parkinson’s risk sixfold certain people appear to be especially sensitive to the effects aldhblocking effects of pesticides the study revealed that people with a common genetic variant of the aldh2 gene had a two to six times greater risk of developing parkinson’s disease when exposed to pesticides compared to those without the genetic variant the study reported“ aldh inhibition appears to be an important mechanism by which these environmental toxins contribute to parkinsons pathogenesis especially in genetically vulnerable individuals”unfortunately unless you’ve been specifically tested you’ll have no way of knowing whether you have this particular genetic variant and even those who do have it will have a hard time completely avoiding pesticide exposure since their use is ubiquitous can we still say parkinson’s disease has no identifiable cause parkinsons disease is still classified as idiopathic meaning it has no identifiable cause but one reason it is likely on the rise is due to many environmental toxins that now bombard your body on a daily basis with pesticide exposure becoming an undeniable risk factor according to the parkinson’s disease foundation 5“ epidemiological research has identified several factors that may be linked to parkinson’s including rural living well water manganese and pesticides some studies have demonstrated that prolonged occupational exposure to certain chemicals is associated with an elevated risk of pd parkinson’s disease these include the insecticides permethrin and betahexachlorocyclohexane betahch the herbicides paraquat and 24dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and the fungicide maneb in 2009 the us department of veterans affairs added parkinson’s to a list of diseases possibly associated with exposure to agent orange”separate research has further revealed that ambient exposure to organophosphate pesticides also increased the risk of developing parkinson’s disease 6 rotenone and paraquat are two additional pesticides linked to an increased risk of parkinsons disease and both are lipophilic meaning they resist breaking down in water and accumulate in your fat both are also known to cross your bloodbrain barrier dousing our crops with large amounts of glyphosate — the active ingredient in monsanto’s broadspectrum herbicide roundup – may be another factor in the rising rates of parkinson’s disease we’re now seeing 7 as these residues are found in all virtually all food containing genetically modified ingredients avoiding pesticide exposure – around your home in your community and via the food you eat – is clearly important for reducing your parkinson’s risk as is reducing your exposure to environmental toxins of all kinds exposure to industrial solvents including tce a common degreasing agent and drycleaning chemical has also been linked to parkinson’s disease 8 for instance so along with avoiding the use of solvents and pesticides in your home and garden eating organic foods as much as possible will help you avoid unnecessary exposure to these chemicals another important and oftenoverlooked environmental risk factor is “silver” amalgam dental fillings which actually are more than half mercury mercury becomes a biochemical train wreck in your body causing your cell membranes to leak and inhibits key enzymes your body needs for energy production and removal of toxins mercury toxicity can lead to major inflammation and chronic illnesses such as parkinson’s disease a healthful lifestyle may lower your parkinson’s risk parkinsons disease is a neurological disorder in which neurons in a region of dopamineproducing cells within your brain known as the substantia nigra required for normal movement begin to die as the disease progresses symptoms include increasingly slow motor function tremor when at rest muscle rigidity and abnormalities in your walk up to one million americans currently have parkinson’s disease and 60000 more are diagnosed each year 9as a disease that currently cannot be cured prevention of parkinson’s disease is crucial people over 60 years of age used to make up the majority of those afflicted but with increasing lifestyle factor risks like chronic exposure to pesticides and a generally increasing toxic burden cases are now being reported regularly in people under 50 and even under 40 years of age parkinsons is strongly related to lifestyle choices which is good news because it means there are steps you can take to modify your risk of this disease eating a varied wholefoods diet that includes healthful veggies like peppers appears to be one simple way to lower your risk especially since a lack of folate is also linked to parkinson’s and veggies are the only source of this important vitamin most vitamins contain the semisynthetic analog known as folic acid additionally the following nutrients are also important and may help you to significantly lower your risk vitamin d there is a correlation between insufficient levels of vitamin d and the development of early parkinsons disease it used to be thought that vitamin d deficiency is a symptom of parkinsons but recent research squarely implicated vitamin d deficiency as one of the causes of parkinsons 10 the best way to optimize your vitamin d level is through appropriate midday sun exposure or a safe tanning bed as optimizing your body’s own production virtually eliminates any risk of overdose animalbased omega3 fats these may protect against parkinson’s by preventing the misfolding of a protein associated with a gene mutation in neurodegenerative diseases like parkinsons and huntingtons 11 animalbased omega3 fats contain two fatty acids crucial to human health dha and epa most of the neurological benefits of omega3 oils are derived from the dha which is one of the major building blocks of your brain adding omega3 fats to your diet via wildcaught fish or a supplement like krill oil is important coenzyme q10 co q10 one study found that the progression of parkinsons disease was significantly slower in people taking the highest dose of co q10 12 if you’re taking statin cholesterollowering drugs this issue is particularly important as these medications deplete your body of co q10 making supplementation with co q10 or ideally the reduced form called ubiquinol important green tea green tea’s polyphenols offer neuroprotection that might benefit parkinson’s patients 13 caffeine which is doparminergic stimulates dopamine release may be one more reason why green tea has also been linked to a lower parkinson’s risk in fact the daily caffeine equivalent in two to four cups of coffee may modestly improve parkinson’s movement symptoms as well 14finally your best bet for minimizing health risks from pesticide exposure is to avoid them in the first place by eating organic as much as possible and investing in a good water filtration system for your home or apartment if you know you have been exposed to pesticides the lactic acid bacteria formed during the fermentation of kimchi may also help your body break down pesticides so including fermented foods like kimchi in your diet may also be a wise strategy to help detox the pesticides that do enter your body get my best health
