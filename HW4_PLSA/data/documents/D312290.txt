the president of the senate as such the vp has a more of a procedural role and in the rare case of a tie he or she casts the tiebreaking vote as the president of the senate the vp also presides over the allimportant counting of the electoral college vote which is why the 25th amendment specifies the math qualification test of office mqto for the vp following the 1920 election fiasco when vice president marshall miscalculated 5467 incorrectly reaching a result of 111 instead of 121 if thats all the vp had to do he or she would spend their days at the united states naval observatory playing farm ville for democratic vps or world of warcraft for republican ones awaiting for a tie in the senate or for the president to be incapable of performing the presidential duties however the president typically asks the vp to handle some current issues what these issues are vary from one president to another for example president obama had put vice president biden in charge of oversight of american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 vice presidents cheneys role in the bush administration is almost legendary  but remember whatever the vp does is done at the presidents blessing as these roles are not constitutional they are delegated some vps had very little with which to fill their time most famously the first vp john adams who was not even allowed to attend cabinet meetings when president eisenhower was asked about how nixon his vp for two terms contributed to his administration he answered if you give me a few weeks i may be able to think of something in fairness irwin gellman indicates that nixon engaged in many foreign and domestic issues during his term as vp i guess the short answer is that it depends on the relationship and level of cooperation between the president and the vice president in essence whether they make a true team or just a convenient alliance for electoral reasons  the math qualification test part was a joke i made that fiasco up you should laugh now105k views · view upvoters your response is private is this answer still relevant and up to datepromoted by synccom introducing synccom secure cloud storage get your team in sync

presidency in case something happens to the presidentannnnnd that’s pretty much it unofficially vps are usually chosen for their tactical advantage during the campaign they might be chose for geography to enhance the ticket’s appeal in certain area of the country they might fill a gap in the presidential candidate’s resume — an example of this was obama choosing joe biden to cover for his relative inexperience in foreign affair an older president might choose a younger running mate think john mc cain choosing sarah palin to alleviate concerns about his health  a younger candidate might choose an older vp to lend experience and gravitas obamabiden again or perhaps bushcheney more recently vps will sometimes choose a signature issue or two to champion and will get somewhat free rein to lead on that issue — think al gore on the environment or lbj and the space program again it’s unofficial and all the big decisions still come back to the president’s desk but it can sometimes be a way for a vp to carve out an identity and make a reptuation for himself while still serving920 views · view upvoters bruce mc kinney answered jul 28 2016 · author has 15k answers and 821k answer views the vice president does three things does whatever the president asks that the president could just as well ask of someone else breaks ties in the senate that used to be rare and now never happen waits for the president to die or be incapacitated sometimes the president doesn’t ask the vice president to do anything and there are no ties in the senate and the president doesn’t die and isn’t
