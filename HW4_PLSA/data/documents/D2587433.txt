m n o p q r s t u v w x y z now i know my abcs next time wont you sing with me ask several spanishspeakers how many letters there are in the alphabet and youll get several different answers with or without a song not everyone in the spanishspeaking world agrees on what the official alphabet should look like however the real academia española which is basically in charge of the official spanish language says it should look like thisa b c ch d e f g h i j k l ll m n ñ o p q r s t u v w x y z how spanish got its ñ  the story behind that n with a tilde your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available click here to visit our frequently asked questions about html5 video watch how spanish got its ñso in older spanish dictionaries words beginning with ch are listed in a separate section after the rest of the c words and words beginning with ll are listed after the rest of the l words however in 1994 the royal academy stated that for alphabetizing purposes ch and ll should not be considered distinct letters and so modern dictionaries do not have sections for them this brings the spanish letter total to 29 due to the inclusion of the letters ch ll and ñ other spanishlanguage sources will also include rr as a separate letter raising the possibility of a 30letter alphabet to make matters more confusing still other sources dont count the k or the w since they almost always appear in words that originated outside of the spanish language fun fact the letter e is the most common letter in both english and spanish fun fact the letter w is the least used letter in spanish so how many letters are there the best answer is somewhere between 25 ñ but no k or w and 30 the 26 youre used to plus ch ll ñ and rr just to cover all the bases lets work with a 30letter

spanish letters the future the letters b and v are pronounced so similarly in spanish that sometimes in order to avoid confusion b is called be grande and v is called ve pequeña or something similar its not uncommon in some latin american countries to see signs with spelling errors involving b and v such as se bende instead of the correct se vende the letter e is also pronounced at times more like the e in pet especially when at the beginning of a word or when spoken quickly when a g precedes an e or an i in a word it is pronounced like an h but with a slight rasping sound almost like clearing ones throat due to the limited usefullness of the letter h some including noted colombian author gabriel garcia márquez have called for it to be removed from the spanish language entirely words beginning with k w and x were adopted into spanish from other languages and are therefore extremely rare words beginning with r are usually trilled as if they began with rr eg rojo  rrojo  there are at least four ways to say the letter w in spanish doble ve doble u doble uve or uve doble the w is extremely rare in spanish there are many spanish words borrowed from indigenous languages where the x is pronounced like the english h eg méxico  the pronunciation of the letter z as well as c when followed by an e or an i varies widely in regions of spain c and z are pronounced more like th eg barcelona  barthelona  other notes see also accent marks  special characters spanish letters are all feminine la a la be la ce etc you may be wondering about letters with accents like á é í ó and ú or the rare dieresis ü these are not considered separate letters alphabet is el alfabeto in spanish but you can also say el abecedario which is a word made up of the first three letters of the alphabet like saying abcs alfabetizar means to alphabetize but it can also mean to teach reading and writing
