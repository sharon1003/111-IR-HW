the “how” of a pedagogy of multiliteracies the nlg state “our view of mind society and learning is based on the assumption that the human mind is embodied situated and social”  new london group 1996 p 19  in other words humans develop knowledge not in a general or abstract way but embedded in social cultural and material contexts this view leads the nlg to a pedagogy based on the complex integration of four factors situated practice overt instruction critical framing and transformed practice below each of the four factors will be discussed in turn situated practice is defined as the “immersion in meaningful practices within a community of learners who are capable of playing multiple and different roles based on their backgrounds and experiences”  new london group 1996 p 20  situated practice requires experts to guide the learning community members as mentors and designers of their learning process the nlg 1996 noted that there was significant evidence people learn best when they are motivated to learn and believe what they are learning is in their interest therefore when designing situated practice activities one must carefully consider the affective and sociocultural needs of the learners furthermore evaluation within this area of pedagogy should be used to developmentally guide learners and not to judge them the authors argue that situated practice on its own has several weaknesses some of these are it does not lead to conscious control of what one knows and does not know it does not create learners who can critique what they are learning in terms historical cultural political ideological or valuecentered relationships finally learners may not be able to put their prior knowledge into action for these reasons situated practice needs to be augmented with additional strategies  new london group 1996  overt instruction encompasses “all those active interventions … that scaffold learning activities that focus the learner on the important features of their experiences and activities … and that allow the learner to gain explicit information at times when it can most usefully organize and guide practice”  new london group 1996 p 21  the goal with overt instruction is conscious awareness and control over what is being learned because of this the use of a metalanguage of design is required here too like with situated practice evaluation should be used as a guide to inform further action critical framing involves helping “learners frame their growing mastery in practice from situated practice and conscious control and understanding from overt instruction in relation to the historical social cultural political ideological and valuecentered relations of particular systems of knowledge and social practice”  new london group 1996 p 21  using critical framing the teacher helps the learner gain personal and theoretical distance from what they have learned in order to constructively critique it and creatively apply it transformed practice is embedded in authentic learning where activities are recreated considering the lifeworlds of the learners  new london group 1996  using understandings gained through overt instruction and critical framing students show that they can apply and revise what they have learned in authentic activities it is here during transformed practice that there is the opportunity for situated contextualized assessment of both the learners and the learning process the learning process the unique integration of the four factors situated practice overt instruction critical framing and transformed practice needs to be continually reviewed and reformulated based on these assessments when developing lessons or unit plans the key learning experiences and the learning sequence should be divided into the four elements of teaching practice as outlined above and summarized in the table below the order in which these four elements occur in a given lessons or units learning sequence need not follow the order of the elements as they are listed below instead the order of the elements in a learning sequence should be determined by the content and learning objectives of the lesson or unit and arranged to maximize the lessons or units impact each element should be utilized at least once in a given lesson or unit and depending on the nature and complexity of the content being presented elements or groups of elements may be utilized more then once although the order of elements is not fixed transformed practice is normally chosen as the final element of a lesson or unit as it provides an excellent opportunity for assessment of student learning and instructional effectiveness the four elements of multiliteracies pedagogy situated practice immersion in experience either the various knowledge interests and experiences students bring to school eg ways of communicating or immersion in new experiences that are familiar and make at least half sense when introduced to learners overt instruction describing patterns in meaning explicit teaching eg uncovering the underlying patterns in meaning and communication critical framing locating purpose explaining purposes ie what a piece of communication is for to get what done for whom why transformed practice adding meaning applied learning realworld meanings communication in practice applying understandings to a new
