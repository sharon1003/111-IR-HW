austroasiatic and austronesian twentyone ethnic minority groups have unique writing systems chinese religion confucianism taoism and buddhism are the three major religions in china although it is true to say that confucianism is a school of philosophy rather than a religion buddhism in china buddhism is the most important religion in china it is generally believed that it was spread to china in 67 ad during the han dynasty 206 bc220 from hotan in xinjiang to central china during its development in china it has a profound influence on traditional chinese culture and thoughts and has become one of the most important religions in china at that time three different forms of this religion evolved as it reached the centers of population at varying times and by different routes the social and ethnic background in each location also affected the way in which each of these forms developed and eventually they became known as han tibetan and southern buddhism over its long history buddhism has left an indelible impact on chinese civilization many words and phrases have root in a buddhist origin take a colloquial phrase as an example to hold the foot of buddha at the moment means to make a last minute effort this reveals in a sense the true attitude of the chinese toward the utilitarian aspects of belief many people kowtow to whatever gods they encounter and will burn incense in any temple in literature traces of buddhism and zen are obvious quite a few famous poets in tang dynasty like bai juyi were lay buddhists but this did not prevent them from indulging in a little from time to time just as todays white collar classes go to bars the tang scholars went to restaurants to drink and flirt with the almahs in todays china buddhist temples buddhist caves and grottoes and buddhist holy mountains especially the ones listed in the national or provincial historical and cultural relics have become the hot spots for tourism it is not uncommon for the income of a temple to cover the expenses of a whole county or district website referencehttpwwwtravelchinaguidecomintroreligionbuddhismtaoism in china in the chinese language the word tao means way indicating a way of thought or life there have been several such ways in chinas long history including confucianism and buddhism in about the 6th century bc under the influence of ideas credited to a man named laotzu taoism became the way like confucianism it has influenced every aspect of chinese culture taoism began as a complex system of philosophical thought that could be indulged in by only a few individuals in later centuries it emerged perhaps under the influence of buddhism as a communal religion it later evolved as a popular folk religion philosophical taoism speaks of a permanent tao in the way that some western religions speak of god the tao is considered unnamed and unknowable the essential unifying element of all that is everything is basically one despite the appearance of differences because all is one matters of good and evil and of true or false as well as differing opinions can only arise when people lose sight of the oneness and think that their private beliefs are absolutely true this can be likened to a person looking out a small window and thinking he sees the whole world when all he sees is one small portion of it because all is one life and death merge into each other as do the seasons of the year they are not in opposition to one another but are only two aspects of a single reality the life of the individual comes from the one and goes back into it the goal of life for a taoist is to cultivate a mystical relationship to the tao adherents therefore avoid dispersing their energies through the pursuit of wealth power or knowledge by shunning every earthly distraction the taoist is able to concentrate on life itself the longer the adherents life the more saintly the person is presumed to have become eventually the hope is to become immortal website

peking duck once confined to the kitchens of the palace the legendary peking duck is now served at thousands of restaurants around beijing as well as around the world the origin of the peking duck dates back to the ming dynasty about 600 years ago cooks from all over china travelled to the capital beijing to cook for the emperor it was a prestigious occupation as only the best chefs could enter the palace kitchens a top cook was even able to reach the rank of a ministerit was in these kitchens where dishes of exceptional quality such as the peking duck were first created and crafted to perfection by palace chefs however many of the recipes for such foods of the emperor were later smuggled out of the kitchen and onto the streets of beijing with the eventual fall of the ching dynasty in 1911 court chefs who left the forbidden city set up restaurants around beijing and brought peking duck and other delicious dishes to the masses hotpot in the winter season when chilly temperatures and frigid winds prevail over the land people like to eat food that instantly warms their bodies and lifts their spirits for that the hot pot is a delicious and hearty choice families or groups of friends sit around a table and eat from a steaming pot in the middle cooking and drinking and chatting eating hot pot is not a passive activity diners must select morsels of prepared raw food from plates scattered around the table place them in the pot wait for them to cook fish them out of the soup dip them in the preferred sauce and then eat them hot fresh and tender they can also ladle up the broth from the pot and drink it the high temperature in the hot pot is symbolic of the warmth of tender feeling that those people sitting around it have for each other while the round shape of the apparatus is a hint at the lack or complete absence of irregularities in the mantoman relationship undoubtedly this way of eating is not only a figurative embodiment but a visual indication of the willingness to eat from the same pot and to share the same lot this is the most highly prized merit of group consciousness the hot pot is not only a cooking method it also provides a way of eating it is not only a dietary mode it is also a cultural mode as a dietary mode the hot pot can be used by many people dining together or by one person eating alone yet how few are those solitary diners to be found in a restaurant in a hot pot restaurant its really hard to meet with a customer dining by himherself this is not because the diner wants to economize but because dining by oneself in front of a hot pot is devoid of interest and joy
