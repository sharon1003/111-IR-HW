alguien are you looking for someone no yo no necesito a nadie no i dont need anyone no veo nada aquí de interés i dont see anything interesting here puedo mostrarle algo maravilloso i can show you something marvelous—¿quién pagaría 30 por esa pluma who would pay 30 for that pen—quienquiera anybody would reciprocal vs reflexive pronouns “ourselves” vs “each other”the plural direct and indirect object pronouns nos os and se can of course be used reflexively to mean “ourselves” “yourselves” and “themselves” in this case the “doer” and the recipient of the action are the same these same plural forms may also be used to express reciprocal actions expressing the idea of “ towithforetc each other” or “one another” thus the expression nos miramos can mean both “we see ourselves” for example two of us are looking in the mirror and each of us sees both of us or it can mean “we see each other” we pass each other on the street and each one sees the other one to distinguish between reflexive and reciprocal actions clarifying prepositional phrases are often added the usual clarifying prepositional phrases for reflexives arenos  a nosotros as mismos as  to ourselvesos  a vosotros as mismos as
