return to devils island the toughest penal colony of all time len adams jul 26 2016once feared as the worst place on earth the french guiana prison colony made famous by papillon has now thrown off the shackles of the past to welcome wellheeled tourists531shares  img viathe cruiser taking visitors from kourou on the french guiana mainland to devils island is smooth and swift and the journey passes in an hour but the boat is packed and cresting the whitecapped atlantic swells off the north coast of south america we look enviously at a helicopter bringing in more tourists as we approach royale the largest of the three rocky islands that make up devils island nowadays known by their original name the iles du salut the warm breeze the sight of windbent palms and the smell of bougainvillea gives it a sense of kuoni culture rather than one of the most feared prison colonies anywhere in the world devils island  the infamous green hell of legend  was a place no frenchman would go unless sent by a judge for here and in prisons on the mainland 60000 prisoners endured a living death dubbed the dry guillotine now 50 years after the last shackled convict returned to france devils island has become a macabre tourist attraction boats make regular trips and helicopters fly over the crumbling cell blocks where vines and creepers seek to purge the island of its hideous past but this is just a facade when the tourists have gone after the guide and you stand on the wooden jetty that once echoed to the shuffle of shackled feet its not difficult to imagine the men in shapeless uniforms who died here their ghosts are everywhere in the crumbling ruins on royale the air of colonial france still lingers in the governors house the church the hospital and admin blocks although time and foliage have softened their imposing features the main prison blocks where 2000 convicts were once imprisoned remain an eyesore clad in shapeless red and white striped pyjama pants the prisoners shuffled from the workplaces to the cellblocks thinlipped and holloweyed shadows of men who had long given up hope of escape or freedom advertisementthanks for watchingduring the period of its existence  from 1852 when louis napoleon iii the president of france sent convicts to the colony to do the work once done by african slaves until it shut down in 1946  devils island was synonymous with cruelty its dehumanising process was law and began as each consignment of convicts made the long 15day trip from marseilles to the mainland prison at st laurent ont he northern tip of south america crammed in steel cages below decks 80 to each cage tempers flared as men fought for space nd food any threat of rebellion and jets of scalding steam were directed through the bars from overhead pipes by the end of world war i a converted german freighter la martiniere was carrying its cargo of human misery to the settlements twice a year most of those aboard were replacements for those that had died of beatings malnutrition and selfinflicted wounds but dont forget he added with a hint of menace we have two guardians the jungle and the sea if you dont get eaten by sharks or your bones picked clean by ants you will soon beg to return today flying over the mainland across the chocolatecoloured maroni river from surinam one can look down and see the sprawl of decaying jail buildings and ancient cell blocks long since taken over by squatters the impressive brick entrance is till there to the camp de transportation leading to the vast parade ground where the commandant resplendant in white uniform and pith helmet addressed the ranks of naked new arrivals he said he knew some would try to escape but dont forget he added with a hint of menace we have two guardians the jungle and the sea if you dont get eaten by sharks or your bones picked clean by ants you will soon beg to return then you will be severely punished you will get locked up in solitary the first attempt will get you two years the second attempt will get you fivedeath was the only escape the surrounding sea was infested with sharks the rivers with piranha the jungled teemed with army ants and alligators it was a wildlife roll call of the planets most threatening animal once encamped on royale the prisoners would be forced into backbreaking soulsapping toil naked but for shoes and a straw hat up to their waists in water each convict was forced to cut a stire one cubic metre of hard wood every dady or receive nothing but a lump of dry bread if the timber camps were overcrowded others were put to work on the infamous route zero a sadistically futile roadbuilding exercise in over 40 years of hard labour route zero never passed 25km in length for those who repeatedly broke the strict rules  or on the verge of insanity did crazy things  the ultimate sanction was a living death on the nearby isle of saint joseph known to the convicts as mangeuse dhomme the devourer of men in this jungle hellhole fiendishly designed to break the body and spirit men went mad after years spent in solitary confinement  the reclusion disciplinaire left in total darkness they were forbidden to speak not even to the guards who pushed food through the flap in the heavy iron doors some were bricked up in the individual dungeons cramped cylinders of stone lit only by a threeinch hole high in the wall others were kept in concrete pits with iron bars above their heads find the cells today under the blanket of rotting coconut husks and jungle vines is difficult and for the unwary the first sight of agoutis huge ratlike creatures feeding on fallen fruit is scary everything is wet decayed and haunted push open the rusting remains of a cell floor and part of it collapses inside against one wall are two decaying planks which once served as a bed scratched above barely readable is a pathetic prayer to a god that didnt hear another declares simply a woman put me here in another crumbling cell block where vines as thick as a mans arm embrace the rusting bars the eyes diiscern a narrow corridor with rows of facing doors each side behind each door at least four inches thick is a cramped bare cell there is no window and when the door clanged shut it must have felt like being buried alive in these conditions death often came as a blessed release but even the elite were subjected to a regime so perverse it made oz look like porridge shackled all night unable to twist or turn always prey to vampire bats that roosted under the corrugated iron roofs away from the smell of the damp and decay beneath a blue sky just visible above the canopy of trees you stumble upon a series of concrete pits barred at ground level by rusting iron grids these are the bear pits seven feet wide 12ft long by 12ft high where prisoners were kept exposed to the elements at all times today young palms sprout from fallen coconuts its hard to believe these appalling punishments remained french law until the start of world war ii jailers and survivors would speak of how easily men went mad others reduced to mindless emaciated animals were left in the fetid darkness of the punishment cells waiting to die the forger fredric la grange tells how prisoners in solitary lay on their wooden boards their legs fettered to an iron bar staring at any light coming from a small hole just waiting waiting waiting la grange died in 1964 as a liberte of freed prisoner he was stabbed in the back in a bar in martinique the smallest island  devils island itself still out of bounds to todays visitors  was the dumping ground for the elite of frances highranking political prisoners most notable of all was captain alfred dreyfus falsely imprisoned for spying from 1895 to 1899 and kept in total isolation in 1900 he was pardoned after the publication of novelist emile zolas jaccuse a fierce condemnation of the french governments involvement in what became known as the dreyfus affair but even the elite were subjected to a regime so perverse it made oz look like porridge although there was no chance of escape dreyfus was still shackled all night unable to twist or turn always prey to vampire bats that roosted under the corrugated iron roofs invisible in the darkness despite their huge wingspan the bats waited for their victim to fall asleep then hovering silently over his feet the bat would strike sinking its sharp teeth into the flesh to feed on the convicts blood just one more of the colonys arsenal of horrors despite the virtual impossibility of escape some did achieve it one man who made it back to civilisation was safe cracker henri papillon charriere so called for the butterfly tattoo on his chest framed for murder he was transported there in 1930 from ille de re off la rochelle in france and spent 13 years on royale his best seller papillon published in 1970 was eventually made into a harrowing film starring steve mc queen as charriere and dustin hoffman as fellow convict louis dega who allegedly kept a fortune in francs stuffed up his rectum it was all in vain viewing the sea from the rocky point where the dead were thrown to the sharks one wonders how papillon figured every seventh wave was so powerful that he could be swept out to sea on a sack of coconut shells but that is how he eventually escaped today there are few if any sharks around only turtles but when there was a plentiful supply of bodies their fins were a familiar sight when the bell rang from the prison church this was their cue for feeding time as more bodies would be tossed into the water death was the only escape the surrounding sea was infested with sharks the rivers with piranha the jungled teemed with army ants and alligators it was a wildlife roll call of the planets most threatening animal another convict rene belbenoit also made it back to the outside world after six years on the islands using a hundred dollars earned advising a film crew to buy a canoe full of supplies from a chinese merchant he also wrote of his experiences lugging his manuscript wrapped in oilskin he spent almost a year with a tribe of indians before pushing on through the forests of honduras and guatemala to stagger toothless and broken across mexico and into the united states the resulting book dry guillotine was a publishing sensation printed 14 times in just two months after its 1938 release belebenoits dissection of the islands legacy of brutality was instrumental in swaying public opinion toward the colonys closure but these were the exceptions out of 60000 convicts that sweated and starved in the name of french justice less than 2000 would return alive they were given secondhand clothes by the salvation army and left to fend for themselves so what is the appeal for tourists today partly perhaps because of the movie and maybe a ghoulish curiosity in the atrocities that went on here and what will it be like tomorrow perhaps there will be a mc donalds and a
