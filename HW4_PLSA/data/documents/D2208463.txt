automotive group employs a staff of approximately 1400 workers and enjoyed sales of 125 billion last year the company serves a broad customer base corder says for instance its lamborghini and audi dealerships are highend stores “ but that customer base is a little different than what it is for our chevrolet and kia stores” he states growing from scratch a longtime veteran of the auto industry corder joined findlay automotive group in 1994 previously he worked for general motors acceptance corporation gmac after graduating from college during his time at gmac “i got transferred around to various locations and ended up as the branch manager in las vegas” he recalls it was there that corder met pete findlay’s son president cliff findlay and joined the company in the past 20 years corder has led the company’s growth “when i started we only had four dealerships” he recalls “cliff has given a lot of autonomy to create the organization and develop the people it’s a lucrative business but the best thing has been the ability to help build an organization from scratch“we’ve been able to take a blank canvas and build an organization that makes sense” he describes “as we’ve grown we’ve had to become more structured but we’ve always focused on promoting the right managers and giving them authority to make decisions at the dealership level”giving back findlay automotive group’s success is due to multiple factors including its strong base of employees after more than five decades the company has nurtured a low turnover rate corder says “we’ve given a lot of employees opportunities to grow” he states noting that this promotes stability“every general manager has been promoted within the organization” he says “we’ve helped a lot of people to create a really good career in the car business”another factor corder says is the company’s willingness to take part in its community “ by being a local business that gets involved we get a lot of repeat and referral business” he states “we’re involved in a lot of charities and things that add value”findlay automotive group’s employees also get personal satisfaction from it he asserts “we spend a lot of time trying to make our communities a little bit better” corder says“in the last couple of years we have been heavily involved with the leukemia  lymphoma society and the american heart association” he states “most recently we’ve created a program to help local law enforcement alert teens to the dangers of distracted driving we’re continually looking for opportunities to add value to our local communities”the company

events”up to standards findlay automotive group regularly adjusts to changes in its market which include new government regulations corder says “since the government created the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb there’s been a lot of focus on the finance departments of auto groups” he says the cfpb makes sure that auto groups are staying compliant with regulations while the federal trade commission is focusing on dealership advertising “they have gone out charged and gotten consent decrees from dealers who were violating advertising laws” he says findlay automotive group spends much of its time making sure it meets those legal and ethical standards “that’s the way the entire organization operates” corder asserts “you need to worry about that when you get to be a big organization with a lot of locations”a more aware clientele findlay automotive group’s customers have changed in recent years corder says“over the last couple of decades the customers are more educated” he says “they’ve shopped a lot and accessed information through the internet”because of this awareness auto dealers have had to be more transparent in their processes however “that’s the way we’ve always operated as opposed to the older car dealer techniques” he says noting that those who weren’t as up front “have to adapt now”unique growth findlay automotive group’s growth in the past had been unique compared to others in the automotive business corder says twothirds of its locations he notes are located in franchise territories that it was awarded“we didn’t go buy a dealership as manufacturers opened new territories” he says “we were awarded new franchises because we’ve got good sales penetration”soon “we’re going to be growing into the state of oregon with a couple new dealerships” he says noting that the first oregon location is scheduled to open later this year in a portland suburb “we may grow a little bit through acquisitions too“we’re trying to limit our growth to our current geographical footprint if we can” he says “we’re not looking to grow a long ways from where we currently operate”findlay automotive group also plans to continue its legacy of family ownership the company is in its third generation of family leadership corder says “cliff has three sons that work in the organization as general managers” he explains “they’re looking to pass it on to the kids someday“ that will give us continued growth and we’ll continue what we’re doing” corder continues “we’re in it for the long haul we’ll also continue to provide an opportunity for employees”
