chlorine was first made in 1774 by swedish chemist carl wilhelm scheele who believed it contained oxygen he did this by treating muriatic acid with manganese dioxide thirtysix years later the english chemist sir humphry davy insisted it was a chemical element and gave it its name which is derived from a greek word meaning greenishyellow the substance is a poisonous gas yet when combined with metal sodium it makes table salt chlorine is found in chloride minerals which occur naturally in salt lakes sea water and in rock salt deposits it is a member of the halogen group of elements how does chlorine work to kill bacteria what is chlorine how it is used chlorine is commonly used to kill bacteria in water it is widely used to purify swimming pool spa and drinking water when it is dissolved in sodium hydrate it can be made into chlorine bleach or disinfectant disinfectant is used to kill germs and chlorine bleach is used to whiten clothes and to disinfect chlorine bleach can also be used to sanitize well water how it works when chlorine is poured into water it breaks into several chemical compounds including hypochlorous acid and hypochlorite ion the combination of hypochlorous acid and hypochlorite ion is a reaction called free chlorine both of these substances attack the microorganisms and bacteria in the water by going after the lipids in their cell walls and destroying the enzymes as they destroy the structure inside the cells the chemical compounds leave the bacteria cells oxidized which kills the cell leaving it harmless hypochlorous acid vs hypochlorite ion hypochlorite ion carries a negative electrical charge while hypochlorous acid carries no electrical charge the hypochlorous acid moves quickly able to oxidize the bacteria in a matter of seconds while the hypochlorite ion might take up to a half hour to do the same germ surfaces carry a negative electrical charge which results in a repulsion of the negatively charged hypochlorite ion to the area of the germ surfaces making hypochlorite ion less effective at killing germs the ratio of the two compounds is determined by the relative acidity p h of the water water treatment specialists can adjust the p h level to make hypochlorous acid more dominate as it is more efficient at killing bacteria the hypochlorous acids lack of electrical charge allows it to more efficiently penetrate the protective barriers surrounding germs show comments related articles what is alkaline p h how to rebuild an 18 volt battery how to rebuild your own lithiumion drill battery bleach vs chlorine in a pool how does a low p h affect chlorine levels in a pool the effect of bleach on yeast
