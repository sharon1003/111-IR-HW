law is an unrelated work with a similar name for other uses see tanya disambiguation edition of the tanya printed in fayid from 1974 the 7th leader of chabad encouraged new printings to be made in remote places the tanya  hebrew תניא  is an early work of hasidic philosophy by rabbi shneur zalman of liadi the founder of chabad hasidism first published in 1797 its formal title is likkutei amarim  ליקוטי אמרים  hebrew collection of statements but is more commonly known by its opening word tanya which means it was taught in a beraita  it is composed of five sections that define hasidic mystical psychology and theology as a handbook for daily spiritual life in jewish observance the tanya is the main work of the chabad philosophy and the chabad approach to hasidic mysticism as it defines its general interpretation and method the subsequent extensive library of the chabad school authored by successive leaders builds upon the approach of the tanya chabad differed from mainstream hasidism in its search for philosophical investigation and intellectual analysis of hasidic torah exegesis this emphasised the mind as the route to internalising hasidic mystical dveikus emotional fervour in contrast to general hasidisms creative enthusiasm in faith as a consequence chabad hasidic writings are typically characterised by their systematic intellectual structure while other classic texts of general hasidic mysticism are usually more compiled or anecdotal in nature as one of the founding figures of hasidic mysticism schneur zalman and his approach in the tanya are venerated by other hasidic schools although they tend to avoid its meditative methods in chabad it is called the written torah of hasidus with the many subsequent chabad writings being relatively  oral torah  explanation in it schneur zalman brings the new interpretations of jewish mysticism by the baal shem tov founder of hasidism into philosophical articulation and definition this intellectual form synthesises hasidic divine omnipresence and jewish soulfulness with other historical components of rabbinic literature embodied in the talmud medieval philosophy musar ethical literature and lurianic kabbalah the tanya has therefore been seen in chabad as the defining hasidic text and a subsequent stage of jewish mystical evolution 1contents  hide 1 background to the chabad approach11 early

philosophy and its inner explanations of kabbalah jewish mysticism it offers advice for each individual on how to serve god in their daily life early hasidic movement  editthe first few generations of the hasidic movement established the various approaches of its different schools the third generation great students of dov ber of mezeritch who spread out across eastern europe became the leaders of hasidism in ukraine poland hungary and russia among them schneur zalman articulated a different approach to hasidic philosophy from general hasidism the founding hasidic mysticism of the baal shem tov and subsequent hasidic masters emphasised the emotions of dveikus to cleave to the omnipresent divine the intellectual chabad approach of schneur zalman continued by successive lubavitch rebbes emphasised the mind as the route to the inner heart the chabad school requires knowledge of godliness drawn from hasidic philosophy to establish hasidic mystical faith this enabled schneur zalman to take hasidus to lithuanian jews from nearby white russia and aroused the opposition of their early leaders in this chabad is a separate offshoot of general hasidism and to its students is the profound fulfillment of systematically articulating its inner depths therefore in chabad the baal shem tov and schneur zalman who share the same birthday are called the two great luminaries after genesis 116 according to the midrashic account before the moon was diminished representing heart and mind kabbalah and hasidism  editthe historical development of kabbalah from the 12th century and its new formulations in the 16th century explained the subtle aspects and categories of the traditional system of jewish metaphysics hasidic spirituality left aside the abstract focus of kabbalah on the spiritual realms to look at its inner meaning and soul as it relates to man in this world 2 the founder of hasidism the baal shem tov brought the kabbalistic idea of omnipresent divine immanence in creation into daily jewish worship of the common folk this enabled the popularisation of kabbalah by relating it to the natural psychological perception and emotional dveikus fervour of man the mystical dimension of judaism became accessible and tangible to the whole community outwardly this was expressed in new veneration of sincerity emphasis on prayer and deeds of lovingkindness the unlettered jewish folk were cherished and encouraged in their sincere simplicity while the elite scholars sought to emulate their negation of ego through study of hasidic exegetical thought hagiographic storytelling about hasidic masters captured the mystical charisma of the tzaddik the inner dimension of this mystical revival of judaism was expressed by the profound new depth of interpretation of jewish mysticism in hasidic philosophy great scholars also followed the baal shem tov as they saw the profound meanings of his new teachings the baal shem tovs successor dov ber of mezeritch became the architect of the hasidic movement and explained to his close circle of disciples the underlying meanings of the baal shem tovs explanations parables and stories chabad  editmind versus heart among dov bers disciples rabbi schneur zalman of liadi formed hasidic philosophy into a profound intellectual system called  chabad  after the kabbalistic terms for the intellect that differs from mainstream hasidic emotional approaches to mystical faith this seeks inward jewish observance while downplaying charismatic hasidic enthusiasm that it sees as external the mysticism of schneur zalman did not seek cold intellectual investigation in common with all of hasidism it awakens joy and negation of selfawareness from the jews perception of the divine in all things but in chabad later to be called after its russian village of lubavitch external emotional expression is seen as superficial if devoid of inner contemplation in this vein it is related that the second lubavitch rebbe dov ber schneuri would pray motionless for hours emotional expression was replaced with inner hidden emotional ecstasy from his intellectual contemplation of hasidic philosophy during prayer at the end of praying his hat and clothing would be soaked in perspiration typically he wrote one of the most personal mystical accounts in judaism his tract on ecstasy that instructs the chabad follower in the levels of contemplation this explains his fathers concept of the chabad articulation of hasidism while the baal shem tov stressed the heart schneur zalman stressed the mind but it was a warm fiery mystical intellectualism intellect versus faith by giving hasidus philosophical investigation the chabad school explained the inner meanings of the torah of the baal shem tov its systematic investigation enables the mind to grasp and internalize the transcendent spirituality of mainstream hasidism if the mind can bring the soul of hasidism into understanding and knowledge through logic then its effects on the person can be more inward the classic writings of other hasidic schools also relate the inner mysticism of hasidic philosophy to the perception of each person the aim of the hasidic movement is to offer the jewish mystical tradition in a new internal form that speaks to every person this would awaken spiritual awareness and feeling of god through understanding of its mystical thought mainstream hasidism relates this mystical revival through charismatic leadership and understanding based faith the path of schneur zalman differs from other hasidism as it seeks to approach the heart through the development of the mind chabad writings of each generation of its dynasty develop this intellectual explanation of hasidic mystical ideas into successively greater and more accessible reach in recent times the last two rebbes expressed the spiritual warmth of chabad in terms of daily reality language and relevance in the yiddish translations and memoires of yosef yitzchak schneersohn and especially the likkutei sichos of menachem mendel schneerson chabad hasidus and other dimensions of jewish thought because the approach of chabad explains hasidus in intellectual form it can incorporate into its explanation the other aspects of historical jewish thought complimentary or initially contradictory explanations of jewish thought from rabbinic judaism jewish philosophy and kabbalah can become synthesised into one unity it can connect the different disciplines of mysticism kabbalah and jewish philosophy hakira by relating to a higher essential unity in divinity that harmonises diverse ideas this approaches classic questions of theology from a different route than hakira the jewish philosophers of the middle ages such as maimonides reconciled judaism with greek philosophy their explanations of the nature of the divine are related from mans independent understanding from first principles hasidic thought looks to the inner meaning of kabbalah a conceptual system of metaphysics from mystical encounters with revelation the insights it brings to theological questions brought out in its chabad explanation are related from a mystical higher reality from above when hasidic thought addresses traditional questions such as divine providence immanence and transcendence it offers inner torah explanations of spirituality that can also be harmonised with the explanations of the revealed torah it is the ability of hasidic thought to bring the abstract esoteric systems of kabbalah into conscious perception and mystical faith by relating them to mans inner psychological awareness the ideal of the chabad approach is to articulate this spiritual perception in terms of mans understanding and knowledge 3structure  editrabbi shneur zalman legendarily published his likkutei amarim anonymously in 1797 later editions incorporated additional writings by shneur zalman the latest version of this work dating from 1814  citation needed consists of five parts sefer shel beinonim the book of the average men this book is a hasidic guide to the psychological drama of daily jewish spiritual life it describes how contemplating the mystical greatness of the creator and the union that a jew has with him through the torahs commandments can achieve the love and fear of god necessary for sincere worship this approach is the fundamental theme of chabad teaching to achieve emotional refinement during prayer and jewish observance however in the path offered this emotion must stem from intellectual understanding of hasidic mysticism that is why this approach and the movement are called chabad after the three intellectual sephirot gods emanations in kabbalah chochmah wisdom binah understanding daat knowledge a hasidic psychology of a jews two souls 4 is investigated the divine soul and the natural soul the divine soul is a true part of god a historic emphasis in jewish thought though based on earlier sources the books guidance is for the intermediate person who is tempted by natural instincts while the service of the true tzaddik in mystical thought is transcendent and only involved with holiness shaar hayichud vehaemunah the gateway of unity and belief this book outlines the theological background to the first sections hasidic life it is an investigation of the meaning of gods unity in hasidism the panentheism all creation takes place within god taught by the baal shem tov is systematically articulated in kabbalistic philosophy god is all but all is not god two levels of gods unity are both paradoxically true based on the kabbalistic doctrine of the tzimtzum in the lower unity all creation is nullified to god in the higher unity creation is an acosmic illusion as only god truly exists the apparent plurality in creation is only an effect of the concealments of divinity the origin of everything is nullification within the divine unity iggeret ha teshuvah letter of repentance this gives the hasidic interpretation and chabad method of teshuvah return to god this section is also known as the tanya katan brief tanya as it is the gateway to all personal spiritual redemption it describes the mystical return that not only leads to forgiveness for the sins but can fully enable the repenting person to be elevated to a spiritual place that is higher than where they were before the sin in hasidism any spiritual descent is only a preparation for a higher ascent two levels of teshuvah are described based on their meanings in kabbalah the lower teshuvah redeems sin the higher teshuvah brings constant elevation unconnected to sin because of this the founder of hasidism taught that even saintly tzadikim are able to be inspired to do teshuvah iggeret ha kodesh letter of holiness this section was not published until 1814 after rabbi shneur zalmans passing it is a collection of letters which the author wrote to his disciples and different hasidic communities in which he talked about mystical aspects of certain commandments such as charity torah study or in general all commandments concerned with physical deed today it is used as a source of certain indepth concepts of the written hasidism not concerned specifically with emotion felt during service or repentance it is a more esoteric and detailed work of kabbalistic commentary than the previous sections schematically it would relate to a person who had internalised the fundamental first three sections and could progress higher kuntres acharon last thesis this section was not published until 1814 after rabbi shneur zalmans passing it is also a series of letters in which the author resolved certain seeming controversies in kabbalah this section is an even more indepth investigation of profound mystical notions than the previous one like the fourth section it can be seen as an addition to the first three fundamental sections in general the first book is a universal jewish guidebook to avodah everyday divine service through schneur zalmans innovative system applying jewish mysticism stepbystep to the internal drama of human psychology as a formative approach guidebook in judaism the english translator of the first section in his introduction compares its position with maimonides guide for the perplexed but contrasts the spiritual guidance aim of tanya with the philosophical aim of maimonides the second sections philosophical exposition of hasidic mystical panentheism is the underlying foundation for contemplation methods in the first part and gives the theoretical definition of hasidisms theology of god the third section guides individuals in a habad hasidic approach to repentance to be able to prepare more deeply for the first parts guidance the last two added sections give more complicated and indepth hasidic exposition of kabbalistic concepts the author uniting abstract ideas with the importance of everyday service and an emotion that must accompany it these discourses are similar to the exegetical commentaries of schneur zalman in his other works though here they sometimes take the form of letters to his followers with more direct advice subject matter  editmost of the works first part the book of the average man the beinoni serves as a fundamental and basic guide to the spiritual service of god unlike other early hasidic works this book is not a collection of sermons or stories but rather a systematic exposition of shneur zalmans philosophy lubavitcher hasidim are enjoined to study from this work each day as part of chitas  an acronym for chumash tehillim and tanya the rebbes of chabad taught that it is a sacred duty to publish and distribute this book as widely as possible the tanya seeks to demonstrate to the average jewish man or woman that knowledge of god is there for the taking that spiritual growth to ever higher levels is real and imminent if one is willing to engage in the struggle 5 although many view the tanya as a work of explanation on kabbalah or jewish mysticism its approbations make clear that tanya is first and foremost a book of advice in the practical service of god levels of divine service  editthe tanya describes five levels the complete tzaddik righteous person has transformed his animal soul completely to the point that it is able to reach intense godly delight in its connection to godliness and is disgusted by all worldly pleasures 6the incomplete tzaddik no longer desires evil in a way that will be externally expressed even on the level of thought however a minute amount of desire for very subtle evil remains 6the beinoni lit intermediate one possesses an animal soul that still desires evil but he succeeds at constantly restraining himself from sin in action speech and even thought this however requires ongoing tension and struggle this struggle is not simply the confrontation between good and evil but rather the ongoing encounter between ones two souls  the animal and the divine  the soul that draws downward toward the earth and the soul that aspires upward toward hashem 7the incomplete rasha evil person has committed sin without doing teshuva but does good deeds as well 8the total rasha has sinned so frequently that none of his thought speech or action are controlled by the divine soul though it remains in an external state of makkif attached to him and he is exclusively controlled by his animal soul 8jewish criticism  editmain article jews as a chosen people § alternative kabbalistic and philosophical views the tanya’s concept of two souls and the statement that the souls of the gentile nations of the world are different from those of jewish souls emanating instead from the realm of evil have been controversial various writers have asserted that this idea has the potential to either develop into or to provide support for racism 9 or that it endorses a kind of metaphysical racism 10 or that it is a dangerous and indeed racist idea and contrary to normative jewish belief 11the description in the tanya of soul differences follows on from a particularist universalist debate in judaism concerning the meaning of jews as a chosen people among medieval jewish philosophy yehudah halevi follows a protokabbalistic approach that distinguishes jewish and gentile souls while maimonides describes a universalist rationalist approach kabbalistic mysticism follows halevi developed in hasidism however nonliteralist universalist readings have been found among kabbalists and hasidim in normative chabad righteous gentiles have souls similar in divine receptivity to jewish souls while jews can be distanced from divine consciousness consequently the tanya has been read as describing two universal levels of psychological consciousness  citation neededexposition  editin chabad the tanya is said to be the written torah of hasidic philosophy for it is the first work of hasidic philosophy recorded by its own author in contrast to the works of the baal shem tov and the maggid of mezritch whose words were transcribed by their disciples 12 this implies that the teachings of hasidic philosophy in general are all an exposition of the tanya just as the torah teaches that the entire purpose of the oral torah is to elucidate the written torah in his preface to the tanya the author writes that anyone with questions about the meaning or application of the tanya s guidance should approach the great ones in his city in chabad hasidic parlance such a guide is known as a mashpia such a person is trained by his predecessors in correct application of the tanya many works have been written explaining the tanya in particular the lubavitcher rebbes reshimos on the tanya ha lekach veha libuv shiurim be sefer ha
