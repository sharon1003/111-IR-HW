replies to css profile last question  how to get a fee waiver1sybbie719super moderator posts 20745super moderator12012010 at 1041 pm there are no codes to waive the fee on the css profile the profile service provides fee waivers automatically to domestic u s citizens or eligible noncitizens firsttime students from families with low incomes and limited assets fee waivers are not available to international students in an effort to reach as many qualifying students as possible the profile fee waiver process is fully automated based on the family and financial information given in the application profile fee waiver guidelines are as follows • the profile fee waiver program applies the usda reduced price lunch income guidelines to the css institutional methodology im definition of total parent income total parental income includes both taxable and untaxed income with the exception of the earned income credit more information about current reduced price lunch income guidelines may be found at school meals • parental assets are also included in the fee waiver eligibility assessment dependent students whose parents report net assets in the excess of 341202 are not eligible for a fee waiver • the fee waiver covers the application and six total school reports firsttime students file an average of three profile reports thus the fee waiver process meets the needs of most entering students • payment is not required until the application is submitted when students submit their applications they will be notified of their charges or their fee waiver receipt • students who do not qualify for the fee waiver or who need to submit their reports to more than six schools may pay for their profile charges using a credit card debit card online check or a fee payment code

the financials at app time this college claims need blindness and yet requires financial info for an answer hmmm ok lesson 1 need blindness is an admissions process the only thing being need blind does is that your having a financial need whether it is a 1 or the full cost of attendance will not be a factor in admitting a student to college meeting demonstrated need is a financial aid process at schools that give institutional aid you need to submit their forms if you want their money if the school requires the css profile then you need to submit the profile i understand in these hard economic times that 25 can be a stretch however it is a small price to pay if you are getting somewhere upward 40k in institutional aid if the college board deems that you are not eligible for a fee waiver then you have to decide whether you want your son to apply to profile schools you can contact the fa office explain your situation and find out if there is another way you can send your fa information but if they only use the profile then you may be stuck the fafsa is free but the only thing it does is qualify you for federal aid however most fafsa only schools do not meet 100 demonstrated need so you may not have the  that you need reply3roderick registered user posts 1488senior member12022010 at 241 am there are no codes to waive the fee on the css profile i saw waiver codes yesterday in the final payment screen maybe the codes were being soliciated since i did not satisfy the auto waiver criteria the profile fee waiver program applies the usda reduced price lunch income guidelines my kids are in the federal reduced lunch program we recv food stamps and energy utlility assistance there was a rigorous checking of lots of info for this parents report net assets in the excess of 341202 are not eligible for a fee waiver does this include home and 401k assets maybe this was the problem i have 70k home equity this ia joke too since a home is what you can get right now and under this criterion i have less than 70k equity i am using an incorrect def indexing formula for which the css asks data  and over 34k in 401k assets all other assets are below that threshold gosh i hope i filled out this rather byzantine circuitous form out correctly if this were the only school that i was paying 25 and 25 for something that i might not even avail myself of i might not be as upset but there are many more schools to apply to since the schools are pretty selective  a wide net vs fishing rod approach is a prudent approach to follow to increase the odds of a match but the problem here is that 25 or is it 16 multiplied my many more schools becomes odd since the fa comes after admissions which cd be a reject and just plain expensive for someone w food stamps this is apparently nutz if we had heard of qb in time we cd have tried that program which i understand helps w the fees reply4boogaloony registered user posts 78junior member12022010 at 250 am i received such codes directly from colleges i simply told them that i was an international student ineligible for college board waivers and that paying  16 for every universitycollege i apply to would be highly prohibitive for me and my parents whose cumulative monthly income is  very small i wrote this email to the fin aid offices of many colleges and received either alternatives forms for requesting fin aid or fee waiver codes reply5roderick registered user posts 1488senior member12022010 at 307 amtypo i am using an incorrect def indexing formula for which the css asks data i was using an incorrect fed indexing formula for which the css asks data  ok booga i s just ask for the codes from the colleges see what they say sure it telegraphs your financial status  but theyll find out how poor you are soon enuf  but apparently i am not poor enuf nowgosh i hope i filled that thing out correctly it would be nice to have a preview or model feature to make sure you are on track and things are reasonable the college that i was applying to pointed me to the efc calc tool on cb and to pick whatever method that gave me the greater efc fm or im as my guide they said that this is very accurate at their school and others on cc corroborated this but this is hard to fathom since that preview tool just asks for a few items of info vs the real css is something like 20 or more pages it seemed wont this get some help next yr when the feds mandate having free realistic and accurate price preview in place for all colleges that want to continue to recv fed monies reply6roderick registered user posts 1488senior member12022010 at 323 am if the college board deems that you are not eligible for a fee waiver then you have to decide whether you want your son to apply to profile schools when i ran the preview tool that the college advised me to use  the efcs gend both im and fm were well under the colleges threshold for full need aid then why wouldnt the fee watching code in css give a waiver i wonder either the preview tool and the real thing have a synch problem or i put in different data in both the css has numerous questions that admit to differing interpretations and even with the catch all of other  thats scary when computers are involved next year in jerusalemreply7roderick registered user posts 1488senior member12062010 at 518 am parental assets are also included in the fee waiver eligibility assessment dependent students whose parents report net assets in the excess of 341202 are not eligible for a fee waiver i have confirmed from css that the 34k in parental assets do not include assets from 401k but does anyone know whether the 34k asset threshold includes assets from home equity  reply8macmill registered user posts 422member12062010 at 532 am there is a way to get a waiver code when you are prompted for a paymentjust email the admissionsfinancial aid of the particular college and ask them for the css profile waiver code then enter this code underfee payment codes in the profile you will need to email each college you are sending to ask for the codei believe every college has a unique waiver code did this and saved myself 25 bucks the other day reply9roderick registered user posts 1488senior member12062010 at 707 amthanks i saw in a corelated thread below that anyways i didnt get one because in order to qualify the income  all assets business home must be lower than 34k the guideline is poorly written since it mentioned assets when assets plus income is actually used to develop the programmatic threshold
