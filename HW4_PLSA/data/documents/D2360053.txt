the names origin to terang ganu malay for bright rainbow  5 another story said to have been originally narrated by the ninth sultan of terengganu baginda omar tells of a party of hunters from pahang roving and hunting in the area of what is now southern terengganu one of the hunters spotted a big animal fang lying on the ground a fellow party member asked to which animal did the fang belong the hunter not knowing which animal simply answered taring anu malay fang of something the party later returned to pahang with a rich hoard of game fur and sandalwood which impressed their neighbours they asked the hunters where did they source their riches to which they replied from the land of taring anu which later evolved into terengganu 5 terengganu was called trangkanu  thai ตรังกานู by the siamese when it was under their influence terengganuans usually pronounce terengganu as tranung or ganu chinese naming  editthe traditional chinese name for terengganu has been 丁加奴  pinyin dīngjiānú which is a direct transcription of the malay name however in recent years the chinese community in terengganu has raised objections to the name citing that the characters used loosely translate to giving birth to a child who will become a slave chinese 添 丁加 做 奴  therefore they successfully petitioned the regulatory commission for chinese language in malaysia to change the chinese name for the state to 登嘉楼 pinyin dēngjiālóu which can be loosely translated to aspiringstepping up to a higher level in september 2004 it is worth noting however that the new name has been in unofficial use by the states chinese society for at least 30 years before its official adoption there are certain segments of the chinese society who opposed to the name change citing the fact that the new name contains too many character strokes making it much more difficult to write they have proposed to revert the name back to the version used before 2004 but with the word 奴 slave which was mainly the cause of the controversy to the similar sounding but more positive 努 perseverance indian naming  editthe traditional indian name for terengganu has been tringganu since the land was once hindu influenced the name tringganu or triangganur is believed to be named after the hindu deity lord dattātreya lord dattātreya is identified as the personification of the hindu trinity or trimurti namely brahma vishnu and

power over terengganu after winning 24 out of 32 seats in the 2008 general elections prime minister pm abdullah ahmad badawi put forth the reappointment of datuk seri idris jusoh to a second term as menteri besar in what political analysts described as a possible constitutional crisis trouble began to precipitate after the sultan of terengganu tuanku mizan zainal abidin who is also the then yang dipertuan agong king of malaysia refused to reappoint and swear in idris as menteri besar 15 similar problems occurred in the state of perlis where the pms choice was also rejected in which the latter eventually gave in to its sultan 16the sultan of terengganu appointed ahmad said instead for the job with the regency advisory council handing him the letter of appointment the pm claimed that the appointment of ahmad said was unconstitutional as it went against the wishes of the assemblymen and the prime ministers office who have supported idris jusoh candidacy for menteri besar 17in spite of threats to strip ahmad said of his party membership for disobeying the leadership he went to the office in wisma darul iman to begin the first day of his new appointment on 25 march 2008 the party announced earlier that they made good on their promise to remove his membership which technically disqualifes him to be appointed as menteri besar in the first place 18 the ruling also planned to vote down the sultans choice through a motion of noconfidence by 22 umno state assemblymen the opposition party parti islam se malaysia in the meantime promised that its assemblymen would support ahmad said as menteri besar 19on 26 march 2008 however pm abdullah ahmad badawi and sultan mizan zainal abidin met at istana negara to resolve the deadlock 20 the prime minister reversed his stance and decided to accept the kings appointment of ahmad said as chief minister of terengganu 21 22 he also apologised to the king for the public spat over the appointment of the menteri besar explaining that there was no intention to disparage or humiliate the royal household the apparent backdown was due to threat that the royal household would be prepared to dissolve the state assembly if the motion of noconfidence was initiated against ahmad said which would trigger another election in what is already a climate of discontent towards the ruling party and the possibility of dissenting assemblymen defecting to the opposition 23the umno supreme council proceeded to endorse ahmad said as the new menteri besar of terengganu with the resolution of the impasse ahmad said expressed his gratefulness on his appointment and paid tribute to idris an old friend he has known since university for the work he has done for the terengganu people so far and to seek his advice after the swearing in ceremony where the duties are handed over from idris he also expressed hopes in moving on to discharge his responsibility to the people and eradicate poverty within the state 24 25the state executive council
