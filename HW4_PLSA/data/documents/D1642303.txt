what’s the deal with last names in spain january 28 2009 by erik category spain 52344 views rate this post  12 votes average 467 out of 5loading for outsiders visiting or learning about spain the system of surname inheritance in spain may seem very strange and foreign not surprisingly all nonspanish systems seem pretty weird to spaniards humans have a tendency to think “we know what we know and we assume that our way of doing things is the best” that’s one of the most eyeopening things about traveling and learning about other cultures you learn that the way you and your country have always done things is not the only way to be a contented expatriate you have to become very accustomed to saying “huh that’s different it’s not necessarily better or worse but different from what i’m used to ” everything has pros and cons in this post i will attempt to explain the spanish system of last names to nonspaniards there are four basic rules to surname inheritance in spain everyone has two last names your first last name is your father’s first last name your second last name is your mother’s first last name women do not change their last names when they get married that’s it that’s the whole system to spaniards the fact that women in some countries change their last names when they marry seems like a loss of identity “how can you just give up who you are like that” they say occasionally they will play the feminist card and claim that giving children only their father’s surname is chauvinistic and that the spanish system isn’t because it values the surname of the mother but if you look closely the spanish system is only valuing the mother’s father’s surname the truth is that women’s surnames do get lost in spain it just takes another generation to do so here’s a family tree to illustrate the process the names have been anglicized and the last names have been reduced to initials for clarity another way to write rules 2 and 3 from above would be your first last name is your paternal grandfather’s first last name your second last name is your maternal grandfather’s first last name a consequence of this system is that your siblings because they have the same mother and father all share the same two last names and yes it is quite common for someone to have two identical surnames if their grandfathers had the same common surname another consequence is that you can’t refer to a nuclear family unit as “the joneses” or “the simpsons” in spain i suppose you could refer to tommy susie and their parents in the diagram as “the a e family” but it’s almost never done and there’s really no need because the concept of the nuclear family unit is so fuzzy in spain no one has a middle name in spain but it’s fairly common to have multiple first names eg juan carlos maría josé luis miguel etc sometimes these are contracted to names like majo or luismi and some people have two first names but only use one when a spaniard becomes famous it is quite common when referring to the person to drop the most common of the two surnames josé antonio domínguez banderas – antonio banderas penélope cruz sánchez – penélope cruz josé luis rodríguez zapatero – josé luis zapatero i’m not sure if this is done mainly to avoid confusing nonspaniards with all the names or if it is just to shorten things because famous people are talked about a lot i suspect the latter and there you have it i hope that you agree that this spanish system is different but not necessarily better or worse than what you are accustomed to related posts sunday soccer on sunday we went to mondragon to see two soccer matches organized in honor of marga’s uncle jose luis who passed away in february the first was between two teams of tenyearolds that jose luis had coached and the second

get lost in spain you can have the maternal surname before the paternal surname luis • 2 years ago yes but only because a very recent law added that option and it is still very unusual except among very strongly feminist women as far im concerned angela • 7 years ago excellent explanation this is also true for most latin american countries guest • 2 years ago pablo • 1 year ago this is not true in all spanish speaking countries in argentina the norm is to only have one single surname your father surname anw25 • 6 years ago one more thing you missed nowadays under equality of genders law spanish children can be borned with their mothers surname instead of their fathers as it was tradition example helena a e marry antonio h t and they have children their children can be a h or h a thats something helena and antonio have to discuss reach a mutual agreement of which surname survives m • 2 years ago the best part about this system is that you can track all your family surnames and know how your ancestors were named spaniads do not have two surnames though tehy only use two of them they have as many as they can track or remember art • 8 years ago hi therein the past it was true that with our system the mothers last name got lost as it was always put in second place after the fathers but the law was changed at some point and now couples can decide to give their last names to their children in any order the only thing is that the order has to be the same for all the children they have so brothers and sisters have the same combination of last names so in your example james and sara could decide to name their children tommy a e and susie a e or tommy e a and susie e a in reality though not many couples dedide to put the mothers last name first perhaps because of lack of knowledge perhaps not my two eurocents ricardo chavez • 2 years ago that is the same in all hispanic american countries sarah rodriguez • 5 years ago im american and married a mexican man but we live in the u s so we decided to follow my customs and i took his first last name his two last names are rodriguez trejo people ask what do we do etc but its up to each person what they want sometimes in mexico mexicans will not understand we are married and think we are brother and sister because we have the same last name and i just explain to them that in my country the family adopts a single name its no big deal i am proud to have my husbands name javi • 2 years ago it must be a chaos for all you papers and places where you are registered no by the way if someone asks my name id say my name and my first surname not both of them so i guess that you should adopt the first one i am spanish not latinamericanroman v • 6 years ago i know why spaniards have two surnamesit is really easy if you think about itwhats the best way to identify a jew judaism is transmitted thru the motherso two surnames identify if your mother is jewish or not very clever josé maría rubio jiménez • 2 years ago thanks for the article im a spaniard trying to find something useful about the topic from the point of view of a non spaniard so this is just what i needed when traveling abroad things go worse when your official name is multiple just as you mentioned my name is josé maría contracted chema and my two surnames are rubio jiménez you just cant figure out how hard and how many problems this can bring when youre on the go i had to change and repay for an entire round flight ticket because the travel angency used my second surname and forgot about the first one when booking a whole trip or the very common misunderstanding at the us borders just to say the point is that next time i will carry a printed copy of this in order to go on with my trip normally and dont spend four hours trying to explain to the officer some common sense showed in the first paragraph of this article and then the rest so he or she may find some logic about my name therefore they dont get me stuck looking at my passport while scratching their heads and probably thinking i should be a cheater a terrorist or worse  only because they dont understand spanish surnames erik r • 2 years ago brilliant comment chema thank you thats so sad that they made you repurchase airline tickets the worst ive had to do is use my surname twice on my mobile contract it amuses me to think of someone unfolding one of my blog posts to present to the immigration authoritiesnadia madrid • 3 years ago my last name is madrid andres • 8 years ago im from chile and in chile we have both our fathers and mothers last name as well as a middle name we have to use our full name everything except the more basic day to day activity females in chile that get married do not change their name they instead add their husbands last name to theirs example if maria sofia alvarez pardo got married to luis alberto vazquez sanchez her new name would be maria sofia alvarez pardo de vazquez only her marriage license would have this all of her personal documents would still have her birth namexavi • 8 years ago in some places in latin america it was also customary when a woman got married to substitute her second last name with her husbands last name so for example if mirta lopez gatica got married to diego sotolongo alvarez she may be called mirta lopez de sotolongo i think this was more common among the upper classes i dont think that in spain they will do that but in italy sometimes its used trapezountiosayahoocom • 2 months ago i would never change my name or surname as that indeed is a loss of identity and it is very macho as it is in the anglo world to expect the women become property of the husbands family or the silly explanation i hear from women in england and in the us among other countries that they want their kids to have the same last name as theirs but the kids will have the husbands last name and why would you change your identity because of someone the kids that have not even come to life so the womans whole identity is always dependable on others insane im greek by nationality and grew up in a spanish speaking country neither in both cultures women change their names naki • 1 year ago famous people drop his most common surname in the examples domínguez sánchez and rodríguez are very common surnames like a smith in english so they choose the one that has most personality like and artistic name snapman • 2 years ago that is why i only have one last name because i dont want to go through all that name call stuff good luck with two to three names lol victoria rosa sturley • 2 years ago solving some inaccuracies spanish people do have middle names many have 2 or 3 a nuclear family unit is named after the surnames of the kids for example my nuclear family of origin is called the rosa sturleys however if its my dads family then its the rosas and everyone knows each rosa who is not a sibling will have another surname either before or after rosa also its not just famous people who drop one surname its everyone we tend to use the first one but if that one is common we will use the second surname for example pablo ruiz picasso was known as picasso miriam • 2 years ago my friends brother had a daughter and she has her mothers surname first he was ok with it as long as he could chose the babys girl and i only have my mother surnameskevin • 4 years ago supposedly your fathers name is first on your documents can you still use your mothers last name instead and pass it down to your children rather than your fathers victoria rosa sturley • 2 years ago yes you can scb • 5 years ago love it i consider the hyphenated name a twist on this quite frankly i have spanish heritage through my mothers side however my last name is the typical american fathers last name and i rarely know my father was thinking of switching the hyphen to put my mothers maiden name with my husbands as he suggested was also thinking of just choosing a familial spanish name that was shorter from my maternal line i do not think its such a big deal to end up with two names or for each subsequent generation to get a different name because our mothers constantly change their name each generation in america as you can see by your very example only one name disappears but each name can be called a maternal name and a paternal name because of who you got it from either your mother or your father in iceland they have patronym and sometimes matronyms and each generation that will be different as your father or mother is different from your grandfather or grandmother gh • 5 years ago this is in mexico too  ashly • 6 years ago so say youre a nonspanish woman that marries a spanish mandoes she just take the first last name as well victoria rosa sturley • 2 years ago in spain women dont change their name the only people who have the same last names are siblings so having the same last name as your husband is kind of creepy for us trapezountiosayahoocom • 2 months agoexactly its a lack of identity to have someones surname its losing your heritage worse if the couple divorcesand the woman keeps the surname erik r • 6 years ago most women i know that have done that dont change their names at all bea216 • 6 years agohow does it affect a spanish woman marrying an emglish man in englandbawa • 6 years ago when i got married in the uk 25 years ago we asked about how i could follow the spanish custom of keeping my name the legal answer was there is no law in england that says a women has to take on her husbands surname and give up her own it is a matter of social convention that women change their surnames if you do want to change you go around to the banks and stuff with your marriage certificate and they will do it for you but its entirely up to you lastly you might want to register the marriage with a spanish consulate if you want to get a libro de familia erik r • 6 years ago thats entirely up to the woman getting married robinbooth • 6 years agobrill explanimation well done keep up the good work this is great understood loveltyly i love you eddy • 7 years ago obviously thus equally as obvious drop the paternal surname joking aside i but speak for myself albeit as a man anyway i merely wanted to point out to the crowd that there are some groups including many  albeit still a minority of  indonesians that value the mothers surname more than that of the father cheers ed eddy • 7 years ago have a look at the link that ive pasted below for an example of a mexican whose numerous surnames he has far more than two are all but one from what he calls the female line eg maternal and paternal grand mothers not grand fathers only the mens surnames getting lost there you cant argue that that isnt less chauvinistic can you erikhttpuserspanolacomaag erik r • 7 years ago no of course not at some point either the paternal or maternal surname must be dropped otherwise wed all end up with 2supnsup surnames kathy • 7 years ago i am writing a work of fiction in english about spain readers will be confused at the nontraditional method of names im worried no one will realize who is related to whom and how will it be an insult to spaniards if i refer to characters as senor sanchez his wife senora sanchez and their son ramon sanchez javi • 2 years ago its not an insult it just sounds fake by the way saying señor in front of the surname sounds very southamerican to me in spain we dont use that anymore but in very serious situations julie • 7 years ago why not just include a family tree at the end or check the novels of famous spanish and latin american writers it really cant be that confusing at all plenty of english speaker have read a work such as don quixote or 100 years of solitude etc just make sure you understand it if you dont then your readers wont but if you do understand than that will come through erik r • 7 years ago i suppose there are always accuracy vs readability tradeoffs when writing novels set in foreign countries i dont think spaniards would be insulted theyd just know that you got it wrong like if a spaniard wrote a novel set in the us and assumed everyone had two surnames its up to you and how authentic you want it to be if youre not going to market your novel in spain then i imagine that most readers would never know the difference kat • 7 years ago hi i am really confused i understand the wholse spanish process with regards to the names and think that its great i lived in barcelona for a bit and my boyfriend is from there we have recently been wondering though  when we get married what will happen to our surnames could anyone help me i have looked all over the internet for the legal ramifications but cant find anything i am english and therefore it would feel a bit funny for me not taking his name but also it would be very strange for him if i did because then it would be more like i was his sister when we are in spainwould it be possible to use one thing in england and one in spain please help me thanksxx katsx • 6 years ago i had completely forgotten that i posted this a year ago my boyfriend an i got engaged last month and have just started searching the internet again re the name issue you are all completely right and i am coming around to the idea of not changing my name i think its more the fact that in england on the wedding day so much is made of talking about mr and mrs blah blah that i just find it a bit strange anyway it will be lovely for our kids to have my surname as well  thank you for taking the time to help mexx mia • 7 years ago am in a similar situation as you are in at the moment my problem is that my surname is extremely hard to pronounce here in spain and dont really like the alternative that our future children will have a name that is that complicated to spell is it even possible in spain to register a surname that has letters that dont exist in the spanish alphabet but since we most likely will end up living here i guess it would be very odd if our entire family would have the same last name although i personally like the idea of it since it for me symbolizes that a family is a unit another thing is that if i decide to change my surname will i only use his first surname or both of them alex • 7 years ago you have a hard question there erik has replied adequately i dont know about laws so i can only help you with the obvious things mentioned above as it is said if you live in spain and get married there your original surname s will remain without changes you are just mentioned in the civilian registry as married with this man and also by the equality law you have the right of surnames transpotition if you have children with that man they could have as the first surname your own surname or his an example if you are called katherine smith and your husband is called enrique guerrero your children could be guerrero smith this is by default or smith guerrero erik r • 7 years ago nothing will happen to your surnames automatically you would have to request any changes you want its really completely up to you what i dont think you can do is have one name in one country and another in another just because you dont want to seem weird in either your relationship is multicultural some things from one culture are gonna seem weird to the other side of the family if i were you i wouldnt change my name and just let your family back in england deal with it that requires the least paperwork and hassle deborah • 8 years ago soif an english woman with one surname obviously marries a spanish man what does her surname become or does it follow the same rules and doesnt change plus if they have children do the same rules apply the fathers first surname followed by the mothers erik r • 8 years ago obviously youre allowed to do whatever you want but yes thats typically what happens the few expat women i know who have married spaniards have both kept their maiden names and given their maiden name has their kids second surname silvia • 8 years ago the common people always end up copying the style of the rich and famous and it did with the fashion of the second surname gradually everyone added a second surname usually the mothers surname in the midnineteenth century came a law to regulate definitively the spanish surname system i do not remember the date sorry i do not know english im using a translator lorenzo bohme • 8 years ago silvia es muy interesante lo que me has escrito y te lo agradezco así mismo quiero identificar el decreto que hizo obligatorio el uso de los dos apellidos in english thanks very much for this interesting information you have sent me i still want to know exactly what law made it compulsory to use two surnames← budapest opera tweeting on hold →
