dashiell hammett the writer given credit for creating the modern detective novel remains a mystery himself but clues to solving the mystery of his early years can be found in his connection to butte montana hammett wrote short stories and novels about private detectives and they are universally acclaimed as some of the best ever written his novels include red harvest the maltese falcon the glass key the dain curse  and the thin man dashiell hammett drew upon his experiences as a pinkerton operative for his stories about navigating the mean streets of america he worked as a pinkerton detective from 1915 to 1922 one operative who worked with him said that dash as he was known could follow a suspect without being seen better than anybody one time he blended in so well that the man he was following got lost and asked him for directions without even knowing that he was being followed hammett claimed that he once shadowed a suspect for six weeks through a half dozen small towns without being detected hammett took pleasure in exposing inexperienced mystery writers by revealing inconsistencies in their stories that he recognized from his own experience as a private detective such as pointing out the difference between a revolver and an automatic pistol hammett tended to embellish his accounts of his detective years in later interviews for example hammett confided that he was offered 5000 to murder frank little an organizer for the industrial workers of the world hammett said that he turned down the offer but on august 1 1917 five men carried little from his room dragged him behind a car and then hanged him from a train trestle on the edge of butte more than likely thoughhammett was in baltimore maryland in 1917 he was working for pinkerton at the time but probably on the east coast as a rookie operative still learning the trade from his mentor there james wright who would become the model for the continental op in his detective fiction that would follow like the claim that he was offered a fee to murder frank little other claims of his detective life are equally hard to accept he claimed that he had to shoot a man one night defending a powder magazine in butte he described another incident when was hit in the back of the head with a brick thrown by a striker that left a permanent dent in his skull as an unpleasant reminder of his work in montana lillian hellman later related a story that dash was hit over the head with a brick but it happened in an alley in san francisco while following a suspect hammett didnt realize he had a partner who slipped up behind him with a brick it is impossible to corroborate any of what hammett claimed in later interviews because he or hellman are the source for all of them and his reputation as a hardboiled detective writer depended on his selfpromotion as an experienced detective according to his biographer richard layman in shadow man  in a half selfserving half playful manner he characteristically amplified his stories rewriting revising even inventing accounts of his experiences
