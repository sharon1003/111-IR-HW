news gtaroad kill 3000 raccoons 1300 cats and more are casualties of city streets annually ever wonder where road kill goes after scavengers get their chance its picked up by city employees like katherine low by patty winsa urban affairs reporter fri may 25 2012katherine low pulls over when she spots the family pet kindly bagged by a neighbour and disposed of at the curb in black plastic with a white label that reads “dead cat”she hops out of her big white van onto a quiet street near mt pleasant rd and davisville ave opening the vehicle’s side doors so she can stuff the opaque package into a clear plastic bag a reminder that she will have to transfer the animal into it later the cat’s body will spend the next seven days in a freezer just in case its owners come looking for it “other owners let their dead pets get cremated through the city’s shelter system” says low “saving the expense of doing it themselves”the sky is darkening and the lights are on in the local baseball field by the time she gets back in her van and logs the outcome of the call it’s just one of many that low will respond to in the night hours as she picks up the domestic creatures and wildlife that are casualties of the big city road kill is the less nice name about 7500 animals are disposed of annually by toronto’s animal services mobile response unit a list that includes skunks snakes foxes groundhogs and even chickens although no one can figure out why the latter is crossing the road the star mapped the city’s data by ward for 2011 almost as many cats are killed as squirrels each year — about 1300 — which low says may be due to the high volume of feral felines she sees their numbers are “staggering” but they could also be outdoor cats that are allowed to roam the death of so much urban wildlife while sad is not an indication that animals can’t live in the city instead it shows that they adapt really well“when you see those animals dead on the road one of the impressions — and this is natural for people to have — is that they’re not adapting well that they’re highly vulnerable to that type of mortality” says stanley gehrt an associate professor at ohio state university“in reality it turns out when we radiocollar and track them they’re actually really really good at crossing roads and learning traffic patterns” says gehrt “it’s just that when they do it enough times eventually they get hit by a car”gehrt started studying chicago’s wildlife 16 years ago at a time when there was so little research being done that everything he learned was new chicago changed a policy that allowed raccoons to be trapped in the city and relocated in the wild after his research proved the move spread disease“we’ve been able to document that raccoons have a very high survival rate even when they live next to really busy roads” says gehrt coyotes can judge not only the flow of traffic but the speed and foxes and deer have similar abilities not so for the animals low sets out to retrieve next on a route she planned before she left the office the calls for dead or injured animals made directly to animal services or through the 311 call centre are responded to within 24 hours her expert eye spots the grey rabbit against the faded concrete curb and she pulls over on the north toronto street the animal is bagged and added to a big green garbage pail in the back that will begin to smell funkier which each additional thump“sometimes it’s not the most exciting but it has to be done” says low who works a 7 pm to 7 am shift that is new added last fall when animal services decided to centralize its emergency and mobile response unit on eastern ave previously calls were dealt with by separate divisions around the city but the change made after toronto’s core services review leaves daytime employees more time to deal with bylaw enforcement and emergencies“sometimes it can be very solitary as it gets later into the night” says low who works six 12hour shifts and one 8hour shift during a twoweek period tonight she grabbed about 10 — or half — of the calls but the night before it was 20 and sometimes it’s as high as 40 low’s next call is for a raccoon on mc cowan and she heads east across the city on the 401 empty metal cages in the back rattle and hum a big plastic cooler which another employee has added bumps around it’s dark but low spots the dead animal in the road’s centre median lane she pulls the van over and reaches down between the bucket seats past the cans of pet food and errant leashes to activate the switches that turn on flashing rooftop lights for safety the semisquished raccoon is added to the tub in the back before she continues on dead animals are cremated by the city injured domestic pets are taken to a vet while injured wildlife will go to the toronto wildlife centre if the animal isn’t put down low’s training as a veterinary technician helps her make that decision the city retrieves about 3500 raccoons each year animals lured into the city mainly by edible and accessible garbage“we are responsible for a lot of that” says gehrt the ohio professor garbage “will dictate their lives the numbers of animals will go up dramatically their reproductive rates will go up and their survival rates will go up”that’s why he tried unsuccessfully to get chicago officials to put lids on trash cans in parks chicago doesn’t keep statistics the way toronto does gehrt and his team drove through the city systematically recording thousands of dead raccoons over eight years and there were probably many they didn’t record coyotes will drag away deer and raccoons hit by cars but animals aren’t the only road kill scavengers“the biggest challenge we had was getting to these animals before people did” says gehrt “they eat deer and they’ll eat raccoon too and beaver is apparently eaten by quite a few people” in the chicago area “so when beaver get hit they disappear pretty fast” many of the animals — beaver muskrat foxes and even raccoons — are also valued for their pelts of the 10000 road kill calls toronto gets each year about onequarter of the animals are gone by the time workers respond those figures don’t include animals killed on expressways or highways which are picked up by the city’s transportation department or the provincial transportation ministry as low drives farther east across the 401 in response to instructions from dispatch to search out a wobbly raccoon in a resident’s backyard she says it’s the emergency calls that save her job from being “routine”she and her colleagues rescue orphaned wildlife — cats are responsible for a lot of that at this time of the year — and deal with injured domestic animals they also answer calls from police often to shelter a pet when the owner has been arrested last month low picked up a coyote shot dead by police near cherry beach the animal was killed when it approached an officer during an investigation although police described the coyote as aggressive — much like the infamous beach coyote — gehrt says that’s usually not the case chicago has thousands living in the city and the animals live off rabbits rodents fruit and deer most are unseen because they hide in the green wildlife corridors that connect city parks coyotes only turn to the “dark side” and become a nuisance when human food becomes readily available“originally the belief was that they didn’t belong in cities and that if you saw a coyote that it needed to be removed because it was ultimately going to be a threat or a danger to people or pets” says gehrt “what we’ve been able to demonstrate repeatedly year after year is … they cause very few if any conflicts or incidents”“it’s much easier to manage our behaviour than it is to manage theirs” he adds on this night low’s latest assignment might not be a break from the routine of collecting the dead it’s pitch black and she’s searching blindly in a massive backyard trailed by a neighbour looking for a raccoon that is probably long gone the wildlife cage is empty when she gives up and puts it back in the van data analysis by hidy ng top 10 animal casualties the majority of
