beef  main course  slow cooker crock pot beef carnitas tacos the people have spoken and they want a savory recipeor so twitter told me last night when i was trying to decide whether to post these tacos or a cake recipe guess you’ll just have to wait till monday for the cake please come backyou know though i don’t think there’s anything wrong with tacos on a friday yep i’d say this is a pretty darn good recipe to leave you with this weekend i hadn’t brushed off the ol’ crockety pot in quite some time so what did i do stuck some steak in it these tacos are off the chain does anyone still say “off the chain” a lovely piece of flank steak gets a spicy rubdown before sitting in the crock pot for eight hours with onion bell pepper and jalapeno never thought to put steak in the crock pot well let me tell you—it can be doneflank steak is typically a tougher cut of meat i accidentally just wrote “me” instead of “meat” here…it’s a tougher cut of me too that usually requires a lengthy bath of marinade not in the slow cooker the meat literally just cooks in its own juices all day long when 500 rolls around you’ll be ready to go with your shredded beef carnitas or here’s an even better idea stick all the stuff in the crock pot right before bed when you wake up the beef is readyhere’s what your meat should look like after eight hours this is man food if there ever was such a thing—perfect for upcoming football seasonnow put that shredded spicy beef on top of a tortilla with salsa cilantro lime juice and avocado and you’re set check out these cute little baby hass avocados i found the other day at a farmstandit’s the little things in life folks you’re not really set yet though—i lied you need a margarita oh yes you do get it crock pot beef carnitas tacosserves 68print this

good but i’m pretty sure it’s incorrect to call beef “carnitas” right especially shredded – i think carnitas are for little hunks of meat replyjenna july 27 2012 at 817 am well i was unsure about that too actually so i looked it up and found out that since carnitas technically does mean “little bits of meat” shredded beef does fall in the carnitas category as well i learned something too reply christena july 27 2012 at 501 pm i thought carnitas  pork ooopsreply simon august 17 2012 at 537 pm i think traditionally carnitas is made with pork at least the carnitas i’ve had has been pork but any slow cooked meat is delicious and will do it’s great to serve them with a side of radishes i don’t know why but it worksreply mark muñoz september 6 2012 at 903 am i would recheck your sources as this is not carnitas carnitas are purely pork they are slow cooked much like this in their own fat all day and left in chunks so as to get the outside of the chunks a nice crispy texture but the inside moist and juicy if you are ever served anything other than the above and are told its carnitas they have taken liberties because making good carnitas is an art form and they probably messed it up along the way reply jessica october 9 2012 at 1042 am i’m shocked more people haven’t weighed in on this as it was the first thing i checked mark is absolutely correct tosay that carnitas are purely pork and involve specific methods of preparation wikipedia agrees as well “carnitas literally “little meats” are a type of braised or roasted often after first being fried pork in mexican cuisine ” i don’t mean to be nitpicky but it’s a signficant difference especially when you live with someone who doesn’t eat pork angela april 23 2013 at 327 pmin a literal translation it is carnitas  little meat… in mexican cuisine my being mexican and not by any means a chef this would be more like barbacoa northern mexico literally barbeque or birria seca as known in the south carinitas here in mexico is always referred to as pork all this being said this recipe looks amazing and spot on for a traditional taco filling whatever you want to call it boboseptember 4 2014 at 511 pm that is what my mexican buddy says when i read it was steak i was thinking…not carnitas hwuay reply maria g zoctober 4 2013 at 1108 pm mark is completely right about the meaning and way of cooking “carnitas” if they’re not made out of pork they are something else reply the meaning of me july 27 2012 at 903 am very nice never did think of putting steak in the crock but this has inspired have a lovely weekend

longer like 11 hours or will it dry out i would love to start using my slow cooker but it i ussually about 11 hours from when i leave for work and get home looks amazing replyjenna july 27 2012 at 627 pm okay so i’m really not sure about this one but i would assume it would be fine they definitely will not dry outif your slow cooker has a timer i would probably set it for eight hours but if not i’m sure it would be okay reply anneke march 19 2013 at 131 am i leave it in the slowcooker for about 12 hours for it to be cooked enough to be able to pull it apart it tastes greatreply amanda  becoming

what a great recipe i am going to test it and i expect it will go into my regular rotation i have but two recipes i got of the internet at one time or another and both years ago which have gone into the regular rotation and oddly they are both mexicanstyle one is a turkey chili recipe in the crock pot and one is a cilantrolime chicken fajita recipe my husband will love these and i am sure i will too did anyone ever say “off the chain” i think it was “off the hook” where i lived reply liz july 27 2012 at 1152 am i’d like to make a recommendation…i call my slow cooker a “crock pot” but it is really a hamilton beach model which my husband bought before i knew him it’s great – you have a rather shallow metal base with the heating element and it comes with three very heavy white ceramic bowls of different sizes which are not encased by the base – they sit in it and most of the bowl is well above the base but the ceramic material conducts heat very well it’s like having crock pots of three different sizes plus the bowls actually look pretty nice so you can just take them and go if you need to bring food somewhere i like to imagine my husband cooked lots of crock pot meals for himself in his single days but the truth is that he bought it so that he could bring food to work for potlucks and fundraising sales some committee sometimes has he would cook up frozen prepackaged stuff in it but it would look like his own reply beverly july 27 2012 at 227 pm i love that you recommend a margarita in the blog post and in the serving directions i feel the same wayreply emily

please let me know also my slow cooker is pretty old and runs hot i slow cooked drumsticks the ither day for 6 hours and they were dry reply erika june 5 2014 at 620 pm this was tasty i will say that i think flank steak is not the right cut of meat to use in this type of recipe usually when i make crock pot beef tacos i use chuck roast or cross rib roast this meat altho very tender was stringy which i didn’t care for however the flavors were really good so i will use the rest of the recipe oh i also used 3 serranos instead of jalapenos as we find them more flavorful i also added some extra toppings as i had leftover ingredients from fish tacos a couple nights ago i’ve been on a taco kick lol some sliced red onions that u had marinated in lime juice sour cream sauce which is sour cream lime juice cilantro  sliced green onion i also added shredded angel hair lettuce which i placed on top of the tortilla before the meat just some other topping ideas to get your juices flowingi love mexican foodreplydave june 7 2014 at 311 am i make mine with whatever roast is on sale i us either a cajun blend of seasoning creole or mrs dash spicy no need to make a special rub i spray my roast with olive oil and if it is very lean i might add just an ounce of water to the pot never comes out dry if you put too much water in you can add alittle instant white rice an hour before finished it will soak up the water and flavor giving extra body to the meat reply denise june 8 2014 at 144 pm yummy but …carnitas is pork carne asada is beef reply mark dahlin june 8 2014 at 607 pm loving this recipe i am actually drooling on my keyboard i have to go get a mopreply autumn june 17 2014 at 714 pm ok to make with pork still no liquid reply phil june 18 2014 at 732 am i’d probably put the half the onions and peppers on the bottom then the steak then the rest of the onions and peppers the veggis are going to provide the liquid that steams the meat and having some on bottom ensures no sticking probably works either way just a bit safer with something between meat and cooker i do a similar prep for pulled pork using a pork shoulder or butt although i do add 2c of water overnight on low cool and pull the meat then back in the cooker save the liquid and use as soup stock or for cooking rice or noodles with favorite bbq sauce for about an hour on low reply mark june 18 2014 at 1049

the wrong name carnitas is porke meat and flank steak is beef…… i cook and have salsa……reply taco guy july 24 2014 at 837 am i cook all sorts of meat pork chicken beef in my crock pot to make tacos all the time flank steak is a great piece that that is 100x better grilled i would substitute the flank steak for a cheaper piece of meat like a london broil after being in a crock pot for hours it all pretty much ends up as the same end product save your money and do it with a cheaper cut also try it with a cheap pork shoulder roast and give it a quick pan fry after pulling it apart to crisp it up to make some carnitas reply walter july 24 2014 at 916 am actually this would be abuse of flank steak save it for grilling if you’re doing the meat in the crock pot spend less and get the same flavor from either bottom or top round or chuck the spice rub won’t impart that much flavor or heat and needs a bit more “oomph” this is a hint at “mexican” flavoring suitable for delicate tastebuds put some heat in itreply dan pseptember 1 2014 at 1145 am in the crockpot we have a huge family so i tripled the ingredients also used chuck steak because that is what another recipe said to use and

jorge september 4 2014 at 603 pm sorry this is just not that good of a recipe and certainly not worthy to pay 899lb for flank steak sorry just sayinreply len september 5 2014 at 1049 am i have never tried the steak before but pork carnitas are a favorite in my household i use a pork butt in the crock all day seasoned with salt pepper and garlic powder i usually cut the pork in 1″ cubes before putting them in the crock just before dinner i put the pork in a baking dish and pour some homemade salsa verde on top i put that in the oven at 450 degrees for ab out 10 minutes to get a nice crust on top i serve with corn tortillas or just on top of rice i cannot wait to try it with the steak reply leticia carreon september 6 2014 at 952 am these are not carnitas “carnitas” does not mean slowly cooked meat carnitas are pork and only pork the pork is slowly braised in its own fat for a long time depending on where they are cooked they may add orange juice or caramelized sugar even coke the point is for the meat to come off the bone and be sweet and juicy and you don’t add any marinades you do not rub the meat these are not carnitas reply camp jpseptember 7 2014 at 1239 pm i’m an experienced home cook and i tweaked this very good recipe right off the bat first of all i doubled the amount of “rub” when i saw how much 2lbs of meat was secondly i bought skirt instead of flank steak skirt steak has a lot more fat in it that i figured would hold up better to 8 hours of cooking the doubling of the rub truly turned out to be just right two pounds is a lot of meat and i don’t like underseasoned food i see a lot of pessimism from the other commenters about “no liquid” in the crock pot i have very good knife skills but because i was in a hurry transitioning from breakfast to this recipe i used a small food processor for the veggies by the time i was done i’ll bet i had close to a cup or more of juice from the veggies i’m gonna guess knife work would eventually although maybe not immediately result in the same by the time the product was done there was easily more than two cups of liquid gold in the crock pot lastly if you like spicy you could easily add cayenne or another two or three jalapenos with seeds and membrane or a habanero as i saw someone say they did lastly i recommend you don’t omit the lime juice the acid cuts the fat nicely and i made emerile’s pico de gallo as a condiment reply angela september 10 2014 at 1034 am i just made this last night and i was not happy with it at all it smelled heavenly but it just didn’t taste like it smelled very bland and i even added a habanero maybe i needed to use more spices i rubbed the steak down with spices and let it sit overnight i cooked the very expensive flank steak for 8 hours on low as stated and mine came out very chewy it was awful not sure if over or under cooked not happy and not sure i would try again oh and you definitely do not need to use liquid this made so much liquid i was
