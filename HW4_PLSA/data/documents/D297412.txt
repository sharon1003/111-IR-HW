fall  2013published on november 6th 20133neorealism in international relations – kenneth waltz by jo jakobsen ntnuneorealism – or structural realism – is the bedrock theory of international relations starting from a simple set of assumptions it seeks to explain how states in particular the most powerful ones behave and how they interact with each other on the international arena neorealism – or structural realism – is a theory of international politics the theory is usually associated with kenneth waltz 1924–2013 and his 1979 book bearing the obvious name theory of international politics that book endeavored to construct a very general framework for explaining recurring patterns of state behavior and state interaction in the international system as is the case with all theories there are many things that neorealism fails to explain in fact most types of state behavior and state interaction cannot usefully be accounted for by waltz’s parsimonious theory thus it is that neoralism has attracted many adversaries in the academic world much – but by no means all – of the criticism neorealism faces is really of a straw man character neorealism is often faulted for failing to explain or predict events or behavior that neorealists have never set out to explain or predict in the first place every theory claims its own domain neorealism’s consists of the biggest issues – past present and future – in international relations war the avoidance of war power balancing power seeking the death of states security competition and arms races alliance formation and the like even then neorealism on its own is usually unable accurately to account for the specifics concerning each case of war or of the avoidance of war or of power balancing or power seeking or of the death of states or security competition and arms races or alliance formation if a student’s objective is say to acquire a fairly encompassing grasp of why the u s invaded iraq in 2003 or why the cold war ended exactly when it did neoralism on its own is inadequately suited for such a task but neorealists can easily and with some justification claim that their theory is almost always the natural and necessary starting point – a logical firstcut – when the events or developments under study represent the “big” issues in international politics like the u s invasion of iraq or the end of the cold war neorealism is often called “structural realism” which signifies that the theory primarily centers on the effects of the structure of the international system when it seeks to explain outcomes in international politics in waltz’s conception of structure two things are especially noteworthy about the international system firstly the international system’s ordering principle is anarchy this simply means that there is no such thing as a world government there is no higher authority above the main units that exist in the system – the states furthermore this results in an international system that is essentially a selfhelp system consisting of states that are autonomous functionally undifferentiated actors each of which must always be prepared to fend for itself the units of the system closely resemble each other with regard to the functions they perform the tasks the face the primary goals they seek with survival always being the fundamental goal on which the attainment of all other objectives rests and how they go about accomplishing their objectives the main point is that under anarchy each and every state by and large operates on its own without having recourse to any higher authority the second defining principle of the structure of international politics is the distribution of capabilities across the units inhabiting the international system capabilities or power vary significantly between states states though functionally undifferentiated are differentiated according to how much power they possess variations in power yield variations in the types and magnitude of structural constraints that states face thereby effectuating variation in how states behave or should behave these two simple assumptions – anarchy and the importance of the distribution of power – result in the famous image of international politics as a “pool table” consisting of balls whose inherent properties shape the material they are made of etc are essentially the same however the sizes of the balls vary greatly and on the proverbial pool table the smallest balls – and indeed the mediumsized balls as well – tend to congregate around the corners where they more or less stay put the largest balls on the other hand can be found roaming about the whole table often interfering with the smaller balls sometimes knocking them over dominating the game and determining how it is being played out we can use the cold war as an example the second world war had changed the structure of international politics not in terms of ordering principle the system was still anarchic but in terms of the distribution of world power which had been fundamentally altered by 1945 the old multipolar world had gone two great powers remained – the soviet union and the united states the superpowers of the new bipolar world what this meant for the old great powers of europe – germany great britain and france – was that their freedom of action their security relations and indeed their overall fate were suddenly severely constrained by the shifts in the balance of power they were structurally constrained inasmuch as they could no longer afford to view europe as an isolated realm of a world where security power and prosperity were almost exclusively a product of intraeuropean interaction in light of the perceived threat from communist soviet union neither west germany nor the uk or france could act as producers of their own security they were simply too weak to follow the strategy of internal balancing instead they had to rely on external balancing by soliciting american protection by way of an alliance europe had become consumers of security and had no choice but to accept significant u s influence in european affairs as the price for her friendship neither could the british or the french uphold their respective worldwide empires on this score these two demoted great powers were structurally constrained as regard their global reach the power resources necessary to continue dominating faraway places were not any longer in the possession of paris or london economically they were both significantly weakened militarily they were both significantly weakened in the end and after the point was hammered home to them by events such as dien bien phu the suez crisis and the algerian war retrenchment became accepted as the only sensible option on a more positive note however the shifts in the balance of power also resulted in constraints being placed on the european states in terms of the efficacy and rationality of engaging in security and power competition given that america functioned as the continent’s security provider it was no longer required of france to view germany as the major threat and competitor and germany rationally didn’t have to fear france or any other west european nation neither of these states would gain much from choosing guns over butter none would be able to balance the soviet union on its own in any case engaging in serious security and power competition against each other would indeed be counterproductive irrespective of perceptions of national goals or eventual revanchism as long as the overriding question was and needed to be how to relate to the two true consequential states of the time – the u s and the soviet union peace in western europe no more hinged on the relations between germany france and the uk but rather on the relations between a the u s and the ussr b western europe and the u s c western europe and the soviet union one of waltz’s main points is that such structural constraints that arise from the distribution of power force or induce states to act in certain ways and avoid acting in others as rational actors – or at least we should assume that they are rational actors – states tend over the long haul at least to choose the means that best help to realize their objectives the fundamental objective for any state is to survive – for if survival is not ensured all other goals the state may have will be rendered unachievable a more elusive version of the term survival is the slightly broader notion of “security” as a matter of assumption neorealists highlight security as a key objective of states waltz tells us that states generally aim to maximize security according to neorealism if states are to be secure in an anarchic world they need to pay heed to the structural constraints under which they operate simplistically stated powerful states can and indeed should or must “do more” than less powerful states interests expand as relative power increases still even the most powerful states shouldn’t get too excited about the powerprojection opportunities that arise simply from having great capabilities nazi germany lost the second world war because it gaped over more than it could chew faced with selfinflicted opposition from and constraints provided by the united states and the soviet union it could scarcely have won the war following the strategy it did trying to maximize power and expand the reich ever more knowing where and when to stop – ie acknowledging and abiding by the structural constraints of the system – is vital for any state that seeks successfully to fulfil its objectives key among which is security the united states – a postwwii superpower – expanded greatly after 1945 in the sense that starting with western europe it assumed global responsibilities of an unprecedented magnitude it did so because a it could ie it had the capabilities to do so and b it was perceived to be in the interests of national security to do so as relative power increases interests expand – and they also expand geographically the u s increased its influence in and over western europe quite rapidly in the late 1940s and early 1950s that was in a sense terra nullius for washington they had to fill the vacuum in the wake of the world war lest communism do so instead soviet communist control over western europe or alternatively good old security competition within western europe would clearly work to the detriment of the united states with regard to its security economic and ideological interests the u s were commanded to expand big nations have big goals however the u s was also structurally constrained during the cold war whereas goals can be pretty much unlimited the actual achievement of these goals critically depends upon – again – the distribution of capabilities across the international system the u s could not even if it wished to which it surely did achieve complete world dominance they could not shape the world completely according to its own image they could not do this because of the existence of a countervailing power visàvis the soviet union the soviet union balanced the power of the united states whereas the united states balanced the power of the soviet union the soviet union could not expand militarily economically or ideologically into western europe for the simple reason that the united states acted as a check on such expansion likewise the united states could not expand militarily economically or ideologically into the soviet union’s sphere of influence for the equally simple reason that the soviet union acted as a check on such expansion such a check – such balancing – represents a structural constraint on expansion a structural constraint on the achievement of hegemony the concept of the balance of power plays a key role in neorealism considering the ultimate objective of survivalsecurity hegemonic aspirations by others constitute the key threat to the units of the system as states arise that have the means or capabilities to expand others need to react lest they face the risk of extinction or in any case a loss of sovereignty autonomy or control over their own fate hegemonic threats in other words need to be balanced in an anarchic world the peculiar thing about bipolarity waltz has famously and rightly stated is that on a global scale at least only the two superpowers possess the means required to balance each other having allies helps but for purposes of balancing they are all disposable under bipolarity hence if the u s had failed to abandon its isolationist grand strategy of earlier times the soviet union’s influence would quite likely have expanded and vice versa if the soviet union had failed to assume responsibility of checking the expansion of the united states in europe and eventually across the globe the united states would quite likely have expanded even further but waltz also says that states are normally and gradually socialized into accepting the view that power needs to be balanced you never know when a revisionist state appears on the international stage a lack of proper socialization – a lack of acknowledgment of the risks out there and of the appropriate means of facing the risks – can have catastrophic consequences for national security this is not to say that states are automatically socialized into behaving sensibly it does not mean that they automatically learn from their own or others’ mistakes states indeed falter from time to time in the 1930s a series of key “mistakes” were made by france and great britain visàvis the threat posed by adolf hitler the common denominator of these mistakes was that they overall represented relative ignorance toward the salience of power balancing nazi germany was not properly balanced the result was world war ii and with it the end of france and great britain as great powers above i have stated that the soviet union acted as a check on u s power the united states could not expand its influence too much lest it would find itself fighting a war an actual war not only a “cold” one with the ussr that was something the united states was not interested in to put it mildly in general states do not wish to fight wars indeed they tend to fear war more than anything else and that fear generally works as a significant constraint on state behavior instilling some degree of prudence into leaders contrary to what some people seemingly believe neorealism is not a theory that goes around predicting war here there and everywhere wars happen neorealists will say and they will continue to plague the international system from time to time the basic sources of war and peace – the permissive causes of war and peace – are exactly the two fundamental elements of the structure of the international system anarchy and the distribution of power the assumption about anarchy as the ordering principle of the international system leads to the simple but inherently correct contention that wars will occur because there’s nothing there to stop them from occurring states will always have conflicting interests sometimes these conflicting interests center on vital issues sometimes adversaries make mistakes when they are trying to gauge relative power and sometimes states make mistakes when they try to estimate the resolve of adversaries thus sometimes a conflict of interest simply escalates into war proper moreover sometimes wars occur because power is insufficiently balanced making war of conquest a potentially fruitful endeavor in all such cases the basic cause of armed conflict is the lack of a global sovereign – the lack of a world government complete with a “police” force – to stop them from occurring that wars are often down to mistakes miscalculations and accidents is perhaps an unsatisfactory conclusion when one attempts to obtain a grasp of the general forces and patterns in international politics and it is true that neorealism fails to account for many of the specific causal mechanisms at play in most cases of interstate armed conflict for that additional theoretical knowledge – the assistance of other theories about causes of war and peace – are required yet neorealism can still usefully inform us about the permissive causes of war and peace that is under what general circumstances are war likely and under what circumstances are they not and given certain circumstances structuresconstraints what types of wars are likely what types of wars are less likely who will fight these wars big states small states who won’t fight these wars anarchy is in this instant a constant wars occur because of anarchy but wars also fail to occur despite that the international system is anarchic the key variable is the distribution of power waltz has indeed much to say about this issue on which i will not dwell too much suffice it to say that according to waltz greatpower wars are much more likely to occur under multipolarity than under bipolarity this is so not least because bipolarity diminishes uncertainties among the adversaries and eases estimations of relative power and relative resolve making crises and conflicts of interest less likely to spill over into war proper but perhaps an equally interesting question revolves around an issue that waltz does not specifically address in his 1979 book namely what happens in an anarchic world where neither bipolarity nor multipolarity characterizes the distribution of power in other words what happens under unipolarity i will round up my discussion of neorealism by saying just a few words about exactly this to be sure waltz has later and elsewhere written on the subject of the relationship between unipolarity and internationalpolitical behavior and outcomes in addition much of what he does write in theory of international politics is inherently of great value to analysts of the current international system as well in brief the end of the cold war 198991 and the collapse of the soviet union also spelled the immediate end of bipolarity one superpower faced its sudden demise one was left standing and standing completely and utterly alone to boot thus the world suddenly became distinctly unipolar and it still is unipolar especially considering how waltz and others define relative power in terms of the possession of material resources – as opposed to the use of such resources in other words the world is unipolar because the united states commands aggregate material resources especially but not exclusively military capabilities of a magnitude that no other state in the world is remotely close to matching in terms of power resources the u s stands alone in terms of the capacity to act the u s stands alone in theory the u s does not have to act globally even if its absolute and relative power allows it to to what extent washington seeks to exert its influence around the world critically depends on its grand strategy the outline of means and ends in u s foreign policy a specification of what is america’s mission what are the threats to its mission and how america should deal with these threats if america’s leaders acting on behalf of the people of america conclude that america’s security and prosperity are best served by america staying at home then america will choose an isolationist grand strategy that pretty much leaves the rest of the world alone the u s would still though be the unipole of the international system given the actual distribution of material resources throughout the globe a sudden reversal to isolationism would spell the end of american hegemony but not of unipolarity waltz however teaches us that such a move by washington would be extremely unlikely power shapes interests the more power the more extensive the interests the united states behaves like a hegemon because it has the power to behave like a hegemon if power is present it will be used at the very least a state having no peer competitors with a military machine that gobbles up around 40 percent of world military spending with its allies accounting for an additional 25 percent with an economy twice as large as the next one on the list with unmatched technological and academic prowess with a prestige secondtonone in an international system whose institutions are largely the embodiment of that very state’s core values – well such a state is not likely to retrench any time soon neorealists and kenneth waltz himself would make two major points about such a situation both of which have to do with the dangers of unchecked power firstly it matters what the united states actually does in such unprecedented circumstances the temptation to do a lot is obviously there once the soviet union disappears – once moscow cannot any longer function as a countervailing power that balances the power of the mighty united states and to do a lot means to expand and expansion for its part does not necessarily mean territorial expansion it means increasing the influence of the united states in key areas around the globe the united states has expanded its influence and activities following the end of the cold war despite the fact that the level of its influence and activities was already unparalleled at the moment the soviet union collapsed one would indeed think that the marginal utility of expanding even further would be fairly limited after the shift from bi to unipolarity the exceptions are to be found of course in the areas left behind by the soviet empire and indeed most of east and central europe – including the baltic states bordering russia – are now firmly entrenched within the u s sphere of influence contravening alleged promises made by the u s to russian authorities in the early 1990s to be magnanimous in victory and to pay heed to moscow’s security objectives but apart from that arguably important region u s exploitation of the “unipolar moment” has perhaps first and foremost consisted of attempts to institutionalize and where possible expand the world order of which the u s itself has been the key shaper the list of examples is long and includes the enlargement and further strengthening of nato the bolstering of key security alliances around the world enhancing the institutions underpinning economic globalization and capitalism ostracizing and sometimes attacking recalcitrant regimes and more generally entrenching its ideological hegemony and agendasetting powers in the world many neorealists – kenneth waltz included – would argue that the united states have gone a bit too far facing no serious countervailing force it has set out to expand its influence around the globe in too hasty a fashion – with the years 2001–2009 under george w bush representing the highwater mark of what some would call slightly counterproductive unilateralism and hegemonic endeavors that effectively risk ed overstretching even the impressive resources of the american unipole personally i’m not so sure institutionalizing the spoils of the victor is not necessarily unwise – and the mistakes of afghanistan and iraq are not irredeemable eventually washington wisely chose to cut its losses in both these cases and despite the current financial predicament there is as yet little evidence to suggest that unipolarity is anywhere close to eroding due to overextension as waltz has readily admitted as well nevertheless in terms of majorpower contests power balancing and security competition the era into which we are about to enter will undoubtedly be far more interesting than the previous two decades this brings me to the second danger that follows from the existence of unchecked power according to neorealism namely the response of other major states in the system the brief discussion of which will also conclude this article one of the big – if not the biggest – debates among international relations scholars in the last twenty years have been exactly this how will the other major powers respond to u s unipolarity and u s hegemony under unipolarity waltz refers to secondary states as “major powers” rather than “great powers” the u s being the only state entitled to the latter label specifically will the other major powers attempt to balance the mighty american power that is the expectation of neorealists indeed in the early 1990s waltz himself anticipated that balancing would soon occur on a major scale he was wrong however the overall evidence points to the absence of balancing throughout the first 10–15 years of that period unipolarity and american hegemony have as yet not been seriously challenged the most convincing among several explanation of why this nonbalancing has characterized the unipolar moment so far centers inter alia on the argument that u s power has been – and still is – so overwhelming that balancing is largely rendered impossible ineffective and indeed also quite risky considering that it might lead to serious confrontations with the superpower at a time where no other state can confidently expect to pose a real military challenge against it waltz and neorealists should nonetheless be exonerated they got the timing slightly wrong real balancing did not occur on any significant scale in the 1990s and early 2000s however history sometimes moves with the pace of a glacier and moreover the picture has changed somewhat in the last few years – partly in the form of the resurgence and assertiveness of russia but in particular with the rise of china and its conscious translation of speedy economic growth into military capacity specifically aimed at countering u s military power in east asia at present real balancing is occurring it will also very likely continue to occur and for an explanation of why this will happen we need not go much further than to waltz’s theory of international politics in an anarchic world where interests collide where survival and security constitute the basic goals of states where the distribution of power largely shapes what states can and cannot do and whom they have reasons to fear and not fear the biggest gamble one takes is to remain oblivious to the risk posed by unchecked power america’s power is as yet unchecked and unbalanced waltz tells us that this will eventually change though perhaps only slowly we should in any case listen to him because he is in all likelihood in the right tags international relations jj realism waltz related posts spying america
