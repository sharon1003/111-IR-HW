search this site figures of speech sociolinguist deborah tannen has analysed conversations between mothers and daughters to unearth a hidden world of meaning behind such innocent motherly comments as is that a new haircut suzanne goldenberg saturday 13 may 2006 the guardian in a house full of objects that seem carefully chosen there is a photograph of deborah tannens mother in a simple polished frame it is her wedding day and the woman smiling up at her new husband has sharp attractive features and is neatly dressed tannens mother is an even larger presence in her new book youre wearing that  understanding mothers and daughters in conversation the latest offering from the scholar of linguistics who became a household name in north america in the 1990s by dissecting the different modes of expression among women and men the kernel of tannens argument as in her earlier books on communications between couples at the workplace and among family members is that every conversation is conducted on two levels the literal sense of the words and a more subterranean meaning called the metamessage so what is a mother really saying when she asks her daughter if she likes her hair that long answer get a haircut in tannens view the metamessage  and there is always one there  is the potential minefield of human relationships it is where the treachery of the spoken word is exposed and where a seemingly innocuous statement  to the speaker that is  is received as criticism and disapproval over the past 20 years tannen a professor of sociolinguistics at georgetown university washington dc has made a career of decoding conversation for this book she interviewed three dozen women randomly chosen she also collected anecdotes and emails from other women documenting intense feelings of closeness and sometimes an equally intense desire for distance but what is striking to the reader sifting through pages of conversation is that for all of that talking and talking there remains a great deal of confusion about what is actually being said many mothers or daughters assume that words only mean one thing if i feel criticised that has to be the whole story and if i feel i am being helpful that has to be the whole story tannen says so many of the mothers say my daughter takes everything the wrong way those miscommunications wound she says because there is no bond that is stronger than that between mother and daughter and no relationship as integral to ones sense of self a living breathing mirror a daughter is a mothers creation her mini me and so she wants it to be perfect tannen says and that requires criticism a daughter meanwhile looks to her mother for the most meaningful praise because she argues who else will look at her so closely before she gives her approval its hard not to wonder about tannens relationship with her own mother who died during the writing of this book at the age of 93 and tannen invites the speculation with her candour the book is dedicated to the memory of her mother who was born dina rosin in russia and died dorothy tannen in the us and she includes several anecdotes about her clashes with a woman who she did not really come to understand and appreciate until rather late in life even then there were setbacks tannen now 60 reprints an unsent letter to her mother that she wrote while on sabbatical from princeton university the letter which she wrote in the middle of the night quivers with rage at her mothers repeated requests that tannen look up the son of a newly acquired friend who was also at princeton it is astounding to me that you would rather cause me pain than disappoint your friend susan brown i dont know who susan brown is or why or when she became so important to you but i know that i am your daughter and i have gone to great lengths to please you the letter says tannen does not have children and so her personal knowledge of the subject is restricted to her relationship with her own mother i was one of those daughters who saw my mother as my enemy when i was a teen she writes she mashes the knuckles of her two hands together to illustrate that phase of their relationship i was a beatnik and a rebel the typical youngest child thing during the period i was married we got along great that would have been from age 23 to 29 then i got separated from my first husband and didnt meet michael until i was 40 she was obsessedwith the fact i wasnt married she thought i wasnt doing what i should be doing to find a husband and she did not know how to not say tannen giggles we could barely have a conversation without it coming up but towards the end when her mother grew frail the two found a closeness that tannen cherished with that relationship casting such a large shadow its also difficult to resist the notion that tannen seized on a major area of contention between her and her mother  appearance  to make it a focus of the book tannens mother worked as an electrologist removing unwanted hair and she clashed regularly with a daughter who describes herself as supremely uninterested in appearance my mother cared a lot about clothes it was a point of friction because when i was a teenager and i only wanted to wear my fathers shirts and i never wanted to wear makeup she would say put on lipstick that was her thing some of the advice wore off tannen who is tall and lanky in a loosefitting burgundy trouser suit leaves to put on an almost imperceptible trace of lipstick when the photographer arrives but she insists she did not assignimportance to appearance as an area of friction because of its presence in her own relationship with her mother in tannens telling her interview subjects led her to the big three topics that imperil motherdaughter conversation hair clothes and weight lesser areas of contention include childrearing and housekeeping although some of the daughters told tannen they felt closer to their mothers and wanted their advice on the birth of their own children grandchildren also produced new tensions grandmothers wanted more access to grandchildren new mothers were sensitive to perceived criticism of their childrearing methods but nothing tannen says comes between a mother and daughter like hairstyles it is an irritant to the majority of women though the degree to which it is an issue can vary it can be a slight irritant or a huge irritant depending on the spirit in which the mother says it tannen acknowledges that feminism has changed the way mothers and daughters feel about each other and notes that many younger women call their mother their best friend she also writes at length about how technology has changed the way mothers and daughters communicate quoting email instant messages and text messages she is impressed at how women in their 20s often contact their mother several times a day but she rejects the idea that a generation of feminism might have given mothers and daughters something more substantial to discuss than their looks and their housekeeping  the kind of things that concern men for example the dynamic of fathers and sons seems to be more around competition regarding things such as knowledge accomplishments expertise she says appearance she argues gets to the heart of the issue between mother and daughter how much are we the same how much are we different and she says the criticism that damages relationships between daughters and mothers is a natural consequence its because they care the person you most want to think that you are perfect is the one most likely to see your faults and tell you about them because she is looking so close up partly because she is looking at you with the same scrutiny as she looks at herself and partly because she wants to help fix them so that things will go better tannen herself is not big on prescriptives to make things go better women could try saying less  especially on the subject of appearance or they could accept that no relationship is perfect that may be enough for all of the difficulties none of the mothers and daughters tannen interviewed had stopped talking to each other a lot of the women admitted to hanging up the phone on their mothers only one woman admitted to hanging up on her daughter but the daughters always called back· youre wearing that by deborah tannen is published by virago at £999 on may 25 to order a copy
