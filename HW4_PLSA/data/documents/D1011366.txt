windows type optical disc authoring license freeware website  www dvdshrink org dvd shrink is a freeware 1 dvd transcoder program for microsoft windows that uses a dvd ripper to back up dvd video the final versions are 32015 english and 32016 german all other versions such as dvd shrink 2010 are scams 2 dvd shrinks purpose is as its name implies to reduce the amount of data stored on a dvd with minimal loss of quality although some loss of quality is inevitable it creates a copy of a dvd during which the coding only allowing the dvd to be played in certain geographical areas is removed and copy protection may also be circumvented a stamped dvd may require more space than is available on a writeable dvd unless shrunk many commercially released video dvds are dual layer 85 gb  dvd shrink can make a shrunk copy which will fit on a singlelayer 47 gb writeable dvd processing the video with some loss of quality and allowing the user to discard unwanted content such as foreignlanguage soundtracks contents  hide 1 features2 legal status3 scams4 see also5 references6 external links features  editdvd shrink is designed to be easy to use it is contained within a single executable file that is one megabyte in size the program features a de css decryption algorithm enabling it to open and decrypt many currently available dvds although it is defeated by some newer copy protection techniques as well as this it can open dvd files contained in a videots folder or a disk image iso img nrg or mdsixx the dvd video may then be reencoded by the applications vbr encoder the user is able to choose how the compression is to be distributed across the dvd dvd shrink can automatically recompress video to as little as 39 of its original size depending on the aspect ratio  citation needed of the original dvd with a corresponding loss in quality to allow it to fit on a standard dvdÂ±r w a duallayer dvdr or any userdefined custom size when deep analysis and adaptive error compensation options are selected the quality of the resulting dvd is improved  citation needed these options are more timeconsuming because dvd shrink runs through the dvd once doing the analysis and then again doing the transcoding the transcoder in dvd shrink was unusual at the time of its release in that it employs compressed domain video processing technology to avoid a full decode and reencode of the video stream this boosts performance significantly as only part of the video stream is decoded and scraped 3dvd shrink operates in two main modes reauthor and full disk in reauthor mode the interface allows the user to choose specifically which dvd elements main title menus audio tracks and subtitles and special features to retain on the shrunken dvd the menu clips are stored in folders and some of them are playable the compression is automatic if the main title only is selected to fit it onto the selected size of dvd if special features are also selected their compression may be manually selected at the minimum possible using the custom ratio option to give disk space to the main title in full disk mode dvd shrink allows the user to make a functionally identical backup copy without changes alternatively random audiosubtitle streams can be deselected sections of the dvd such as unwanted messages or logostitles can be replaced with still images saving disk space for the main title the compression can be automatic or manual which allows selection of greatest compression for menus or special features saving disc space for the main title in either mode the program has options to facilitate the stripping of the css copy protection user operation prohibition prohibiting skipping over previews or  fbi warnings and so on and also allows the copy to be either made regionfree the default setting or set for any region code extra software such as any dvd avs video converter or dvd decrypter may be required to remove more recent forms of copy protection such as macrovision ripguard dvd shrink can also shrink hard disk files already ripped by programs that can overcome more recent copy protection systems but that do not offer the 2layer to 1layer compression once the dvd content has been reduced in data size the resulting output is an iso file or a dvd video ts folder the program cannot burn these images itself as it does not contain a builtin burning engine  citation needed it can however automatically pass the burning job to either nero version 7 or lower dvd decrypter or copy to dvd as long as these programs are installed this process appears transparent to the end user to burn with img burn its possible to either copy over imgburnexe to the dvd decrypter folder and rename it to dvddecrypterexe both engines use the same commands as they are coded by the same programmer or use the hacked dvd shrink with img burn version alternatively the resulting iso file may be burned with any software capable of writing iso files although dvd shrink gives the user free rein over compression settings for individual tracks on the dvd removing content altogether is not allowed as there is a risk of upsetting the dvds menu software audio tracks and subtitles can however be removed dvd shrink also gives the alternative option of transferring selected sections as a series of stills which acts as a highcompression placeholder for the original recent events increase in processor speed lower cost terabyte disk storage raid drive functionality etc have made it easier to store the iso files directly to hard drive in effect creating largescale dvd media servers playback of these iso files can be done directly on a network connected computer running a virtual dvd rom emulator like daemon tools lite or even through open source media systems like xbmc  dvd shrink has other less controversial uses in particular the 8cm discs produced by the new dvdbased video camcorders are not fully compatible with all computers and dvd players ripping them with dvd shrink or a similar program and rerecording them to standardsized dvds is a quick and very effective solution to this problem it also allows the recorded footage to be used with drives that do not support 8cm discs such as slotloading drives often used in apple macintosh computers due to new copy protections that have come along since the final edition of dvd shrink backups may need the help of one or more other programs such as dvd decrypter dvdfab dvd43 or any dvdlegal status  editon august 17 2005 the official dvd shrink website was updated to say that the site is no more  prompting many sites to mirror the latest dvd shrink version and offer it for download this was a result of dvd shrinks web host receiving a digital millennium copyright act dmca takedown notice as compromising limits on the accessibility of a copyrighted work is prohibited in many cases under the laws of the united states specifically the digital millennium copyright act 4 shortly after the website was restored and a search box was put in place of the download link dvd shrink is now available from the official web page again as it is available from many other sites on the internet as well and it suggests finding a download source using a general web search dvd shrink in some countries the software in itself is illegal under applicable laws pertaining to copyrighted content german law for instance while allowing the manufacture of copies of copyrighted digital material for personal noncommercial use dictates that it is illegal to circumvent mechanisms that prevent copying therefore the use of any software enabling a user to work around copyright restrictions such as css is against the law in germany  citation neededscams  editthe final versions are
