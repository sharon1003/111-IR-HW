earth’s atmosphere is only 11200000 the mass of earth itself so it is a very thin skin surrounding our planet how does earth hold on to this thin skin of atmosphere the answer is gravity – the same force that keeps us anchored to earth and yet although you might not realize it or think about it earth does continually lose some of its atmosphere to space this loss occurs in the upper atmosphere over billionyear time scales molecules in our atmosphere are constantly moving spurred on by energizing sunlight some move quickly enough to escape the grip of earth’s gravity the escape velocity for planet earth is a little over 11 kilometers per second – about 25 thousand miles an hour if earth were much less massive – say as massive as mars – gravity’s grip would be weaker that’s one reason why mars lost most of its original atmosphere in the vicinity of our heavier earth where gravity is stronger than on mars not all particles are equally likely to escape light ones like hydrogen and helium typically move faster than heavier ones like oxygen and nitrogen the light atoms are more likely to reach escape velocity and escape to space that’s why light molecules are rare in our atmosphere in contrast to their abundance in the universe at large still all in all earth’s atmosphere is here to stay and that’s a good thing because our atmosphere protects life on earth in many ways it absorbs harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun helps keep earth’s surface warm via the greenhouse effect and reduces temperature extremes between day and night yay atmosphere it keeps earth livable so thanks to gravity although some of earth’s atmosphere is escaping to space most is staying here what is the source of heat in earth’s interior deborah byrd deborah byrd created the earth sky radio series in 1991 and founded earth skyorg in 1994 today she serves as editorinchief of this website she has won a galaxy of awards from the broadcasting and science communities including having an asteroid named 3505 byrd in her honor a science communicator and educator since 1976 byrd believes in science as a force for good in the world and a vital tool for the 21st century being an earth sky editor is like hosting a big global party for cool naturelovers she says more articles2018s closest far moon on april 815 hours ago use the big dipper to find the little dipper4 days ago
