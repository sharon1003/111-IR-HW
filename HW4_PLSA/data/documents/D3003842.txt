chronological newest first i want to use the external rosc resistor to set the frequency of the msp1232 the datasheet only tells me the frequency when using a 100k resistor is there some documentation that tells me how to calculate the resistance for a given frequency i didnt see it in the family reference guide thanks bob start a new thread beginning microcontrollers with the msp430free download posted by joerg schulzeclewing ● april 7 2005hello bob had the same issue but with another device i suggest you send an email to ti tech support requesting the graph rosc versus frequency they should have that also for the f1232 i wish ti would provide more detailed info for the hw of their processors to me that is one of the weak spots of the msp series not enough detail regards joerg start a new thread posted by onestone ● april 8 2005you dont calculate the frequency vs the resistor the resistor sets the current to the dco you then use the rsel bits to select one of 8 frequency ranges and mod bits to select a more precise frequency between the 8 rsel selected steps it isnt very clear but it is there family user guide 48 in the basic clock module section using an external resistor of 100k i would go with a very low tempco one at 1 or better allows dco frequencies up to approximately 10mhz uisng the internal 200k resistor allows frequencies up to approximately 5mhz the real advantage of the external resistor is the massive reduction in dco temperature coefficient al blueman747 wrote i want to use the external rosc resistor to set the frequency of the msp1232 the datasheet only tells

rosc  400k fmax 25mhz thus fmax  rintrosc where rint is apoproximately 200k and rosc is either rint or when using an external resistor rext rosc is only a current control rselx selects 1 of 8 frequenmcy ranges dcox selects 1 of 8 ranges within the basic range and modx allows fine tuning of the average frequency except when dcox  7 fmin varies with rseland with rosc appearing to be around 40khz  rintrosc when rselx  0 and dcox  0 al joerg schulzeclewing wrote hello bob  had the same issue but with another device i suggest you send an email to ti tech support requesting the graph rosc

more sense however in app note slaa074 controlling the dco frequency section 2 it says the current injected into the dco can be programmed using an external resistor or by selection of oneofeight different internal resistors this current determines the oscillation frequency of the dco when selecting internal resistors the programmable currents available result in a nominal frequency range of 130 k hz to 45 mhz when using a 5v supply voltage so i believe this implies that you dont use rsel if you are using the external resistor does this sound right bob  in msp430msp4 onestone onestoneb

resistor as the main current source in both cases the frequency range is divided into 8 bands by rsel07 so the external resistor only sets the available range of the oscillator rsel selects 1 of 8 bands within that range and dco07 selects 1 of 8 sub bands within each band the bandwidths available by rsel are not linear ie fminfmax for rsel0 is a few hundred khz with rint or rext  100k whereas the fmin to fmax for rsel7 is a few mhz al blueman747 wrote thank you for the information after reading your explanation the ti documenation makes more sense however in app note slaa074  controlling
