tenormin »indications  dosage high blood pressure slideshow pictures take the salt quizlowering blood pressure exercise tips pictures indicationshypertension tenormin is indicated for the treatment of hypertension  to lower blood pressure lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions these benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including atenolol control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management including as appropriate lipid control diabetes management antithrombotic therapy smoking cessation exercise and limited sodium intake many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals for specific advice on goals and management see published guidelines such as those of the national high blood pressure education programs joint national committee on prevention detection evaluation and treatment of high blood pressure jnc numerous antihypertensive drugs from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs that is largely responsible for those benefits the largest and most consistent ardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk and the absolute risk increase per mm hg is greater at higher blood pressures so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension for example patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia  and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects as monotherapy in black patients and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects eg on angina heart failure or diabetic kidney disease these considerations may guide selection of therapy tenormin may be administered with other antihypertensive agents angina pectoris due to coronary atherosclerosis tenormin is indicated for the longterm management of patients with angina pectoris acute myocardial infarction tenormin is indicated in the management of hemodynamically stable patients with definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction to reduce cardiovascular mortality treatment can be initiated as soon as the patients clinical condition allows see dosage and administration contraindications  and warnings  in general there is no basis for treating patients like those who were excluded from the isis1 trial blood pressure less than 100 mm hg systolic heart rate less than 50 bpm or have other reasons to avoid beta blockade as noted above some subgroups eg elderly patients with systolic blood pressure below 120 mm hg seemed less likely to benefit dosage and administrationhypertension the initial dose of tenormin is 50 mg given as one tablet a day either alone or added to diuretic therapy the full effect of this dose will usually be seen within one to two weeks if an optimal response is not achieved the dosage should be increased to tenormin 100 mg given as one tablet a day increasing the dosage beyond 100 mg a day is unlikely to produce any further benefit tenormin may be used alone or concomitantly with other antihypertensive agents including thiazidetype diuretics hydralazine prazosin and alphamethyldopa angina pectoris the initial dose of tenormin is 50 mg given as one tablet a day if an optimal response is not achieved within one week the dosage should be increased to tenormin 100 mg given as one tablet a day some patients may require a dosage of 200 mg once a day for optimal effect twentyfour hour control with once daily dosing is achieved by giving doses larger than necessary to achieve an immediate maximum effect the maximum early effect on exercise tolerance occurs with doses of 50 to 100 mg but at these doses the effect at 24 hours is attenuated averaging about 50 to 75 of that observed with once a day oral doses of 200 mg acute myocardial infarction in patients with definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction treatment with tenormin i v injection should be initiated as soon as possible after the patients arrival in the hospital and after eligibility is established such treatment should be initiated in a coronary care or similar unit immediately after the patients hemodynamic condition has stabilized treatment should begin with the intravenous administration of 5 mg tenormin over 5 minutes followed by another 5 mg intravenous injection 10 minutes later tenormin i v injection should be administered under carefully controlled conditions including monitoring of blood pressure heart rate and electrocardiogram  dilutions of tenormin i v injection in dextrose injection usp sodium chloride injection usp or sodium chloride and dextrose injection may be used these admixtures are stable for 48 hours if they are not used immediately in patients who tolerate the full intravenous dose 10 mg tenormin tablets 50 mg should be initiated 10 minutes after the last intravenous dose followed by another 50 mg oral dose 12 hours later thereafter tenormin can be given orally either 100 mg once daily or 50 mg twice a day for a further 69 days or until discharge from the hospital if bradycardia or hypotension requiring treatment or any other untoward effects occur tenormin should be discontinued see full prescribing information prior to initiating therapy with tenormin tablets  data from other beta blocker trials suggest that if there is any question concerning the use of iv beta blocker or clinical estimate that there is a contraindication the iv beta blocker may be eliminated and patients fulfilling the safety criteria may be given tenormin tablets 50 mg twice daily or 100 mg once a day for at least seven days if the iv dosing is excluded although the demonstration of efficacy of tenormin is based entirely on data from the first seven postinfarction days data from other beta blocker trials suggest that treatment with beta blockers that are effective in the postinfarction setting may be continued for one to three years if there are no contraindications tenormin is an additional treatment to standard coronary care unit therapy elderly patients or patients with renal impairment tenormin is excreted by the kidneys consequently dosage should be adjusted in cases of severe impairment of renal function in general dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious usually starting at the low end of the dosing range reflecting greater frequency of decreased hepatic renal or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy evaluation of patients with

chronotropic effects disopyramide has been associated with severe bradycardia asystole and heart failure when administered with beta blockers amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic agent with negative chronotropic properties that may be additive to those seen with beta blockers beta blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine if the two drugs are coadministered the beta blocker should be withdrawn several days before the gradual withdrawal of clonidine if replacing clonidine by betablocker therapy the introduction of beta blockers should be delayed for several days after clonidine administration has stopped concomitant use of prostaglandin synthase inhibiting drugs eg indomethacin may decrease the hypotensive effects of beta blockers information on concurrent usage of atenolol and aspirin is limited data from several studies ie timiii isis2 currently do not suggest any clinical interaction between aspirin and beta blockers in the acute myocardial infarction setting while taking beta blockers patients with a history of anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may have a more severe reaction on repeated challenge either accidental diagnostic or therapeutic such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat the allergic reaction both digitalis glycosides and betablockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia warnings  precautions high blood pressure slideshow pictures take the salt quizlowering blood pressure exercise tips pictures warningscardiac failure sympathetic stimulation is necessary in supporting circulatory function in congestive heart failure and beta blockade carries the potential hazard of further depressing myocardial contractility and precipitating more severe failure in patients with acute myocardial infarction cardiac failure which is not promptly and effectively controlled by 80 mg of intravenous furosemide or equivalent therapy is a contraindication to betablocker treatment in patients without a history of cardiac failure continued depression of the myocardium with betablocking agents over a period of time can in some cases lead to cardiac failure at the first sign or symptom of impending cardiac failure patients should be treated appropriately according to currently recommended guidelines and the response observed closely if cardiac failure continues despite adequate treatment tenormin should be withdrawn see dosage and administration  cessation of therapy with tenorminpatients with coronary artery disease who are being treated with tenormin should be advised against abrupt discontinuation of therapy severe exacerbation of angina and the occurrence of myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported in angina patients following the abrupt discontinuation of therapy with beta blockers the last two complications may occur with or without preceding exacerbation of the angina pectoris as with other beta blockers when discontinuation of tenormin is planned the patients should be carefully observed and advised to limit physical activity to a minimum if the angina worsens or acute coronary insufficiency develops it is recommended that tenormin be promptly reinstituted at least temporarily because coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized it may be prudent not to discontinue tenormin therapy abruptly even in patients treated only for hypertension see dosage and administration  concomitant use of calcium channel blockers bradycardia and heart block can occur and the left ventricular end diastolic pressure can rise when betablockers are administered with verapamil or diltiazem patients with preexisting conduction abnormalities or left ventricular dysfunction are particularly susceptible see precautions  bronchospastic diseases patients with bronchospastic disease should in general not receive beta blockers because of its relative beta1 selectivity however tenormin may be used with caution in patients with bronchospastic disease who do not respond to or cannot tolerate other antihypertensive treatment since beta1 selectivity is not absolute the lowest possible dose of tenormin should be used with therapy initiated at 50 mg and a beta2stimulating agent bronchodilator should be made available if dosage must be increased dividing the dose should be considered in order to achieve lower peak blood levels major surgery chronically administered betablocking therapy should not be routinely withdrawn prior to major surgery however the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures diabetes and hypoglycemia tenormin should be used with caution in diabetic patients if a betablocking agent is required beta blockers may mask tachycardia occurring with hypoglycemia but other manifestations such as dizziness and sweating may not be significantly affected at recommended doses tenormin does not potentiate insulin induced hypoglycemia and unlike nonselective beta blockers does not delay recovery of blood glucose to normal levels thyrotoxicosis betaadrenergic blockade may mask certain clinical signs eg tachycardia of hyperthyroidism abrupt withdrawal of beta blockade might precipitate a thyroid storm therefore patients suspected of developing thyrotoxicosis from whom tenormin therapy is to be withdrawn should be monitored closely see dosage and administration  untreated pheochromocytoma tenormin should not be given to patients with untreated pheochromocytoma pregnancy and fetal injury atenolol can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman atenolol crosses the placental barrier and appears in cord blood administration of atenolol starting in the second trimester of pregnancy has been associated with the birth of infants that are small for gestational age  no studies have been performed on the use of atenolol in the first trimester and the possibility of fetal injury cannot be excluded if this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus neonates born to mothers who are receiving tenormin at parturition or breastfeeding may be at risk for hypoglycemia and bradycardia caution should be exercised when tenormin is administered during pregnancy or to a woman who is breastfeeding see

contraindicated in those patients with a history of hypersensitivity to the atenolol or any of the drug products components clinical pharmacology high blood pressure slideshow pictures take the salt quizlowering blood pressure exercise tips pictures clinical pharmacologytenormin is a beta1selective cardioselective betaadrenergic receptor blocking agent without membrane stabilizing or intrinsic sympathomimetic partial agonist activities this preferential effect is not absolute however and at higher doses tenormin inhibits beta2adrenoreceptors chiefly located in the bronchial and vascular musculature pharmacokinetics and metabolism in man absorption of an oral dose is rapid and consistent but incomplete approximately 50 of an oral dose is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract the remainder being excreted unchanged in the feces peak blood levels are reached between two 2 and four 4 hours after ingestion unlike propranolol or metoprolol but like nadolol tenormin undergoes little or no metabolism by the liver and the absorbed portion is eliminated primarily by renal excretion over 85 of an intravenous dose is excreted in urine within 24 hours compared with approximately 50 for an oral dose tenormin also differs from propranolol in that only a small amount 616 is bound to proteins in the plasma this kinetic profile results in relatively consistent plasma drug levels with about a fourfold interpatient variation the elimination halflife of oral tenormin is approximately 6 to 7 hours and there is no alteration of the kinetic profile of the drug by chronic administration following intravenous administration peak plasma levels are reached within 5 minutes declines from peak levels are rapid 5 to 10fold during the first 7 hours thereafter plasma levels decay with a halflife similar to that of orally administered drug following oral doses of 50 mg or 100 mg both betablocking and antihypertensive effects persist for at least 24 hours when renal function is impaired elimination of tenormin is closely related to the glomerular filtration rate significant accumulation occurs when the creatinine clearance falls below 35 m lmin173m² see dosage and administration  pharmacodynamics in standard animal or human pharmacological tests betaadrenoreceptor blocking activity of tenormin has been demonstrated by 1 reduction in resting and exercise heart rate and cardiac output 2 reduction of systolic and diastolic blood pressure at rest and on exercise 3 inhibition of isoproterenol induced tachycardia and 4 reduction in reflex orthostatic tachycardia a significant betablocking effect of tenormin as measured by reduction of exercise tachycardia is apparent within one hour following oral administration of a single dose this effect is maximal at about 2 to 4 hours and persists for at least 24 hours maximum reduction in exercise tachycardia occurs within 5 minutes of an intravenous dose for both orally and intravenously administered drug the duration of action is dose related and also bears a linear relationship to the logarithm of plasma tenormin concentration the effect on exercise tachycardia of a single 10 mg intravenous dose is largely dissipated by 12 hours whereas betablocking activity of single oral doses of 50 mg and 100 mg is still evident beyond 24 hours following administration however as has been shown for all betablocking agents the antihypertensive effect does not appear to be related to plasma level in normal subjects the beta1 selectivity of tenormin has been shown by its reduced ability to reverse the beta2mediated vasodilating effect of isoproterenol as compared to equivalent betablocking doses of propranolol in asthmatic patients a dose of tenormin producing a greater effect on resting heart rate than propranolol resulted in much less increase in airway resistance in a placebo controlled comparison of approximately equipotent oral doses of several beta blockers tenormin produced a significantly smaller decrease of fev1 than nonselective beta blockers such as propranolol and unlike those agents did not inhibit bronchodilation in response to isoproterenol consistent with its negative chronotropic effect due to beta blockade of the sa node tenormin increases sinus cycle length and sinus node recovery time conduction in the av node is also prolonged tenormin is devoid of membrane stabilizing activity and increasing the dose well beyond that producing beta blockade does not further depress myocardial contractility several studies have demonstrated a moderate approximately 10 increase in stroke volume at rest and during exercise in controlled clinical trials tenormin given as a single daily oral dose was an effective antihypertensive agent providing 24hour reduction of blood pressure tenormin has been studied in combination with thiazide type diuretics and the blood pressure effects of the combination are approximately additive tenormin is also compatible with methyldopa hydralazine and prazosin each combination resulting in a larger fall in blood pressure than with the single agents the dose range of tenormin is narrow and increasing the dose beyond 100 mg once daily is not associated with increased antihypertensive effect the mechanisms of the antihypertensive effects of betablocking agents have not been established several possible mechanisms have been proposed and include 1 competitive antagonism of catecholamines at peripheral especially cardiac adrenergic neuron sites leading to decreased cardiac output 2 a central effect leading to reduced sympathetic outflow to the periphery and 3 suppression of renin activity the results from longterm studies have not shown any diminution of the antihypertensive efficacy of tenormin with prolonged use by blocking the positive chronotropic and inotropic effects of catecholamines and by decreasing blood pressure atenolol generally reduces the oxygen requirements of the heart at any given level of effort making it useful for many patients in the longterm management of angina pectoris on the other hand atenolol can increase oxygen requirements by increasing left ventricular fiber length and end diastolic pressure particularly in patients with heart failure in a multicenter clinical trial isis1 conducted in 16027 patients with suspected myocardial infarction patients presenting

attributed to mortality in days 01 tenormin – 121 deaths control  171 deaths despite the large size of the isis1 trial it is not possible to identify clearly subgroups of patients most likely or least likely to benefit from early treatment with atenolol good clinical judgment suggests however that patients who are dependent on sympathetic stimulation for maintenance of adequate cardiac output and blood pressure are not good candidates for beta blockade indeed the trial protocol reflected that judgment by excluding patients with blood pressure consistently below 100 mm hg systolic the overall results of the study are compatible with the possibility that patients with borderline blood pressure less than 120 mm hg systolic especially if over 60 years of age are less likely to benefit the mechanism through which atenolol improves survival in patients with definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction is unknown as is the case for other beta blockers in the postinfarction setting atenolol in addition to its effects on survival has shown other clinical benefits including reduced frequency of ventricular premature beats reduced chest pain and reduced enzyme elevation atenolol geriatric pharmacology in general elderly patients present higher atenolol plasma levels with total clearance values about 50 lower than younger subjects the halflife is markedly longer in the elderly compared to younger subjects the reduction in atenolol clearance follows the general trend that the elimination of renally excreted drugs is decreased with increasing age medication guide high blood
