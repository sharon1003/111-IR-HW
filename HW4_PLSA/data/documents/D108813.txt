usually nonprofit and sometimes international organizations 5 independent of governments and international governmental organizations though often funded by governments 6 that are active in humanitarian educational health care public policy social human rights environmental and other areas to effect changes according to their objectives 7 8 9 10 they are thus a subgroup of all organizations founded by citizens which include clubs and other associations that provide services benefits and premises only to members sometimes the term is used as a synonym of  civil society organization  to refer to any association founded by citizens 11 but this is not how the term is normally used in the media or everyday language as recorded by major dictionaries the explanation of the term by ngoorg the nongovernmental organizations associated with the united nations is ambivalent it first says an ngo is any nonprofit voluntary citizens group which is organized on a local national or international level but then goes on to restrict the meaning in the sense used by most english speakers and the media taskoriented and driven by people with a common interest ngos perform a variety of service and humanitarian functions bring citizen concerns to governments advocate and monitor policies and encourage political participation through provision of information 12ngos are usually funded by donations but some avoid formal funding altogether and are run primarily by volunteers ngos are highly diverse groups of organizations engaged in a wide range of activities and take different forms in different parts of the world some may have charitable status while others may be registered for tax exemption based on recognition of social purposes others may be fronts for political religious or other interests since the end of world war ii ngos have had an increasing role in international development 13 particularly in the fields of humanitarian assistance and poverty alleviation 14the number of ngos worldwide is estimated to be 10 million 15 russia had about 277000 ngos in 2008 16 india is estimated to have had around 2 million ngos in 2009 just over one ngo per 600 indians and many times the number of primary schools and primary health centres in india 17 18 china is estimated to have approximately 440000 officially registered ngos 19 about 15 million domestic and foreign ngos operated in the united states in 2017 11the term ngo is not always used consistently in some countries the term ngo is applied to an organization that in another country would be called an npo nonprofit organization and vice versa political parties and trade unions are considered ngos only in some countries there are many different classifications of ngo in use the most common focus is on orientation and level of operation an ngos orientation refers to the type of activities it takes on these activities might include human rights environmental improving health or development work an ngos level of operation indicates the scale at which an organization works such as local regional national or international 20the term nongovernmental organization was first coined in 1945 when the united nations un was created 21 the un itself an intergovernmental organization made it possible for certain approved specialized international nonstate agencies — ie nongovernmental organizations — to be awarded observer status at its assemblies and some of its meetings later the term became used more widely today according to the un any kind of private organization that is independent from government control can be termed an ngo provided it is notforprofit nonprevention  clarification needed but not simply an opposition political party one characteristic these diverse organizations share is that their nonprofit status means they are not hindered by shortterm financial objectives accordingly they are able to devote themselves to issues which occur across longer time horizons such as climate change malaria prevention or a global ban on landmines public surveys reveal that ngos often enjoy a high degree of public trust which can make them a useful  but not always sufficient  proxy for the concerns of society and stakeholders 22contents  hide 1 types11 by orientation12 by level of operation13 track ii diplomacy2 activities21

governmentalrelated organizations types can be understood by their orientation and level of how they operate by orientation  editcharitable orientation often involves a topdown paternalistic effort with little participation by the beneficiaries it includes ngos with activities directed toward meeting the needs of the poor people service orientation includes ngos with activities such as the provision of health family planning or education services in which the programme is designed by the ngo and people are expected to participate in its implementation and in receiving the service participatory orientation is characterized by selfhelp projects where local people are involved particularly in the implementation of a project by contributing cash tools land materials labour etc in the classical community development project participation begins with the need definition and continues into the planning and implementation stages empowering orientation aims to help poor people develop a clearer understanding of the social political and economic factors affecting their lives and to strengthen their awareness of their own potential power to control their lives there is maximum involvement of the beneficiaries with ngos acting as facilitators 23by level of operation  editcommunitybased organizations cbos arise out of peoples own initiatives they can be responsible

corporatefunded and managed projects and have professional staff  citation neededgrongos exist for a variety of reasons usually to further the political or social goals of their members or founders examples include improving the state of the natural environment encouraging the observance of human rights improving the welfare of the disadvantaged or representing a corporate agenda however there are a huge number of such organizations and their goals cover a broad range of political and philosophical positions this can also easily be applied to private schools and athletic organizations track ii diplomacy  editmain article track ii diplomacy track ii dialogue or track ii diplomacy is transnational coordination that involves nonofficial members of the government including epistemic communities as well as former policymakers or analysts track ii diplomacy aims to get policymakers and policy analysts to come to a common solution through discussions by unofficial means unlike the track i diplomacy where government officials diplomats and elected leaders gather to talk about certain issues track ii diplomacy consists of experts scientists professors and other figures that are not involved in government affairs the members of track ii diplomacy usually have more freedom to exchange ideas and come up with compromises on their own activities  editthere are numerous classifications of ngos the typology the world bank uses divides them into operational and advocacy 27generally ngos act as implementers catalysts and partners firstly ngos act as implementers in that they mobilize resources in order to provide goods and services to people who are suffering due to a manmade disaster or a natural disaster secondly ngos act as catalysts in that they drive change they have the ability to inspire facilitate or contribute to improved thinking and action to promote change lastly ngos often act as partners alongside other organizations in order to tackle problems and address human needs more effectively 28ngos vary in their methods some act primarily as lobbyists while others primarily conduct programs and activities for instance an ngo such as oxfam concerned with poverty alleviation may provide needy people with the equipment and skills to find food and clean drinking water whereas an ngo like the ffda helps through investigation and documentation of human rights  citation needed violations and provides legal assistance to victims of human rights abuses others such as the afghanistan information management services provide specialized technical products and services to support development activities implemented on the ground by other organizations operational  editoperational ngos seek to achieve smallscale change directly through projects 25 they mobilize financial resources materials and volunteers to create localized programs they hold largescale fundraising events and may apply to governments and organizations for grants or contracts to raise money for projects they often operate in a hierarchical structure a main headquarters being staffed by professionals who plan projects create budgets keep accounts and report and communicate with operational fieldworkers who work directly on projects 25 operational ngos deal with a wide range of issues but are most often associated with the delivery of services or environmental issues emergency relief and public welfare operational ngos can be further categorized by the division into relieforiented versus developmentoriented organizations according to whether they stress service delivery or participation whether they are religious or secular and whether they are more public or privateoriented although operational ngos can be communitybased many are national or international the defining activity of operational ngos is the implementation of projects 25campaigning  editcampaigning ngos seek to achieve largescale change promoted indirectly through influence of the political system 25 campaigning ngos need an efficient and effective group of professional members who are able to keep supporters informed and motivated they must plan and host demonstrations and events that will keep their cause in the media they must maintain a large informed network of supporters who can be mobilized for events to garner media attention and influence policy changes the defining activity of campaigning ngos is holding demonstrations 25 campaigning ngos often deal with issues relating to human rights womens rights and childrens rights the primary purpose of an advocacy ngo is to defend or promote a specific cause as opposed to operational project management these organizations typically try to raise awareness acceptance and knowledge by lobbying press work and activist event  citation neededboth operational and campaigning  editit is not uncommon for ngos to make use of both activities many times operational ngos will use campaigning techniques if they continually face the same issues in the field that could be remedied through policy changes at the same time campaigning ngos like human rights organizations often have programs that assist the individual victims they are trying to help through their advocacy work 25public relations  editnongovernmental organizations need healthy relationships with the public to meet their goals foundations and charities use sophisticated public relations campaigns to raise funds and employ standard lobbying techniques with governments interest groups may be of political importance because of their ability to influence social and political outcomes a code of ethics was established in 2002 by the world association of non governmental organizations project management  editthere is an increasing awareness that management techniques are crucial to project success in nongovernmental organizations 29 generally nongovernmental organizations that are private have either a community or environmental focus they address varieties of issues such as religion emergency aid or humanitarian affairs they mobilize public support and voluntary contributions for aid they often have strong links with community groups in developing countries and they often work in areas where governmenttogovernment aid is not possible ngos are accepted as a part of the international relations landscape and while they influence national and multilateral policymaking increasingly they are more directly involved in local action corporate structure  editstaffing  editsome ngos are highly professionalized and rely mainly on paid staff others are based around voluntary labour and are less formalized not all people working for nongovernmental organizations are volunteers many ngos are associated with the use of international staff working in developing countries but there are many ngos in both north and south who rely on local employees or volunteers there is some dispute as to whether expatriates should be sent to developing countries frequently this type of personnel is employed to satisfy a donor who wants to see the supported project managed by someone from an industrialized country however the expertise of these employees or volunteers may be counterbalanced by a number of factors the cost of foreigners is typically higher they have no grassroot connections in the country they are sent to and local expertise is often undervalued 27the ngo sector is an essential employer in terms of numbers  citation needed for example by the end of 1995 concern worldwide an international northern ngo working against poverty employed 174 expatriates and just over 5000 national staff working in ten developing countries in africa and asia and in haiti funding  editwhether the ngos are small or large various ngos need budgets to operate the amount of money that each requires varies depending upon multiple factors including the size of the operation and the extent of the services provided unlike small ngos large ngos may have annual budgets in the hundreds of millions or billions of dollars for instance the budget of the american association of retired persons aarp was over us540 million in 1999 30 funding such large budgets demands significant fundraising efforts on the part of most ngos major sources of ngo funding are membership dues the sale of goods and services grants from international institutions or national governments and private donations several eugrants provide funds accessible to ngos even though the term nongovernmental organization implies independence from governments many ngos depend heavily on governments for their funding 31 a quarter of the us162 million income in 1998 of the faminerelief organization oxfam was donated by the british government and the eu the christian relief and development organization world vision united states collected us55 million worth of goods in 1998 from the american government government funding of ngos is controversial since according to david rieff writing in the new republic the whole point of humanitarian intervention was precisely that ngos and civil society had both a right and an obligation to respond with acts of aid and solidarity to people in need or being subjected to repression or want by the forces that controlled them whatever the governments concerned might think about the matter 32 some ngos such as greenpeace do not accept funding from governments or intergovernmental organizations 33 34overhead costs  editoverhead is the amount of money that is spent on running an ngo rather than on projects 35 this includes office expenses 35 salaries banking and bookkeeping costs what percentage of overall budget is spent on overhead is often used to judge an ngo with less than 4 being viewed as good 35 the world association of nongovernmental organizations states that ideally more than 86 should be spent on programs less than 20 on overhead 36the global fund to fight aids tuberculosis and malaria has specific guidelines on how high overhead can be to receive funding based on how the money is to be spent with overhead often needing to be less than 57 37 while the world bank typically allows 37 38 a high percentage of overhead to total expenditures can make it more difficult to generate funds 39 high overhead costs may also generate criticism with some claiming the certain ngos with high overhead are being run simply to benefit the people working for them 40while overhead costs can be a legitimate concern a sole focus on them can be counterproductive 41 research published by the urban institute and the center for social innovation at stanford university have shown how rating agencies create incentives for nonprofits to lower and hide overhead costs which may actually reduce organizational effectiveness by starving organizations of the infrastructure they need to effectively deliver services 42 43 a more meaningful rating system would provide in addition to financial data a qualitative evaluation of an organization’s transparency and governance 1 an assessment of program effectiveness 2 and an evaluation of feedback mechanisms designed for donors and beneficiaries and 3 such a rating system would also allow rated organizations to respond to an evaluation done by a rating agency 44 more generally the popular discourse of nonprofit evaluation should move away from financial notions of organizational effectiveness and toward more substantial understandings of programmatic impact monitoring and control  editin the march 2000 report on united nations reform priorities former u n secretary general kofi annan wrote in favor of international humanitarian intervention arguing that the international community has a right to protect 45 citizens of the world against ethnic cleansing genocide and crimes against humanity on the heels of the report the canadian government launched the responsibility to protect r2p 46 project outlining the issue of humanitarian intervention while the r2p doctrine has wide applications among the more controversial has been the canadian governments use of r2p to justify its intervention and support of the coup in haiti 47 years after r2p the world federalist movement an organization which supports the creation of democratic global structures accountable to the citizens of the world and call for the division of international authority among separate agencies has launched responsibility to protect  engaging civil society r2pcs a collaboration between the wfm and the canadian government this project aims to bring ngos into lockstep with the principles outlined under the original r2p project the governments of the countries an ngo works or is registered in may require reporting or other monitoring and oversight funders generally require reporting and assessment such information is not necessarily publicly available there may also be associations and watchdog organizations that research and publish details on the actions of ngos working in particular geographic or program areas  citation neededin recent years many large corporations have increased their corporate social responsibility departments in an attempt to preempt ngo campaigns against certain corporate practices as the logic goes if corporations work with ngos ngos will not work against corporations greater collaboration between corporations and ngos creates inherent risks of cooptation for the weaker partner typically the nonprofit involved 48in december 2007 the united states department of defense assistant secretary of defense health affairs s ward casscells established an international health division under force health protection  readiness 49 part of international healths mission is to communicate with ngos in areas of mutual interest department of defense directive 300005 50 in 2005 requires do d to regard stabilityenhancing activities as a mission of importance equal to combat in compliance with international law do d has necessarily built a capacity to improve essential services in areas of conflict such as iraq where the customary lead agencies  state department and usaid find it difficult to operate unlike the cooption strategy described for corporations the oasd ha recognizes the neutrality of health as an essential service international health cultivates collaborative relationships with ngos albeit at armslength recognizing their traditional independence expertise and honest broker status while the goals of do d and ngos may seem incongruent the do ds emphasis on stability and security to reduce and prevent conflict suggests on careful analysis important mutual interests history  editinternational nongovernmental organizations have a history dating back to at least the late eighteenth century 51 52 it has been estimated that by 1914 there were 1083 ngos 53 international ngos were important in the antislavery movement and the movement for womens suffrage and reached a peak at the time of the world disarmament conference 54 however the phrase nongovernmental organization only came into popular use with the establishment of the united nations organization in 1945 with provisions in article 71 of chapter 10 of the united nations charter 55 for a consultative role for organizations which are neither governments nor member states—see consultative status the definition of international ngo ingo is first given in resolution 288 x of ecosoc on february 27 1950 it is defined as any international organization that is not founded by an international treaty the vital role of ngos and other major groups in sustainable development was recognized in chapter 27 56 of agenda 21 leading to intense arrangements for a consultative relationship between the united nations and nongovernmental organizations 57 it has been observed that the number of ingo founded or dissolved matches the general state of the world rising in periods of growth and declining in periods of crisis 58rapid development of the nongovernmental sector occurred in western countries as a result of the processes of restructuring of the welfare state further globalization of that process occurred after the fall of the communist system and was an important part of the washington consensus 31globalization during the 20th century gave rise to the importance of ngos many problems could not be solved within a nation international treaties and international organizations such as the world trade organization were centered mainly on the interests of capitalist enterprises in an attempt to counterbalance this trend ngos have developed to emphasize humanitarian issues developmental aid and sustainable development a prominent example of this is the world social forum which is a rival convention to the world economic forum held annually in january in davos switzerland the fifth world social forum in porto alegre brazil in january 2005 was attended by representatives from more than 1000 ngos 59 in terms of environmental issues and sustainable development the earth summit in rio in 1992 was the first to show the power of international ngos when about 2400 representatives of ngos came to play a central role in deliberations some have argued that in forums like these ngos take the place of what should belong to popular movements of the poor whatever the case ngo transnational networking is now extensive 60legal status  editthe legal form of ngos is diverse and depends upon homegrown variations in each countrys laws and practices however four main family groups of ngos can be found worldwide 61unincorporated and voluntary association trusts charities and foundations companies not just for profit entities formed or registered under special ngo or nonprofit laws the council of europe in strasbourg drafted the european convention on the recognition of the legal personality of international nongovernmental organizations in 1986 which sets a common legal basis for the existence and work of ngos in europe article 11 of the european convention on human rights protects the right to freedom of association which is also a fundamental norm for ngos influence of ngos upon world affairs  editservicedelivery ngos provide public goods and services that governments from developing countries are unable to provide to society due to lack of resources servicedelivery ngos can serve as contractors or collaborate with democratized government agencies to reduce cost associated with public goods capacitybuilding ngos influence global affairs differently in the sense that the incorporation of accountability measures in southern ngos affect culture structure projects and daily operations 62 advocacy and public education ngos affect global affairs in its ability to modify behavior through the use of ideas communication is the weapon of choice used by advocacy and publiceducation ngos in order to change peoples actions and behaviors they strategically construct messages to not only shape behavior but to also socially mobilize communities in promoting social political or environmental changes movement ngos mobilizes the public and coordinate largescale collective activities to significantly push forward activism agenda 63in the postcold war era more ngos based in developed countries have pursued international outreach and became involved in local and national level social resistance and become relevant to domestic policy change in the developing world 64 in for the cases where national governments are highly sensitive to external influences via nonstate actors specialized ngos have been able to find the right partners eg china building up solid working networks locating a policy niche and facilitating domestic changes 65international day  editworld ngo day  editmain article world ngo day world ngo day 2014 in afghanistan today we celebrate the world ngo day

internationally marked and recognised on 27 february 2014 in helsinki finland by helen clark administrator of the united nations development programme  undp and former prime minister of new zealand who congratulated with the world ngo day and highlighted the importance of ngo sector for the un through her speech 68 69 70critiques  editissa g shivji is one of africas leading experts on law and development issues as an author and academic his critique on ngos is found in two essays silences in ngo discourse the role and future of ngos in africa and reflections on ngos in tanzania what we are what we are not and what we ought to be shivji argues that despite the good intentions of ngo leaders and activists he is critical of the objective effects of actions regardless of their intentions 71 shivji argues also that the sudden rise of ngos are part of a neoliberal paradigm rather than pure altruistic motivations he is critical of the current manifestations of ngos wanting to change the world without understanding it and that the imperial relationship continues today with the rise of ngos james pfeiffer in his case study of ngo involvement in mozambique speaks to the negative effects that ngos have had on areas of health within the country he argues that over the last decade ngos in mozambique have fragmented the local health system undermined local control of health programs and contributed to growing local social inequality 72he notes further that ngos can be uncoordinated creating parallel projects among different organizations that pull health service workers away from their routine duties in order to serve the interests of the ngos this ultimately undermines local primary health care efforts and takes away the governments ability to maintain agency over their own health sector 72 j pfeiffer suggested a new model of collaboration between the ngo and the dps the mozambique provincial health directorate he mentioned the ngo should be formally held to standard and adherence within the host country for example reduce showcase projects and parallel programs that proves to be unsustainable 72jessica mathews wrote in foreign affairs in 1997 for all their strengths ngos are special interests the best of them … often suffer from tunnel vision judging every public act by how it affects their particular interest 73 since ngos do not have to worry about policy tradeoffs the overall impact of their cause might bring more harm to society 74vijay prashad argues that from the 1970s the world bank under robert mc namara championed the ngo as an alternative to the state leaving intact global and regional relations of power and production 75others argue that ngos are often imperialist 76 in nature that they sometimes operate in a racialized manner in third world countries and that they fulfill a similar function to that of the clergy during the high colonial era the philosopher peter hallward argues that they are an aristocratic form of politics 77 he also points to the fact that ngos like action aid and christian aid effectively condoned the 2004 us backed coup against an elected government in haiti and argues that they are the humanitarian face of imperialism 78 popular movements in the global south such as the western cape antieviction campaign in south africa have sometimes refused to work with ngos arguing that this will compromise their autonomy 79 80 it has also been argued that ngos often disempower people by allowing funders to push for stability over social justice 81another criticism of ngos is that they are being designed and used as extensions of the normal foreignpolicy instruments of certain western countries and groups of countries 82 83 russian president vladimir putin made this accusation at the 43rd munich conference on security policy in 2007 concluding that these ngos are formally independent but they are purposefully financed and therefore under control 84 also michael bond wrote most large ngos such as oxfam the red cross cafod and action aid are striving to make their aid provision more sustainable but some mostly in the us are still exporting the ideologies of their backers 85 china has recently introduced legal measures to regulate and reduce the influence of foreign ngos operating in china 86ngos have also been accused of using white lies or misinformed advise to enact their campaigns ie accusations that ngos have been ignorant about critical issues because as chief scientist at greenpeace doug parr said these organizations appear to have lost their efforts in being truly scientific and now seem to be more selfinterested rather than operating through science so as to be rationally and effectively practical ngos have been accused of abusing the utilization of science to gain their own advantages in the beginning as parr indicated there was a tendency among our critics to say that science is the only decisionmaking tool … but political and commercial interests are using science as a cover for getting their way 87 at the same time ngos can appear to not be cooperative with other groups according to the previous policymaker for the german branch of friends of the earth jens katjek if ngos want the best for the environment he says they have to learn to compromise 87ngos have also been questioned as being too much of a good thing 88 eric werker and faisal ahmed bring up three potential critiques of the role of ngos in developing nations too many ngos in a nation—particularly one ruled by a warlord—reduces the ngos ability to establish a credible threat of removing humanitarian assistance since they can easily be replaced by another ngo the frequent process of resource allocation and outsourcing to local organizations in international development projects results in high expenses for ngos and rings into question how much of the resources and money actually goes to the intended beneficiaries at the end of the allocation process and finally ngo missions tend to be too paternalistic and expensive though werker and ahmed propose that vouchers are a good way to overcome this obstacle 88challenges to legitimacy  editthe issue of the legitimacy of ngos raises a series of important questions legitimacy is one of the most important assets possessed by an ngo and is gained due to them being perceived as an “independent voice” 89 90 their representation also emerges as an important question who bestows responsibilities to ngos or ingos and how do they gain the representation of citizens and civil society is still not scrutinized thoroughly for instance in the article it is stated to put the point starkly are the citizens of countries of the south and their needs represented in global civil society or are citizens as well as their needs constructed by practices of representation and when we realize that ingos hardly ever come face to face with the people whose interests and problems they represent or that they are not accountable to the people they represent matters become even more troublesome 91the origin of funding can have serious implications for the legitimacy of ngos in recent decades ngos have increased their numbers and range of activities to a level where they have become increasingly dependent on a limited number of donors 92 consequently competition has increased for funding as have the expectations of the donors themselves 93 this runs the risk of donors adding conditions which can threaten the independence of ngos for example an overdependence on official aid has the potential to dilute “the willingness of ngos to speak out on issues which are unpopular with governments” 90 in these situations ngos are being held accountable by their donors which can erode rather than enhance their legitimacy a difficult challenge to overcome some commentators have also argued that the changes in ngo funding sources has ultimately altered their functions 90 94 95ngos have also been challenged on the grounds that they do not necessarily represent the needs of the developing world through diminishing the socalled “southern voice” some postulate that the north–south divide exists in the arena of ngos 96 they question the equality of the relationships between northern and southern parts of the same ngos as well as the relationships between southern and northern ngos working in partnerships this suggests a division of labour may develop with the north taking the lead in advocacy and resource mobilisation whilst the south engages in service delivery in the developing world 96 the potential implications of this may mean the needs of the developing world are not addressed appropriately as northern ngos do not properly consult or participate in partnerships the real danger in this situation is that western views may take the front seat and assign unrepresentative priorities 97the flood of ngos has also been accused of damaging the public sector in multiple developing countries eg accusations that ngo mismanagement has resulted in the breakdown of public health care systems instead of promoting equity and alleviating poverty ngos have been under scrutiny for contributing to socioeconomic inequality and disempowering services in the public sector of third world countries 72 98the scale and variety of activities in which ngos participate has grown rapidly since the 1980s witnessing particular expansion in the 1990s 99 this has presented ngos with a need to balance the pressures of centralisation and decentralisation by centralising ngos particularly those that operate at an international level they can assign a common theme or set of goals conversely it may also be advantageous to decentralise as this can increase the chances of an ngo responding more flexibly and effectively to localised issues by implementing projects which are modest in scale easily monitored produce immediate benefits and where all involved know that corruption will be punished 98 100see also  editlist of active ngos of national minorities category nongovernmental organizations advocacy group interest groupcharitable organization community foundation civil society
