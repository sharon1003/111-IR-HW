patients with widespread arthralgias andor myalgias can be a challenge because many disorders may manifest these pro tean symptoms widespread pain can be defined as pain that extends beyond joint margins to involve large areas or whole limbs alternatively it is described as pain on both sides of the body above and below the waist and includes axial pain as well the examiner should search for revealing historical features or evidence of articular or periarticular pathology ie swelling erythema warmth before considering the disorders mentioned herein icd9 codes arthralgia site unspecified 71940 myalgiamyositis 7291etiology the most common cause of widespread arthralgias and myalgias is fibromyalgia and myofascial pain syndrome it is also possible that widespread pains may be drug

psychiatric depression psychogenic rheumatism malingering somatization disorder other fibromyalgia chronic fatigue syndrome hypermobility syndrome silicone implant syndrome most have fibromyalgiail interleukin cardinal findings many patients manifest moderate to severe fatigue and morning stiffness lasting minutes to hours thus these features have little discriminant value the patient should be questioned about fever ie 100°f or weight loss because these may suggest conditions with significant morbidity symptoms suggesting endocrinopathies should be sought ie heat or cold intolerance symptomatic rashes muscle weakness myalgias muscle cramping depression or sleep disturbance may also provide important clues it is equally important to review the patient’s medication history medical and surgical history health maintenance and social history when evaluating diffuse musculoskeletal complaints efforts should be directed toward identifying the source and extent of joint or muscle pain many patients in this group will have periarticular rather than articular pain the clinician should carefully examine for the trigger point tender areas of fibromyalgia signs of ligamentous laxity may indicate hypermobility syndrome lymphadenopathy masses organomegaly and stigmata of thyroid adrenal or muscle disease see myasthenia gravis should be sought diagnostic testing routine laboratory testing should include a complete blood count cbc chemistries and an esr extreme elevation of the esr 60 mm hg seldom occurs without evidence of serious illness conversely normal or low level elevations of the esr are less diagnostic and should not be overinterpreted serologic testing for ana or rf or batteries of rheumatic screening tests are unlikely to yield useful information similarly thyroid function studies or cpk should only be done if symptoms and signs beyond arthralgias warrant differential diagnosis table 4 lists the many disorders that may manifest widespread arthralgiasmyalgias although fibromyalgia is most common among these the clinician should be careful to not confuse fibromyalgia with influenza and other viral infections thyroid or adrenal disease metabolic bone disease eg osteomalaciarickets hyperparathyroidism polymyalgia rheumatica still’s disease the early onset of a connective tissue disease lupus ra myositis multiple myeloma bony metastases or depression with somatization imaging imaging will seldom reveal diagnostic information not gleaned from the physical examination rarely bony metastases are found by plain radiographs or scintigraphy the predictive value of whole body scintigraphy has been advocated for the evaluation of widespread pain without supportive physical findings therapy patients should be treated symptomatically and narcotic analgesics should be avoided until a confident diagnosis is made thereafter therapeutic choices are defined by the diagnostic entity rather than the general complaint if the complaint is drug induced then drug withdrawal usually results in rapid improvement treatment of the underlying condition may also improve the musculoskeletal complaint bibliographymc beth j
