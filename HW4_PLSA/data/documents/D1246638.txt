0ask a question chemistry aspirin lab question in lab today we measured the actual yield and melting point of aspirin that we had made in lab last week our actual yield was 287 grams the theoretical yield was 29 g so the percent yield was 9896 when we tested the melting point the range was 106118 since the melting point of pure aspirin is 138140 this means that our aspirin was impure my question is what would have caused us to have a high percent yield but low purity what went wrong the aspirin was completely dry so it wasnt that there was water making the aspirin heavier giving us a higher actual yield and therefore a higher percent yield but obviously there was something in our aspirin that was making it heavier right or could we have measured the melting point wrong chemistry4222014  dana from sugar land tx subscribe comment
