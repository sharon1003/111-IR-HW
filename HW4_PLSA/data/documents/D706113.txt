answered by the wiki answers ®community answerscom ® is making the world better one answer at a time homogeneous tiles with much lower water absorption rate and higher density homogeneous is definitely a much tougher tile compared to ceramics tiles and therefore more long lasting its surface can be polished to make it reflective shine like those of a mirror but the ceramic can only be glazed to make it shiny and its not as long lasting as compare to the polished surface the whole piece of homogeneous is made up by the same material and therefore it can be round edged at the sides without showing a different material beneath the tile ceramic tiles are made of red clay with a thin layer of coloring on the surface chamfering the edges of the tile will reveal the red base below  pvc strips will be need to cover the edges of ceramic tiles homogeneous tiles are generally 30  50 more expensive than ceramic tiles although polished homogeneous of bigger size may cost much more homogeneous tiles have almost become the choice for kitchen flooring and stove in singaporean homes although ceramics tiles are just as feasible in an unlikely event of breakage due to fallen object homogenous will not leave a big crack line and it will not show a different material color beneath the surface between these 2 materials only homogeneous tiles will be considered for the flooring of any commercial project as ceramic tiles will not be able to withstand the kind of load produced by high traffic of human flow ceramic tiles ceramic tiles are more common and have a wider variety of colors tones and textures the usual range of ceramic tiles is inexpensive for a tile layer it is a material which is easier to work with compared to homogeneous tiles it does not pop out after few years2 people found this useful was this answer useful yes somewhat no
