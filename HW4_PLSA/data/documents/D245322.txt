such as ⁕in semantics and discourse analysis a generalization of the concept of conversation within all modalities and contexts ⁕the totality of codified language used in a given field of intellectual enquiry and of social practice such as legal discourse medical discourse religious discourse et cetera ⁕in the work of michel foucault and that of the social theoreticians he inspired discourse describes “an entity of sequences of signs in that they are enouncements ” an enouncement is not a unit of semiotic signs but an abstract construct that allows the signs to assign and communicate specific repeatable relations to between and among objects subjects and statements hence a discourse is composed of semiotic sequences between and among objects subjects and statements the term discursive formation conceptually describes the regular communications that produce such discourses as a philosopher foucault applied the discursive formation in the analyses of large bodies of knowledge such as political economy and natural history chambers 20th century dictionary 000  0 votesrate this definition discoursediskōrs′ n speech or language generally conversation the reasoning
