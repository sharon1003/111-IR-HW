pictures how a python can swallow a crocodile snakes regularly eat items 75 to 100 percent their size an olive python has a johnsons crocodile in a stranglehold as seen in a mobile phone image from queensland australia photograph by tiffany corlis abc northwest via epapublished march 3 2014in an epic battle in northern queensland australia a 10foot olive python got the best of a johnsons crocodile and a lucky passerby snapped photos related content orange cave crocodiles may be evolving into a new species what should you do if a crocodile’s mouth is inches from your head heres proof hippos do whatever they want we talked to terry phillip curator of reptiles at reptile gardens in rapid city south dakota about pythoncroc relations and portion control at mealtime these photos suggest two monstrous animals battling and then a snake that might just regret its meal later is this a rare moment that someone happened to capture or just a standard day in the wild first these animals arent giants that snake is likely about 15 or 20 pounds 7 to 9 kilograms and the croc might be 5 to 7 pounds 2 to 3 kilograms probably three feet one meter long and for these species native to that part of australia this is a very natural event while that looks like a really big meal its a pretty common one for that type of snake olive snakes are known for being phenomenally powerful pound for pound and for feeding on large food items what danger is there to the snake in this scenario teeth the crocs teeth could razor right through that snake if the croc could then shake its head it could do real damage—but it probably wouldnt have that chance here thats one reason snakes intentionally go for the neck and shoulder region when they attack to try to avoid being bitten themselves theyll grab on just behind the skull and coil up to hold the croc in place but even if a snake is bitten it has a phenomenal immune system and can fight off many infections we see huge scars on wild snakes they do get beaten up by their prey the python vs croc duel to the death continues photograph by tiffany corlis abc northwest via epawould the snake always win in this scenario not necessarily both of these are apex predators in their environment big johnsons crocs eat little pythons and vice versa how does a constrictor like a python know when its safe to let go and eat snakes are very sensitive to their preys heartbeat normally a python will constrict until the animal asphyxiates and the heart stops but crocs can go a long time without oxygen in this case id guess that the snake constricted with such force that it compressed the chest cavity until the crocs heart had no room to beat so the croc probably died of cardiac arrest rather than suffocation we always hear that snakes can unhinge or dislocate their jaws to eat big food is that whats going on no snakes have no chin no chin bone so their jaws arent connected the way ours are theres nothing to dislocate instead there are really stretchy ligaments that determine how wide the mouth can open snakes seem to know to eat their prey from the narrowest point—the mouth end—which makes the animal easiest to swallow is this instinctive theres probably some instinct at work there its a particular behavior you see with snakes in the wild and captivity after killing the animal theyll let go and rest then before eating theyll search around using their nostrils and tongue to find the smell of saliva from the animal thats the end they want with crocs there isnt saliva per se but maybe the smell of mucus does the trick whats the biggest prey item youve heard of one eating it was a scrub python —closely related to olives—that ate a wallaby that was about 110 percent of its body weight that was a goodsize meal but snakes regularly eat items 75 to 100 percent their size after crushing the crocodile to death the python begins to eat it face first photograph by tiffany corlis abc northwest via epawhat do you make of the case in florida in which a burmese pythons body burst after eating a crocodile did the snake use bad judgment about how much it could handle snakes may occasionally start eating something and then abandon it after realizing its too big but thats not usual heres what actually happened in florida the snake successfully killed and ate the croc swallowed the whole thing the snake did win but florida is an unnatural environment for that snake species its not as warm as the snakes habitat in southeast asia so the snake couldnt digest fast enough to keep the food from rotting once it started to rot inside the snake the snake began to die its body split open because of that process not because the croc was too large back to australia after eating the johnsons croc how long might that olive python go without eating these are ambush predators so the snake isnt likely to pass up another meal that came along it would go relatively dormant for about ten days to digest but over the next three weeks it would take what it could get however the caloric needs of that type of snake is pretty low it could certainly go the rest of the season without a meal what parts of the croc can the snake use for energy all the bones flesh and organs are digested and used a lot of scales will pass through and the teeth over the two to three weeks after the kill things with keratin and enamel arent digestible so theyll come back out
