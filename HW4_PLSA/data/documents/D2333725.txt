if you want to save money on your next car purchase you’ll need to do more than just strike a “good” deal by haggling with the salesman on the sticker price a mistake on your car loan could cost you money and erase the savings negotiated on the purchase price“the big mistakes are made in the financing office” says phil reed the senior consumer advice editor at edmundscom the auto research website “making the right decisions can save thousands over the life of the loan”compare auto loans here are reed’s five car loan mistakes that can cost you money1 negotiating the monthly payment rather than the purchase price reed warns that buying a car based on the amount of the monthly payment is a trap although you should know how much car you can afford each month don’t provide that figure to the salesman if you do you will forfeit your capacity for negotiating a lower purchase price “don’t let them turn you into a monthly payment buyer” he says calculator estimate your monthly car payment once volunteered a monthly car loan amount tells the dealer how much room is available to hide other costs such as a higher interest rate and addons reed says to negotiate the price of each cost category separately “minimize the individual pieces of negotiation — price tradein and car financing” he says2 letting the dealer define your creditworthiness reed explained that your creditworthiness determines your interest rate your credit score 300 to 850 is your creditworthiness as a rating and is based on your credit report with the three credit reporting agencies — equifax experian and trans union a borrower with a high credit score qualifies for a better car loan rate than one with a low score shaving just one percentage point of interest from a 15000 car loan over 60 months would save hundreds of dollars in interest paid over the life of the loan you can see your credit score for free at my bankrate reed emphasized knowing your credit score before you set foot on the dealer’s lot “most people think their credit score is worse than it is” he says “when people don’t know their credit rating the dealer can tell them almost anything”reed recommends consumers check their own credit by obtaining preapproved financing they should go to a bank or credit union and apply for an auto loan before visiting the dealership even if they intend to take advantage of a deeply discounted interest rate offered by the auto manufacturer’s lending agency consumers can find out how much vehicle they can buy and the interest rate they qualify for by getting a preapproved car loan “it’s another way of checking your credit” reed says erin downs former spokeswoman for san franciscobased wells fargo  co says “we consider your credit rating your payment history and the amount of debt you already have”3 making the wrong choice between cash rebate and low interest rate loan if you want to take advantage of a manufacturer’s offer of a cash rebate or a low interest car loan do your homework before deciding reed cautions that the method netting you the most savings varies from offer to offer bankrate’s car rebate incentive calculator simplifies the comparison manufacturers’ lowinterest car financing isn’t available to everyone so it will help to know your credit score before talking to a finance manager “your credit must be very good to get the lowinterest financing”

car than it is worth the difference is “ negative equity ” when a dealer tells an upsidedown consumer that he can fold that negative equity into the car financing of the next deal he means that he will add it to the purchase price of the new car you will be paying interest on that negative equity for the term of the new loan moreover if you were upside down on your last tradein chances are you will be that much more upside down next time “it’s a horrible practice and should be avoided” reed says “they are just making the problem worse it’s because people are buying more car than they can afford live within your means”5 financing the cost of addons that you can buy separately according to a 2012 report by national automobile dealers association nearly 37 of the average gross profits earned in new and used car sales departments were generated in the fi or finance and insurance office through aftermarket addons“just say ‘no” is good advice “they are really there to make extra profit for the dealership by increasing interest rates and selling extended warranties and addons such as fabric protection and paint sealant” reed says even if you want an extended warranty or credit life insurance these items are available at a lower cost from sources outside the dealership folding them into your car loan and paying interest on them for the life of the loan can add hundreds of dollars to the amount you pay further question every fee you don’t understand“dealers can write other fees into the contract and give them officialsounding names” reed says “these fees are another attempt to take profit on the back end of the deal when the buyer’s guard is down”related links here’s what you should do if you think your car rental isn’t safe the 10 cities where your vehicle is
