start from the basics learn the basics starting with introduction to the atom practice for your next test get some practice with 17 different exercises taking ap®︎ chemistry or organic chemistry check out our classes tab see all classes atoms compounds and ions0 of 23 complete chemistry is the study of matter and all matter is made up of atoms we will learn about elements atomic number and mass isotopes moles chemistry moles not the animal and compounds introduction to the atom ions and compounds names and formulas of ionic compounds mass spectrometry chemical reactions and stoichiometry0 of 37 complete we are now going to delve into the heart of chemistry we learn ways of representing molecules and how molecules react to do this well even think about how many of a molecule we have using a quantity called a mole balancing chemical equations stoichiometry limiting reagent stoichiometry molecular composition types of chemical reactions electronic structure of atoms0 of 33 complete so we know that all matter is made up of atoms but what is an atom made out of chemists describe the structure of atoms using models this section will cover the bohr model photoelectric effect absorption and emission spectra quantum numbers and electron configurations history of atomic structure bohrs model of the hydrogen atom quantum numbers and orbitals electron configurations periodic table0 of 16 complete a little more than a century ago the chemist dmitri mendeleev published an early form of the periodic table which organizes the known elements of our world his method of classifying the elements was so useful that we still use it even today we will learn to apply this elegant table to an understanding of atomic structure and properties including periodic table trends introduction to the periodic table periodic table trends chemical bonds0 of 25 complete chemical bonds are the glue that hold molecules together we will learn about the different kinds of bonds ways chemists draw bonds and molecules and how the type of chemical bonding affects the bulk properties of a material we will cover electronegativity lewis dot structures vsepr bond hybridization and ionic covalent and metallic bonds types of chemical bonds dot structures and molecular geometry hybridization and hybrid orbitals gases and kinetic molecular theory0 of 15 complete properties of gases can be modeled using some relatively simple equations which we can relate to the behavior of individual gas molecules we will learn about the ideal gas law vapor pressure partial pressure and the maxwell boltzmann distribution ideal gas equation nonideal gas behavior states of matter and intermolecular forces0 of 20 complete have you ever wondered how some insects are able to skate on the surface of water we will learn about how intermolecular forces make this possible we will also cover liquids solids mixtures and phase changes states of matter introduction to intermolecular forces mixtures and solutions chemical equilibrium0 of 15 complete many chemical reactions are reversible and the forward and backward reactions can occur at the same time when the rate of the forward reaction is equal to the rate of the backward reaction we call that a dynamic equilibrium we will learn how equilibrium can be described by the equilibrium constant k and how different factors than can affect the chemical equilibrium equilibrium constant factors that affect chemical equilibrium acids and bases0 of 23 complete in this section we will be talking about the basics of acids and bases and how acidbase chemistry is related to chemical equilibrium we will cover acid and base definitions p h acidbase equilibria acidbase properties of salts and the p h of salt solutions acids bases and p hacidbase equilibria buffers titrations and solubility equilibria0 of 33 complete we can combine our knowledge of acids and bases equilibrium and neutralization reactions to understand buffers and titrations solubility equilibria will build on concepts from solubility precipitation and equilibrium buffer solutions titrations solubility equilibria thermodynamics0 of 39 complete thermodynamics is the study of heat thermo and work dynamics we will be learning about energy transfer during chemical and physical changes and how we can predict what kind of changes will occur concepts covered in this tutorial include the laws of thermodynamics internal energy heat work pv diagrams enthalpy hesss law entropy and gibbs free energy internal energy enthalpy entropy gibbs free energy redox reactions and electrochemistry0 of 35 complete oxidation and reduction reactions power your phone and make it possible for your body to use the oxygen you inhale we will learn about oxidation states numbers oxidationreduction redox reactions galvanicvoltaic cells electrolytic cells cell potentials and how electrochemistry is related to thermodynamics and equilibrium oxidationreduction reactions galvanic cells standard cell potentials electrochemistry thermodynamics and equilibrium cell potentials under nonstandard conditions electrolytic cells and electrolysis kinetics0 of 29 complete chemists are often interested in how fast a reaction will occur and what we can do to control the rate the study of reaction rates is called kinetics and we will learn about average reaction rate rate laws the arrhenius equation reaction mechanisms catalysts and spectrophotometry reaction rates and rate laws relationship between reaction concentrations and time arrhenius equation and reaction mechanisms spectrophotometry nuclear chemistry0 of 10 complete ancient alchemists attempted but failed to turn different substances into gold it turns out that the only way to turn one element into another element is using nuclear chemistry nuclear reactions change the composition of an atoms nucleus and this process is useful for many applications radioactive decay studying for the ap chemistry exam0 of 20 complete studying for the ap chemistry exam watch these videos to help you prepare2015 ap chemistry free response questions meet the chemistry professional0 of 10 complete what can you do with chemistry skills a lot of things it turns out learn about the diversity of careers available to people interested in chemistry meet the chemistry professional alkanes cycloalkanes and functional groups0 of 37 complete the properties of organic molecules depend on the structure and knowing the names of organic compounds allow us to communicate with other chemists well be learning about different aspects of molecular structure including common functional groups and conformations naming alkanes naming alkanes cycloalkanes and bicyclic compounds conformations of alkanes conformations of cycloalkanes functional groups staff picks944the mole and avogadros number introduction to the atom437visually understanding balancing chemical equations balancing chemical equations article stoichiometry stoichiometry article daltons atomic theory history of atomic structure1054introduction to redox reactions oxidationreduction reactions a brief introduction to chemistry chemistry is the study of the composition properties and reactivity of matter this may be your first time taking chemistry but chances are you know a lot already from observing the world around you we will be covering the material in a first year introductory high school or college general chemistry course start learning746preparing to study chemistry chemistry draws on math physics and general science skills see
