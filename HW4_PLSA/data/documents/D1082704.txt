computer won’t start power on button light flashing may 26 2010 by mitz how annoying it is when your computer won’t start and you can see the computer power button flashing one minute they are fine and the next thing you know it is basically dead i especially hate it when you press your power button and nothing happens you can see the computer power light blinking but nothing comes up on the screen it seems like the computer is sending me a signal but what is it trying to say we have tutorials about computers not starting when the computer has a black screen when you need to repair the boot sector of your hard drive and many more however this article is about your computer not starting but seeing a flashing light at the same time check the power supply unfortunately different makes and models of computers do different things for which could be the same error causing the problem some computers have a beep sequence code and others have no signals at all however when the computer won’t start and the power light flashing on and off i always test the power supply first you can also take the side of your computer case off to listen for the cpu fan starting when you press the button if it seems a bit slow and quiet you can almost guarantee that there is not enough power getting through to your computer if you have a spare power supply hanging around and you have done this type of thing before try swapping them over if you are not confident in working on computers yourself get a professional to do it for you computer won’t start and the reasons are too obvious i was working on a computer with this problem a few years ago and it turned out to be the power cord it was faulty which allowed the computer to work most of the time but then other times it would not boot and the power light flashed this was a rare because the problem is usually the actual power supply itself if this doesn’t work for you try removing everything that is connected to your computer remove the mouse keyboard monitor pci cards graphics cards etc now you should only have the power cable connected turn the computer on now if the blinking power light is gone and it seems to be running this could mean that there is something wrong with one of the components you have just removed replace them one at a time testing to see if the computer works each time when the flashing light comes back you know you have found the problem if changing the power supply didn’t help or removing all of the components either it doesn’t look good now it could only be the cpu or the motherboard example problem number one – computer power light blinking my computer won’t start i have a dell dimension 9150 after a power outage my pc will not turn on it has a blinking yellow light everything i have read said it is most likely a power supply problem i purchased a new power supply from 911 pc and still have the same problem there is a green light lit up on the motherboard any ideas i have also read about diagnostic lights to figure out the problem i don’t believe this pc has any of those lights thanks i did remove the ram and graphic card and tried starting it up without any of that installed and got the same thing i then put them back and got the same blinking light the setting is 115 on the power supply although i have toggled it and tried the other setting i have also tried just the power supply connected to the mobo–no drives and get the same blinking light two lights also blink on the back of the pc underneath an rj 45 connection nothing beeps and nothing else turns on source i did remove and change the memory to different slots and tried starting it up without any memory and got the same blinking light i received a new power supply and tried it and got the same results brought the new power supply to a pc shop and they let me try their tester it produced lights but it grinded and the fan barely moved “possible i got a dud the place i got the power supply from is great–911 pc  the guy i spoke to on the phone is going to open up and test the new one and initial it before shipping it priority mail–also not even charging me for the new one being shipped as long as i send the old one back if it turns out the motherboard is shot i’ll send both back and they will refund computer won’t start problem solved warning when working on computers see opening computer cases and please take the right precautions problem fixed it was the front usb ports that were causing the computer not to power on and the blinking yellow lights i took a screwdriver and kept messing with the pins on the beat up port–pushing them down spreading them apart etc etc until finally no lights on power button i then pushed the power button and it started right up that port for sure is fried but i don’t care the computer works thanks for the help i had this exact same issue to the tee with a dell xps 400 the front usb pins were touching causing a short on the motherboard after i stuck a screw driver in there and pulled back the pins just mike magic everything started workingeg problem number two – computer power light blinking solution from lloyd lloyd february 25 2012 at 953 pm it is not always a power supply problem – as in the power supply needs to be replaced it has something to do with leftover energy that needs to be discharged a hair dryer blowing in onto the tower’s fan will cause it to run in reverse negatively discharging the built up or leftover energy it doesn’t seem to work with cold air but also needs the heat don’t put dryer up against the casing don’t want to cook the fan motor anywhere from 30 seconds to 2 minutes should cause light to go solid then you can start computer in normal mode this method has worked 2x on my sr5601p marnie february 16 2013 at 1157 pm my dell computer wouldn’t start and had the blinking green light checked the power source cord plugged directly into wall open cpu unplugged all connections took out ram replugged in all connections put ram back in made …sure all connections in firmly if ram not clicked in snug will not work then checked cables going into power button to see if any disconnection also looked at motherboard to see if anything disconnected checked usb ports to see if any pins bent which can cause a short…… these are all the first steps to try to get computer to come back on nothing worked— so then i took a hair dryer to cpu fan at back ran it for about 1 min 30 seconds and …… unbelievably the green light was solid and my computer is working fine… totally amazing””” it really works thanks more examples in comment section quick troubleshooting tips if your computer won’t start and you have a flashing power light then you can try the following the first thing you should do
