the british admiralty established an independent command the australia station under the command of a commodore who was assigned as commanderinchief australia station 6 the australian squadron was created to which british naval ships serving on the australia station were assigned 6 7 the changes were partially in recognition of the fact that a large part of the east indies station had been detached to australian waters and also reflecting growing concern for the strategic situation in the western pacific in general and in tahiti and new zealand in particular 6 in 1884 the commander of the australia station was upgraded to the rank of rear admiral 6at its establishment the australia station encompassed australia and new zealand with its eastern boundary including samoa and tonga its western edge in the indian ocean south of india and its southern edge defined by the antarctic circle the boundaries were modified in 1864 1872 and 1893 8 at its largest the australia station reached from the equator to the antarctic in its greatest northsouth axis and covered 1⁄ 4 of the southern hemisphere in its extreme eastwest dimension including papua new guinea new zealand melanesia and polynesia 9in 1911 the australia station passed to the commonwealth naval forces initially under the command of rn officers and the australian squadron was disbanded the station now under nominal australian command was reduced to only cover australia and its island dependencies to the north and east in 1911 the commonwealth naval forces was renamed the royal australian navy which in 1913 came

to assist the new zealand colonial government during the first taranaki war when victoria returned to australia the vessel had taken part in several minor actions with the loss of one crew member the deployment of victoria to new zealand marked the first occasion that an australian warship had been deployed overseas in the years leading up to federation victoria had the most powerful of the colonial navies victoria had hmvs cerberus since 1870 as well as hmvs nelson three small gunboats and five torpedoboats nsw had two very small torpedo boats and the corvette wolverine the colonial

controlled by australia in 1907 prime minister alfred deakin and creswell while attending the imperial conference in london sought the british governments agreement to end the subsidy system and develop an australian navy the admiralty rejected and resented the challenge but suggested diplomatically that a small fleet of destroyers and submarines would be sufficient deakin was not impressed with the admiralty and in 1908 invited the united states great white fleet to visit australia the visit prompted public enthusiasm for a modern navy and led to the order of two 700ton riverclass torpedoboat destroyers a purchase that angered the british the surge in german naval construction in 1909 led the australian admiralty to change its position on an australian navy which resulted in the naval defence act of 1910 being passed which created the australian navy the first australian warship the destroyer hmas parramatta was launched at govan in scotland on wednesday 9 february 1910

commonwealth naval board which functioned from 1 march 1911 at the 1911 imperial conference australia expressed concern about japans growing naval power and it was agreed that the british government would consult australia when negotiating renewal of the anglojapanese alliance 14 it was also decided that the royal navy would continue to support the ran and provide bluewater defence capability in the pacific and that if there was war the ships of the ran would be transferred to british admiralty control under the naval defence act 1912 the power to make the transfer was conferred in the governorgeneral the ran would become the australia squadron of the royal navy with all ships and personnel under the direct control of the british admiralty while the ran remained responsible for the upkeep of the ships and training in 1913 responsibility for the reduced australia station passed to the new royal australian navy 6 15 under nominal australian command with the australia squadron of

rigorous quarantine policy was implemented in australia although this reduced the immediate impact of the flu the nations death toll surpassed 11500 33when the pandemic struck in 1918 the ships of the royal australian navy were dispersed throughout the world the speed at which the flu spread coupled with the cramped mess decks and poorly ventilated living spaces on early 20th century warships created a favourable environment for the disease the pandemic swept through the british grand fleet in 1918 the australian cruisers assigned to the fleet suffered high casualties with up to 157 casualties in one ship alone outbreaks in the mediterranean fleets were more severe than those in the atlantic hmas brisbane recorded 183 casualties between november and december 1918 of those casualties 2 men died of pneumonia the ran lost a total of 26 men to the disease further loss prevented primarily by the ready availability of professional medical treatment 34south pacific aid

whilst knowingly carrying sick passengers talune stopped in fiji samoa tonga and nauru the first outbreaks in these locations occurred within days of the ships visits the local authorities were generally unprepared for the size of the outbreak allowing the infection to spread uncontrollably the german territory of samoa was the worst affected of the small islands the new zealand administration carried out no efforts to lessen the outbreak and rejected offers of assistance from nearby american samoa the new zealand government officially apologised to samoa in 2002 for their reaction to the outbreak 35 on 29 november 1918 the military governor of apia requested assistance from wellington the request was turned down because all doctors were needed in new zealand australia offered the only alternate source of aid the commonwealth naval board was aware of the worsening situation in the region the sloop hmas fantome reported its first case on 11 november 1918 while stationed in fiji with half her complement eventually affected on 20 november 1918 the naval board began forming a joint relief expedition from available military medical personnel the commanding officer of hmas encounter was then ordered to embark the expedition in sydney and sail as soon as possible encounter departed sydney on 24 november 1918 ten minutes after completing loading 33 as a precaution all 450 members of encounter  s crew were doubly inoculated the ship had suffered 74 cases earlier in the year at fremantle and the captain did not want a repeat encounter arrived in suva

that coaling be carried out by the crew instead of native labour encounter departed suva in the evening of the same day and arrived off apia on 3 december within six hours the medical landing party assigned to apia and their stores were ashore encounter then departed for the tongan capital of nuku ʻ alofa arriving on 5 december the last of the medical staff and supplies were unloaded and encounter sailed for suva on 7 december to recoal on arriving in suva encounter received orders to return to sydney where reached on 17 december and was immediately placed into quarantine the south pacific aid mission is regarded as australias first overseas relief expedition and set a precedent for future relief missions conducted by the ran 33between the wars  editaustralia on her side and sinking during her scuttling in april 1924following the end of world war i the australian government believed that an immediate evaluation of the ran was necessary australia had based its naval policy on the henderson recommendations of 1911 developed by sir reginald henderson the government sent an invitation to admiral john jellicoe he arrived in australia in may 1919 jellicoe remained in australia for three months before returning to england via new zealand and canada jellicoe submitted his findings in august 1919 titled the report on the naval mission to the commonwealth the report outlined several policies designed to strengthen british naval strength in the pacific ocean the report heavily stressed a close relationship between the ran and the royal navy this would be achieved by strict adherence to the procedures and administration methods of the royal navy the report also suggested constant officer exchange between the two forces jellicoe also called for the creation of a large far east imperial fleet which would be based in singapore and include capital ships and aircraft carriers the creation cost for this fleet was to be divided between great britain australia and new zealand contributing 75 20 and 5 respectively the suggested makeup of the ran would include one aircraft carrier two battlecruisers eight light cruisers one flotilla leader twelve destroyers a destroyer depot ship eight submarines one submarine depot ship and a small number of additional auxiliary ships the annual cost and depreciation of the fleet was estimated to be £4024600 except for implementing closer tier with the royal navy none of jellicoes major recommendations were carried out 37with the end of world war i the australian government began to worry about the threat japan posed to australia japan had extended its empire 3000 kilometres 1900 mi to the south bringing it right to australias doorstep japan had continued to build up its naval force and had reached the point where it outgunned the royal navy in the pacific the ran and the government believed that the possibility of a japanese invasion was highly likely in his report admiral jellicoe believed that the threat of a japanese invasion of australia would remain as long as the white australia policy remained in place due to the perceived threat and bilateral support in australia for the white australia policy the australian government became a vocal supporter of the continuance of the 1902 anglojapanese alliance australia was joined in its support for the alliance by new zealand but was heavily opposed by canada which believed that the alliance had hindered the british empires relationship with china and the united states no decision on the alliance was agreed on and the discussion was shelved pending the outcome of the washington naval treaty the results of the treaty which allowed the british to retain naval supremacy in the pacific ocean created a sense of security in australia many australians saw the four powers pact as replacing the anglojapanese alliance this sense of security became known as the ten year rule this led to defence retrenchments in australia following the international trend and a £500000 reduction in expenditure the governorgeneral henry forster when opening parliament on 22 june 1922 was quoted as saying 37in view of the result of attained at the washington treaty which my advisors believe guarantee peace in the pacific for some time to come it is proposed to reduce the establishment of the navy and army and postpone the expansion of the air force hmas canberra entering sydney harbour in 1930between world war i and world war ii the royal australian navy underwent a severe reduction in ships and manpower as a result of the washington naval treaty the flagship hmas australia was scrapped with her main armaments and sunk outside sydney heads in 1924 38 in the same year the ran began a fiveyear program of obtaining new ships from britain the heavy cruisers australia and canberra and the seaplane carrier albatross this purchase was partly paid for by scrapping brisbane melbourne sydney and most of the destroyers the great depression of 1929 led to another reduction of manpower although reduced in size the available posts were easily filled as many men were unemployed and the offered pay was greater than most jobs the rans personnel strength fell to 3117 personnel plus 131 members of the naval auxiliary services by 1932 the strength of the reserves stood at 5446 in the early 1930s lack of funds forced the transfer of the royal australian naval college from jervis bay to flinders naval depot in victoria in 1933 the australian government ordered three light cruisers hma ships perth hobart and sydney selling the seaplane carrier albatross to fund hobart during this time the ran also purchased destroyers of the v and w destroyer classes the ships that would become known as the scrap iron flotilla with the

and policing by these nations increasing the strain on existing maritime patrol resources and highlighting the need for countries without a maritime patrol force to obtain one especially in the south west pacific area 119in 1979 the australian and new zealand governments at the request of pacific island nations sent defence representatives into the southwest pacific region to assess surveillance and maritime patrol requirements the governments of a number of the pacific nations expressed their concern about the need for a suitable naval patrol force to meet their new surveillance requirements the australian government responded by creating the defence cooperation project dcp to provide suitable patrol vessels training and infrastructure to island nations in the region the pacific patrol

stirling on garden island and jervis bay to accommodate an expanded ran combat surface and submarine fleets the plan originally called for the major combat units and submarines to be split between the two fleet bases providing similar capabilities on both sides of the continent the proposed jervis bay naval base never became a reality fleet base east was built up around hmas kuttabul in sydney while hmas stirling is home to half the surface fleet and the entire submarine fleet the rationale behind the policy included the possibility of savings in fuel and maintenance that would result from indian ocean deployments beginning their journey from western australia rather than new south wales the report also classed the indian ocean as an area where contingencies might arise the new facilities would increase australias worth to the united states particularly to do with maintenance of submarines expansion at jervis bay would allow intensified east coast visits by the united states pacific fleet and its nuclear warship visits would not run into as much opposition as they do in sydney and melbourne 123the 1987 white paper was seen by many as an attempt to strengthen australias relationship with the united states which had been damaged by new zealands stance against nuclear weapons in its ports in line with this policy the ran was structured to become more selfreliant and its activities during the late 1980s were focused on operating within australias local region 124the two ocean policy remains in place today and is supported by the current australian government and the opposition the success of the policy is especially evident at hmas stirling the base is thriving and its location both in a global and local context gives it an advantage over fleet base east it has been suggested that all eight anzac class ships be relocated to stirling this would create an easier training environment for sailors and would lead to significant cost savings 125post coldwar  editthe gulf wars  edithmas anzac and hmas darwin with united states and british warships in late 2002australias contribution to the 1991 gulf war centred on a naval task group initially task group 6274 126 which formed part of the multinational fleet in the persian gulf and gulf of oman in addition medical teams were deployed aboard a us hospital ship and a naval clearance diving team took part in demining kuwaits port facilities at the end of the war over the period from 6 september 1990 to 4 september 1991 the ran deployed a total of six ships to the area hma ships adelaide brisbane darwin

127after the end of the first gulf war the royal australian navy periodically deployed a ship to the gulf or red sea to assist in maintaining sanctions against iraq until the outbreak of the second gulf war the australian naval force in the persian gulf continued to enforce the sanctions against iraq these operations were conducted by boarding parties from the ran warships 128a sailor from hmas adelaide inspecting a ship in the persian gulf during 2004upon the outbreak of war the rans focus shifted to supporting the coalition land forces and clearing the approaches to iraqi ports hmas anzac provided gunfire support to royal marines during fighting on the alfaw peninsula and the clearance diving team took part in clearing the approaches to umm qasr boarding operations continued during the war and on 20 march boarding parties from hmas kanimbla seized an iraqi ship carrying 86 naval mines 129since the end of the war the ran has continuously maintained a frigate in the persian gulf to protect iraqs oil infrastructure and participate in countersmuggling operations twelve australian sailors were deployed to umm qasr iraq between january and october 2004 to join the multinational training team working with the iraqi coastal defense force 130 the ran has also assumed command of coalition forces in the persian gulf on two occasions combined task force 58 in 2005 131 and combined task force 158 in 2006 132hmas westralia fire  editon 5 may 1998 a fire broke out onboard hmas westralia while off the western australia coast the fire was caused by the rupture of a flexible fuel line one of a number used to replace rigid hoses on cylinder number nine starboard engine this sprayed diesel fuel onto a hot indicator cock which ignited a spray fire resulting in the deaths of four crew following the fire the australian government and the ran began a major investigation known as the westralia board of inquiry the enquiry found that the ran and the contractor australian defence industries adi did not critically examine their course of action and that key personnel in both the ran and the contractor were insufficiently trained and qualified the inquiry also found that the hoses were not properly designed and were unfit for the intended purpose 133 in 2005 adi was fined 75000 for failing to provide a safe workplace seven sailors who were severely traumatised by the fire have also sued adi and subcontractor jetrock in august 2006 the australian government decided to accept liability after it reached settlement with the adi and jetrock the seven sailors stand to receive compensation totalling up to 10 million 134east timor  editduring the australianled united nations peacekeeping mission to east timor in 1999 known as interfet the ran deployed a total of 16

ships hawkesbury labuan wewak and whyalla following the initial deployment two vessels were generally kept on station in the area by the time the ran deployment ended 19 australian warships had taken part the last ship to leave was fremantle which sailed home in october 2004 137operation anode was not the first time units of the ran had been deployed to the solomon islands anode was unique in that the navys primary role was to support and facilitate the work of the participating police force ppf moreover along with being the first time the ran had supported a policeled mission 138fiji  editmain article operation quickstep on 2 november 2006 in response to the fijian military threats to overthrow the fijian government the australian government began operation quickstep by deploying military resources to support australian citizens in fiji in the event of a coup détat the contribution from the ran was the deployment of three vessels hma ships kanimbla newcastle and success to international waters south of fiji the three vessels were deployed to fiji to evacuate the estimated 7000 australian citizens present in fiji if the need arose 139 along with the three vessels a detachment of the special air service regiment sasr helicopters from the 171st aviation squadron and an evacuation team were also deployed 140on 29 november 2006 an australian army s70a black hawk

coup took place on 5 december but was bloodless and almost completely without violence the evacuation of australians was deemed unnecessary and vessels of the task force began arriving back in australia on 17 december with kanimbla docking in townsville and both newcastle and success returning to sydney 143 melville returned to australia in late december the ran has decided to attempt to recover the downed black hawk and has identified the united states navy supervisor of salvage supsalv as the preferred organisation 142 mv seahorse standard recovered the remains of trooper joshua porter on 5 march and the blackhawk helicopter on 9 march with the assistance of specialist equipment provided by the supsalv team the soldiers body was repatriated on 13 march escorted by members of the sasr seahorse standard arrived in australia with the aircraft wreckage at the end of march the wreckage will become evidence in the board of inquiry into the crash 144battle honours  editprior to 1989 the battle honour system of the royal australian navy ran was linked to that of the royal navy the british ministry of defence and the admiralty were responsible for approving and assigning battle honours although from 1947 this was done on advice from the ran badges names and honours committee 145 the only uniquely australian battle honour during this time was vietnam 1965–72 and smaller date units thereof for deployments to the vietnam war 146 ships of the ran inherited honours from british ships of the same name in addition to australian predecessors 145in 1989 the ran chief of naval staff admiral michael hudson approved a decision to have australian warships only carry battle honours earned by previous australian vessels 145 the creation and awarding of battle honours came completely under ran control 145a complete overhaul of the ran battle honours system was unvelied on 1 march 2010 to celebrate the navys 109th anniversary of creation 147 new honours were created for operations during the 1990s and 2000s—the last approved honour prior to this was kuwait 1991 for gulf war service—and the service history of previous vessels was updated to include due recognition of previous actions 147women in the ran  editwomen are expected to play a greater role in the ran in the future from 1911 to 1941 women were forbidden from serving in the ran the demands world war ii placed on personnel and resources led to a change of policy 148 on 21 april 1941 the australian naval board sent a letter authorising the entry of women into the ran to the commodoreincharge sydney the letter led to the formation of the womens royal australian naval service wrans and the royal australian naval nursing service ranns the two separate womens services existed until 1984 when they were incorporated into the permanent force today female members of the ran have a wide variety of roles open to them women serve on submarines command ships and shore postings and are expected to play
