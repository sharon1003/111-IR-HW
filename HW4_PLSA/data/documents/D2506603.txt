ben scrafield answered aug 27 2015 路 author has 78 answers and 865k answer views hydride is the name give to h the anion that results when a neutral h atom gains an electron if your question is actually why does this occur then i think one good explanation is electronegativity electronegativity is the propensity of an element to draw electron density in bonds towards itself this is quantified in different ways but essentially fluorine is always the most electronegative element and the low group i metals tend to be the least electronegative hydrogen is not very electronegative but it can be induced to take an extra electron if it is donated by something that is even less electronegative for example na h is a relatively wellknown base the sodium atom can be said to donate an electron to the hydrogen atom to form na and h800 views 路 view upvoters related questions more answers below what is the acceptor of hydride ions what are hydride ions why do some ions have negative entropies what are negative ions how are hydride ions formed ask new question julia saltflower interested in the science of music and the musicality of science answered sep 11 2015 路 author has 183 answers and 3187k answer views because the substances tend to achieve a stable electronic configuration and in ionic compounds hydrogen having one only electron needs an extra electron to achieve the stable two electrons in 2s orbital so adding this extra negative charge to the neutral atom it will be a negative ion363 views 路 view upvoterspromoted by 23and me explore your dna with 23and me learn more about your health traits and ancestry through 75 genetic reports learn more at 23andmecom jenni french ive been through more than i should have so i know a thing or two answered aug 19 2015a hydrogen atom has a charge of 1 h and an oxygen atom has a charge of 2 o2 when these are added together an overall charge of 1 results this is why a hydroxide ion is oh201 views ankit goswami professor of chemistry in an indian university answered sep 20 2015hydrogen can be broken into two parts mechanistic ally homolytically or heterolyticall when it breaks into ions the ion which has two electrons would be hydride since it has two electrons and only one proton so has a negative charge61 views
