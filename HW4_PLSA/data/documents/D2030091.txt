rectifier followed by a 220u f electrolytic capacitor to turn it into 32vdc the source has two wires does it matter in what order i connect the ac wires to the input to the bridge rectifier if so how do i determine which wire goes where i suspect that its totally symmetric on the input side but im am full of doubt when it comes to ac sorry if this is just a really dumb questionpower ac

probably doesnt apply in your case – sridhar nov 4 14 at 358sridhara  you are correct but where neutral is grounded a bridge rectifier probably wont do much good because the resulting dc supply isnt isolated so you cant connect v to ground – brian drummond nov 4 14 at 1139add a comment4 answers active oldest votesup vote29down voteaccepted when youre looking at an ac source in isolation such as in your question indeed theres no polarity and you can connect the wires either way round when combining two or more ac sources in series or parallel the relative phasing is very importantshare improve this answeranswered nov 4 14 at 322pericynthion3783 8 281while not relevant in this case i guess it is worth mentioning that transformers have polarity between the primary and secondary in schematic symbols this is denoted by a dot when the primary terminal with a dot on it goes high the secondary with a dot on it also goes high sometimes this matters – mkeith nov 6 14 at 603add a commentup vote13down vote as long as you are dealing with a closed system like a transformer secondary winding  bridge rectifier then no ac is not polarized however when dealing with outside power like what comes out of the wall we do consider accarrying cables to be polarized theres the hot wire carrying the juice and the neutral wire carrying the return the hot wire should go directly to your devices switch  fuse and any semiexposed contacts must have the hot wire as protected as possible if you dont do this on production items you will fail ul certification and be wide open for lawsuits the common light bulb would likely fail many of todays standards but its been around too long to recall devices that dont have a polarized wall plug will use a doublepole power switch to prevent the circuit being live up to the switchshare improve this answeranswered nov 4 14 at 654paul1827 7 7among others the schuko wall plug used in most of europe is not polarized so any device intended for those markets will have to assume that both wires are hot more electronicsstackexchangecomquestions96033… – ntoskrnl nov 4 14 at 2213ntoskrnl actually all the schuko plugs i have ever come across were polarized because they were designed to fit in both the schuko outlets as well as french outlets but that doesnt help when it is used in a schuko outlet which is not polarized – kasperd nov 5 14 at 0101kasperd the polarization of the french type polarized plug is not standardized for example the polarization is reverse in the czech republic compared to france – ntoskrnl nov 5 14 at 1512ntoskrnl

voltage has no polarity therefore it does not matter how you connect the wires to the bridge rectifier also there are no dumb questions feel free to ask about whatever is bothering you you will learn as will others and you will be safer for itshare improve this answeranswered nov 4 14 at 319barry9148 1 13 14the last three sentence are a comment not an answer – immibis nov 5 14 at 0401i think it is potentially dangerous to tell people that ac voltage has no polarity without further qualifying it some of the other answers covered areas where polarity is important to consider – mkeith nov 5 14 at 639add a commentup vote0down vote at the atomic level with the ac coming out of your transformer there is a herd of electrons which all run one way then stop turn round and run the other way half a cycle later since the electrons are running in both directions the transformer output has no polarity the job of the rectifier is to round them up and make them all run in the same direction now you know which way theyre going they now have polarity thats why the input of the rectifier doesnt specify which way round to connect the wires but the output doesshare improve this answeranswered nov 5
