experience as doctor verified hello what type of doctor did you see did you consult an orthopedic doctor can you raise your leg straight in the air after lying flat in the bed ask your own medical question i am not sure if i am waiting for the doctor to respond or if the doctor is waiting for me to respond doctor dr  saha i am waiting for your response to the above questions ask your own medical question i saw an internist only when my knee is not swollen i can put my leg in the air no problem doctor dr  saha thank you for the information the fissure can be due to a crack from trauma when you can raise your leg  then the muscle power is good it may need conservative treatment only some immobilisation with brace  analgesics will be helpful analgesics need to be used only when needed physical therapy can also be useful here however you can take an opinion of an orthopedic specialist  i hope this information will be helpful please ask if you need any clarification best wishes ask your own medical question hello dr  is it just a matter of waiting for the knee to heal the swelling gets in the way of walking etc i visited the physical therapist and since i am already strong according to his evaluation there isnt much he can do other than recommend glute exercises do i just avoid going up any type of elevation if i go up a hill or maybe it is down a hill that agravates it i have swelling the next day the swelling is so bad that it affects my gait what to do ialso doctor what do you mean by a brace since both knees seem to have the same problem interchangeably should i brace them should i brace them only when they become swollen i purchased something from the drugstore but i dont think you are referring to that thank you doctor dr  saha i had a misunderstanding that the swelling is affecting one joint which was affected by trauma did you got hit in both the knees ask your own medical question i only had an mri in one leg but i believe both patellas are cracked it was very hard to just get an mri for one leg the main problem is that i dont know how long it will take to heal what i should avoid i just would like some reassurance that this will one day heal and that my knees wont always swell after i walk uphill doctor dr  saha hello again i am opting out of your question another expert will take over it ask your own medical question thank you for your help anyway hello as dr saha has opted out i am here to help you the fissure in patella is not a major fracture but it s a minor  it is generally treated by putting the limb in   compression bandage or with cyllindrical slab or cast  it generally heals within 68 weeks as you have passed about 2 months then most probably the lesion could have been healed up the swelling you are facing at present may be a part of the healing process in which there is secretion of excess amount of the synovial fluid in the joint due to increased circulation as well to provide the intrarticular structures with good amount of the nutrition  to fight from the pathology generally this swelling goes away with development of strength in the quadriceps muscles i want to add here that if your muscles are not developed to the previous stage at present then in contrast your knee may look swollen so the first step here is to develop your quadriceps muscle  you may have anti inflammatory analgesic like advil to get relief if it is excessively there even after all this if this swelling continue to be ther then you should think of presence of post traumatic osteoarthritic changes which may be there in your age it will be better to use glucosamine msm sadenosyl methionine which are chondroprotective agents  are helpful in early stages at this stage i will advice you not to wear the brace after the 2 months but to keep the knee in mobility if fissure has healed instead you may wear knee cap  protected activities hope this will be helpful  if you are satisfied with my

question now dr tiwari would you mind clarifying should i avoid going up hills as that seems to trigger the swelling should i just spend a lot more time in the pool in the event that the healing isnt complete thanks mary anne also dr tiwari the mri was done recently 3 weeks ago it shows a fissure therefore it appears it hasnt healed does that change anything you have said earlier doctor drtiwari you should avoid going to the hill as well as frequent stairing up  down as these are the positions which does put maximum stress on the patellofemoral articulation doing pool exercises are good for you but remember excess should always be avoided mri report of 3 weeks back does not change the matter as this is the time post injury that is 48 weeks when tissues are healing  the important time is first 3 weeks after injury i think you should have a follow up mri after next 1 month which if show you recovery then nothing has to be done but if there is still fissuring with pain at the patella then you may need some drilling procedure by arthroscopic method to help with healing hope this will be helpful  if you are satisfied with my answer then please press green accept ask your own medical
