estimated it at roughly 4 billion the billionaire pledged from the start to selffund his presidential campaign not only ridding himself of some outside influences but also freeing up more time to campaign because candidates often devote a tremendous amount of time to raising funds im really rich trump famously said during his announcement speech adding that his confident attitude is what the country needs after having losers run the country trump has still accepted 65 million in contributions to his campaign since launching his bid but has also injected about 12 million of his own money and disavowed any super pacs looking to support him early in the race no stranger to politics while campaigning as an outsider trump is no stranger to politics for years before officially announcing his bid trump courted rightwing talk show hosts and hardline conservative politicians and activists he famously fanned the flames of the birther movement in 2011 and today takes credit for president barack obamas decision to release his birth certificate trump will now do battle for the republican nomination with a crowd of more conventional politicians including a scrum of governors and senators he stands out in another way beside his brash attentiongrabbing public persona hes hardly an orthodox conservative on a range of issues trump regularly bashes trade deals with china mexico and other countries hes spoken favorably about higher taxes on the wealthy and he talks up protecting social security and medicare in the social insurance programs current forms rather than making them more
