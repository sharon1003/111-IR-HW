home  main oyster page  oyster mushroom identification oyster mushroom identification lately ive received a number of emails asking me about oyster mushroom identification the most recent one came in early december from a reader named tracey she writes wondering if you could help me i took photos of mushrooms growing on tree stumps that i had that i could not split and set upright to dry out this is in western pennsylvania a few days ago our winter has been very mild so far 4050 degrees and damp is this the oyster mushroom and are there mushrooms that could look like this and be poisonous great questions tracey lets take a closer look at oyster mushroom identification ive broken this page into two sections identification features and look alikes please remember to never eat any mushroom if youre not absolutely sure what it is the internet is a great resource but if youre a beginner you should show your find to a real live expert to be safe nothing beats an in person identificationto read more about these mushrooms in general see this page special thanks to tracey ann miller for the picturestraits and characteristics pleurotus ostreatus is a common edible known for its oystershaped cap one of the first things you should look for when trying to identify this mushroom is the presence of decurrent gills decurrent means that the gills are attached to and run directly down the stem take a look at the close up to the right can you see how they run into and down the stem other identification features cap oyster or fan shaped usually 210 inches across 525 cm often grow in a shelflike formation with overlapping clusters smooth with no warts or scales usually white to light brown with firm white flesh the gills are white and are attached to and running down the cap and stem decurrent stem they may not have a stem if they do it will often be stubby and offcenter if the mushroom is growing on the side of a log if its growing on the top you will see a more well developed stem no ring around the stem and no sack around the base flesh is white spore print white to lilacgray its best to make the spore print on a dark background habitat these mushrooms are saprotrophic meaning they feed on dead material in this case wood thus youll find them growing on logs or sick or dying trees most often found on deciduous hardwoods trees that lose their leaves beech and aspen trees are common sometimes found on conifers as well smell said to have a mild anise odor meaning they smell a little sweet like licorice time of year summer and fall or winter as well in warmer areas return to top oyster mushroom look alikes this page tells you how to identify pleurotus ostreatus the true oyster mushroom however there are other mushrooms in the pleurotus genus that are referred to as oysters a few examples are pleurotus citrinopileatus  the golden oyster pleurotus eryngii  king oyster pleurotus pulmonarius  phoenix oyster pleurotus tuberregium  king tuberand many morethese species are all edible so if you mistake a phoenix oyster for a true oyster you will not be poisoned another similar species is the elm oyster hypsizygus ulmarius this is not a true oyster at all but is often mistaken for one to tell an elm oyster from a true oyster take a look at the gills the gills of a true oyster run down the stem the gills of an elm oyster do not the elm oyster is edible although some say not as tasty so are there any poisonous look alikes the poisonous omphalotus nidiformis is sometimes mistaken for an oyster it grows in japan and australia so become familiar with it if you live in those countries the same rules apply here as with any other species become familiar with them through reading and pictures try to find them in the wild and check your finds with someone who knows in real life taking a spore print and checking for gill attachment can be a big help good luckreturn to top
