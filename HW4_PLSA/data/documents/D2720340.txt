n foramen85list the steps in the repair process of a simple fracture hematoma formation fibrocartilaginous callus formation bony callus formation and remodeling86what is found in a haversian canal blood vessels and nerve fibers87several hormones control the remodeling of bones which two respond to changing blood calcium levels to keep bones in proper dimensions pth and calcitonin are the major determinants of whether and when remodeling will occur in response to changing blood calcium88why are the bones of young children much more flexible than those of the elderly bones of children are not completely calcified with a higher ratio of more flexible organic fibers bones in the elderly are more completely calcified which gives the characteristic of rigidity89inflammation of bony tissue is called osteitis90bones appear to be lifeless structures does bone material renew itself bone only appears lifeless in gross anatomy microscopically bone is full of cells and blood vessels that maintain and renew bone tissue approximately 5 to 7 of our bone mass is recycled each week up to 05 g of calcium may enter or leave the bones each day depending on the negative feedback hormonal mechanism and gravitational forces91compare the function of the organic materials in the bone matrix with the function of the inorganic materials in the matrix the organic matrix contributes to the bone structure and its tensile strength while the inorganic matrix contributes to hardness and resistance to compression92what are the differences between the diaphysis and the epiphyses of long bones the diaphysis bone is composed almost entirely of compact bone except in irregular and short bones while the epiphyses are composed almost entirely of spongy bone the epiphyses are on the ends of the bone the diaphysis is the shank of the bone the diaphysis in long bones has a large medullary cavity whereas the epiphyses do not93describe how oxygen is carried from outside a bone to an individual osteocyte blood vessels enter through the periosteum into a perforating canal the vessel may follow along the axis of the bone through a central canal osteocytes have long almost dendriticlike extensions or arms that reach out through tiny holes called canaliculi the canaliculi connect one cell to another and to the central canal oxygen would leave the blood vessel in the central canal and travel through the canaliculi from cell to cell until it reaches the cell in question94how is the beginning of intramembraneous ossification different from endochondral ossification intramembraneous ossification starts in connective tissue from mesenchymal cells that become osteoblasts these osteoblasts cluster together into an ossification center endochondral ossification starts with a hyaline cartilage template mesenchymal cells become osteoblasts and begin forming bone around the cartilage95if your doctor notices a marked decrease in calcium ion levels in your blood what gland might he suspect is not functioning properly and why answer tthe parathyroid gland normally responds to low calcium ion levels in the blood and releases pth which mobilizes osteoclasts to step up bone destruction releasing more calcium into the bloodstream if the parathyroid is not functioning properly it may release too much pth or not respond at all which seems to be the case here96clinical questions while on vacation last spring june fell on the pavement and broke her wrist at the emergency room a resident placed a cast on her wrist after manipulating the bones it seemed to heal within a few months however recently she has noticed lumps in the area where the break happened and she has been complaining of pain what could be causing the lumps and the pain june probably has bony spurs which are abnormal projections from a bone due to bone overgrowth97clinical questions alice and james adopted a 3yearold child from a developing country they noticed that her legs were bowed and there were some deformities in her cranial and pelvic bones they brought her to a physician for a diagnosis what was the diagnosis and what was the treatment for the disorder the child most likely has rickets a condition caused by poor diet especially one deficient in vitamin d the parents were told to increase her intake of calcium and vitamin d and to make sure that she gets some sunshine every day98clinical questions emily a 64yearold obese woman was brought to the hospital suffering pain in her legs and an x ray revealed that she had a simple fracture in her right femur and a crack in her left tibia other tests revealed that her bones were brittle and porous what might have happened to emily and what advice would she have been given by the physician emily has osteoporosis a debilitating bone disease that strikes more women than men after age 4550 the bones become weak and brittle due to leaching of calcium from the bone emily has been told that she needs to lose weight because her bones may not have the strength to support her body mass99clinical questions a 75yearold woman and her 9yearold granddaughter were victims of a train crash in both cases trauma to the chest was sustained x rays of the grandmother revealed several fractured ribs but her granddaughter had none explain these different findings the child had more organic material in her bones which allows them to bend while her grandmothers bones are extensively calcified with little organic material and are probably thin due to osteoporosis100clinical questions johnny fractured the lower third of his right tibia in a skiing accident the soft tissues in the area were severely damaged and their surgical removal was necessary after prolonged immobilization it was found that johnny was healing very poorly the explanation offered by the orthopedic surgeon was that vascularization of the fracture site was still inadequate and good healing was absolutely dependent upon an adequate blood supply describe how a long bone receives its blood supply and trace the path of nutrient delivery to the osteocytes long bones are nourished by nutrient arteries that frequently enter the shaft removal of the soft tissues probably reduced the flow of blood to the affected area the pathway would include diffusion of nutrients from blood vessels to periosteum to volkmanns canals to haversian canals to canaliculi to lacunae101clinical questions people who live in the north should take supplemental calcium with vitamin d explain why vitamin d is manufactured by sunlight and is needed for absorption of dietary calcium people who live in the north where the winter months are severe may need supplemental vitamin d because of the decreased amount of sunlight exposure102clinical questions when does prevention of osteoporosis start the prevention of osteoporosis should begin with children parents need to provide children with the opportunity to develop as much bone as they have inherited the ability to develop if people increase their peak bone mass as young adults they will have additional protection from osteoporotic fractures in the future103clinical questions if your elderly patients blood calcium level is normal does that mean the patient does not have osteoporosis explain no the level of calcium in the blood is expected to be normal even in advanced cases of osteoporosis the calcium in the bones will be low but that is not indicated by the blood nourishment104clinical questions mrs brown was outside on her patio cleaning windows when she fell off her step ladder and fractured her right hip she had emergency surgery for an open reduction and internal fixation of the right hip three days postoperative she asks you if she will have trouble going through airport security what has prompted her concern open reduction is the correction of the bone alignment through a surgical incision it may include internal fixation of the fracture with the use of rods wire screws pins or nails metal items that may trigger security alarms105clinical questions how can a tooth be moved in a bony socket during orthodontic treatment because bone deposition and reabsorption can occur and because bone responds to mechanical stress wolffs law a tooth can be moved by applying slight pressure to a tooth the bone on the forward side will reabsorb while the bone on the reverse side will be reformed106clinical questions explain why swimming is not generally recommended as an exercise to prevent osteoporosis mechanical stress and gravity help to promote skeletal remodeling swimming is not considered a weightbearing exercise the water not bones supports the bodys weight while swimming
