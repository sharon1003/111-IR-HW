live science tech reference who invented the printing press by elizabeth palermo associate editor  february 25 2014 0148am etmorejohannes gutenberg ca 13981468credit public domain johannes gutenberg is usually cited as the inventor of the printing press indeed the german goldsmiths 15thcentury contribution to the technology was revolutionary — enabling the mass production of books and the rapid dissemination of knowledge throughout europe however the history of printing begins long before gutenbergs time chinese monks and blocks nearly 600 years before gutenberg chinese monks were setting ink to paper using a method known as block printing in which wooden blocks are coated with ink and pressed to sheets of paper one of the earliest surviving books printed in this fashion — an ancient buddhist text known as the diamond sutra — was created in 868 during the tang tang dynasty 618909 in china the book which was sealed inside a cave near the city of dunhuang china for nearly a thousand years before its discovery in 1900 is now housed in the british library in london the carved wooden blocks used for this early method of printing were also used in japan and korea as early as the eighth century private printers in these places used both wood and metal blocks to produce buddhist and taoist treatises and histories in the centuries before movable type was invented an important advancement to woodblock printing came in the early eleventh century when a chinese peasant named bi sheng pi sheng developed the worlds first movable type though sheng himself was a commoner and didnt leave much of a historical trail his ingenious method of printing which involved the production of hundreds of individual characters was welldocumented by his contemporary a scholar and scientist named shen kuo in his 11thcentury work dream pool essays kuo explains that shengs movable characters were made out of baked clay the ink he used was a mix of pine resin wax and paper ashes and as kuo tells it shengs method could be used to print thousands of copies of a document fairly quickly while earthenware movable type was used by several other chinese printers throughout the 12th and 13th centuries shengs movable type didnt go mainstream in china or elsewhere until many centuries later in the 14th century wang chen a chinese government official of the yuan dynasty independently created his own set of movable characters out of wood his motivation for developing this new method of printing was the publication of a voluminous series of books on agriculture titled nung shu nung shu was eventually printed in 1313 using triedandtrue woodblock methods not movable type but chens printing method did catch on albeit slowly and was used for reproducing documents in the centuries that followed metal type — made from bronze and perhaps tin — was also used in china for the printing of books and paper money until at least the 18th century historical evidence suggests that metal movable type was also developed independently in korea in the late 14th century in 1377 a korean monk named baegun is credited with printing a compilation of buddhist sayings using movable metal type the twovolume book known as jikji is believed to be the oldest book in the world printed with metal type one volume of the work is held at the national library of france despite early successes with movable type this method of printing didnt catch on as quickly in asia as it did in europe this lukewarm reception was most likely due to the complexities of asian writing systems unlike the concise alphabetic script of many western languages chinese japanese and korean are made up of thousands of characters which would each have to be cast individually for printing using movable type such a daunting task may have made woodblocks seem like a more efficient option for printing in these languages europeans however took to movable type quickly before the invention of the printing press — sometime between 1440 and 1450 — most european texts were printed using xylography a form of woodblock printing similar to the chinese method used to print the diamond sutra in 868 manuscripts not printed with woodblocks were painstakingly copied by hand both processes were extremely labor intensive and as a result books in europe were very expensive and few could afford to buy them but all that changed in the middle of the 15th century when johannes gutenberg established himself as a goldsmith and craftsman in strasbourg germany in strasbourg gutenberg first began experimenting with both xylography and the development of a more efficient method of printing a printer demonstrates a gutenberg press gutenbergs press allowed more bibles books and music to reach more people credit upstudio  shutterstockcom gutenberg printing press like bi sheng wang chen and baegun before him gutenberg determined that to speed up the printing process he would need to break the conventional wooden blocks down into their individual components — lower and uppercase letters punctuation marks etc he cast these movable blocks of letters and symbols out of various metals including lead antimony and tin he also created his own ink using linseed oil and soot — a development that represented a major improvement over the waterbased inks used in china but what really set gutenberg apart from his predecessors in asia was his development of a press that mechanized the transfer of ink from movable type to paper adapting the screw mechanisms found in wine presses papermakers presses and linen presses gutenberg developed a press perfectly suited for printing the first printing press allowed for an assembly linestyle production process that was much more efficient than pressing paper to ink by hand for the first time in history books could be massproduced — and at a fraction of the cost of conventional printing methods examples of movable type which uses separate components for each letter number and punctuation mark credit youd also like how gutenberg changed the world live science the renaissance the rebirth of science  culture live science how
