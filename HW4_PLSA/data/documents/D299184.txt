november 15 2013grimm’s sasha roiz who plays captain sean renard talked to tvline about season three’s villain baby revelations and more here’s the interview“i often imagine he’s a character that just never sleeps” roiz tells tvline laughing “when would you have time he just worries it’s a huge responsibility”those worries look like they’re about to increase exponentially in this friday’s episode nbc 98c per the official synopsis “captain renard makes a startling realization about the possible identities of the royal baby’s parents”“you see it quickly play out in his mind the sheer panic of it all” roiz says “once he receives the information things start to move much quicker he springs to action”enter adalind renard’s newly rehexenbiested possible baby mama whom roiz notes that his “masochistic” character could have killed on several occasions – “and i chose not to”he continues “the more of a thorn in renard’s side that she is the more that she plays this chess game the more excited he gets”but given the royal power vacuum that his halfbrother eric’s death created sean won’t have much time for romance – even a twisted one – anytime soon lest we forget angel alum alexis denisof is poised to begin a multiepisode arc as viktor albert wilhelm george beckendorf a royal cousin whom roiz deems “the big bad this year”might viktor offer the outforhimself exile a way back into the royals’ good graces and if so would he take it the royals “definitely understand that that’s very alluring to him” the actor notes “it’s one thing that’s missing from his life… that idea of belonging and having that sense of family which was stripped away from him they know how to play that and manipulate that”in the meantime renard’s closest ally appears to be nick – that icy interaction in the last episode notwithstanding“i think we’re like what do you call it enablers” roiz says chuckling “there’s a tacit understanding that we are not going to get very far without one another so let’s just grin and bear it sometimes it’s good and we actually have some levity and other times it’s very adversarial”nick’s movingout party at monroe’s for instance after all of the teamwork in the season’s first two episode roiz watched the episode and felt a pang at his absence from the scene“for a second i was like ‘oh’ i was a little hurt by that” he jokes “i was like ‘is it so hard to invite the captain it would be such a big deal to send the guy a text maybe just make him feel included ”source tvline season 3 read more379 views1 2 next
