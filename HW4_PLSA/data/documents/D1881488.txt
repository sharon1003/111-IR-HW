have more infovia wareable february 2018 smartwatch rumors recently fitbit provided bits of information regarding their next steps and plans for the upcoming year while there aren’t any solid details just yet fitbit will be focusing on smartwatches — specifically a family of “ mass appeal smartwatches ” some early leaks indicate that the smartwatch will look quite different from the unique and oversized ionic which is probably a good thing the ionic itself was a pretty spectacular failure by most standards and part of that is likely linked to the aesthetics of the watch fitbit kept a low profile during ces in january so this is the first real news we’ve heard from them even without out much from fitbit there is still plenty of speculation about a follow up to the wildly popular charge 2 there’s also the adidas edition of the ionic smartwatch should be available by the end of march with fitbit’s earnings continuing to be disappointing it’s evident that the company needs to make some big changes to keep up with the rest of the wearable world and to regain traction with the apple watch 3’s impressive sales it seems that wearable brands are moving toward smartwatches more often however there is still a market for activity trackers — as garmin’s recent releases have shown fitbit continues to quietly add to their app store partner with various software and app developers and make changes to the ionic it seem likely that there will be more smartwatches before fitness trackers the ionic adidas edition will be available in march we’ll keep updating this page as we hear of
