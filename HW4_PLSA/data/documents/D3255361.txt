up with a friend boyfriend or girlfriend is one thing and there’s a lot of advice out there for doing it but what about a family breakup most of us are not in a position to “just leave” nor do we feel we want to or that it’s the right thing to do so what do we do when a toxic family member or members is literally ruining our lives how do we deal with the feeling of obligation guilt confusion and heartache it is important to note that not everyone’s family is there for them to lean on to call on or to go home to not every family is built on the premise of interconnectedness support and stability sometimes family simply means that you share a bloodline that’s all some families build you up and some suck your energy dry there are relationships and friendships that just aren’t fixable—this includes family there are situations that you can endure for only so long before you’ve outgrown them there may come a crucial time when you have to separate yourself from your family in order to do what is best for you and possibly for them in many respects the way we were treated by our family ends up being the same treatment we offer the world often times the signal and energy we put out into the world is similar to or exactly what we have experienced by others and for most of us this influential force has been our family think about it think about just how much the interaction or lack there of from our family sets the tone for the quality of energy we give off during our lifetime what is unacceptable treatment rejection abandonment not taking the time to get to know you or to be in your life making you feel unwelcome someone being competitive or hypercritical of you pressuring or forcing you to be someone you are not blaming ostracizing manipulating belittling neglecting and abusing you …the list goes on and on and on these types of experiences can make a deep imprint on our hearts and inhibit our ability to react without them being present in the back of our mind’s our reactions to life become skeptical doubtful fearful and we more often see the dark instead of the light in both people and situations these negative experiences can jade us for a lifetime unless we learn to do whatever it takes to get ourselves into a positive nurturing environment and replace negatively influenced reactions with positive ones what are the signs

on our mother when her husband passed a few years ago to gain control of her through lies and mother does not want to rock the boat i only communicate through email now with her and its to say hi oh and now she has been baptized as if to say that she is not liable for her behavior that caused pain for others and continues to do so i am glad to be free of her and that the universegod takes care of it in her lifetime log in to replyhelena says september 23 2015 at 0138my sister never used to call me unless she had been drinking on these occasions i would sit up all night chatting when her

1154been dealing with a negative mother my whole life am 40years old now my sister just disowned her and left and refuse to help her ever again if i leave she cant take care of herself and how much negative and controlling she can be i just dont have the heart to abandon her no matter how much i want to my heart denies it i really hate my mother at times well most of the time all she does is talk about people and puts you down and makes you feel like you can not accomplish anything no matter what you try and do to bring yourself up she takes it away no matter how much thought i put into myself to make my life better even if its work or other things she takes it all away and brings you down below her i feel like just ending my lie why bother anymore it sucks and its half way over and never had a taste of life because of her log in to reply libby m says november 5 2015 at 1951hang in there nxs it will get better in time hugs  prayers to u log in to reply maxwell says november 26

have ideas of how to lessen ur burden you need a lot of joy and positive experiences to combat her toxic negativity she has had her life before u were even born now it is time to live your life dont give up on being happy things can change log in to replyjackie says september 30 2015 at 1045soo diifficult is hard to convince abuser  user of the damage that they are doing to themselves and to the people who do care for them its hard to not be sucked in to the blame game log in to replybill says october 2 2015 at 2149great article i do all those things except one get away from them i have 2 brothers that are just scum they continually impose on my life plotting  scheming behind my back my mother is the core of the toxicity i cant get away from her bc she has me in a financial bind im stuck  have to endure their bs its gotten to a boiling point for 16yrs my mother used me i made her over a million dollars i solved all her problems big  small gave up my life for my stupid family they dont appreciate anything a couple of years ago i discovered my mother is just a big fat liar so are both my brothers both are losers i thought i could just find a job  leave but no one is hiring me bc for 16yrs my mother paid me 500month under the table i didnt care too much bc i thought i was just doing stuff for my family  thought i would be taken care of later but when i wanted to leave my mother made it impossible im stuck still need help but now all 3 are going to be in my face for 3 months no one i talked to has an answer  the job thing is the biggest hurdle if i got a decent paying job i could leave but min wage jobs arent going to cut it log in to reply melina says october 19 2015 at 1744waylon’s video is great 3 oh the article is good too log in to reply ingrid says october 20 2015 at 0348my family of origin is exceptionally toxic and abusive divorcing them has been the hardest thing i’ve ever done in my life and probably ever will do the process of extricating myself from them as peacefully as possible began around 7 years ago i am still grieving the loss though have absolutely no regrets it has definitely been a necessary and beneficial decision log in to reply marco says october 26 2015 at 1440yes get as far away from them as possible and never look back done it and i have no regrets ive been able to mend my spirit and reach beyond the limits of what they had me believe i could thats what walking away does for you log in to reply evan says november 14 2015 at 1301the problem i have is that my sister is toxic it hurts me deeply how ignorant she can be but as i try to explain this she blames me constantly since we are both in our early 20s we still are in unicollage and visit our parents regularly its gotten to the point where i want to remove myself from such abuse and give up on trying to convince her of the err of her ways mainly not seeing that we are a family and shouldnt point faults in others while avoiding your own faults my parents however who have seen this happen with their own siblings know that this will be the stake that ends our family talking about this to my father he has no solution for the daughter her loves who seems to point out nothing but a horrible situation for herself and the son myself who understands that she needs to widen her scope and see things for how they actually are im sick of abuse im sick of stating shes not the abuser when it actuality its just to hold our family together what do you do when the toxic relationships ending means the ending to that which is irreplaceable your family log in to reply magikal kat says november 23 2015 at 1956wow i know exactly how all of you feel i have a uncle who is very toxic and i have since cut all ties with him in high school i moved in with him and my aunt  mothers sister my dad was sick so i couldnt live with him and my mom wasnt around well everything started out fine during h s years but then little by little i was restricted i couldnt go out after school i had to come right home i couldnt out to the movies i couldnt have friends over my house i couldnt give out the phone number etc etc etc  then when i started dating it got worse i had 1 boy who was interested in me and i didnt dare to tell my uncle about him one day i didnt care anymore and this same boy asked me if i wanted to go to the mall with him after school i said yes i came homelate like around 5 and you would have thought i had gotten kidnapped all hell broke loose my uncle demanded that i call up this boy in front of him and break up with him i was devastated i couldnt do i was soo upset so my uncle calls him up and tells the boy i said said all these horrible nasty things about him the boy believed my uncle and broke up with me and never spoke to me again fast forward to my college years and another guy comes along and uncle tries to sabotage that relationship too luckily this guy was smart and could see thru my uncles mind games 5 years of hell we went thru with to be together my uncle was vicious he screamed at me all the time called me vile names threw things at me nearly slammed a door on my fingers called up the guy i was with nonstop and accused him of things too while i lived with them they also treated me like a maidslave i had to cook for them run out to stores for them pick up things for them cleaned for them all the while being screamed at nonstop i literally felt like cinderella finally i had had enough and i moved out still to this day this same uncle texts me on my cell phone and leaves messages telling me what a terrible person i am and how the family is ashamed of me and my actions i now ignore his texts and have stopped all contact with him me and the guy are still together to this day and have since moved out of state away from my crazy unclelog in to reply chey says november 24 2015 at 2142my dad has been toxic to my family for 20 years i had moved in with my spouse 1 year ago after my parents had divorced and my sister moved out of state to this day my dad still causes problems i had tried to distance myself but i keep thinking about the past and how we used to talk i tried forgiving him in the past but every several months he does the same thing again so it turns into a vicious cycle i don’t know how to handle another one of his cycles it’s so incredibly hard to block out a family member i try to stay positive but it becomes very challenging at times log in to reply jay are p says november 25 2015 at 1402i have chosen to take a toxic family member out of my life i have felt a much better life after doing so the only thing since then is another family not agreeing with my decision and now pressures me to forgive and forget which then makes me feel like another toxic relationship is starting im at an age where i can decide who i would like to speak with and who i will not speak with so here i am feeling down and out over and over again from another family member who just wont give up on this because it hurts there feelings im on day two of a constant headache from this situation……log in to reply guest says december 13 2015 at 1234dont worry im in the same place…i decided to take a toxic felative out of my life almost 20 years ago when i was really young…best decision ever i couldnt take the abuse anymore the thing is people think its somewhat forbidden or cruel or something impossible to think of to decide to remove a relative from your life but i say go for it your life and your well being is first who cares what others think i bet they dont have to deal with the abuse so its easy for them to say youre too sensitive better forget and forgive its not ideal of course not but i wish people were more understandating and had more empathy so they wouldnt judge so much the funny thing is few people seem to judge the abuser but they judge the one they abused for standing up … seriously your are firstalways act thinking about whats best for you…i wasnt like that by nature but toxic people force you to be like that log in to reply harleigh says december 13 2015 at 2000hi so i’m not 100 sure if some of my family members would qualify as toxic or not i have a mother who is one way towards me one minute and then acts completely different if certain people are present or if she’s talking about me to someone else my granny is pretty much the same way except she vickers about everything under the sun nearly always sometimes it’s about how i dress who i’m with what i’m doing what i say etc well i have manic depression and severe anxiety and 99 times out of 10 when i’m around them both together it ends in a horrible fight they’re quick to talk bad about each other until they’re side by side and then they seem to ‘ team up ‘ and verbally attack me about literally everything i’m 24 and as an adult i feel like they really over step their boundaries i’ve tired calmly talking to them the way my psychiatrist has suggested but it never works they cut me off every time well my boyfriend has offered i move out and in with him so that i’m not stressed out constantly and that’d put some distance between my family and me as well any time i’ve ever moved it starts a fight that is so bad i end up in panic attacks and tears i have no idea how to even approach them about moving because i already know how this will go down any suggestions it’s so hard because they’re family and they know how to make me feel awful  log in to reply anonymous says december 31 2015 at 1501my family is a complete mess my aunt tried to kick my mom’s belly while she was pregnant of me my mother locked herself in the bathroom and called my dad crying saying that my aunt was screaming and threatening her outside the bathroom door after that they didn’t speak anymore and my father hates her deeply but now she’s trying to get closer to my mom and to me and keeps trying to buy us with presents she truly is a horrible person and i completely understant my dad but my mom doesn’t see it and fights with my dad a lot over this despicable person she tries to force my dad to talk to her and sometimes he does but he told me that he feels like crying everytime he looks at her i love my father more than anything in the world and i hate seeing him like this i just want my aunt to stay away from my family but i have no idea how to do that and how to make my mom see who she really is log in to reply cerrha says january 3 2016 at 1151i recently had a break up with my dad he is an abusive alcoholic growing up i would compulsively spy on my parents so i would know whether things were ok or if he might leave us again by age 10 i recognized that my mom loved him but his love for her was unequal he disrespected her criticized her and was inconsiderate of her every day he was living with us but he wasnt present he never did anything with me though occasionally he would do fatherson stuff with my brother he did get sober for several years when i was a teen and then life was wonderful but when i was 18 my mom and i were out horseback riding and there was an accident my mom was left permanently disabled and in constant pain still to this day 17 years later when my dad realized that she would never be able to work again that he would need to support her instead of her supporting him when he retired he became angry and abusive once more and resumed drinking and also had many many affairs which he had also done early in their marriage i moved away married and had a son before i realised how things stood at that point i began planning for my moms escape and divorce and moved to a larger house with a guesthouse so she would have a place of her own with me it took several more years for her to be convinced to leave he flushed her medications or stole them for himself he shook her to cause her more physical pain he screamed at her telling her how stupid she was and that no one liked her or wanted to be near her and many other awful things when my mom ended up sleeping in the guest room door locked and a knife under her pillow because she was afraid he would try to kill her she finally resolved to leave him she had been with him since she was 12 and married to him for 33 years one day while my dad was at work my husband and i moved my mom out and brought her to live with us my dad went insane he blamed me he made false accusations about my mom and tried to use my kids to manipulate me when things cooled off i tried to resume a fatherdaughter relationship but he couldnt behave himself and we frequently fought he even went so far as to remove parts from my moms car engine so she would miss her class reunion one night he was in a car accident and nearly died his back and arm were badly broken his face was crushed and required reconstructive surgery his skull was fractured and some internal organs were lacerated he was in the hospital in the icu for a month and then moved to a recovery facility for another 2 months during that time i took care of his house his pets and his bills and kept his boss informed on his progress so he would have a job to return to eventually his blood alcohol level at the time of the accident was 244 more than 30 times the legal limit the doctor told me that only a lifetime alcoholic could survive having that much alcohol in their system thank god no other cars were involved in his accident i had hoped this would be a wake up call and a life changer but he returned to alcohol within weeks and became worse than ever 7 years later he still raves and rages against my mother and does everything he can to try and destroy the life she has been making for herself last september i told him that if he wanted to be involved with me and my 4 kids then he would have to stop trying to get back at her for leaving and he would have to be sober before coming over he accused me of hurting my kids by making these boundaries he said he would never contact me again and then told all of our very extensive family that i had been manipulated by my mom and that i quit speaking to him at first i was upset but once i realized that i would never again have to live in dread of the holidays of trying to make sure that he was either with my brother or with me on special days nor worry about him showing up to my kids birthdays hammered nor hear his lies again when i realised all this then i felt incredibly liberated i never ever want to go back to trying to have a relationship with him again a few days before christmas he started a fight with my brother and quit speaking to him as well of course he blames our mom but now my brother and i and our spouses and children will never have to be exposed to this dysfunction again and we are all relieved log in to reply amelia says january 17 2016 at 2017its a comfort to see that i am not alone to have suffered a toxic family from a young age i knew my siblings were not people whom id wish to befriend my brother especially bully would be putting it lightly abusive physically mentally emotionally you name it he is now in his late 30s and has not changed he also refuses to admit any wrongdoing whatsoever and places the blame on those he injures i no longer allow myself to stress i will not allow this toxic person to have power or control over me for the most part ive blocked him out of my life i wish i could visit my parents more often i love them dearly but he lives with them…they are financially stressed and he has been living off their good will for years all the while neglecting his responsibilities towards his child good thing the kid lives with the mother no one picks their family and after a while of trying to make it work you have to face it…its best to walk away and remain a better person than let yourself be sucked in to their nastiness self preservation and survival log in to reply jeannine neuschwander says january 23 2016 at 0916i didn’t like the word toxic at first i preferred to think of these people as just sick but as time went on i came to understand that a sick person refusing to get better is toxic we’ve had to deal with several times my husband’s family’s control issues if we don’t live or do what they want they don’t talk to us the first couple times i was so angry but after the last couple times which is going on two years now i was able to accept my pain and recognize that they are just sick people that want to stay that way my kids are hurt and it has put additional issues in their lives but i just tell them that we can’t control other people and when we’re feeling hurt or mad we should pray for them today my life has much less drama and more peace i am not being compared to anyone else and i feel freedom to be who i am i am thankful for friends and family that lives me for who i am for relationships where people work on themselves to be healthy for each other and for boundaries you never know your strength until you decide to forgive someone who has never said they are sorry for hurting you and you don’t have to crawl back and let them hurt you again codependency recovery such as melody beattie materials really helps with this we can break the cycle log in to reply george says march 2 2016 at
