with carbon molecules so lets look at them in a methane molecule there is one carbon and 4 hydrogens now we know that carbon has 4 free electrons in its valence shell we know that the 1s shell is filled with 2 electrons we would also expect the 2s shell to be filled with 2 electrons now what normal chemistry classes tell you is that each of these 2p shells are aligned around a certain axis in three dimensions thus each of them can be named according to their axis alignment as 2px 2py and 2pz we would expect to see these shells in their normal dumbbell shapes so one electron is filled into the 2px and 2py shells respectively remember both electrons have the same spin also remember that this is just an expected scenario not what really happens instead the hydrogen knocks off one electron from the 2s shell and transfers it to the 2pz shell which is empty we now have one electron in each of the 2nd orbitals shells now each of these shells have the same number of electrons with the same spin on each making them have the same properties thus they can all be grouped into one category and we call this category a hybridised hybrid meaning mixed or combined shell since this new shell is a mixture of one 2s and three 2p shells we call it a hybridised sp3 shell the same thing occurs with sp2 and sp hybridised shells except with a smaller ratio of s to p mixture hope this helps225 views ·

is responsible for the geometry of a molecule but the reality is that on the basis of the geometry of molecules their hybtidization are decided structure of a molecule is obtained from xray
