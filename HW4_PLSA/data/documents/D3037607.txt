facts about ufc fighter pay d july 23 2013the wnba is also dangerously close to not existing sicwill july 24 2013unlikely… the total salary cap for a wnba team is less than 1 mil the max salary for any given player is only 101000 it literally costs nothing to operate which is why david stern keeps it going even with no one watching compare that to the nba where kobe is making 30 mil a year and the lakers and nets spend over 100 mil in payroll every year kobe could literally pay the salaries of every player and probably coach too in the wnba and still have money left over they also just signed a 10 year deal with espn which should guarantee most teams in the league making a profit the league as a whole already does joey july 23 2013this is stupid fighters average more than 2 fights a year the lowest mma fight gets paid more than the lowest boxer boxers can get 500 for a fight you only tell us what the highest grossing boxer makes you also can’t factor in payper view income the top earning stars make that info is not released you don’t factor in medical  travel  bonuses  other paid gigs for appearances  broadcasting you seem biased… stop writing coach july 24 2013i train both mma and boxers boxers make 3 times the amount that mma fighters make and have double the length as far as the career the average boxer even a bum makes 1000 to 1500 a fight there first 6 to 8 fights they normally have that many fights the first year mma fighters nor boxers get paid for medical both get paid for travel which unless they’re with a promoter is little to nothing boxing at this point gross way more then mma and it’s been around long enough that these fighters are not going to get punched in the face for peanuts a 20 and 0 low to no name boxer middleweight or welter weight can get a 50 to 100 purse easy on a espn low end card mma is in need of some kind of union joey july 24 2013a bum makes 1500 high end u say… lowest ufc fighter 6k to show 6k to win something like that… thanks for proving me right sir dick july 24 2013joey you have no idea what you’re talking about…at all not only have i fought in the ufc 28 but i also train with tj waldburg in belton and i’m at ft hood with colton smith tim kennedy  yves edwards is right over in austin so i can personally say that ufc pay is terrible entry fighters in the ufc make 2000 these days the only way to make any kind of semidecent dough is to get the knockout bonus or fight of the night purses in other shows i’ve been paid 10 times more…i fought in bellator 21 lost and still made more than the ufc will pay youcralph709 july 24 2013just curious what your name is i looked up the results to bellator 21 and ufc 28 and didn’t see a fighter that fought on both cards sorry for asking i’m just curious lol i’m pretty fanatic when it comes to mma history kyle july 24 2013mma fighters in smaller organizations make much less than 6k to show and 6k to win you’re clearly still wrong here sir ian july 24 2013actually jimmy hendrix made 14k from his last fight in which he won and the guy is the number one contender chris weidman earn a lil over 20k plus the kotn bonus with win over andersen who banked in 400k afo44 december 27 2013and the ufc covers medical expenses that occur in the octagon john july 24 2013are you insane in canada a club fighter boxing for a small promotion makes at least 800 – 1000 for the fight that pay is win or lose mma fighters start at 400 to show and 400 to win top level boxers make so much more than mma fighters mayweather makes 30 million a fightdo your homework mark a brown february 10 2014but we are talking the ufc that is the top tier in mma not some regional promotion josh boyd july 23 2013did you know that there are 34 regular season games in a wnba season the wnba is subsidized by the nba and it is still failing… the numbers shared above are only “disclosed” amount s… pro golf is a much better sport to compare mma to and the numbers are much closer despite golf also being much more global than the wnba and having been around for a couple of hundred years it is also much more comparable because it is an individual sport and the actual organization does the paying nfl players do not get paid by the nfl but ufc fighters get paid by the ufc and that makes a difference most pro golfers compete a lot more than 34 times per years and 90 of them subsidize their income with coaching and repping companiesproductsdennis scharf july 23 2013i mentioned this riff many times back in the early 2000 but i got the feeling i was made out to be an ass well now all of a sudden i never stopped saying it in a good way but now the fighters are speaking up now what real fighters thru the years have done is to refuse to fight until it was good for the fighter and still very good for the enterprise and their future development but you men better step up to the plate because they do not care about making a fool out of you either nice is nice but greed is greed get some business savvy guys it’s your future in the long run refuse as well as agree i really appreciate all the good times you have made for us d mac july 23 2013floyd mayweather is his own promoter he doesn’t go through bob arum or any other association he throws his own shows the fact is most boxers make jack shit look if you’re looking to make huge money then win huge and become a huge draw anderson silva made peanuts at one point too rdlc july 24 2013silva was supposed to be the baddest mother they had he’s made as of when they started keeping salary records around ufc 46 23 million… total still quite pathetic at that level of the sport greg july 24 2013anderson silva has made over 100 million for his fights between the ufc and his sponsors i would hardly call that peanuts coach july 24 2013don’t believe that greg anderson silva hasn’t made half that even with endorsements his networth is only 10 million numbers don’t lie httpwwwcelebritynetworthcomrichestathletesmmanetworthandersonsilvanetworthjosh boyd july 24 2013only joey july 24 2013his lifetime worldwide nike deals prolly worth more than 10 million joey july 24 2013thats not showing how much of his  of each pay per view was he had 2 or 3 of the highest selling pay per views  whatever dude july 24 2013i just think this goes to show what real sportsman the fighters truly are they are willing to do whatever it takes just because they love the sport they aren’t like all the lame sports pros who only play with balls that make millions just for playing a kids game it’s sad how low the bank is for mma fighters but their heart is what proves that ufc bellator invicta and any mma brand is the only true “sport” left games and pads are for pussies 4 oz gloves and cups are for real men and women the patriot july 24 2013this is silly those figures are not what the fighters actually get paid every one of those fighters got more than what was disclosed…in many cases a lot more this ufc pay is a nonissue back in the day we fought for gas money in grimey holeinthewall bars if fighters don’t like what they are getting paid they need to go do something elsejoe december 19 2013go back under the bridge and sniff some more glue idiot jeremy wagle july 24 2013fact of the matter is ufc is becoming watered down with the “grind it out” types not the winning types mma is my passion my love and my privledge to be apart of these foghters today have forgotten what loyalty is about hell i dont believe any fighter in any sport should get a garauntee outside travel and medical… firm believer that the winner gets the lion’s share in fact i am willing to fight anyone under a winner takes all stipulation and mr dana white you are the man

area the were being paid between 500 and 700 for their debuts and they had to pay their own medicals which were 380 that means they would gross 120 to 320 after which they would have to pay taxes on the net that is a fact i also had a payperview comain train in my gym and he grossed 5000 for his fight and recieved a broken leg obviously he signed a waiver before the match which precluded him for suing for damages boxers starting out make peanuts too but on average they make much more the promoters in mma are the big winnersstabler august 1 2013what org were they fighting for ufc new fighters
