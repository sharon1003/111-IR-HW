 â€“ upperguy 10 points 5 years ago denim is an amazing world and im gonna jump in before everyone else get their hands on this bare in mind i only pretend to be an expert higher quality denim is a thing of beauty just like you have higher quality suits in both material and construction all this applies to denim unfortunately for most of us what we end up with is something cheap that will last a year or two three if we are lucky and by then they are shredded and threadbare what you get with a nicely made pair of jeans is construction that will last years and years and only get nicer as they age i dont know how old you are but you might remember growing up and having the same pair of jeans forever and how when you finally replaced them everything else felt like cardboard edit nvm you are 17 but still if you can swing it check out naked  famous or apc or if youre looking on the cheaper side unbranded they are just a few of the brands that make really nice denim im about to pickup a pair of nf but everything ive seen on them looks like they really experiment with different types of weaves and construction they made a pair that were 10 stainless steel thread im going to drop a few buzzwords on you to look into rawdry denim and selvedge selvedge denim was made on traditional shuttle looms and can be identified along the length seam by the edge it is generally considered to be higher quality and holds up much longer raw or dry denim hasnt been put through an enzyme wash what the enzyme wash does is simulate an accelerated wear cycle essentially breaking down the denim to create that softer worn feeling by causing the breakin in a tub instead of on your body the denim will never properly mold to you so initially rawdry denim will feel a bit stiff or coarse but once it starts breaking inits the greatest feeling in the world a lot of people take this to an extreme and dont wash their raw jeans only spot cleaning and freezing when they start to smell youre on your own for this one though again im no expert but if you want to chat denim id be happy to give you my im or skype info maybe some candy if you want to go for a ride in my sweet van tldr getting a single nice pair of jeans is much better than a few cheap pairs but lucky and true religion can be found at tjmaxx and similarpermalink embed save
