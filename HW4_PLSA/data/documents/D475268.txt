home sound advice q is there a better balancedtounbalanced cabling solution hardware  cables  connectors recording published may 2013 by hugh robjohns the line inputs on my computer interface are all balanced on trs sockets but the outputs of my hardware synths are all unbalanced on mono ts sockets ive been connecting them with ordinary unbalanced guitar leads up until now but some of them suffer from what i think is groundloop hum and i wondered if there was a better way i thought about using di boxes but i dont have enough miclevel inputs peter bradley via email sos technical editor hugh robjohns replies di boxes would certainly cure the groundloop hum problem because they generally employ a transformer to balance the signal with a groundlift switch to isolate the grounds between the synth and interface however it seems a bit silly taking a linelevel signal from a synth and knocking it down to mic level only to reamplify it again inside the interface and as you dont have enough mic inputs we can discount that option anyway a better option would be to use linelevel transformer isolation boxes these use a transformer again to balance the signal and isolate the source and destination grounds but like di boxes the good ones are quite expensive unless youre handy with a soldering iron — and have a lot of patience — soss custommade pseudobalanced cables could be the best solution for connecting unbalanced equipment to balanced inputs thankfully there is a much cheaper and more convenient alternative which takes advantage of the fact that a balanced input is also a differential input a differential input looks for a signal applied between the hot and cold sides of the connection and unlike an unbalanced connection the cable screen which is grounded plays no part in transferring the wanted audio — its only there to trap unwanted external interference we can use this differential input idea to our advantage by wiring a cable in a slightly nonstandard way to trick the balanced input into accepting an unbalanced signal while also avoiding a ground loop the nonstandard wiring is actually very simple the signal side of the unbalanced output quarterinch plug tip is connected to the hot side of the balanced input quarterinch plug tip while the trick part is to connect the ground side of the unbalanced output quarterinch plug sleeve to the cold side of the balanced input quarterinch ring in that way the balanced input sees the wanted signal between its hot and cold inputs as it should but the unbalanced outputs ground isnt connected directly to the balanced inputs ground any more so there cant be a ground looptechnically the balanced input loses its ability to reject electrostatic rf interference because the impedances to ground from each input terminal are now different unbalanced however with linelevel signals connected with relatively short cables of under five metres or so rf interference is unlikely to be a problem anyway and in practice ive employed variations of this kind of bodge interfacing for decades without any problems incidentally this kind of bodge interface is typically called a pseudobalanced connection the quickest easiest and dirtiest diy approach would be to cut off the ts plugs from the interface end of your existing unbalanced cables and solder on new trs plugs for the balanced input the signal core wire should be reconnected to the trs tip terminal and the screen to the ring terminal leaving the trs sleeve unconnected and isolated although that solution will work it has virtually no protection against rf interference and a better solution can be obtained if you start with balanced cables and modify the unbalanced end instead in this case the hot signal wire is connected to the unbalanced tip the cold signal wire to the unbalanced sleeve and the balanced cable screen is left isolated and disconnected in this way the cable screen will provide a useful degree of rf protection although it isnt as good as it could be the optimum solution is to connect the screen at the unbalanced end too because that maximises the rf screening however a direct connection will reinstate the ground loop so thats not a good idea instead the cable screen should be connected at the unbalanced end via a simple circuit that maintains a relatively high impedance to mains and audio frequencies to prevent the groundloop hum but a much lower impedance to rf to maintain effective rf screening this simple circuit is nothing more than a 100ω resistor in parallel with a 10n f capacitor although these values are not particularly critical the practical problem with this approach lies in trying to squeeze a resistor and capacitor into the very limited amount of space inside a standard ts plug without everything shorting out its not impossible if you have decent soldering skills small components and some patience but for those who dont help is at hand in the form of our very own custommade sos pseudobalanced cables these are available from the sos shop to uk customers at £1999 or £1699 to sos subscribers they come with either an xlr or a trs connector at the balanced end they are made to our own specifications and to very high standards by pirahna cables using neutrik connectors and pirahna ultraflex cable ive been using some recently to avoid the frustration of making up some new pseudobalanced cables myself and they work superbly well published may 2013previous article next article
