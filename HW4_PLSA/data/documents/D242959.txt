wikipedia comet  a comet is an icy small solar system body that when close enough to the sun displays a visible coma a thin fuzzy temporary atmosphere and sometimes also a tail these phenomena are both due to the effects of solar radiation and the solar wind upon the nucleus of the comet comet nuclei range from a few hundred meters to tens of kilometers across and are composed of loose collections of ice dust and small rocky particles asteroid  asteroids from greek ἀστήρ star and εἶδος like in form are a class of small solar system bodies in orbit around the sun they have also been called planetoids especially the larger ones these terms have historically been applied to any astronomical object orbiting the sun that did not show the disk of a planet and was not observed to have the characteristics of an active comet but as small objects in the outer solar system were discovered their volatilebased surfaces were found to more closely resemble comets and so were often distinguished from traditional asteroids meteor  a meteoroid is a sand to bouldersized particle of debris in the solar system the visible path of a meteoroid that enters earths or another bodys atmosphere is called a meteor or colloquially a shooting star or falling star if a meteoroid reaches the ground and survives impact then it is called a meteorite many meteors appearing seconds or minutes apart are called a meteor shower the root word meteor comes from the greek meteo¯ros meaning high in the airshare cite improve this answeranswered nov 22 11 at 228larian le quella6634 2 39 70i

into each other with no clear dividing line classically a comet gives off a lot of gas and dust even forming a noticeable tail once the volatiles are mostly used up an inactive comet can be mistaken for an asteroid except perhaps on a close pass to the sun when it heats up enough to outgas again there are many asteroids out there particularly those that swing through the inner solar system that probably started life with a lot of ice and would have been called comets but are now almost entirely rock and dust there is no clear line between an asteroid and a meteoroid both are rockydusty its a matter of size as to how you refer to it however there is no clearcut dividing line a big one is usually referred to as an asteroid while smaller stuff is a meteoroid you could draw the line on whether its big enough to likely survive a trip through the earths atmosphere as a meteor and arrive on the surface as a meterorite but that also depends on the composition initial speed and trajectory not just diameter and of course it would depend on which planet gravity and atmospheric density its heading towardsshare cite improve this answeranswered jun 30 14 at 1424phil perry683 5

considered asteroids the international astronomical union also defines dwarf planets which are smaller than planets but bigger than asteroids the qualification natural must be added because the number of manmade objects in orbit around the sun are also never considered asteroids if an asteroid is ever observed to have a coma—a surrounding cloud or a tail—a coma extended to have a linear appearance it is officially categorized as a comet and ceases to be officially categorized as an asteroid scientifically we know that the usual reason for this appearance is an icy composition but it is much more difficult to determine composition than to observe appearance so most objects categorized as comets remain categorized solely on appearance a meteor is a small natural object which is or could be observed entering the atmosphere the countless meteors visible any given night are almost always smaller than any cataloged asteroidshare cite improve this answeranswered mar 13 12 at 232soniaadd a commentup vote1down vote i am sure the above answers will serve well for the op but i tend to remember it simply by this  asteroid a relatively small inactive body composed of rock carbon or metal which is orbiting the sun comet a relatively small sometimes active object which is composed of dirt and ices comets are characterised by dust and gas tails when in proximity to the sun far from the sun it is difficult to distinguish an asteroid from a comet meteoroid a small particle from an asteroid or comet orbiting the sun meteor a meteoroid that is observed as it burns up in the earths atmosphere  a shooting star meteorite a meteoroid that survives its passage through the earths atmosphere and impacts the earths surfacehttpwwwnearearthobjectscoukshare cite improve this

that they move quite slowly through the sky you need to look really closely with a telescope to see them move against the starry background meteors start out also in orbit around the sun but they are very small so we cant see them until they enter the earths atmosphere they are travelling very fast relative to the earth which makes them heat up so that we view them as rapidly moving streaks of light across the sky a meteor takes a second or two at most to cross the sky while a comet or asteroid takes weeks or months there are also artificial satellites in orbit around the earth these move at an intermediate speed taking about 5 or 6 minutes to cross the sky so its very easy to tell the difference based on the speeds they travel meteors fast satellites intermediate comets and asteroids slow now the hard part comets vs asteroids comets are made up mostly of ice as they near the sun they are warmed and the ice sublimates forming a tail which is swept away by the solar wind asteroids have already visited the region of the sun many times in the past and have lost most of their ice so they dont form tails in a telescope they look just like stars except that they move from one day to the next like a planetshare cite improve this answeranswered mar 13 12 at 2222geoff gahertyadd a commentprotected by qmechanic ♦ feb 13 13 at 1828thank you for your interest in this question because
