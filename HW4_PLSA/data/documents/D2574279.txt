hookes law introduction a spring is usually a coiled piece of metal or plastic that has the property of stretching when pulled if the spring is elastic then it will return to its original lengthshape when the pulling force is removed depending on the coiling some springs can also be compressed this is unlike many of the forces encountered in most of introductory physics for instance to lift a ball off the floor with constant velocity you need to supply a force equal to the balls weight make sure you can explain why this is so since the balls weight is constant the lifting force is constant in contrast to the ball moving a spring a distance x measured from its unstretched position requires a nonconstant force the more you stretchcompress a spring the more force it requires for elastic springs the relationship between the applied force and the distance the spring moves is called hookes law f  kx 1the negative sign is used because f is the restoring force of the spring which is in the opposite direction from the applied force of the hanging mass the restoring force is therefore in the opposite direction from the displacement of the spring this relationship between restoring force and displacement depends on the physical properties of the spring the more stiff a spring is the more difficult it is to stretch or compress it the stiffness of a conventional spring more commonly referred to as the spring constant k is dependent on the material the spring is made of the number of coils the gauge of wire used and the radius of the coil because the restoring force is a function of displacement a constantly changing position will result in a constantly changing force and therefore a constantly changing acceleration even though force and mass are not constant newtons second law describing the linear relationship between them should still be true f  ma 2objectives primary objective to examine hookes law and newtons second law in the case of a stretched or an oscillating spring secondary objective to use hookes law and newtons second law to determine the mass of a hanging weight materials helical spring and stand mass hanger and slotted masses lab pro and computer with logger pro vernier force sensor and motion detector meter stick pan balance activity 1 hookes law note please do not twist stretch or bend these springs beyond their elastic limit the elastic limit is the point at which the spring no longer returns to its original shape treat these springs gently in this activity you will use hookes law to graphically determine the spring constant of a helical spring you will not be using the dualrange force sensor or the motion sensor in this activity examine eq 1 this equation predicts that there is a linear relationship between applied force and displacement from equilibrium on your table is a spring suspended vertically with a mass hanger attached to the underside make sure that there is some separation between all of the coils by placing a 20 g mass on the hanger this will be the first data point for the applied force turn your meterstick upside down and position it beside the spring so that it meaures increasing values as the spring streches measure the position of the bottom of the mass hanger this position will be the first data point for the spring displacement by incrementally adding 20 g experimentally create a data set which will allow you to examine the relationship between applied force and displacement remember that hookes law involves force not mass so calculate the gravitational force for each mass value plot force and position using logger pro or microsoft excel such that the hookes law formula is in the form of ymx apply a linear fit and use the slope of the graph to determine the effective spring constant k of the helical spring what are the units of k print this graph for your notebook activity 2 newtons 2nd law with a spring in this activity you will determine relationship between position velocity acceleration and applied force the force will be measured with the vernier dual range force sensor attached to the top of the spring and the displacement will be measured using a vernier motion detector placed on the table underneath the spring make sure that both sensors are connected to the lab pro open logger pro and prepare the computer for data collection in logger pro go to file  open in the experiments folder go to probes and sensors  motion detector  motdfscmbl open this file you should see graph windows for position vs time acceleration vs time and force vs time note dont put the motion detector below the spring yet the safety of the equipment is very important make sure that the bottom of the spring is firmly attached to the mass hanger again using masking tape nothing should be in danger of falling onto the motion detectorattach a few 20 g masses to the mass hanger again secure with a small piece of masking tape now you may position the motion detector on the stool beneath the spring and hanging mass for the purposes of the following table zero the motion detector and the force sensor this way the force and position are zero at the equilibrium position prediction before performing the experiment first recreate the following prediction table in your notebook for the given four positions of the oscillating mass predict whether the force as read by the force sensor velocity and acceleration will be most positive max most negative max or zero position velocity acceleration forcemax the mass is at its highest point and changing directions the spring is compressed the maximum amount zero the mass is crossing the equilibrium position moving downwardmax the mass is at its lowest point and changing directions the spring is stretched the maximum amount zero the mass is once again crossing the equilibrium position moving upwardtable 1 predicted relationship between position velocity acceleration and force after you have made your predictions stretch the spring about 3 cm beyond its equilibrium position then release the springmass system should begin to oscillate the lowest portion of the mass should not be closer than 15 cm from motion detector if it is data near the detector will not be taken and your waveform will appear clipped click collect while the spring is oscillating and allow it to oscillate undisturbed for the entire data collection period examine your three graphs recreate the table 1 in your notebook and this time record your results not predictions you can change the acceleration vs time graph to a velocity vs time graph by leftclicking the yaxis note any differences between the observed values and your predicted values in this table what do you notice about the relationship between force and acceleration change the horizontal axis of your force vs time graph so that it plots force vs acceleration youll probably need to click the autoscale button figure 1 the autoscale button what type of relationship does this show how does this confirm newtons second law print this graph for your notebook
