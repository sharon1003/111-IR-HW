science  mathematics biology what does passive and passive transport mean follow 1 answer answers relevance rating newest oldest best answer close but passive transport does not require energy passive transport is the spontaneous movement of molecules or ions due to a concentration gradient but it does not require energy diffusion and osmosis are examples of passive transport solutes are moved from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration but this does not require any energy expenditure on the part of the cell active transport is the type of transport that requires energy in this case particles may be too large to escape the cell membrane and are therefore bound to special carrier proteins that hydrolyze atp and use the energy derived from breaking the phosphate bond to transport molecules in or out of the cell polarity size concentration and charge are all factors that determine if a given molecule or ion will be able to undergo passive transport or if it will need active transport source s biology majorpiano playin kat · 9 years ago0 0 comment passive transport definition biology source shttpsshrinkima9a ythrabar · 1 year ago0 0 commentpassive is the reverse of activeit means it needs help from others and does not do things by its ownit may also need generators passive transport is the passage of ions against the concentration gradient low solute concentration to high solute concentration trough a semi permeable membrane by the need of energyyoon teng · 9 years ago0 1 comment maybe you would like to learn more about one of these considering an online college online education an option need a home security safe need a dui attorney
