roger greenaways song became the iconic id like to buy the world a coke commercial a hit single  now the epic ending to a beloved tv series when roger greenaway cowrote id like to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony 45 years ago for cocacola he had no idea the song would become part of one of the most iconic ad campaigns in history  much less that it would play a role in sunday nights mad men series finale not that the legendary british songwriter 76 was watching not only has greenaway never seen mad men he had no idea the show had licensed the feelgood song and commercial which ends the episode and is seemingly the result of protagonist don drapers breakthrough at a spiritual retreat i only learned of its use in the final episode when i received a congratulatory email this morning from john titta head of membership at ascap so obviously it came as a pleasant shock he exclusively tells billboard mad men finale the real story behind the coke jingle that became a billboard hit greenaway cowrote id like to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony with his frequent collaborator roger cook and mc cann erickson executives bill backer and roquel billy davis for the ad agencys client cocacola as he reveals via an email interview the tune originally called true love and apple pie underwent a few changes on its way to becoming not only the staple of cocacolas ad campaign for years but also a top 10 single in both the u k and the u s greenaway who was inducted into the songwriters hall of fame in 2009 and retired from ascap after years as head of international in december cowrote dozens of hits including the air that i breathe here comes that rainy day feeling again this golden ring youve got your troubles ive got mine my baby loves lovin and long cool woman in a black dress he tells billboard how the song developed and what he hopes happens next how did you first begin working with mc cann erickson roger cook and i had been writing cocacola commercials since 1966 after the fortunes hit youve got your troubles ive got mine bill backer was the first to approach us and we worked with him and another account exec named arnold brown when arnold left mc cann for another agency bill backer headhunted billy davis who had produced coke commercials as an independent we worked with both teams on average about three or four times a year writing and coproducing spots for coke did the theme of universal harmony really come from backer writing i d like to buy the world a coke on a napkin after the flight he was on was diverted and he saw irritated travelers calming down over a coke bill backers flight to london was diverted to shannon ireland roger cook was also out of town performing with his group blue mink roger and i had written the melody which was to become teach the world whilst on holiday in portugal which i played to billy as a suggestion he liked it and that day we finished it calling it true love and apple pie once bill backer had made it to london he heard true love and felt the lyric was not suitable for coke he did like the melody and mentioned an idea he had whilst waiting at shannon airport the song was then rewritten as id like to teach the world to sing i had to leave london early so the new lyric was written by cook backer and davis how long did it take to write the song took about four to six hours to complete the song first aired in cocacolas radio commercial but it wasnt until the television commercial aired that the tune took off right after we finished the recording sessions the commercial went straight to radio  not to tv  and there was no special reaction to it it wasnt until a man called harvey gabor who worked in the tv commercial area at mc cann had the idea of filming a group of young men and women of different nationalities and backgrounds standing on a hill known as the hilltop version with a bottle of coke in their hand and used teach the world as the anthem that the song took off how quickly did the new seekers  version that rose to the top of the charts and that didn t mention cocacola come about after only a week on air the cocacola company was receiving thousands of letters from the public asking how they could get a copy of the music luckily the new seekers were performing in a new york hotel during that time and were able to go into the studio with billy davis and record the song for commercial release because of the tv commercial the record climbed the charts very quickly both in the states and in the u k and we realized we had a monster hit on our hands it was a christmas no 1 in the u k it was a few years before we heard the words iconic applied to both the song and the hilltop commercial none of us expected the song to be so successful i still find it difficult to believe even after all these years when did you find out the songcommercial would be used in the mad men finale are you a fan of the show although the mad men show has been aired in the u k i have never seen a single episode i only learned of its use in the final episode when i received a congratulatory email this morning from john titta head of membership at ascap so obviously it came as a pleasant shock have you heard any plans about the song now being reintroduced in a new commercial or about the tune going to radio again similar to how journey s don t stop believin experienced a new life after its usage in the sopranos finale i have no idea if the cocacola company has any future plans for the commercial but live in hope what s your favorite memory about the song my favorite moment was when i first saw the tv commercial in london and then 10 days later watching the seekers recording going to no 1 after selling over a million copies
