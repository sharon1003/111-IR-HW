van allen radiation belt the term van allen belts refers specifically to the radiation belts surrounding earth however similar radiation belts have been discovered around other planets the sun itself does not support longterm radiation belts as it lacks a stable global dipole field the earths atmosphere limits the belts particles to regions above 200ð1000 km while the belts do not extend past 7 earth radii re the belts are confined to a volume which extends about 65¡ from the celestial equator a radiation belt is a layer of energetic charged particles that is held in place around a magnetized planet such as the earth by the planets magnetic field the earth has two such belts and sometimes others may be temporarily created the discovery of the belts is credited to james van allen and as a result the earths belts bear his name the main belts extend from an altitude of about 1000 to 60000 kilometers above the surface in which region radiation levels vary most of the particles that form the belts are thought to come from solar wind and other particles by cosmic rays the belts are located in the inner region of the earths magnetosphere the belts contain energetic electrons that form the outer belt and a combination of protons and electrons that form the inner belt the radiation belts additionally contain lesser amounts of other nuclei such as alpha particles the belts endanger satellites which must protect their sensitive components with adequate shielding if their orbit spends significant time in the radiation belts in 2013 nasa reported that the van allen probes had discovered a transient third radiation belt which was observed for four weeks until destroyed by a powerful interplanetary shock wave from the sun the van allen radiation belt is a torus of energetic charged particles ie a plasma around earth trapped by earths magnetic field the van allen belts are closely related to the polar aurora where particles strike the upper atmosphere and fluoresce the presence of a radiation belt had been theorized prior to the space age and the belts presence was confirmed by the explorer i on january 31 1958 and explorer iii missions under doctor james van allen the trapped radiation was first mapped out by explorer iv and pioneer iii qualitatively it is very useful to view this belt as consisting of two belts around earth the inner radiation belt and the outer radiation belt the particles are distributed such that the inner belt consists mostly of protons while the outer belt consists mostly of electrons within these belts are particles capable of penetrating about 1 gcm2 of shielding eg 1 millimetre of lead the term van allen belts refers specifically to the radiation belts surrounding earth however similar radiation belts have been discovered around other planets the sun does not support longterm radiation belts the earths atmosphere limits the belts particles to regions above 2001000 km while the belts do not extend past 7 earth radii re the belts are confined to an area which extends about 65¡ from the celestial equator the outer van allen belt enlarged view of this image the large outer radiation belt is almost toroidal in shape extending from an altitude of about three to ten earth radii re or 13000 to 60000 kilometres 8100 to 37300 mi above the earths surface its greatest intensity is usually around 45 re the outer electron radiation belt is mostly produced by the inward radial diffusion and local acceleration due to transfer of energy from whistlermode plasma waves to radiation belt electrons radiation belt electrons are also constantly removed by collisions with atmospheric neutrals losses to magnetopause and the outward radial diffusion the outer belt consists mainly of high energy 01ð10 me v electrons trapped by the earths magnetosphere the gyroradii for energetic protons would be large enough to bring them into contact with the earths atmosphere the electrons here have a high flux and at the outer edge close to the magnetopause where geomagnetic field lines open into the geomagnetic tail fluxes of energetic electrons can drop to the low interplanetary levels within about 100 km 62 mi a decrease by a factor of 1000 the trapped particle population of the outer belt is varied containing electrons and various ions most of the ions are in the form of energetic protons but a certain percentage are alpha particles and o oxygen ions similar to those in the ionosphere but much more energetic this mixture of ions suggests that ring current particles probably come from more than one source the outer belt is larger than the inner belt and its particle population fluctuates widely energetic radiation particle fluxes can increase and decrease dramatically as a consequence of geomagnetic storms which are themselves triggered by magnetic field and plasma disturbances produced by the sun the increases are due to stormrelated injections and acceleration of particles from the tail of the magnetosphere on february 28 2013 a third radiation belt consisting of highenergy ultrarelativistic charged particles was reported to be discovered in a news conference by nasas van allen probe team it was stated that this third belt is generated when a mass coronal ejection is created by the sun it has been represented as a separate creation which splits the outer belt like a knife on its outer side and exists separately as a storage container for a months time before merging once again with the outer belt the unusual stability of this third transient belt has been explained as due to a trapping by the earths magnetic field of ultrarelativistic particles as they are lost from the second traditional outer belt while the outer zone which forms and disappears over a day is highly variable owing to interactions with the atmosphere the ultrarelativistic particles of the third belt are thought to not scatter into the atmosphere as they are too energetic to interact with atmospheric waves at low latitudes this absence of scattering and the trapping allows them to persist for a long time finally only being destroyed by an unusual event such as the shock wave from the sun which eventually destroyed it the inner van allen belt while protons form one radiation belt trapped electrons present two distinct structures the inner and outer belt the inner electron van allen belt extends typically from an altitude of 02 to 2 earth radii l values of 1 to 3 or 600 miles 1000 km to 3700 miles 6000 km above the earth in certain cases when solar activity is stronger or in geographical areas such as the south atlantic anomaly saa the inner boundary may go down to roughly 200 kilometers above the earths surface the inner belt contains high concentrations of electrons in the range of hundreds of ke v and energetic protons with energies exceeding 100 me v trapped by the strong relative to the outer belts magnetic fields in the region it is believed that proton energies exceeding 50 me v in the lower belts at lower altitudes are the result of the beta decay of neutrons created by cosmic ray collisions with nuclei of the upper atmosphere the source of lower energy protons is believed to be proton diffusion due to changes in the magnetic field during geomagnetic storms due to the slight offset of the belts from earths geometric center the inner van allen belt makes its closest approach to the surface at the south atlantic anomaly on march 2014 a pattern resembling zebra stripes was discovered in the radiation belts by nasa in their energetic particle experiment rbspice the reason reported was that due to the tilt in earths magnetic field axis the planetõs rotation generated an oscillating weak electric field that permeates through the entire inner radiation belt the field affects the electrons as if they behave like fluids the global oscillations slowly stretch and fold the fluid resulting in the striped pattern observed across the entire inner belt extending from above earthõs atmosphere about 800 km above the planetõs surface up to roughly 13000 km the van allen belts impact on space travel solar cells integrated circuits and sensors can be damaged by radiation in 1962 the van allen belts were temporarily amplified by a highaltitude nuclear explosion the starfish prime test and several satellites ceased operation magnetic storms occasionally damage electronic components on spacecraft miniaturization and digitization of electronics and logic circuits have made satellites more vulnerable to radiation as incoming ions may be as large as the circuits charge electronics on satellites must be hardened against radiation to operate reliably the hubble space telescope among other satellites often has its sensors turned off when passing through regions of intense radiation an object satellite shielded by 3 mm of aluminum will receive about 2500 rem 25 sv per year proponents of the apollo moon landing hoax have argued that space travel to the moon is impossible because the van allen radiation would kill or incapacitate an astronaut who made the trip van allen himself still alive and living in iowa city has dismissed these ideas in practice apollo astronauts who travelled to the moon spent very little time in the belts and received a harmless dose nevertheless nasa deliberately timed apollo launches and used lunar transfer orbits that only skirted the edge of the belt over the equator to minimise the radiation astronauts who visited the moon probably have a slightly higher risk of cancer during their lifetimes but still remain unlikely to become ill because of it the van allen belts and why they exist it is generally understood that the van allen belts are a result of the collision of earths magnetic field with the solar wind radiation from the solar wind then becomes trapped within the magnetosphere the trapped particles are repelled from regions of stronger magnetic field where field lines converge this causes the particle to bounce back and forth between the earths poles where the magnetic field increases the gap between the inner and outer van allen belts is caused by lowfrequency radio waves that eject any particles that would otherwise accumulate there solar outbursts can pump particles into the gap but they drain again in a matter of days the radio waves were originally thought to be generated by turbulence in the radiation belts but recent work by james green of the nasa goddard space flight center comparing maps of lightning activity collected by the micro lab 1 spacecraft with data on radio waves in the radiationbelt gap from the image spacecraft suggests that theyre actually generated by lightning within earths atmosphere the radio waves they generate strike the ionosphere at the right angle to pass through it only at high latitudes where the lower ends of the gap approach the upper atmosphere the soviets once accused the u s of creating the inner belt as a result of nuclear testing in nevada the u s has likewise accused the ussr of creating the outer belt through nuclear testing it is uncertain how particles from such testing could escape the atmosphere and reach the altitudes of the radiation belts likewise it is unclear why if this is the case the belts have not weakened since atmospheric testing was banned by treaty thomas gold has argued that the outer belt is left over from the aurora while dr alex dessler has argued that the belt is a result of volcanic activity in another view the belts could be considered a flow of electric current that is fed by the solar wind with the protons being positive and the electrons being negative the area between the belts is sometimes subjected to a current flow which drains away the belts are also thought to drive aurora lightning and many other electrical effects removing the belts the belts are a hazard for artificial satellites and moderately dangerous for human beings and difficult and expensive to shield against there is a proposal by the late robert l forward called hi volt which may be a way to drain at least the inner belt to 1 of its natural level within a year the proposal involves deploying highly electrically charged tethers in orbit the idea is that the electrons would be deflected by the large electrostatic fields and intersect the atmosphere and harmlessly dissipate some scientists however theorize that the van allen belts carry some additional protection against solar wind which means that a weakening of the belts could harm electronics and organisms and that they may influence the earths telluric current dissipating the belts could influence the behavior of earths magnetic poles read more  in the news space tsunami causes the third van

above earth phys org  november 26 2014 a team led by the university of colorado boulder has discovered an invisible shield some 7200 miles above earth that blocks socalled killer electrons which whip around the planet at nearlight speed and have been known to threaten astronauts fry satellites and degrade space systems during intense solar storms the barrier to the particle motion was discovered in the van allen radiation belts two doughnutshaped rings above earth that are filled with highenergy electrons and protons the latest mystery revolves around an extremely sharp boundary at the inner edge of the outer belt at roughly 7200 miles in altitude that appears to block the ultrafast electrons from breeching the shield and moving deeper towards earths atmosphere zebra stripes in earths magnetic field have surprising source live science  april 3 2014 strange stripelike features in earths magnetic field are caused by the planets spin and not by the constant bombardment of solar particles as previously thought scientists say the socalled zebra stripes form when the electric field around earth generated by the planets rotation  previously thought to be too weak to impact the fastmoving particles  creates a striped pattern in the inner electron belt earths radiation belt van allen probes reveal zebra stripes in space science daily  march 20 2014 scientists have discovered a new persistent structure in one of two radiation belts surrounding earth nasas twin van allen probes spacecraft have shown that highenergy electrons in the inner radiation belt display a persistent pattern that resembles slanted zebra stripes surprisingly this structure is produced by the slow rotation of earth previously considered incapable of affecting the motion of radiation belt particles which have velocities approaching the speed of light nasa discovers new radiation belt around earth live science  february 28 2013 a ring of radiation previously unknown to science fleetingly
