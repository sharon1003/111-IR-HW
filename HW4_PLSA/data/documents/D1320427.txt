yacolt burn state forest after nearly seven years of planning we are finally going to begin building new 4x4 atv and dirt bike trails as part of the first phase of the dnrs ten year recreation plan for the yacolt burn yes its true  its actually going to happen leadership from the jones creek trail riders association jctra and piston’s wild motorsports as well as other supporting organizations has already engaged in several meetings with the washington department of natural resources dnr to discuss the “nuts and bolts” of implementing the trail building process throughout the month of may our groups will be working on the ground with the dnr finalizing trail layout and roughing in the first sections of new trails much of the roughing in process will be handled using heavy equipment so the need for volunteers will be minimal during the month of may to put it simply jctra will take the lead on building most of the atv and dirt bike singletrack trails and piston’s wild motorsports will take the lead on building the 4x4 trails both groups will be working in cooperation with the dnr and in accordance with the approved plan in most cases there will be separate operations going on in the forest for these projects although it will not be uncommon to share resources to promote building trails at the least cost and the highest rate of efficiency in some cases volunteers may be asked to help out with either type of trail building project as the need arises please remember that it is in all of our best interests to see both groups succeed as the trail projects are linked together if one group falls too far behind the other will not be allowed to proceed this will be a team effort to bring additional motorized recreation to the yacolt burn so how can you help the best

public use by the dnr the trail is located just past where the aloop splits off from the bc loop the trail is open to vehicles less than 52 in width atvs and dirt bikes the new trail is a relatively short section of trail of almost a mile in length about twothirds of the trail was created from an abandoned logging road and onethird is trail constructed from virgin ground this was not our first choice for a new trail location but it does provide another alternative for riders heading up the bc loop many more miles of new atv and singletrack trail are slated for construction over the next few years most of which is in territory separate from the current abc loops the next section being constructed is a singletrack trail bollards and other width restriction methods have already been put in place to help prevent atv and 4x4 access to the new singletrack trail access to legal singletrack trail is highly desired at jones creek and we ask that riders please avoid attempting to circumvent the width restrictions to operate wider vehicles on the new singletrack trails over the three phases of the plan approximately 34 miles of atv width trail will be built in comparison to the planned ten miles of singletrack all of these trails will be almost 100 volunteer built and your help is definitely needed our next work party is scheduled for the weekend of august 23rd we will meet at the jones creek staging area at 830 am saturday august 23rd please being gloves and come dressed for the weather lunch and water will be provided all volunteer hours count toward a free discover pass and all participants earn a 10 rocky mountain atvmc gift card in care of rmatcmc racegas we may also be working thursday andor friday august 2122 if you are interested in helping out either of those two
