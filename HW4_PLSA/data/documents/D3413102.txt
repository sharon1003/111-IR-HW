home  pregnancy qa  work  family life during pregnancy qadoes anyone work in nj and understand the process of fmlashort term disability i have been given different answers regarding the process of how fmla and short term disability work my company said that i have to use my accrued paid time off short term disability and fmla time all at the same time for a total of 12 weeks but my doctor said that i go on disability first for the 4 weeks before and the 68 weeks after depending on how the birth goes then if i need more time i can apply for fmla who is correct or is there a loophole for companies if they choose to use it and the fmla website and disability websites dont address this issue clearly enough so that i can print it out and take it to my employer anyone have any idea how this process is suppose to work thanks for any help you can offer meroseynj22asked 82307answer this question mom answers  12best answers most recent best answerif your company qualifies you are entitled to nj

1120077 found this helpful i was just arguing this very thing with my companys human resources dept the nj fla clearly states that you get up to 12 weeks in a 24 month period to care for a newborn and that this time is separate and additional to any short term disabil ity claims that your doctor will authorize for you before and after the birth i think companies get confused because the federal family leave act does include your own disability but under the nj law you are entitled to 12 separate weeks i think they can make you use all of your sick and vacation time if they want to though i had to argue pretty hard with my human reource dept before they would admit this though go to httpwwwnjcivilrightscomlawhtmlfla for more infovalerie022804answered 109075 found this helpful in nj 4

wisconsin you use your disabilty then if you need more time you can use your pto and sick days then fmla but in my experience wiht work and insurance is they dont want you to use the insurance  so

until my due date can i bank my std benifits for after birth since i am not using it beforea baby center member answered 1225122 found this helpful fmla is a federal law so it is not state specific your employer can require to you use you accrued time off vacationsick days before the short term disability would kick in that is not bad news most disability plans have a waiting period where no benefit is paid during the unpaid waiting period you would be receiving the pay through your employer for your paid days off usually an employer will run the disability and the fmla concurrently at the same time i would ask your employer a few questions 1 what is the waiting period before the disability benefit starts 2 are they running the disability and the fmla concurrently 3 can you complete the forms for fmla and the disability prior to going your leave usually you can since you will need the doctor to complete a portion of this claim form it is better to get it done before you have the baby 4 do you have to continue to pay for your disability benefit while you are out if it is something you paya baby center member answered 829112 found this helpful i have the same situation at my job the state will pay a minimum of 4 weeks before and 68 weeks after delivery technically if you go on disability before hand you still get paid by the state since your work is requiring you to use use accrued time off save it for the end so you can spend more qt with your newborn if i were you i would apply for disibility once your doctor takes you out of work payton16answered 18081 found this
