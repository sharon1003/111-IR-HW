how to test a lens lens testing is fun and informative while it wont turn you into a cartierbresson it will have a visible impact on your photography too if you understand the way your lenses behave youll be able to make the most of them under all circumstances for example you might have one lens that you know to work well across the entire aperture range and another thats otherwise ok but starts to break down wideopen at maximum tele knowing this you could make the intelligent decision to use the first lens wideopen for a shorter shutter speed to minimize camera shake  but stop down the second lens risking camera shake to get rid of the lens softness or bumping up the iso a notch knowing that the added noise will hurt less than the lens softness there are two sets of characteristics that you need to consider when examining a lens build and optical the build characteristics are too often ignored although in my opinion they have much more of an immediate impact on photography than the optical ones  they can either get or lose you the shot while the optical quality only determines how the picture looks once its in the box and personally id rather have the shot with a slightly lower quality than miss it altogether build characteristics build characteristics describe the physical properties of a lens the design decisions used to construct it the features put on it and the way its been put together build determines what the lens can be used for at least as much as optics if its very big and heavy you might not be able to or want to carry it where the pictures are but if its very light and flimsy it might not handle well or be able to take the abuse in the field if it focuses slowly you wont be able to get consistent quick shots of fastmoving subjects if its a pump zoom itll cause you annoyance when shooting off a tripod as the zoom will creep some characteristics to look for size and weight in my opinion the most important build characteristic as it can make the difference of having the lens with you when it counts or not lighter and smaller is usually better for us amateurs anyway although a heavier lens can handle and balance better than a light one  just the same as a camera body fit and finish best lens feels like a mercedes metal barrel no creaks or squeaks focus and zoom mechanism moves smoothly and easily heavy good lens feels like a volkswagen metal or plastic barrel slight slop or roughness in focus ring but overall tight and together feel no obvious artifacts such as cast seams visible bad lens feels like a lada allplastic moving parts jiggle squeak and slop around visible cast seams its likely that itll develop quirks over time like serious zoom creep may not focus very accurately and will certainly not take much abuse ramifications a wellfitted lens will most likely last longer and its much more fun to use a sloppy one is ok for an occasionaluse one but if you use it a lot itll probably break down at some point meaning that youll need a new one  so you mightve as well bought the better built one in the first place even used focusing motor best ring usm hsm or other very fast and silent focus motor with realtime manual focus focus can be tweaked even with af engaged found only on the best and most expensive lenses such as most current ls good fast nonringusm focusing motor usually without rtm this could be afd micro usm or even dc found on midpriced lenses such most consumer lenses with usm small lenses with dc are louder but otherwise no worse than usm onesbad slower and louder focusing motor without rtm this could be a dc motor on a bigger lens such as the 10030056l or an otherwise inadequately powerful motor such as the one on my tokina 17 ramifications for most everyday subjects any af motor is good enough it starts to make a real difference if youre shooting stuff like birds wildlife or sports  you need to lock on fast and track accurately or get a lot of missed shots the longer the lens the more important the af motor on an ultrawide you should probably manualfocus anyway as theres a huge amount of depth of field and the issue becomes getting your whole scene into it rather than just your subject whereas on a long tele depth of field is very narrow and apparent subject motion is fast  a slow af motor will translate to more missed shots to test the focusing motor simply point the lens around and get a feel for how fast it responds it helps to have a reference lens with which you can repeat the experiment if its not really bad youll usually adapt to the lenss speed without even noticing it focusing mechanism best internal focusing this means the lenss physical dimensions wont change when it focuses and means that its more resistant to dust and moisture good nonrotating front element this means the front element moves back and forth but doesnt rotate its good because it means that polarizers wont turn as the camera focuses notsogood rotating front element with dedicated focusing ring this will make using polarizers a headache but wont otherwise much affect handling bad rotating front element no focus ring this means that the lens is unpleasant to focus manually usually found on the cheapest consumer zooms ramifications a normalrange lens where youre likely to want to use a polarizer does suffer a significant usability hit if the front element rotates otherwise i dont consider this a terribly important characteristic zoom mechanism best internal ring zoom you zoom by twisting a ring and the lenss physical dimensions dont change this means better environmental resistance and more consistent balance good ring zoom with moving front elements you zoom by twisting a ring and the front of the lens pistons out or in bad pump zoom you zoom by pushing and pulling the lens directly stretching and compressing it this is less precise and pleasant than either of the above ramifications doesnt make that much difference in usability although an internal ring zoom lens feels nicer the main issue with the pump zoom is that the zoom setting will creep if youre shooting off a tripod and your camera isnt perfectly horizontal lens mount best metal this means that the lens is less likely to break if you swing your camera around from it a bad idea in general unless the lens is heavier than the camera bad plastic ramifications in my opinion the actual importance of this characteristic is more symbolic than real  a lens with a plastic mount is likely to be pretty shoddily built in the first place other details depth of field scale barrel markings is other special characteristics or eccentricities like weather seals on l lenses or the focus clutch system on the tokina atx pros lenses have cute things all over the place and theres no way to list them all but if something strikes you as unusual or interesting it may be worth noting how do lenses behave almost all modern lenses are capable of getting good images under some conditions the difference between a mediocre lens and a superb one is that the superb one will get good quality under all conditions in which it can be used to take pictures in the first place however most lenses tend to behave in a similar way under different conditions this makes testing somewhat easier the sweet spotall lenses have a sweet spot where they work at their best within it there are little or no changes in optical characteristics outside it some of the characteristics start to break down generally the better the lens the less things break down one important purpose of lens testing is to find out how big the sweet spot is where it is and what happens outside it you can think of the sweet spot as a blob suspended in space on one axis we have aperture on another focusing distance on a third focal length the latter doesnt apply to primes of course that is there is a certain area of aperture focal length and focus distance combinations within which the lens is at its best effects of aperture one as far as i know unbreakable rule of optics is that lenses do not perform as well wideopen as stoppeddown bugaboos like halation light falloff and corner softening show up to some degree  very little on the best lenses but some on all of them on the other hand lenses peak at some aperture maintaining their excellent optical characteristics until diffraction kicks in and starts softening the image again  at f16 or so with digital sensors f22 or so with film by varying aperture its possible to find out where the lens peaks its usually about two stops down from wideopen  f28 on an f14 lens f11 on an f56 one better lenses peak earlier a very few can be said to peak wideopen to get an idea of how very good lenses behave at different apertures take a look at the fifty versus fifty shootout focal length zoom rangeusually zooms are best near the middle of their range but this depends on lens design they are almost always at their worst at their maximal focal length enlarging the image also enlarges any problems the lens may have therefore its important to pay special attention to the way the lens behaves near its maximum tele setting ultrawideangle zooms are sometimes an exception there the problem becomes holding the very wide scene together so they tend to break down near the short end focus distance lenses usually perform better closeup or at medium distance than nearinfinity this is one reason why newspaper tests dont give a realistic idea of how a lens performs in reallife situations distance from center of frame another as far as i know unbreakable rule of optics is that things are better near the center of the frame than at the edges a hallmark of a really good lens is that image quality holds up all the way to the edges especially wideangle lenses tend to go soft in the corners and exhibit other problems there as well therefore its critically important to examine both the center and a corner of each frame especially for sharpness resolution and contrast and chromatic aberration what is a good lens the answer to this question depends on your frame of reference and intended use for example if youre looking for a good 50 mm prime the competition is so hard that youd consider some legendary lenses at other focal lengths pretty mediocre but if youre looking for a good normalrange zoom for under 500 youd probably settle for good sharpness acceptable contrast more or less neutral color and flare and halation kept more or less under control if you want to use your lens for portraits youd care more about color and contrast than sharpness and flare if you want it for architecture youd want maximal sharpness and minimal distortion so when doing the tests and making your judgments remember to keep in mind the purpose of the game  and weight your assessments accordingly however lets first look at the various optical characteristics that lenses have sharpness sharpness is a function of two characteristics resolution and contrast aka accutance resolution determines how fine detail a lens can see contrast determines how small a lightness difference a lens can see a lens with high resolution and low contrast may have a flat muddy and lackluster look like a scene seen through a dirty windowpane a lens with high contrast and low resolution will produce scenes with a lot of pop depth and clarity but if you enlarge them a lot the small detail will go fuzzy in general id tend to prefer a lens with high contrast and low resolution over one with high resolution and low contrast a crop with high contrast but lowered resolution in this case its a field curvature issue though this level of softness actually has very little impact on final image quality even at fairly large print sizes people do notice the color and contrast only photographers mash their face to the print close enough to catch it a crop with high resolution but low contrast shot with a consumergrade lens stoppeddown even small prints will appear somehow undefinably lackluster compared to prints from better lenses a crop with both high resolution and contrast this level of quality both has pop for all print sizes and enlarges extremely well assessing sharpness to assess sharpness look at how small detail and fine gradations of light and dark are rendered do things look soft or smeared that means low resolution do they look flat and muddy that indicates low contrast contrast is especially tricky to assess from reallife shots as different scenes contain different amounts of contrast to start with a scene shot on a slightly hazy day with a highcontrast lens will look much the same as a scene shot with a lowcontrast lens on a clear day ideally shoot a reference frame or two of the test scene with a lens whose characteristics you know many professional reviewers use the 5014 for this purpose sharpness is one characteristic that can vary a great deal across the frame a lens that has even contrast and resolution over the entire frame is much more desirable than one thats sharp in the center but soft in the corners as it responds to postprocessing better its actually pretty tricky to assess this quality the reason is that lens problems arent the only possible reason for soft corners especially with ultrawides the depth of the scene and field curvature come into play as well very few lenses have perfectly flat fields instead the focus distance curves somewhat this has a couple of implications for one thing a newspaper test will show field curvature as soft corners with reallife scenes the field may not be where you expect it to be and objects that you think would be within it are not  and again you may see soft corners this is especially true for macro and ultra wideangle photography to make sure the corner softness isnt due to field curvature shoot a lot of frames varying the focus distance somewhat if you get some frames with soft corners but others with good sharpness across the frame its field curvature if you cant get the corners sharp no matter what you do short of stopping down its a lens problem excellent small detail is tack sharp and small gradations are rendered clearly and faithfully image has an almost magical transparent and threedimensional look good there is no obvious softening of the image even in the corners the picture generally looks pretty good although it doesnt wow notsogood corners may look somewhat soft but not enough to be noticeable on 8x10 or smaller prints overall look is flat and muddy sometimes with a color tint usually magenta bad corners are very soft and smeared sharpness even at the center is iffy ramifications a lens with poor sharpness is a poor lens if a picture isnt sharp postprocessing can only help so much given a choice between high resolution and high contrast id tend to prefer contrast its visible even on normalsized prints whereas exceptionally high resolution only makes a difference on exceptionally large ones and resolution is often limited by camera or subject motion anyway remedies poor sharpness can be corrected  up to a point  by considered use of unsharp mask this actually only affects contrast not resolution but it can sharpen up slightly soft images beyond a certain point though usm is helpless it cant put in detail that wasnt there in the first place see my lesson on sharpening for more on this subject bokeh bokeh is japanese for the outoffocus areas on a lens good bokeh means that they have an even soft quality ideally like a sharp picture severely gaussian blurred in photoshop bad or harsh bokeh means that highlights will be ringlike fine detail will be ghosted or doubled giving the bokeh a generally uneven and rough look bokeh is produced by the entire lens design its far too often simplistically attributed to the number of blades on the iris more being better the iris shape only immediately affects the look of outoffocus pointlike highlights they take on the shape of the iris on a fivebladed iris theyll look like rounded pentagons on a 9bladed one theyll be nearly circular good bokeh the girl in the background has an evenly soft velvety appearance this was shot on film with the classic canon fd 5014 ssc mk i bad bokeh the reeds are distractingly ghosted and doubled this is from the minolta d7i bokeh is the otherwise excellent lenss achilles heel assessing bokeh shoot a few pictures at different apertures with significant areas out of focus look for ghosting doubling or ringlike highlights if you like shoot another scene with a dark background and pointlike highlights at a few apertures look at the shape and appearance of the highlights excellent bokeh is soft and even at all distances from the field of focus no ghosting or doubling is apparent highlights are round or nearly round no color shifts in the outoffocus areas good bokeh is soft and even overall although some ghosting or doubling may be seen near the field of focus highlights may look polygonal there may be some radial smearing comatic aberration visible in outoffocus areas near the edges of the picture very little color shifting in outoffocus areas notsogood ghosting or doubling is visible at most distances highlights may look polygonal and have starburstlike rays coming from them contrasty areas in the outoffocus parts of the picture may acquire weird color shifts most often purplish bad ghosting or doubling is bad enough to distract seriously from the look of the picture highlights as above very strange things happen to the color in outoffocus areas ramifications good bokeh is next to impossible to put in afterwards not without a lot of work anyway its a signature characteristic of the lens and highly desirable  it can make the difference between a quiet calm and intimate look and a noisy harsh accidental look there are two schools of thought about the shape of the highlights some consider round highlights highly desirable others consider their characteristic shape part of the lens signature i tend to fall in the latter school color one subtle characteristic of a lens is color a good lens should have neutral color  it should not tint the image in any way lenses may give the image a cool blue or warm yellow cast and cheap ones can impart a nastier magenta cast assessing color color is another difficult characteristic to assess as so much depends on the scene the only reliable way to assess it is to shoot the same scene with a reference lens the 5014 is considered the best for this purpose and compare looking at lots of pictures from the lens will help give an impression of color as well excellent neutral no color shift in any direction good slightly warm or cold a small blue or yellow tint thats easy to fix in postprocessing and may even be desirable if kept under control notsogood strongly warm or cold or slightly magenta this may be tougher to clean up later bad strongly magenta ramifications a lens with good color will make postprocessing easier a lens with really bad color may make it difficult to get good results even with postprocessing color used to be an extremely important lens characteristic for film but the possibilities of digital color correction have greatly reduced its importance i would consider a magenta cast a significant downside but a minor yellow or blue one pretty insignificant this doesnt stop people from hating sigma yellow reputedly common in sigma lenses remedies color can be easily corrected to a fairly large extent by levels or curves manipulation see my levels and curves lessons for techniques chromatic aberration chromatic aberration happens when light of different wavelengths colors doesnt end up focused at the same point its either shifted radially the different colored images are sharp but out of register with each other or in distance color extremes are out of focus the former is called sagittal chromatic aberration and the latter axial chromatic aberration sagittal casagittal ca shows up as a red or green ghost image around highcontrast edges near the edge of the frame its important not to confuse this with sensor blooming a violet glow around a blownout highlight most ultrawides suffer from this type of ca to some degree good normaltotele lenses should show little or none of it this type of ca is usually unaffected by aperture sagittal ca the red shadow along the right edge of the shirt assessing ca shoot a scene with say branches against the sky near the corner of the frame look for red violet or green fringes or ghost images of them excellent no ca to be seen even at 200 magnification good no ca to be seen at 100 and normal distance from computer screen notsogood ca easily visible at 100 under some conditions bad ca visible in nearly all frames even in images downsampled to screen size ramifications ca is highly undesirable but it is very hard to completely avoid again digital postprocessing can help a lot you can desaturate reds and greens in the problem areas this results in a slightly softer image but gets rid of the distracting coloration remedies ca can be effectively cleaned up with the following technique zoom into 100 on a problem area new adjustment layer huesaturationlightness reds or magentas depending on the lens saturation 100 cyans or greens depending on the lens saturation 100 tweak the two ranges above until the ca disappears from the problem area youre examining select mask channel fill black this will completely hide the changes use the eraser in softedged brush mode in the mask channel on the problem areas ive made some attempts to automate this but havent been able to do it entirely satisfactorily this doesnt usually take more than a few minutes though so its not too onerous axial ca halation and purple glows one thing that very commonly happens on lenses when theyre shot wideopen is purple haze technically known as halation production of haloes the main culprit of this is axial ca what this means is that parts of the spectrum usually red or purple are not focused at the right plane these colors form a soft glow around highcontrast edges it has an overall softening effect on the image most consumergrade lenses suffer from this type of ca to a greater or lesser degree as do almost all exceptionally bright lenses canons l lenses are known for having very little of this type of ca they use elements made of fluorite crystals which are very effective at correcting ca on the better nonl lenses wideopen axial ca is minimized and engineered to have a more neutral color than the nasty magenta mix of red and violet that cheaper lenses have most lenses exhibit this to some degree when wideopen on some its bad enough to render the wideopen aperture nearly unusable a very bad case of axial cacaused halation purple haze the canon 5014 produces a particularly nice kind of halation its present wideopen but its fairly neutral in color this type of halation can actually be used creatively for example to smooth out skin imperfections in portraiture or give a dreamy feel to landscapes the 5014 wideopen there is a glow but its color is close to neutral intentional use of halation in a photo i wanted to give a dreamy look to the scene and shot the 5014 wideopen i like this version a lot more than the stoppeddown frames where the branches are tacksharp come to think of it maybe i shouldnt sell it after all the 5018 mk i has no veiling glow at all so id lose this creative optionassessing halation use your wideopen ca test shot and examine the branches if they have a translucent look its probably due to halation look for glows around highlights and highcontrast edges be careful not to confuse it with sensor blooming a bright purple glow around a blownout highlight or with outoffocus softness haloes cast a veil over fine detail giving the picture a softfocus look if theres no color cast this can be effectively used for portrait photography as it nicely smooths out skin imperfections this is why it can actually be considered a positive lens characteristic if kept to a reasonable degree excellent no halation visible at any aperture even around extremely highcontrast edges good some neutralcolored glows visible wideopen disappears one stop closed this can even be desirable for portrait photography notsogood some purple glows visible wideopen disappears one stop closed bad lots of purple haze all over the picture wideopen may not disappear even stoppeddown ramifications a lens with little or no halation is a dependable lens you can shoot it at any aperture and be fairly confident of the look itll give you some halation can actually be nice for portraits as it can give a pleasing softfocus look to them and gives a characteristic lens signature however id consider significant purple haze as a pretty major point against a lens halation is especially important on long lenses as it can render the wideopen aperture useless  and with long lenses you pay a lot of money and haul a lot of weight to get the wideopen aperture in the first place the 5014 that exhibits a moderate amount of halation makes for a pleasing portrait lens wideopen and a supersharp lens from f2 down  the extra weight from the extra stop is pretty negligible but i wouldnt buy an 8020028 that has a lot of veiling glow remedies purple haze can be effectively combatted with a similar technique to dealing with chromatic aberration this will remove the magenta tint from it and turn it into ordinary neutral glow halation itself is more problematic it responds well to aggressive unsharp mask in lowcontrast areas but this will cause serious artifacting sharpening glows in highercontrast areas entirely satisfactory results are difficult to achieve but the following techniques can help a lot to get rid of the purple haze select color range  highlights expand selection 8 px select background layer and new adjustment layer  huesaturationlightness magentas  saturation 100 deselect and select color range  highlights contract selection 2 px select layer mask from adjustment layer and fill black deselect and gaussian blur 3 px to mitigate the problem overall duplicate background layer select color range  highlights expand selection 8 px deselect and select color range  highlights contract selection 2 px select layer mask from adjustment layer and fill black deselect and gaussian blur 3 px invert select master channel apply ultraaggressive unsharp mask eg 200 4 px 0 levels the mask will leave out the highcontrast edges where sharpening haloes would be most apparent select mask channel use the eraser and airbrush to mask in and out problem areas  sharpening artifacts on the one hand soft areas on the other lower layer opacity until the picture stops looking unnatural see if it looks better with luminosity blend mode flare apart from halation a specific type of flare two other types are worth looking at flare spots and veiling flare spots are caused by reflections of a pointlike light source usually the sun inside the lens and appear as circular or polygonal shapes often with a color tint lined up in the picture veiling is more subtle its caused by incident light bouncing around in the lens and reducing overall contrast a picture with heavy veiling looks like it was shot through pantyhose veiling has played hell with the contrast on this picture it looks like it was shot through pantyhose you can also see a few small but pretty bright flare spots in it assessing flare shoot two test frames one with the sun just outside the frame and another with say a bright window and darker room exposing for the room and overexposing the window take a comparison shot of the room with the window outside the frame look for flare spots in the first one and overall contrast compared to the reference shot in the other excellent faint or no flare spots little or no visible loss of contrast in the window test good visible but not very bright flare spots visible loss of contrast but still usable frame notsogood bright flare spots severe loss of contrast picture difficult to rescue bad bright flare spots and lines picture ruined by veiling lowcontrast detail gone impossible to recover in postprocessing ramifications this depends a lot on what you intend to do with the lens a landscape lens with bad veiling flare problems is a bad proposition as the bright sky will wipe out much of the contrast in many cases the same behaviour may make little difference on a portrait lens used for lowcontrast scenes and controlled lighting remedies especially on longer lenses both kinds of flare can be very effectively combatted with lens hoods if no incident light hits the lens you will see no flare spots and much less veiling flare is difficult to clean up in post contrast that is gone can only be restored to a degree by printing through it using levels curves or a largeradius lowamount unsharp mask see my levels curves and sharpening lessons for techniques  but the end result wont have the pop it would originally have had flare spots can actually be used effectively as a part of the composition or pretty effectively toned down using the burn tool light falloff vignettingespecially wideopen most lenses are brighter in the center than the edges this is especially pronounced with wideangles and some long teles this phenomenon is known as light falloff or vignetting a fairly mild case of vignetting if a lens does no worse than this wideopen its pretty good assessing vignetting take a test shot of a scene with even lighting if theres significant vignetting the center will be visibly brighter than the corners excellent no obvious vignetting at any aperture good some vignetting wideopen gone one or two stops down notsogood wideopen vignetting is bad enough to need postprocessing some visible even stoppeddown bad vignetting bad enough to need correction incamera with a circulargraded neutraldensity filter or use of bw negative film you might see this on an ultraultrawide rectilinear slr lens such as a 14 or 15 mm it does happen on the widest rangefinder lenses currently available the 12 mm voigtländer heliar for example ramifications in my opinion vignetting is close to a nonissue its extremely unlikely to be bad enough that it cant be pretty easily corrected in postprocessing with a curves tweak and circulargraded mask remedies vignetting is easy to fix in post unless its really bad over a stop and a half or so new adjustmen layer curves blend mode luminosity pull up the curve so that the corners brighten up approximately to the original levels of the center dont worry about getting it exactly right overshooting is ok select mask channel put a circular graded fill from black to white centered in the frame adjust translucency until vignetting mostly fades out if you get a circular banding effect redo the mask channel fill distortion a lens with no distortion renders straight lines as straight no matter where they are most lenses arent so good though and instead buckle them outwards barrel distortion or inwards pincushion distortion at least closeup macro lenses are specifically designed for minimal distortion and widerange zoom lenses often suffer from it more assessing distortion take a test shot of a scene with lots of straight lines an office block would do well print it compare the lines with a ruler excellent lines are straight or very close to it at all focus distances good lines look straight but the ruler comparison shows some distortion notsogood barrel or pincushion distortion is apparent without a ruler bad barrel or pincushion distortion is bad enough to need correction ramifications distortion can be corrected outofcamera fairly easily since its a lens characteristic it can even be automated in fact lots of people are using rectangular fisheye lenses that have a tremendous amount of barrel distortion for normal wideangle photography correcting for it outofcamera for this reason i dont consider it a major issue anymore  although it certainly used to be before the advent of digital image processing remedies distortion is best corrected with panorama tools see helmut derschs essay for tips and techniques test suite its usually pointless to test for every characteristic of the lens youre interested in pick the characteristics that you consider most significant and test for them simulated or real reallife scenes are far and away the best lens tests even with the inevitable variation of circumstances resolution charts mtf curves or newspapers do not give a realistic idea of the lenss reallife performance they can either be overoptimistic since they dont catch nearinfinity issues overpessimistic since they make field curvature look like spherical aberrationcaused corner softness or just plain incomplete for example with regards to flare heres a proposed test suite for gathering the data you need to make the assessments it only takes a few minutes and can be shot handheld outside the camera store if you have the time and possibility use a tripod for best results if shooting handheld crank up the iso if necessary to ensure sharp pictures  ideally 1  5 x 35 mm equivalent focal length shoot more frames if necessary to increase your chances of getting in a sharp one if shooting at slower shutter speeds take several frames for each varying the focus point otherwise the lens may look soft due to camera shake for the stoppeddown shots or missed focus for the wideopen shots pay attention to the handling characteristics while shooting the test shots  itll give you an idea about how itll feel in real life examine the lenss build characteristics size and weight fit and finish focusing motor focusing mechanism zoom mechanism other characteristics move outside the store test af performance by taking quick shots of passersby ideally compare to a similar lens with known performance pretty fast is nowhere near as informative as almost as fast as a 702004l take the following test shots wideopen stopped down two stops and at f11 bokeh test infocus subject outoffocus chaotic background sharpness test detailed scene as near infinity as possible detail extending to at least one corner of the frame at a nearconstant distance usable also for assessing vignetting ca and halation test branches or fine building detail against the sky in focus near corner of frame flare test 1 sun just outside frame into the light flare test 2 indoor scene with bright window in the frame but exposed for the interior distortion test building with straight lines does not need to be perpendicular the other optical characteristics can be assessed by examining these pictures for them then take the pictures home and examine them as described above ideally write up your experiences  even just for your own future reference but if youll post them on the internet you will get a grateful audience including yours truly in summary the most useful test of a lens is to see how it is at its worst so to do this shoot a few frames at maximum tele wideopen and nearinfinity and then look at the corners if they look mostly ok the lens is likely to be a star performer if not stop down a notch or two if theyre still not ok the lens is likely to be a dog and remember to have fun if youd rather spend your time taking pictures than testing lenses more power to you
