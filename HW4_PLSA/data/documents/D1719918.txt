but overall state income exceeded them rj sangostithe denver post via getty images denver — in the state capitol they are calling it refund madness a year after colorado became the first state to allow recreational marijuana sales millions of tax dollars are rolling in dedicated to funding school construction marijuana education campaigns and armies of marijuana inspectors and regulators but a legal snarl may force the state to hand that money back to marijuana consumers growers and the public — and lawmakers do not want to the problem is a strict antispending provision in the state constitution that touches every corner of public life like school funding state health care local libraries and road repairs technical tripwires in that voterapproved provision known as the taxpayer’s bill of rights may require colorado to refund nearly 60 million in marijuana taxes because the state’s overall revenue estimates ended up being too low when the marijuana tax question was put to voters lawmakers are scrambling to figure out a way to keep that money and they are hoping colorado voters — usually stingy when it comes to taxes and spending — will let them in rare bipartisan agreement on taxes legislators are piecing together a bill that would seek voters’ permission to hold on to the marijuana money“despite our antitax feelings in the state there’s an exception being made when it comes to marijuana” said michael elliott the executive director of the denverbased marijuana industry group a trade organization that has not taken a position on the refund issue “the industry is making a huge economic impact”but antitax feelings run deep in colorado and some antitax groups said they would fight any effort to deprive the public of a refund even if it amounts to only 11 or less a person tax money at the karing kind dispensary in boulder co benjamin rasmussen for the new york times“it should go back to the taxpayers” said gregory golyansky the president of the colorado union of taxpayers “when government tries to keep the money that rightfully belongs to the taxpayers of colorado it is an enormous issue there should be a tax refund”selling taxing and regulating a federally outlawed drug were never going to be easy for states at the forefront of marijuana legalization and as colorado enters its second year of retail marijuana sales it is

pushing to repeal the state law or shut down marijuana sellers instead lawmakers are mostly making incremental tweaks like ensuring that food stamps cannot be used to buy marijuana debating changes to

toward paying for the inspectors enforcement agents and other costs of running the offices that regulate the substance while millions are pouring into the state from locals and tourists buying marijuana oils and tinctures candy and cookies and raw plants the tax revenue is falling short of the 70 million that the state thought it might collect nevertheless the state is now in the awkward position of having to give back that marijuana money because it collected more than it had anticipated in taxes last year across the board — including construction oil and gas and other sections of the state’s booming economy blame lies with the taxpayer’s bill of rights said tim hoover a spokesman for the colorado fiscal institute which tracks budget issues in the state he compared the muchderided law to hal 9000 the sinister computer in the movie “2001 a space odyssey”“it has its own malevolent programming that is really hard to override” he said the complex measure first approved by voters in 1992 essentially requires that when colorado collects more money than it had anticipated it has to give some back to taxpayers refunding nearly 60 million in marijuana money would shortchange school construction and other needs that had been depending on marijuana taxes and force the state to pay for them from its general fund“it’s not that the pot tax came in too high” said

the law was unclear on who exactly should be paid back the marijuana customers the growers and wholesale businesses paying taxes the public who approved this whole setup“i swear the more you work on it the tougher it gets” mr steadman said “it’s really complicated”his bill expected to gather bipartisan support would kick the question of marijuana refunds back to the public asking voters whether the state could keep the money write a comment most marijuana businesses have supported the sales taxes colorado placed on the substance but miguel lopez who organizes denver’s annual 420 rally — intended to be a giant feelgood festival — said he was sick of what he called high taxes on recreational marijuana he said they were hurting small stores and helping to keep the black market alive“we’re still struggling to survive while losing the economic battle” he said “it’s just too high”a version of this article appears in print on april 2 2015 on page a1 of the new york edition with
