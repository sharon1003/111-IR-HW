material his knoll sofa was about 650 to reupholster and another 600 for fabric he recalls  the womb settee was really expensive to reupholster because i wanted it to original specs and you need someone with specialized expertise it was about 1800 total for upholstery and fabric kevin recommends dave erbe 6109674658 for his high quality work and for being a  really nice guy  jen jen recently had a club chair reupholstered by calico corners and it was about 560 for the labor elizabeth was considering getting a bergere chair redone but has put it off because of the price she was quoted she was told the labor would be 395 plus about 6 yards of fabric the chairs single cushion would have a dacron wrap 25 and if she chose downfeather it would be about 95 delivery was 95 the real cost for elizabeth was the madeleine weinrib fabric she lusted after which was a whopping 250 per yard meaning the fabric total would come to about 1500sarah sarah got a basic contemporary 3seater sofa reupholstered with similarly basic solidcolored fabric for 860 fabric included she says it was worth it because the sofa is very well made and super comfortable but the original fabric was irreversibly stained mary anne about ten years ago mary anne inherited two very heavy club chairs and a sofa from her parents she found a really good upholsterer named ana who was incredibly economical the upholsterer stripped the pieces to their frames reinforced the frames and redid the pillows in spring down a combo of manmade and down she regrets not doing full down  ana works out of her home she and her son picked up the 3 pieces in skokie and delivered to downers grove a suburb of chicago fabric excluded she did the whole job for 800 no lie it was a gift beyond belief she is a magnificent upholsterer with emphasis on finishing detail she was extremely careful of matching seams and patterns for example she explained that the 3 sofa cushions can be turned for wear like a mattress and alternated so that the fronts and backs match the back pattern of the couch at all times even the arm covers match the pattern of the underlying arm of the couch a few years later ana covered 8 dining chairs including 2 armchairs with fabric backs and leather seats all together the labor was around 1000 mary annes advice is to ask around in unlikely places i found ana through my hair stylist ana has done work for major hotels like the hilton and marriott so maybe ask at those types of businesses mary anne also says that fabric stores can be a good resource for upholsterer  be careful though make sure you see some of their finished work if theyre good theyre proud of it good upholsterers can give you great tips on fabric too the pros weigh in because interior decorators are constantly referring out and contracting with upholsterers they can offer a good general overview of the costs associated with upholstery annie elliott of bossy color annie elliott of bossy color an interior design firm in washington dc has some great detailed advice for those considering reupholstering a piece of furniture sofa allow 1720 yards of fabric if youre using a solid or texture but if youre using a largescale pattern youll need more labor cost can range between 800  1000 depending on whether you have loose seat and back cushions or not  of course there are less expensive upholsterers but you do not want to skimp on this especially if a pattern is involved dining chair seat only you might only need a yard of fabric but it will still cost 75100 per chair to upholster comfy living room armchair  you might  shockingly  need 10 yards of fabric if you have loose seat and back cushions if there arent separate cushions or a skirt you might be able to do 7 yards  labor would be around 500 bench or ottoman you may only need a few yards of fabric depending on the repeat labor shouldnt be too high maybe 150  200 depending on whether theres welting cording etc annie says there are some factors that will affect the labor costs• tufting is laborintensive also will the buttons be covered w the same fabric as the piece thats more work for the upholsterer • welting that cordlike edging is also more work • zippers on the cushions • making sure patterns line up geometric or striped patterns are harder to work with other factors to consider include whether any structural repairs need to be done to the frame or springs and whether you want arm covers or delivery should you try to diy the only upholstery annie thinks a novice should attempt is a dining room chair if the seat pops right up out of the frame  theres practically a sticker on the bottom of those seats that says go ahead staple gun me annie wrote a great blog post that provides some very wise advice and some case studies of actual upholstery costs meaghan mc namara meaghan has an interior design and furniture rehab business in washington dc 3015091098  according to her  the size shape and fabric all weigh in on your final price but typically for an arm chair you are looking at 250 to 350 and for a couch it can be even more of a range in price anywhere from 600 upward meaghan also adds that tufting piping and trim require more labor and are therefore higher in price some fabrics like a vinyl can also be more timeconsuming then a cotton because it is harder to ensure smooth surfaces and edges with a thicker texture what have you paid for upholstery work was it worth it why did you decide to redo the piece instead of replacing with a new piece altogether image jill slater rita

bed i finally made the decision to go ahead and buy the chelsea upholstered bed extremely pleased with my decision below is a link to the product page goodluck with your upholstered bed shopping flag reply jenny82 4 years ago fyi as someone whose family has a 4th generation run upholstery shop  i highly recommend doing your research get quotes but dont always go with the cheapest every upholsterer knows the shortcuts and if theyre offering a lower price than the majority of the other quotes you receive you better believe they are reusing old materials skimping on repairs and not being upfront with you on what your piece needs not to mention as is common down here in the south they dont follow proper business laws no insurance or licensing paying workers under the table to evade taxes not reporting income etc upholstering is truly an art form and requires expertise except maybe those pop out dining chair seats and most upholsterers take great pride in their work as most artists do  there is a lot involved with a piece of furniture that you dont see on the outside but it makes a difference in how long your piece will last i cant tell you how many pieces i helped strip and we see what the former upholsterer had done and just shake our headsif people only knew what they were actually getting the same is true of the cheap new furniture available nowadaysyou might be able to purchase a new piece for the same amount or less but youre also paying for a poorer quality product that was made overseas on an assembly line in 30 minutes if you want to replace it in 15 years seems about how long clients have owned a piece before they seek us out to make repairs then go aheador be smart and invest in a quality piece of furniture and a good upholsterer who knows what hes doing
