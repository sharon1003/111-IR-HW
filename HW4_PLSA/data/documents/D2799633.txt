cattery there are various ways to advertise kittens but today the internet is one of the most critical creating a web site is very time consuming but important to get your name out there advertising and promotion  500  1000 the first year this includes the cost of a web site about 200 each year after communication communication includes phone calls contracts photos business cards following up on each kitten sold is the most important thing a breeder can do this tells her how her program is progressing if there are any health issues popping up etc maintaining your adult cats toys climbers food litter vet bills and furniture all add up it always costs more than 600 per year per adult ragdoll cat but can quickly add up to over 2000 we never breed a female more than twice per year and only until she is 7 years of age after that she is spayed and placed as a pet in a loving home there will always be adult cats looking for good homes due to replacing your breeding stock cats that just do not work out health problems difficult birthing moms behavioral problems the older a cat gets the more the vet bills are as they have special needs as they age there are dental cleanings yearly on some adult cats no matter what the intentions are there are always more cats than are desired in any ragdoll cattery since they are special cats that you just cannot place since you are too attached adults that require special attention it is very emotionally draining parting with cats that have been part of your life for years you then replace these ragdoll cats with other breeding animals which may or may not produce these are the risks you take the costs per litter equipment purchased for ragdoll kittens is not the only cost of having litters breeding ragdoll females must be vaccinated each year  45 done by your vet extra food for pregnant mothers 2  6 oz cans per day for 4 last weeks of pregnancy and for at least 8 weeks after delivery each can is 1 which adds up to 280 per queen kittens dehydrate quickly so keeping kmr handy is a necessity as well as the feeding tubes and syringes  30 per litter kittens start eating canned food at about 4  6 weeks of age and will continue eating it until they are around 8 weeks old at this age one kitten eats about 6 oz of canned food per day and maybe 18 cup of dry food they also play in their food spill it sleep in food dishes etc so there is some waste kittens remain with the breeder until they are between 910 weeks old this all adds up to about 30 per kitten 150 for a litter of 5 kittens one 4 pound bag of dry food per litter  30 total for one litter of kittens is 165 at minimum ragdoll kittens need vaccinations we do an injectible one at both 8 and 12 weeks for 5 kittens that is 40 per shot for a total of 400 per litter of 5 kittens kittens do have accidents which adds to your vet costs and it almost always happens in each litter be it a poke in the eye falling off a table umbilical infection failing to thrive etc swallowing foreign objects doors shut on toes and birth defects are only a few of the things that can go wrong in a litter of kittens kittens are like children and get into lots of trouble these vet costs can go from 50 for a routine exam to over 500 for emergency treatment queens can have problems with birthing as well including having to have a csection having no milk to feed her kittens uterine infections diarrhea and other complications emergency after hours csections can run you up to 1000 often kittens die from the effects of anesthesia as well as from complication with the mothers milk queens often have xrays or ultrasounds done before giving birth at a cost of 50  150 the litter as well as the kitten you keep have to be registered  24 you must replace some of your equipment birthing supplies etc with each litter  50 if you buy more breeding ragdoll cats the higher your costs are you have more litters therefore again more chance of problems some of these other breeding cats may die prematurely not be breedable or develop infections and can no longer be bred when you have multiple ragdoll females you are bound to get animals that do not get along so again you have to provide separate quarters for certain females more vet bills due to fighting cats etc never mind the crying with the girls all in heat together the peeing on furniture when they are in heat therefore you may have to have separate girls areas for the ones in heat that spray then add more heating pads birthing supplies and it does not take long for those expenses to add up again since ragdoll cats were solitary animals years ago and now you have several living in the same quarters you cannot prevent them from passing infections to each other more money so why do ragdoll breeders even bother with multiple cats and litters it is due to the fact that they want to keep the breed going and improve the overall quality and appearance of the ragdoll cats so much for the profit of ragdoll breeding when you buy a ragdoll kitten from a reputable ragdoll breeder you are helping the breeder with some of the expenses so the breeder can keep the ragdoll breed alive thats all there is to it thank you for taking the time to read this article it may help you understand that breeders do not make money breeding ragdoll cats they do it for the love of the animals
