causes of toe twitching and solutions so your toe is twitching maybe it’s the big one only or maybe it’s a few of the smaller ones but nevertheless the twitching is hard to ignore especially when you can actually see the toes jump under your socks when a toe twitches it’s because of an electrical misfire in the motor neuron unit in the muscle but this isn’t the cause per se it’s only the mechanism toe twitching is perfectly normal but can have a variety of causes sometimes toe twitching can be caused by scrunching up the digits which you may not be aware you’re doing this actually causes twitching in the tiny muscles in some cases because these muscles are so small and the toe itself is such a small fixture of the body it shouldn’t be any surprise that when it twitches you can see it “jump” if two toes twitch in unison this is nothing at all to be worried about for example the third and fourth ones may twitch together in synch but this is perhaps due to the fact that in anything these particular toes usually act in unison try lifting the fourth one without the third one coming up for instance twitching in these tiny muscles is completely normal and there is very little reason to fear you might have a disorder like als or ms“the key point with benign fasciculations is that for whatever reason they occur but do not represent an ominous underlying condition” affirms kristina lafaye m d a board certified neurologist“yes some people with benign fasciculations could experience them 247 or so they say i’m a little skeptical of that but if nothing else is wrong then i wouldn’t probe further” adds dr lafaye assistant clinical professor of neurology at tulane university school of medicine full time clinical staff and director of the neurophysiology lab at ochsner medical center“i don’t do any kind of a frequency count because if a person doesn’t have evidence of denervation which if present would indicate a mnd myelopathy or some other condition then it doesn’t warrant any further neurologic evaluation”causes of toe twitching are tensing up the toes anxiety habitimproper footwear especially a tight toe box exercise pressure on a nerve shoes foot position

medication only in very rare cases is muscle twitching caused by a disease perhaps while you were on the verge of falling asleep your toe twitched this isn’t the same kind of twitching that happens when you are wide awake this type of “twitch” is actually called a myoclonus an involuntary jerking of a muscle mayocliniccom states “ these forms of myoclonus occur in healthy people and rarely present a problem”mayocliniccom also states that more severe myoclonus can be triggered by medication or head injury however there is also a paranormal explanation for the causes of this kind of twitching regardless of which muscles it occurs in myoclonus occurs in different muscles the paranormal explanation is that your astral double has left your body out of body experience and when it’s time to return it reenters rather abruptly and you feel this as the myoclonussource mayocliniccomhealthmyoclonusds00754youll also like twitching calf muscle should you worry muscle twitching in the
