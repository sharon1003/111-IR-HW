running continued why run how do you get a runner out should i run will i be safe or out preliminary 1 the batter usually starts the action the batter has to stay at home plate until he hits a fair ball or is awarded a base or acquires three strikes in the latter case he has made an out in the other two cases he must proceed toward first base preliminary 2 at risk or not at risk sometimes a batter or runner is awarded the right to advance to a base without the danger of making an out he is said to be not at risk until this brief action stops you can usually spot these situations because the player walks or trots to a basethere is no need to run the batterrunner is not at risk when he gets a walk is hit by a pitch or hits a fair ball that leaves the park on the fly or on the bounce most of the time however a runner or batterrunner is at risk of making an out in this case he is in danger until he touches and stays on a base that he has a right to occupy the baseball hasnt arrived to the defensive player the runner is safe preliminary 3 forced to move or not forced given that two offensive players cant occupy the same base at the same time when the batterrunner  at risk or not at risk  is forced to advance to first base or beyond he forces one or more runners in front of him to abandon their respective bases the only runners forced to move are those who are occupying a base that someone behind them has to occupy there may be one or two runners who are not forced to do anything when a batterrunner is forced to go to a base simply because no other runner is being forced to occupy those runners bases for example consider that runner f is on first base and runner t is on third base if batter h hits a fairball on the ground h has to try to gain first base and f has to abandon it but t does not have to leave third base because no other runner needs it most anytime he wishes t is free to leave his base mdash he may think its a good time to try to score a run in this situation—but he is at risk of making an out conclusion runners sometimes stroll and sometimes sprint when the batterrunner is not at risk of making an out any runners that he forces to move are also not at risk for example when the batter receives a walk or is hit by a pitch any runner who has been occupying first base is pushed to second if there were also a runner there he would have to move to third base if someone were already on third he would have to take a pleasant stroll to home plate and score a run everyone takes his time because no one is at risk of making an out during this action similarly if the batter hit a home run over the wall all runners are calmly pushed to home plate each scoring a run in the process when the batterrunner is at risk any runners he forces to move are also at risk of making an out so they should run to the next base as fast as possible how to put or get or make a runner out a defensive player can block any base as long as he has the baseball or is trying to catch it here a catcher is blocking home plate trying to tag a runner before he touches it and scores a run the general conditions under which the defense can get a runner or batterrunner out are he is at risk ie he is not in the act of reaching a base that he has been freely awarded—because the batter got a walk was hit by a pitch etc he is not touching a base to which he has a right tagout in the above circumstances the defense can always get a runner or batterrunner out by tagging him with the ball that is a defensive player can touch him with the hand or glove that is holding the baseball the players in question dont have to be anywhere in particular on the playing field forceout this only works on a runner or batterrunner who is forced to run to a base again he has to be at risk and not touching a rightful base if he is forced to run to a certain base a defensive player in possession of the baseball can simply make contact with that base with any part of his body usually his foot this is easier and faster than the other way of getting someone out ie tagging him with the baseball—which also works in this situation an atrisk batterrunner is forced by the rules to try to reach first base the forceout at first is perhaps the most common play in baseball if a runner leaves his base before a flyball is caught the defense can either force him out at the base he left or tag him out anywhere else on the field
