genre literary criticism publisher rowland hunter with charles and james ollier publication date 9 july 1817media type print preceded by the round table followed by a view of the english stage characters of shakespears plays is an 1817 book of criticism of shakespeares plays written by early nineteenth century english essayist and literary critic william hazlitt composed in reaction to the neoclassical approach to shakespeare s plays typified by samuel johnson it was among the first englishlanguage studies of shakespeares plays to follow the manner of german critic august wilhelm schlegel and with the work of samuel taylor coleridge paved the way for the increased appreciation of shakespeares genius that was characteristic of later nineteenthcentury criticism it was also the first book to cover all of shakespeares plays intended as a guide for the general reader then becoming known as a theatre critic hazlitt had been focusing increasingly on drama as literature contributing miscellaneous literary criticism to various journals including the prestigious edinburgh review this was the first of his booklength literary studies the plays the thirtyfive that hazlitt considered to be genuine are covered in thirtytwo chapters with new material added to passages reworked from periodical articles and reviews a preface establishes his main theme of the uniqueness of shakespeares characters and looks back at earlier shakespearean criticism two concluding chapters on doubtful plays of shakespear and the poems and sonnets round out the book the centre of attention is in large part on the characters described often with a personal slant and using memorable expressions it is we who are hamlet and incorporating psychological insights that were to become highly influential in later criticism though at first less influential hazlitts comments on the plays dramatic structure and poetry and on the central themes and general mood of each play laid the groundwork for later critics more elaborate interpretations frequently expressing the view that stage presentation could not do justice to shakespeares plays hazlitt nevertheless also found certain plays eminently actable and he frequently admired the performances of certain actors particularly edmund kean at first highly acclaimed—it made an immediate and powerful impact on the poet john keats among others—then brutally criticised hazlitts book lost much of its influence in the authors lifetime only to reenter the mainstream of shakespearean criticism in the late nineteenth century the first edition sold out quickly sales of the second in mid1818 were at first brisk but they ceased entirely in the wake of harshly antagonistic personally directed politically motivated reviews in the tory literary magazines of the day although some interest continued to be shown in hazlitts work as an essayist it was not until the end of the nineteenth century long after hazlitts death that significant interest was again shown in his interpretations of shakespeare in the twentieth century the influential critic a c bradley and a few others began to take seriously the books interpretations of many of shakespeares characters but then hazlitt along with bradley was censured for displaying faults of the character school of shakespearean criticism primarily that of discussing dramatic characters as though they were real people and again hazlitts contributions to shakespearean criticism were deprecated a revival of interest in hazlitt as a thinker began in the mid20th century his thoughts on shakespeares plays as a whole particularly the tragedies his discussions of certain characters such as shylock falstaff imogen caliban and iago and his ideas about the nature of drama and poetry in general such as expressed in the essay on coriolanus gained renewed appreciation and influenced other shakespearean criticism hazlitts ideas about many of the plays have now come to be valued as thoughtprovoking alternatives to those of his contemporary coleridge and characters of shakespears plays is now viewed as a major study of shakespeares plays placing hazlitt with schlegel and coleridge as one of the three most notable shakespearean critics of the romantic period contents  hide 1 background2 essays21 preface22 cymbeline23 coriolanus24 falstaff  henry iv and the merry wives

shakespeares merchant of venice at londons drury lane theatre william hazlitt drama critic for the morning chronicle since the previous september was in the audience he wrote a stunning review 1 followed by several others applauding but sometimes censuring 2 keans performances in other shakespearean tragedies including king richard ii king richard iii hamlet macbeth romeo and juliet and what hazlitt considered the best of keans performances othello 3 these were written for the morning chronicle the champion and the examiner he was to continue as principal drama critic for the last of these for three years 4 kean was hitherto unknown in london hazlitt having recently begun a career as a theatrical reviewer was no better known than the subject of his reviews these notices quickly brought both kean and hazlitt before the public eye 5in the course of his preparing for a drama review hazlitt was in the habit of reading or rereading the play he was soon to see 6 and his reviews came to include extensive commentary on the plays themselves turning rapidly from dramatic criticism to literary criticism 7 with shakespeare in particular this led to considerations of the ways in which the actors—again particularly his favourite kean—communicated the message of the plays but he also noted ways in which no actors interpretation could live up to the dramatists conception 8as his musings developed along these lines hazlitt continued to contribute miscellaneous articles to various periodicals 9 in february 1816 he reviewed august wilhelm schlegel s lectures on dramatic literature for the edinburgh review the german critic schlegel showed an appreciation for shakespeare of a kind that no one in hazlitts country had yet demonstrated and hazlitt sympathising with many of schlegels ideas felt there was a place for a whole book that would provide appreciative criticism of all of shakespeares plays such a book would provide liberal quotations from the text and focus on the characters and various qualities particular to each play and he felt that he could write it 10 his writing career was now moving in this direction he had been contributing miscellaneous literary criticism to the examiner and elsewhere during this period he needed the money to support his family 11 and his growing reputation as a drama critic enabled him to have his name appear on the title page as a reviewer for periodicals his contributions were anonymous as was customary at the time 8thus characters of shakespears plays was born considerable material that he had already worked up in his drama reviews was incorporated into the book one essay on a midsummer nights dream was taken entire from a contribution to the round table series in the examiner first published on 26 november 1815 with a concluding paragraph tacked on from a drama review also published in the examiner on 21 january 1816 there was material from other essays most of shakespears exact discrimination of nearly similar characters the examiner 12 may 1816 made its way into the chapters on king henry iv king henry vi and othello 12 portions of shakespears female characters the examiner 28 july 1816 found a place in the chapters on cymbeline and othello 13 hazlitt filled out the rest of what he needed to make a complete book in 1816 and possibly early 1817 14at this time unhappy with the way his collection the round table issued in the same year was being promoted by its publisher he began to promote his new book himself partly by word of mouth and also by getting a friend to publish the chapter on hamlet in the times and requesting francis jeffrey editor of the edinburgh review to notice it in that periodical 15 he had already had it printed privately instead of offering it directly to a publisher by his friend the printer carew henry reynell who purchased the copyright for £100 as a publicity tactic copies were circulated privately finally hazlitt got the book published by rowland hunter and the brothers charles and james ollier in collaboration who brought it out on 9 july 1817 15 it was extremely successful this first edition selling out in six weeks a second edition was issued by taylor and hessey in 1818 16 and later that year an unlicensed edition was brought out in boston by wells and lilly 17 no further editions appeared in hazlitts lifetime 18essays  editcharacters of shakespears plays consists primarily of hazlitts impressions of and thoughts about all of william shakespeares plays he believed to be genuine 19 it was the first book of the kind that anyone had yet written 20 his main focus is on the characters that appear in the plays but he also comments on the plays dramatic structure and poetry 21 referring frequently to commentary by earlier critics as well as the manner in which the characters were acted on stage the essays on the plays themselves there is a preface as well as an essay on doubtful plays of shakespear and one on the poems and sonnets number thirtytwo but with two of the essays encompassing five of the plays the plays discussed amount to thirtyfive in number though each essay constitutes a chapter in a book in style and length they resemble those of hazlitts miscellaneous collection the round table published also in 1817 a collaboration with leigh hunt  22 which followed the model for periodical essays established a century earlier in the spectator 11though hazlitt could find much to appreciate in the comedies tragedy was to him inherently more important and he weights the tragedies much more heavily 23 in this he differed from johnson who thought shakespeare best at comedy the greatest of the plays were tragedies—particularly macbeth othello king lear and hamlet —and hazlitts comments on tragedy are often integrated with his ideas about the significance of poetry and imaginative literature in general 24 as he expressed it at the end of lear tragedy describes the strongest passions and the greatest strength of genius is shewn here in describing the strongest passions for the power of the imagination in works of invention must be in proportion to the force of the natural impressions which are the subject of them 25preface  editin the preface hazlitt establishes his focus on characters by quoting pope s comment that every single character in shakespear is as much an individual as those in life itself 26 after reviewing various other critics of shakespeare hazlitt focuses on two of the most important including the influential dr johnson hazlitt found the shakespearean criticism of johnson the premier literary critic of the previous era troubling in several ways he insufficiently valued the tragedies he missed the essence of much of the poetry and he reduced everything to the common standard of conventional propriety  the most exquisite refinement or sublimity produced an effect on his mind only as they could be translated into the language of measured prose 27 johnson also believed that every character in shakespeare represents a type or species 28 whereas hazlitt siding with pope emphasised the individuality of shakespeares characters while discussing them more comprehensively than anyone had yet done rather than an english critic it was the german august wilhelm schlegel whose lectures on the drama had recently been translated into english whom hazlitt believed to be the greatest critic of shakespeares plays hazlitt here includes long extracts from schlegel on shakespeare differing with him principally with respect to what he called a mysticism that appears in schlegels interpretations he shared with schlegel an enthusiasm for shakespeare that he found lacking in dr johnson an overstrained enthusiasm he remarks is more pardonable with respect to shakespear than the want of it for our admiration cannot easily surpass his genius 29cymbeline  editsee also cymbeline as one of his favourites 30 hazlitt places cymbeline first in his discussions of shakespeares plays according it extensive treatment this includes his personal impressions of individual characters—as the books title would lead us to expect—but also the kind of broader consideration for which he would not be credited for at least a century and a half 31herbert gustave schmalz imogen 1888the plays greatest charm is the character of imogen  writes hazlitt 32 he observes how in justifying her actions she relies little on her personal charms 33 or a prudish affected antipathy to vice 34 but rather on her merit and her merit is in the depth of her love her truth and constancy 33 shakespeares presentation is full and rounded we see her beauty as observed by others as by the villain iachimo 35 but more often we see her from the inside and are touched when after endless nights of crying herself awake over the loss of posthumus she is outraged to learn as she is falsely informed that  some jay of italy  hath betrayed him   36 and we witness a moment in the development of her character as her resolve to disguise herself to seek out posthumus grows firmer 37 of all shakespears women she is perhaps the most tender and most artless 38hazlitt broadens the scope of these reflections into a consideration of shakespears heroines in general writing no one ever hit the true perfection of the female character the sense of weakness leaning on the strength of its affections for support so well as shakespear 32 here hazlitt incorporates material from his essay shakespears female characters published in the examiner on 28 july 1816 39hazlitt comments to a lesser degree on other characters such as bellarius guiderius and arviragus more often he shows how the characters relate to each other and to the structure of the play these three for example are a fine relief to the intrigues and artificial refinements of the court from which they are banished 40the character of cloten the conceited booby lord is discussed as an occasion for noting how shakespeare depicted what is most contradictory in human nature cloten with all the absurdity of his person and manners is not without shrewdness in his observations 41 and again hazlitt steps back and points out how shakespeare set one character off against the other and presented characters of similar types but with slight modifications of their otherwise similar traits to convey a certain impression about human nature hazlitt observes as it happens in most of the authors works there is not only the utmost keeping in each separate character but in the casting of the different parts and their relation to one another there is an affinity and harmony like what we may observe in the gradations of colour in a picture the striking and powerful contrasts in which shakespear abounds could not escape observation but the use he makes of the principle of analogy to reconcile the greatest diversities of character and to maintain a continuity of feeling throughout has not been sufficiently attended to 42as he does with character hazlitt observes patterns he discovers in the plot he will have nothing of criticising it in terms of the classical  unities  43 the plot must be taken on its own terms if the action is longdrawnout the interest becomes more aerial and refined from the principle of perspective introduced into the subject by the imaginary changes of scene as well as by the length of time it occupies 44regarding shakespeares weaving together of the storys threads hazlitt marvels at the ease and conscious unconcern with which  the most straggling and seemingly casual incidents are contrived and in such a manner as to lead at last to the most complete developement of the catastrophe 45 again he broadens the discussion and argues against the view of dr johnson that shakespear was generally inattentive to the windingup of his plots we think the contrary is true and we might cite in proof of this remark not only the present play but the conclusion of lear of romeo and juliet of macbeth of othello even of hamlet and of other plays of less moment in which the last act is crowded with decisive events brought about by natural means 45beyond plot beyond individual characters hazlitt rounds out his discussion by noting the prevailing mood the tender gloom that overspreads the whole play 32 he sees the parallel yet subtly contrasting lines of the story playing against each other unconsciously in the mind of the reader as of the author working by the force of natural association a particular train of thought suggesting different inflections of the same predominant feeling melting into and strengthening one another like chords in music 46 thus far more than simply commenting on particular characters hazlitt elucidates the character of the play as a whole 47coriolanus  editsee also coriolanus18thcentury engraving of coriolanus act v scene iiihazlitts focus in the essay on coriolanus is less on the various characters of shakespeares tragedy than on the fundamental moral and political principles behind their actions for hazlitt this play showed in action the concepts behind political writings of his own day such as edmund burke s reflections on the revolution in france and thomas paine s rights of man 48 the character of coriolanus is a type of the aristocratic hero though presented as a wellrounded individual with a pride consisting of inflexible sternness of will a love of reputation and glory and a contempt of popular opinion 48 hazlitt also comments on the characters of coriolanuss mother and wife and he points out the substantial fidelity of this play to its source in thomas norths translation of plutarch s lives of the noble greeks and romans extracting long passages from the life of coriolanus 49his primary focus however is on shakespeares dramatisation of the arguments for and against aristocracy or democracy on the privileges of the few and the claims of many 48 shakespeare shows the weaknesses of both the nobles and the people but thought hazlitt he was biased somewhat in favour of the nobility leading him to gloss over their defects more so than those of the common people 50but hazlitt goes further to develop an idea that only much later was seen to have radical implications for literary theory he claims that it is of the very nature of poetry to glorify the aristocrat the solitary hero and the monarch while being much less suited to represent in ways that capture the imagination the social problems of the common people 51 poetic imagination naturally falls in with the language of power the imagination is an exaggerating and exclusive faculty it takes from one thing to add to another it accumulates circumstances together to give the greatest possible effect to a favourite object 52 on the other hand the language that would be used to argue the cause of the people relies more on the understanding which is a dividing and measuring faculty it judges of things not according to their immediate impression on the mind but according to their relations to one another  poetry on the other hand is rightroyal it puts the individual for the species the one above the infinite many might before right 53so we feel some concern for the poor citizens of rome when they meet together to compare their wants and grievances till coriolanus comes in and with blows and big words drives this set of poor rats this rascal scum to their homes and beggary before him there is nothing heroical in a multitude of miserable rogues not wishing to be starved  but when a single man comes forward to brave their cries and to make them submit to the last indignities from mere pride and selfwill our admiration of his prowess is immediately converted into contempt for their pusillanimity 54 the key for hazlitt is the innate human love of power this love of power is not necessarily expressed by a will to dominate others physically but there is at least the tendency to side with power in the imagination to be swayed and carried away emotionally by the power of poetic language hazlitts own worship of napoleon it was later observed could be taken as an example of this tendency 55hazlitt for the most part agreed with his contemporary romantics that poetry can make us better human beings the following year in his lectures on the english poets referring to tragic poetry especially he would observe how in proportion as it sharpens the edge of calamity and disappointment it strengthens the desire of good 56 yet he remained alert to ways in which poetry can also express and reinforce our less admirable tendencies following an observation of burke he notes that people flock to see a tragedy but if there were a public execution in the next street the theatre would very soon be empty  we are  fond of indulging our violent passions  we cannot help it the sense of power is as strong a principle in the mind as the love of pleasure 57alarmingly this tendency as shown in coriolanus could seem to so glorify tyranny and oppression as to lead people to accept it in practice the whole dramatic moral of coriolanus is that those who have little shall have less and that those who have much shall take all that others have left the people are poor therefore they ought to be starved they are slaves therefore they ought to be beaten they work hard therefore they ought to be treated like beasts of burden they are ignorant therefore they ought not to be allowed to feel that they want food or clothing or rest that they are enslaved oppressed and miserable this is the logic of the imagination and the passions which seek to aggrandise what excites admiration and to heap contempt on misery to raise power into tyranny and to make tyranny absolute to thrust down that which is low still lower and to make wretches desperate to exalt magistrates into kings kings into gods to degrade subjects to the rank of slaves and slaves to the condition of brutes the history of mankind is a romance a mask a tragedy constructed upon the principles of poetical justice it is a noble or royal hunt in which what is sport to the few is death to the many and in which the spectators halloo and encourage the strong to set upon the weak and cry havoc in the chase though they do not share in the spoil we may depend upon it that what men delight to read in books they will put in practice in reality 58in this way hazlitt demonstrated how poetry might be used to glorify tyranny and oppression a tendency he saw disturbingly prominent in coriolanus a lifelong advocate of individual freedom and the cause of the people as against the oppression of aristocracy the tyranny of  legitimate  monarchy 59 hazlitt was disturbed by this tendency in the human imagination as expressed in poetry and it was here that these misgivings first entered into his general theory of poetry 51 these thoughts were not particularly noticed for a century and a half when critic john kinnaird pointed out how curiously at odds with the more typical critical theories of poetry hazlitts idea was setting him apart from contemporaries such as wordsworth and coleridge students of hazlitts thought have strangely neglected this passage yet the idea it introduces is perhaps the most original and surely the most heretical idea in the entire range of his criticism 51 kinnaird notes that lionel trilling was the first critic to grasp the originality and importance of this passage though even trilling interpreted hazlitts idea of the human love of power in too narrow a sense 60having observed the workings of what he thought an alarming tendency of the poetic imagination as well as shakespeares possible aristocratic bias hazlitt then observes that after all traits of coriolanuss character emerge even in this dramatic context that shakespeare clearly shows to be less than admirable for example coriolanus complains of the fickleness of the people yet the instant he cannot gratify his pride and obstinacy at their expense he turns his arms against his own country if his country was not worth defending why did he build his pride in its defence 61ultimately hazlitt tried to form a balanced judgement of the play comparing hazlitts account with that of a famous contemporary david bromwich thought that nothing like this critical stance can be found anywhere in the whole range of coleridges criticism 62falstaff  henry iv and the merry wives of windsor  editsee also falstaff falstaff by eduard von grützner the character of sir john falstaff appeared in three of shakespeares plays henry iv part 1 henry iv part 2 and the merry wives of windsor the bulk of hazlitts commentary on the two history plays is devoted to falstaff whom he considers to be perhaps the most substantial comic character ever invented 63falstaff had been of interest to shakespearean commentators for years forty years earlier a fulllength book had appeared an essay on the dramatic character of sir john falstaff 1777 by maurice morgann often taken as the beginning of that school of shakespearean criticism which considers the characters of shakespeares plays as though they were real people 64 hazlitt who seems to have had little acquaintance with morganns work 65 is careful never to lose sight of falstaffs status as a character in a play 66 —three plays in fact though the two parts of henry iv are examined in a single essay in conveying his impressions of falstaff hazlitt first emphasises the sheer physical bulk that we remember him by we are as well acquainted with his person as his mind and his jokes come upon us with double force and relish from the quantity of flesh through which they make their way as he shakes his fat sides with laughter  63then hazlitt observes the connection between falstaffs body and his wit falstaffs wit is an emanation of a fine constitution an exuberance of goodhumour and goodnature an overflowing of his love of laughter and good fellowship a giving vent to his hearts ease and overcontentment with himself and others 67answering those who consider falstaff a mere sensualist he points out how little we actually see falstaff indulging himself all this is as much in imagination as in reality his sensuality does not engross and stupify his other faculties  his imagination keeps up the ball after his senses have done with it he seems to have even a greater enjoyment of the freedom from restraint of good cheer of his ease of his vanity in the ideal exaggerated description he gives of them than in fact 68this leads hazlitt to consider why when falstaff is represented as a liar a braggart a coward a glutton etc  we are not offended but delighted with him  69 the answer is that he is all these as much to amuse others as to gratify himself he openly assumes all these characters to shew the humourous part of them the unrestrained indulgence of his own ease appetites and convenience has neither malice nor hypocrisy in it in a word he is an actor in himself almost as much as upon the stage and we no more object to the character of falstaff in a moral point of view than we should think of bringing an excellent comedian who should represent him to the life before one of the police offices 69hazlitt goes on to present extracts of his favourite scenes including those between falstaff and prince hal and falstaff and mistress quickly this is merged into a consideration of the way falstaff interacts with some other characters and the way shakespeares characters reflect on one another each in his or her behaviour shedding light on key traits in the others 70this in turn leads to commentary on the heroic and serious parts of henry iv parts 1 and 2 and finally to more general reflections on shakespeares genius 71 but the character of falstaff has had the lions share of the discussion and hazlitt ends his essay on the two history plays by balancing his personal feelings about falstaff with a more distanced objective comment on the dramas as history plays in a broader contextthe truth is that we never could forgive the princes treatment of falstaff  by banishing him after the prince has become king henry v though perhaps shakespear knew what was best according to the history the nature of the times and of the man 72hazlitts enthusiastic explanation of how falstaffs fatness contributes to our amused sympathy with him was later especially admired by the critic john dover wilson 73 and john kinnaird considered the sketch of falstaff in this essay to be a masterpiece a brilliant  portrait of comic exuberance incarnate though perhaps in part a creation of his own imagination rather than being entirely faithful to the character as created by shakespeare 74 more recently the critic harold bloom in a book devoted entirely to falstaff approvingly noted hazlitts appreciative commentary on the character quoting hazlitts observation that falstaff lives in a perpetual holiday and open house and we live with him in a round of invitations to a rump and dozen 75falstaffs appearance in the merry wives of windsor is far less significant although he found things to admire in this play to hazlitt falstaff in the merry wives of windsor is not the man he was in the two parts of henry iv  76hamlet  editsee also hamlet and prince hamlet19thcentury depiction of hamlet though at times hazlitt delighted in actors interpretations of shakespearean characters and he thought some of shakespeares plays eminently suited for the stage he opens the chapter on hamlet by proclaiming we do not like to see our authors plays acted and least of all hamlet 77 here more than anywhere else he sides with charles lamb in believing shakespeares plays to suffer in stage presentation neither john kemble nor his favourite actor edmund kean played the role of hamlet to his satisfaction mr keans hamlet is as much too splenetic and rash as mr kembles is too deliberate and formal 77 this he felt is a play to be read and he noted that by his time it had already been so often read as to have become part of the common culture this is that hamlet the dane whom we read of in our youth 78 one might say he observes that hamlet is just a character in a play hamlet is a name his speeches and sayings but the idle coinage of the poets brain 79 yet shakespeare gives those sayings a reality in the mind of the reader making them as real as our own thoughts 79of all shakespeares plays this one is the most remarkable for the ingenuity originality and unstudied developement of character 80 writes hazlitt he thought of hamlet more often than any of shakespeares other plays because it abounds most in striking reflections on human life and because the distresses of hamlet are transferred by the turn of his mind to the general account of humanity 80the character of hamlet  is not a character marked by strength of will or even of passion but by refinement of thought and sentiment 81 writes hazlitt and he sides with schlegel and coleridge in thinking that hamlet seems incapable of deliberate action 82 his ruling passion is to think not to act 83although the focus in this essay is largely on the character of prince hamlet hazlitt also comments on the movement of the dramatic action shakespeare lends all the characters and settings an air of verisimilitude so that the reader might consider the whole play to be an exact transcription of what might be supposed to have taken place at the court of denmark at the remote period of time fixed upon before the modern refinements in morals and manners were heard of  the characters think and speak and act just as they might do if left entirely to themselves there is no set purpose no straining at a point 84hazlitt also reflects on shakespeares thorough understanding of the complexity of human character queen gertrude who was so criminal in some respects was not without sensibility and affection in other relations of life 85 again he comments on the idea expressed by other critics that some characters are too inconsistent in their behaviour to be plausible particularly polonius if his advice to his son laertes is very excellent and his advice to the king and queen on the subject of hamlets madness very ridiculous 86 that is because shakespeare kept up the distinction which there is in nature between the understandings and the moral habits of men  polonius is not a fool but he makes himself so 77hazlitts essay on hamlet was later used by david bromwich in an extensive comparison of coleridges and hazlitts critical views in general although to bromwich coleridges criticism of hamlet contained a greater number of original ideas including the general assessment of prince hamlets character hazlitts view is notable in that it does not like coleridge reduce that character to a single dominating flaw his inability to act in one of his lectures on shakespeare coleridge claimed that shakespeare wished to impress upon us the truth that action is the chief end of existence—that no faculties of intellect however brilliant can be considered valuable or indeed otherwise than as misfortunes if they withdraw us from or render us repugnant to action and lead us to think and think of doing until the time has elapsed when we can do anything effectually 87 hazlitt on the other hand instead of applying this moral pointed to the necessity of each readers identifying with hamlet to understand him which he believed occurred more readily than with any other of shakespeares characters and the readers judging of hamlet in part on the basis of what that reader then saw in himself this made it unlikely that hamlets entire character would be reduced to a single flaw that would provide the reader with a moral lesson 88shakespeare did not force prince hamlet to conform to any particular rules of morality the moral perfection of this character has been called in question hazlitt writes but the ethical delineations of shakespeare do not exhibit the drabcoloured quakerism of morality 89 hazlitt understood that human character is too complicated for such a portrayal to conform to the truth of human nature 90 on the morality of literature observes bromwich coleridge will usually be found a resolute guide and hazlitt an unsettling observer 91john kinnaird also paid particular attention to hazlitts celebrated sketch of prince hamlet in this essay 92 although hazlitt does not entirely belong to the school of pure character critics this essay does tend to be more of a character criticism than others asserts kinnaird because hazlitt shared with his romantic contemporaries an ambivalence toward tragedy hamlet to him as to his contemporaries was a modern character who was obsessed with evil in the world   long ed to escape from knowledge of it in themselves and had a pessimistic sense that suffering changes nothing and that the world must go on as it is 93 thus hazlitt could declare it is we who are hamlet 79hazlitt incorporated into this chapter material from his review of keans performance of hamlet at drury lane on 12 march 1814 mr keans hamlet the morning chronicle 14 march 1814 94 that review already included hazlitts musings on the difficulty of presenting hamlet on stage after seeing how even his favourite kean failed to interpret hamlets character adequately the celebrated passages that begin with this is that hamlet the dane and include the assertion it is we who are hamlet appear however only in the final form of the essay in characters of shakespears plays 79king lear  editsee also king lear18thcentury depiction of king lear mourning over his daughter cordelia in the essay on king lear which he entitled simply lear hazlitt makes no references to the performances of any actors in fact here he fully agrees with lamb that king lear like hamlet cannot be adequately presented on stage no actors he felt could do justice to the overwhelming imaginative power of this play 95hazlitt was so deeply affected by this tragedy that he begins the chapter with a regret that he had to write about it at all to attempt to give a description of the play itself or its effect upon the mind is mere impertinence 96 yet what he did write turned out to be a major piece of literary criticism that contributed to his general concepts about tragedy and poetry and made a powerful impression on the poet john keats 97the greatest strength of genius hazlitt writes is shewn in describing the strongest passions 25 this play takes as its subject the strongest passions 96 and shakespeares genius rose to the occasion here shakespeare was more in earnest than in any of his other creations and he was fairly caught in the web of his own imagination 96 the result was his best tragedy and therefore his best play 24of king lear in general hazlitt writes the passion which he has taken as his subject is that which strikes its root deepest into the human heart  this depth of nature this force of passion this tug and war of the elements of our being this firm faith in filial piety and the giddy anarchy and whirling tumult of the thoughts at finding this prop failing it the contrast between the fixed immovable basis of natural affection and the rapid irregular starts of imagination suddenly wrenched from all its accustomed holds and restingplaces in the soul this is what shakespear has given and what nobody else but he could give 98some space is devoted to the psychological scrutiny of the principal characters but with consideration also of their function in the dramatic construct the character of lear is perfectly conceived for its place in the play the only ground on which such a story could be built with the greatest truth and effect it is his rash haste his violent impetuosity his blindness to every thing but the dictates of his passions or affection that produces all his misfortunes that aggravates his impatience of them that enforces our pity for him 99hazlitt then comments on some of the other characters seen not in isolation but as they interact with and affect one another comparing and contrasting them to highlight subtle differences for example the characters of goneril and regan the comparison of which he begins with a note of personal distaste they are so thoroughly hateful that we do not even like to repeat their names 100 are shown he points out partly in their reaction to their sister cordelias desire that they treat their father well—  prescribe not to us our duties  —and partly by the contrast of their hypocrisy with the candor of the otherwise evil edmund 101hazlitt lingers briefly on the character of lears third daughter cordelia observing in one of his psychological asides that the indiscreet simplicity of her love  has a little of her fathers obstinacy in it 100going beyond specific characters or even specific interactions among them hazlitt delineates what he calls the logic of passion 102 the rhythm of emotions in the drama and its effect on the mind of the reader or viewer we see the ebb and flow of the feeling its pauses and feverish starts its impatience of opposition its accumulating force when it has had time to recollect itself the manner in which it avails itself of every passing word or gesture its haste to repel insinuation the alternate contraction and dilatation of the soul and all the dazzling fence of controversy in this mortal combat with poisoned weapons aimed at the heart where each wound is fatal 103 he observes too in explaining an instance of what later came to be called comic relief how when the readers feelings are strained to the utmost just as  the fibres of the heart  are growing rigid from overstrained excitement  the imagination is glad to take refuge in the halfcomic halfserious comments of the fool just as the mind under the extreme anguish of a surgical operation vents itself in sallies of wit 104and again on shakespeares artistry hazlitt remarks on the way the second plot involving gloucester edgar and edmund is interwoven with the main plot indeed the manner in which the threads of the story are woven together is almost as wonderful in the way of art as the carrying on the tide of passion still varying and unimpaired is on the score of nature 105hazlitt appreciatively quotes long extracts from what he considered some of the best scenes and remarks that as sad as the concluding events are the oppression of the feelings is relieved by the very interest we take in the misfortunes of others and by the reflections to which they give birth 106 this leads to his mentioning the thencurrent practice of substituting on stage a happy ending for shakespeares tragic one which had been approved by no less an authority than dr johnson arguing against this practice hazlitt brings in a lengthy quote from an article lamb wrote for leigh hunts reflector which concludes a happy ending—as if the living martyrdom that lear had gone through—the flaying of his feelings alive did not make a fair dismissal from life the only decorous thing for him 107hazlitt however in the view of john kinnaird goes beyond lamb in maintaining that it is lears very despair by which all the powers of thought and feeling were elicited and intensified that gives him tragic strength and grandeur 108by early 1818 a few months after the publication of characters of shakespears plays john keats had acquired a copy fascinated by what he read particularly by the essay on king lear he underlined passages and added comments in the margins keats especially liked what hazlitt wrote on the plays ebb and flow of the feeling 103 and noted using a term he had heard hazlitt himself apply to shakespeare in his 27 january lecture on shakspeare and milton 109 this passage has to a great degree hieroglyphic visioning 110 together with what he had already read of hazlitts work especially the essay on gusto from the round table which had helped him develop his celebrated idea about negative capability this essay on king lear inspired much of his own poetry and thoughts about poetry 111hazlitt ends the chapter by making four points about genius poetry and especially tragedy to david bromwich the most important of these is the third that the greatest strength of genius is shewn in describing the strongest passions for the power of the imagination in works of invention must be in proportion to the force of the natural impressions which are the subject of them 112bromwich noted that hazlitts thoughts particularly as applied to lear are here in line with those of shelley in his defence of poetry 113 bromwich also noted that for hazlitt the power of this play is achieved by shakespeares unwillingness to soften the harshness of nature as expressed in lears halting broken outcries such as i will have such revenges on you both goneril and reganthat all the world shall—— 114 this approach is never quite followed by even so great a contemporary poet as wordsworth to hazlitt this is a demonstration of why the greatest poetry of his own age failed to achieve the level of greatness that shakespeare reached here 113 that king lear is strongest in subordinating the artistry of dramatic poetry to the power of nature is also why its kind of poetry is superior to the more artificial kind produced by pope 115macbeth  editsee also macbeth among shakespeares four principal tragedies macbeth according to hazlitt in this chapter is notable for its wild extremes of action its preponderance of violence and its representation of imagination strained to the verge of the forbidden and the darker mysteries of existence this tragedy is alike distinguished for the lofty imagination it displays and for the tumultuous vehemence of the action and the one is made the moving principle of the other hazlitt writes 116 macbeth moves upon the verge of an abyss and is a constant struggle between life and death the action is desperate and the reaction is dreadful  the whole play is an unruly chaos of strange and forbidden things where the ground rocks under our feet 117here again hazlitt is interested not merely in individual characters but in the character of the play as a whole focusing especially on the supernatural underpinnings with the prophecies of the three witches on the blasted heath with which macbeth struggles wrestling with his destiny through to the plays tragic climax hazlitt is especially interested in the design of macbeth in its general mood its full poetic impression   118 and in this according to john kinnaird he anticipates the method of the twentiethcentury shakespearean critic g wilson knight 118 shakespear writes hazlitt lost sight of nothing that could in any way give relief or heightening to his subject  117further noting shakespeares crafting of the play hazlitt points to fine touches at the beginning that contribute to a unified effect the wildness of the scenery the sudden shifting of the situations and characters the bustle the expectations excited all are equally extraordinary 116 shakespear he writes excelled in the openings of his plays that of macbeth is the most striking of any 119he also as in his essay on hamlet notes the realistic effect of macbeth his plays have the force of things upon the mind what he represents is brought home to the bosom as a part of our experience implanted in the memory as if we had known the places persons and things of which he treats 119in considering the characters hazlitt emphasises the importance of their interaction the way in which a major characters behaviour helps define that of another this is especially true of macbeth and lady macbeth locked together in a struggle against all scotland and their fate macbeth as he is about to commit his bloodiest deeds is assailed by the stings of remorse and full of preternatural solicitings  in thought he is absent and perplexed sudden and desperate in act from his own irresolution 120 this is in contrast with and set off by the character of lady macbeth whose obdurate strength of will and masculine firmness give her the ascendancy over her husbands faultering virtue  the magnitude of her resolution almost covers the magnitude of her guilt 120 but in effect macbeth and lady macbeth exchange places as the action develops he becomes more callous as he plunges deeper in guilt  and  in the end anticipates his wife in the boldness and bloodiness of his enterprises while she for want of the same stimulus of action  goes mad and dies 121here as elsewhere hazlitt illuminates the characters not only by contrast with others in the same play but with characters in other plays a lengthy passage adapted from an 1814 drama review by hazlitt 122 compares macbeth and king richard iii from shakespeares play of that name both characters are tyrants usurpers murderers both aspiring and ambitious both courageous cruel treacherous but richard is naturally incapable of good and wades through a series of crimes  from the ungovernable violence of his temper and a reckless love of mischief while macbeth full of the milk of human kindness   is with difficulty prevailed upon to commit  the murder of duncan  and is filled with remorse after its perpetration 123similarly though lady macbeth is evil  she is only wicked to gain a great end and it is only her inexorable selfwill that prevents her being diverted from her bad purpose which masks her natural affections 124 whereas goneril and regan in king lear excite our loathing and abhorrence as lady macbeth does not 120 further hazlitt notes that lady macbeth displays human emotions swelling exultation and keen spirit of triumph  uncontroulable eagerness of anticipation  solid substantial flesh and blood display of passion while the witches from the same play are only hags of mischief unreal abortive halfexistences 125because of their human qualities we never entirely lose sympathy with macbeth and lady macbeth and our imagination participates with theirs in the tragedy their imagination makes the two more human and yet also destroys them as kinnaird points out elaborating on an idea of joseph w donohue jr hazlitt in part sees macbeth as a tragedy of imagination itself 126sarah siddons as lady macbeth 1822 engraving by robert cooper after a painting by george henry harlow one concern addressed by hazlitt is the assertion by previous critics that macbeth is little more than a crude and violent amalgam of extremes filled with gothic barbarisms 127 hazlitt notes however that should anyone think macbeths character is so composed of contradictory extremes as to be implausible it is rather the circumstances and the passions in conflict that provide the extremes while macbeths character retains a strong underlying unity throughout macbeth in shakespear no more loses his identity of character in the fluctuations of fortune or the storm of passions than macbeth in himself would have lost the identity of his person 128 kinnaird notes that here as if anticipating it by a century hazlitt argues against the view advanced by elmer edgar stoll in 1933 that macbeths character is too full of contradictions to be plausible 127although he lingers nostalgically on his memory of the great actress sarah siddons s performance as lady macbeth 129 and a few years earlier had acknowledged that kean and john kemble had been at least partly successful in the role of macbeth though each in different portions of it 130 on the whole he expressed doubts about the success of the staging of this play again agreeing with lamb by the time he composed this chapter of characters he could write we can conceive  no one to play macbeth properly or to look like a man that had encountered the weïrd sisters 131 further observations follow about the witches themselves part of the problem was that by his day there remained few who really believed in the supernatural and by the force of the police and of philosophy  the ghosts in shakespear will become obsolete 131 he concludes by quoting at length a passage from an essay by lamb on the originality of shakespeares portrayal of the witches 132the merchant of venice  editsee also the merchant of venice hazlitts treatment of the merchant of venice centres on the character of shylock a few years earlier edmund kean had appeared as the jewish moneylender in his debut performance at drury lane hazlitt the drama critic for the morning chronicle in january 1814 sat close to the stage and watched every facial expression every movement 133 he was astounded at keans for the time radically unconventional portrayal of shylock as a full rounded complex human being full of vigour rather than a doddering malevolent stereotype 134 his positive review of keans performance became critical in boosting the actors career but keans performance also helped alter hazlitts own view of shylock which made its way into this essay a few years later hazlitt admitted that he had tended to accept the older interpretation of shylocks character as it had been depicted on stage which followed centuriesold prejudices against the jews and made him a onedimensional character keans performance led him to study the play closely and think deeply about shylock though shylocks mind is warped with prejudices and passion  that he has but one idea is not true he has more ideas than any other person in the piece and if he is intense and inveterate in the pursuit of his purpose he shews the utmost elasticity vigour and presence of mind in the means of attaining it 134although old prejudices against the jews were starting to disappear as hazlitt notes he refers to the portrayal of the benevolent jew in richard cumberland s play the jew of 1794 135 and some reviewers had begun to discover something respectable in shylocks figure a century and a half later critic david bromwich would suggest that in retrospect it was hazlitt himself even more than kean who paved the way for what became the prevalent reading of shylocks character though shylock is serious about revenge he is true to himself in other ways that cast a less than favourable light on other characters in the play 133 after hazlitts account according to bromwich it became less easy to find a simple resolution to the problems in the play or to withhold entirely our sympathy for shylock 136 particularly in view of a passage like the following shylock is a good hater a man no less sinned against than sinning if he carries his revenge too far yet he has strong grounds for the lodged hate he bears anthonio which he explains with equal force of eloquence and reason he seems the depositary of the vengeance of his race and though the long habit of brooding over daily insults and injuries has crusted over his temper with inveterate misanthropy and hardened him against the contempt of mankind this adds but little to the triumphant pretensions of his enemies there is a strong quick and deep sense of justice mixed up with the gall and bitterness of his resentment  the desire of revenge is almost inseparable from the sense of wrong and we can hardly help sympathising with the proud spirit hid beneath his jewish gaberdine stung to madness by repeated undeserved provocations and labouring to throw off the load of obloquy and oppression heaped upon him and all his tribe by one desperate act of lawful revenge till the ferociousness of the means by which he is to execute his purpose and the pertinacity with which he adheres to it turn us against him but even at last when disappointed of the sanguinary revenge with which he had glutted his hopes and exposed to beggary and contempt by the letter of the law on which he had insisted with so little remorse we pity him and think him hardly dealt with by his judges 137shylock and portia 1835other critics even in later years insisted that the character of shylock is that of an outsider separated from society that the jewish shylock represented an older form of justice meant to be supplanted by the christian view represented by portia who argued for the prevalence of mercy shylock these critics maintained must be removed in order to allow society to attain a christian form of peace hazlitts view however has remained as a valid countervailing concept of the play one that does not arrive at easy conclusions or take sides readily 138hazlitt also reflects on several other characters portia for example was no favourite of his and has a certain degree of affectation and pedantry about her 139 gratiano he finds a very admirable subordinate character 140once again as john kinnaird observed hazlitt is here far more than a character critic showing serious interest in the structure of the play as a whole 141 the whole of the trialscene he remarks in this essay is a masterpiece of dramatic skill the legal acuteness the passionate declamations the sound maxims of jurisprudence the wit and irony interspersed in it the fluctuations of hope and fear in the different persons and the completeness and suddenness of the catastrophe cannot be surpassed 142 he points to some beautiful poetic passages and concludes that the graceful winding up of this play  is one of the happiest instances of shakespears knowledge of the principles of the drama 143othello  editsee also othello early 19thcentury depiction of othello act v scene 2while hazlitts discussion of othello includes observations about the characters his consideration of this play as with all of the four major tragedies is combined with ideas about the purpose and value of tragedy and even of poetry in general expanding upon aristotle s idea in the poetics that tragedy purifies the affections by terror and pity 144 he asserts that tragedy makes us thoughtful spectators in the lists of life it is the refiner of the species a discipline of humanity 145furthermore othello more than the other tragedies has for the average viewer or reader a close  application to the experiences of everyday life 146 hazlitt brings out this point by comparing othello to macbeth where there is a violent struggle between opposite feelings between ambition and the stings of conscience almost from first to last in othello the doubtful conflict between contrary passions though dreadful continues only for a short time and the chief interest is excited by the alternate ascendancy of different passions by the entire and unforeseen change from the fondest love and most unbounded confidence to the tortures of jealousy and the madness of hatred 147hazlitts discussion of the particular characters incorporates observations about the way shakespeare creates them showing that rather than being broad types characters even superficially similar differ in finely discriminated ways desdemona and emilia for example are to outward appearance characters of common life not more distinguished than women generally are by difference of rank and situation 147 as the dialogue unfolds the difference of their thoughts and sentiments is however laid open their minds are separated from each other by signs as plain and as little to be mistaken as the complexions of their husbands 147with all his frequently noted attention to character and characters 141 —hazlitts partly psychological approach to character necessarily referred to observed reallife behavior—he also frequently emphasises the art by which shakespeare created dramatic character 148 particularly in tragedy a sense of power he believed is the essential medium by which a poet of genius operates on the minds of his audience 149 when the author instills in the reader or viewers imagination the sense of power that he must have had in grasping and conveying intertwined passions he makes us identify with a character such as othello and feel in ourselves the way iago plays upon his mind so that ironically his weakness is made to undermine his strength 150hazlitt often focuses as well on specific traits by comparing the characters not to those of real life but to characters in shakespeares other plays comparing for example iago with edmund in king lear his interest in the art of drama emerges even more obviously when he compares iago with the villainous character zanga in edward young s the revenge 1721 still a popular play in hazlitts day 151for hazlitt othello is especially notable for the interplay between the characters and the way shakespeare communicates the slow and gradual movement of passion  the alternate ascendancy of different passions  the entire and unforeseen change from the fondest love and most unbounded confidence to the tortures of jealousy and the madness of hatred 147 he finds especially remarkable the gradual alteration of othellos feelings about desdemona as his mind is played upon by iago othello is not naturally a violent person in everyday life 152 the nature of the moor is noble confiding tender and generous but his blood is of the most inflammable kind and being once roused by a sense of his wrongs he is stopped by no considerations of remorse or pity till he has given a loose to all the dictates of his rage and despair  the third act of othello is shakespeares finest display not of knowledge and passion separately but of the two combined 153 hazlitt continues it is in working othellos noble nature up to this extremity through rapid but gradual transitions in raising passion to its height from the smallest beginnings and in spite of all obstacles in painting the expiring conflict between love and hatred tenderness and resentment jealousy and remorse in unfolding the strength and the weakness of our nature in uniting sublimity of thought with the anguish of the keenest woe in putting in motion the various impulses that agitate this our mortal being and at last blending them in that noble tide of deep and sustained passion impetuous but majestic  that shakespear has shewn the mastery of his genius and of his power over the human heart 154desdemonas character is shown in her attachment to her husband her beauty and external graces are only indirectly glanced at 154 her attachment to othello begins in a manner a little fantastical and headstrong 155 but after that her whole character consists in having no will of her own no prompter but her obedience even the extravagance of her resolutions the pertinacity of her affections may be said to arise out of the gentleness of her nature 156three years earlier in the review mr keans iago in the examiner 7 august 1814 hazlitt had ventured to speculate that iagos suggestions of lasciviousness in desdemona may have had some basis in truth as purity and grossness sometimes nearly are alliedand thin partitions do their bounds divide   157 although he omitted this thought from characters of shakespears plays that did not stop an anonymous reviewer in blackwoods magazine from accusing him of calling desdemona a lewd character in a reply to z   written in 1818 but never published hazlitt answers his accuser 158 it is not true that i have insinuated that desdemona was a lewd woman any more than shakespear has insinuated it but i have dared to say that he alone could have given additional elegance and even delicacy to a female character from the very disadvantageous circumstances in which desdemona is placed 159hazlitts treatment of the character of iago is written in part as a response to those who thought this whole character unnatural because his villainy is without a sufficient motive  160 hazlitt responds with a psychological analysis that exerted great influence and sparked considerable discussion shakespeare knew that the love of power which is another name for the love of mischief is natural to man  he would know this  merely from seeing children paddle in the dirt or kill flies for sport iago in fact belongs to a class of character common to shakespear and at the same time peculiar to him whose heads are as acute and active as their hearts are hard and callous iago is  an extreme instance of the kind that is to say of diseased intellectual activity with the most perfect indifference to moral good or evil or rather with a decided preference of the latter because it falls more readily in with this favourite propensity gives greater zest to his thoughts and scope to his actions 161 this interpretation was later admired and built upon by shakespearean critic a c bradley 162john kinnaird later commented on hazlitts words terming iago an amateur of tragedy in real life 163 pointing out that bradley and others after him developed the idea that hazlitt saw iago as an artist in his own right a dramatic artist manqué  164 but the form iagos will to mischief takes is not primarily aesthetic or creative but practical and critical soldier that he is he has a craving after action of the most difficult and dangerous kind and he has none of the artists sympathy with pleasure his licentious bent is always saturnine and stems from a desire of finding out the worst side of every thing and of proving himself an overmatch for appearances  165 david bromwich later warned against carrying too far the idea that iago is an artist figure within the play a representation of shakespeare himself as iagos genius is  the opposite of shakespeares it presents all things in a distorting medium  iagos peculiar genius is as hazlitt represented it the exuberance of one part of shakespeares mind—not an allegorical representation of the whole of it 166the tempest  editsee also the tempest the tempest act i scene 1 1797the tempest hazlitt claims is one of shakespeares most original and perfect plays 167 similar in some ways to a midsummer nights dream but finer as a play if not as rich in poetic passages 168 the tempest demonstrates the author to be a master of both comedy and tragedy with a full command over all the resources of passion of wit of thought of observation 169 yet again hazlitt here devotes considerable space to not just the characters in the play but the character of the play as a whole 118 the world of the play seems to be created out of nothing 167 yet though dreamlike in large part a product of the imagination its setting resembles that of a painting we may have seen—prosperos enchanted island with its airy music the tempesttost vessel the turbulent waves all have the effect of the landscape background of some fine picture 170 —its poetry having a music that conjures up meaning in the listeners mind—the songs  without conveying any distinct images seem to recall all the feelings connected with them like snatches of halfforgotten music heard indistinctly and at intervals 171 —and its characters many of whom like ariel we know could not really exist are drawn so as to seem as true and natural as shakespeares real characters 172 all is so artfully unified that that part which is only the fantastic creation of his mind has the same palpable texture and coheres semblably with the rest 167hazlitt provides brief appreciative sketches of many of the characters and their relationships for example the courtship between ferdinand and miranda is one of the chief beauties of this play it is the very purity of love the pretended interference of prospero with it heightens its interest and is in character with the magician whose sense of preternatural power makes him arbitrary tetchy and impatient of opposition 168in quoting the speech of the old counselor gonzalo on the ideal commonwealth he would rule hazlitt observes that here shakespear has anticipated nearly all the arguments on the utopian schemes of modern philosophy 173he scrutinises with special interest the characters of caliban and ariel pointing out that as they arise within the structure of the play neither could exist without the other and neither alone illuminates the sum of our nature better than both together caliban is gross of the earth 174 whereas ariel is imaginary power the swiftness of thought personified 175shakespear has as it were by design drawn off from caliban the elements of whatever is ethereal and refined to compound them in the unearthly mould of ariel nothing was ever more finely conceived than this contrast between the material and the spiritual the gross and delicate 175hazlitt was particularly interested in caliban in part because others thought the character vulgar or evil though he is a savage half brute half demon 170 and the essence of grossness 174 caliban is not in the least vulgar the character grows out of the soil where it is rooted uncontrouled uncouth and wild uncramped by any of the meannesses of custom  vulgarity is not natural coarseness but conventional coarseness learnt from others contrary to or without an entire conformity of natural power and disposition as fashion is the commonplace affectation of what is elegant and refined without any feeling of the essence of it 174 stephano and trinculo are vulgar by comparison and in conducting them to prosperos cell by understanding the nature by which it is surrounded caliban shews the superiority of natural capacity over greater knowledge and greater folly 176casting a retrospective light on his interest in caliban in characters of shakespears plays the following year hazlitt in a review of mr coleridges lectures responded indignantly to coleridges calling caliban a villain as well as a jacobin 177 who wanted only to spread anarchy though speaking somewhat tongueincheek hazlitt rises to calibans defence caliban is so far from being a prototype of modern jacobinism that he is strictly the legitimate sovereign of the isle 178 hazlitt did not necessarily believe that caliban deserved to supplant prospero as ruler but he shows that calibans very existence raises questions about the fundamental nature of sovereignty justice and society itself as noted by david bromwich coleridge found reasons to apologise for society as it was hazlitt on the other hand refused to take sides leaving as open questions the issues that emerged in the play it was left to hazlitt to interpret calibans coarseness and the justice of his protests as both alike irreducible 179twelfth night or what you will  editsee also twelfth night hazlitts commentary on twelfth night uses shakespeares play to illustrate some of his general ideas about comedy thoughts that he explored at greater length in later works such as his lectures on the english comic writers 1819 180walter howell deverell twelfth night 1850nobody according to hazlitt voicing his disagreement with dr johnson excelled shakespeare in tragedy although his comedies could be first rate other writers such as molière cervantes and rabelais excelled him in some types of comedy 181 it was in the comedy of nature that shakespeare was supreme this is not comedy that satirises the ridiculous but is rather the comedy of convivial laughter 182 which gently mocks human foibles and invites us to share in innocent pleasures of this kind of comedy twelfth night is one of the most delightful 183 unlike the comedy of artificial life of wit of satire 184 shakespeares more gentle comedy makes us laugh at the follies of mankind not despise them  shakespears comic genius resembles the bee rather in its power of extracting sweets from weeds or poisons than in leaving a sting behind it 183besides his further general remarks hazlitt lingers appreciatively over a number of amusing scenes and poetic passages including the songs all showing how shakespears comedy is of a pastoral and poetical cast folly is indigenous to the soil  absurdity has every encouragement afforded it and nonsense has room to flourish in 185 characters of vastly different types are all welcome and fit into his scheme the same house is big enough to hold malvolio the countess maria sir toby and sir andrew aguecheek  186 he particularly admires the character of viola whom shakespeare gives many speeches of impassioned sweetness 187 characterising the play as a whole by quoting the authors own words in it—shakespear alone could describe the effect of his own poetry —he reflects that the plays poetry comes  oer the ear like the sweet souththat breathes upon a bank of violetsstealing and giving odour   187here hazlitt steps back to observe his own character musing that if he himself were less saturnine he might well like the comedies as much as the tragedies or at least that is how he feels after reading  parts of this play 188as you like it  editsee also as you like it although hazlitt had seen as you like it on stage he remembered it most fondly from having read it so frequently that he practically had it memorised 189 in characters of shakespears plays he makes no mention at all of any stage performances treating the play as one primarily meant to be read what strikes him as most notable about it is its character of a pastoral drama one that presents an ideal world—that is a world of thought and imagination not action and though it is a comedy its interest derives not so much from in our being made to laugh at any particular human follies but rather more out of the sentiments and characters than out of the actions or situations it is not what is done but what is said that claims our attention 190scene from as you like it 1750the very air of the place wrote hazlitt about the forest of arden seems to breathe a spirit of philosophical poetry to stir the thoughts to touch the heart with pity as the drowsy forest rustles to the sighing gale 191 and the character who most embodies the philosophical spirit of the place is jacques who is the only purely contemplative character in shakespear 191 among the lovers hazlitt particularly likes the character of rosalind made up of sportive gaiety and natural tenderness 192 and the couples touchstone and audrey and silvius and phebe have their different places in the picture 193 the other characters including orlando and the duke also come in for their share of commentary 191 all in all hazlitt finds this to be one of the most quotable and quoted of shakespears plays there is hardly any of shakespears plays that contains a greater number of passages that have been quoted in books of extracts or a greater number of phrases that have become in a manner proverbial 194hazlitts concept of the play as one in which the interest is intended to arise not out of the action or situation but rather its contemplative nature has remained a vital one reaching into the twentieth century 195 and now the twentyfirst 196measure for measure  editsee also measure for measure claudio and isabella 1850 by william holman hunt measure for measure has frequently been considered a  problem play  it was a problem for hazlitt in that it contains almost no character with whom one can feel complete sympathy  there is in general a want of passion the affections are at a stand our sympathies are reflected and defeated in all directions 197 angelo the deputy ruler of vienna is forgiven by the duke but draws only hazlitts hatred as he seems to have a much greater passion for hypocrisy than for his mistress 197 neither are we enamoured of isabellas rigid chastity though she could not act otherwise than she did 197 isabellas brother claudio is the only person who feels naturally yet even he does not show well in his pleading for life at the sacrifice of his sisters virginity there is no easy solution for his plight and he is placed in circumstances of distress which almost preclude the wish for his deliverance 198 over a century later commentator r w chambers placed hazlitt as the first of a long line of notable shakespearean critics who felt the same way 199 and he quoted characters of shakespears plays in establishing his contention as a basis for arguing his own different view of the play that hazlitt was among the first of dozens of distinguished critics who could not comprehend how mariana could love and plead for someone like angelo and in general showed a distaste for much in measure for measure 200yet unlike coleridge 200 and despite his own reservations hazlitt found much to admire in measure for measure a play as full of genius as it is of wisdom 197 he quotes at length passages of dramatic beauty 201 and also finds occasion to use this play as an example supporting his characterisation of the general nature of shakespeares genius and the relation between morality and poetry shakespear was in one sense the least moral of all writers for morality commonly so called is made up of antipathies  202 yet in another sense he was the greatest of all moralists he was a moralist in the same sense in which nature is one he taught what he had learnt from her he shewed the greatest knowledge of humanity with the greatest fellowfeeling for it 203although hazlitt had reviewed a performance of measure for measure for the examiner on 11 february 1816 204 and incorporated a few passages with modifications into this chapter including some of his general philosophical reflections and a mention of some of schlegels opinions 205 yet he says nothing in characters of shakespears plays about any stage performances of this play others  editsee also shakespeares plays tragedies  edithazlitt believed that because tragedy engages our emotions most profoundly it is the greatest kind of drama 206 of the tragedies based on greek and roman history he ranked julius caesar beneath the other roman tragedies coriolanus and antony and cleopatra 207 but as elsewhere he expresses admiration for the fine discrimination of character the depiction of the manners of the common people and the jealousies and heartburnings of the different factions in julius caesar 208in antony and cleopatra shakespears genius has spread over the whole play a richness like the overflowing of the nile 209 overall this play presents a fine picture of roman pride and eastern magnificence and in the struggle between the two the empire of the world seems suspended like the swans down featherthat stands upon the swell at full of tideand neither way inclines   210timon of athens to hazlitt as much a satire as a play 211 seemed to him to be written with as intense a feeling of his subject as any one play of shakespear and is the only play of our author in which spleen is the predominant feeling of the mind 211troilus and cressida act v scene ii 1795a focal point of hazlitts account of troilus and cressida is a comparison of the characterisation in this play and that in chaucer s poem troilus and criseyde one of shakespeares sources chaucers characters are full and well developed but chaucer unfolded each character in itself one at a time shakespeare displayed characters as they see themselves as well as how others see them and showed the effects each has on the others shakespeares characters were so distinctive that it is as if each were expressed by a distinct faculty of his mind and in effect these faculties could be considered as showing excessive sociability notable for how they gossiped and compared notes together 212 twentiethcentury critic arthur eastman thought that although these remarks did insufficient justice to chaucer they were particularly original in revealing the sophisticated genius of shakespeare 213for hazlitt the essence of romeo and juliet is shakespeares portrayal of the love that comes with the ripening of the youthful blood 214 and with that love the imagination of the youthful lovers is stirred to dwell not so much on present pleasure but on all the pleasures they had not experienced all that was to come of life was theirs  their hopes were of air their desires of fire 215 in many beautiful poetic passages the feelings of youth and of the spring are  blended together like the breath of opening flowers 216 assessing the character of the play as a whole he states this play presents a beautiful coupdoeil of the progress of human life in thought it occupies years and embraces the circle of the affections from childhood to old age 217histories  editin hazlitts commentary on king john his last on any of the history plays he offers his view of history plays in general if we are to indulge our imaginations we had rather do it upon an imaginary theme if we are to find subjects for the exercise of our pity and terror we prefer seeking them in fictitious danger and fictitious distress 218still he finds much to appreciate in the history plays here it is the weak vacillating sometimes contemptible character of king john 219 the comic but forthright noble character of philip the bastard 220 the desperation and excess of maternal tenderness in constance 221 and many beautiful and affecting passages hazlitt also offers some reflections on shakespeares versification there was some controversy over whether this play was genuinely shakespeares he concludes that the verse shows that it certainly was a judgement borne out by later critics 222hazlitt remarks that richard ii less well known than richard iii is the finer play worth noting is the exchange of places between the king and bolingbroke the usurping king—the steps by which bolingbroke mounts the throne are those by which richard sinks into the grave— 223 and he compares the manner and politics of the age with those of his own among various poetical passages he finds the speech of john of gaunt in praise of england one of the most eloquent that ever was penned 224porträt des heinrich viii  henry viii  after hans holbein the younger 1542 henry v hazlitt thought only secondrate among shakespeares plays yet filled with much fine poetry regarding the king himself he considered the character of this pageant play 225 entertaining enough until one compares king henry with the historical henry v who was as barbarous as any of the historical absolute monarchs 226henry vi the three parts considered together in one chapter is not for hazlitt on a level with the other history plays but in a long comparison of king henry vi with king richard ii he finds occasion to reinforce his major theme of the fine discrimination of superficially similar characters 227richard iii for hazlitt is preeminently made for acting properly a stage play it belongs to the theatre rather than to the closet 228 it is dominated by the character of king richard whom shakespeare portrays astowering and lofty equally impetuous and commanding haughty violent and subtle bold and treacherous confident in his strength as well as in his cunning raised high by his birth and higher by his talents and his crimes a royal usurper a princely hypocrite a tyrant and a murderer of the house of plantagenet 229hazlitt comments on the efforts of several actors in playing the role particularly kean portions of his review of keans first performance as richard written for the morning chronicle of 15 february 1814 were incorporated into this chapter 230differing with dr johnson who found nothing of genius in henry viii but the depiction of the  meek sorrows and virtuous distress   of queen katherine 231 hazlitt finds in this play though not one of shakespeares greatest considerable interest of a more mild and thoughtful cast and some of the most striking passages in the authors works 232 in addition to the portrayal of katherine hazlitt likes that of cardinal wolsey and of king henry himself which though drawn with great truth and spirit is like a very disagreeable portrait sketched by the hand of a master 233 and the scene of the duke of buckingham led to execution is one of the most affecting and natural in shakespear and one to which there is hardly an approach in any other author 234comedies  editreflecting on twelfth night hazlitt considered that his own preference for tragedy could be in part due to his own saturnine temperament and asserted that regardless of individual preferences shakespeare was as skilled in comedy as in tragedy 188 with this acknowledgement he had quite a few appreciative comments to make about the comedies hazlitt found sheer delight in a midsummer nights dream 235 especially relishing its playfully inventive poetry and quoting at length several of his favourite passages he also considers how it exhibits the fine discrimination of character to be found everywhere in shakespeare as elsewhere he crosses the boundaries of plays and enumerates subtle differences between even the fairy characters in this case in an extensive comparison of puck in this play and ariel in the tempest 236the quarrel of oberon and titania by joseph noel paton this is one play that hazlitt felt cannot be properly represented on stage its beauties are primarily those of poetry poetry and the stage do not agree well together the ideal can have no place upon the stage which is a picture without perspective  where all is left to the imagination as is the case in reading every circumstance  has an equal chance of being kept in mind and tells according to the mixed impression of all that has been suggested 237although the early play the two gentlemen of verona seemed to hazlitt like little more than the first outlines of a comedy loosely sketched in he also found in it passages of high poetical spirit and of inimitable quaintness of humour 238hazlitt proclaims the winters tale as one of the bestacting of our authors plays 239 and recalls with delight some of his favourite actors who played the parts including sarah siddons and john kemble 240 he notes the incisive psychology of the unfolding of king leontes s madness 241 the appealing roguery of autolycus 239 and the charm of perdita s and florizel s speeches 242 after wondering how it could be that pope doubted the authenticity of the play as shakespeares 243hazlitt thought alls well that ends well to be a particularly pleasing play 244 though less as a comedy than as a serious dramatisation of an original tale by boccaccio 245 helena is a noble example of womanhood 246 and in the comic part of the play hazlitt is especially amused by the character of parolles the parasite and hanger on of count bertrams whose folly boasting and cowardice  and false pretensions to bravery and honour are unmasked in a very amusing episode 247 the source of shakespeares play leads hazlitt to digress at length on the writing of boccaccio who had never had justice  done him by the world 248loves labours lost thought hazlitt transports us quite as much to the manners of the court and the quirks of the courts of law as to the scenes of nature or the fairyland of shakespeares own imagination shakespear has set himself to imitate the tone of polite conversation then prevailing among the fair the witty and the learned 249 if we were to part with any of the authors comedies he writes it should be this 250 yet he also mentions many amusing characters dramatic scenes and noble lines of poetry he would not willingly part with quoting at length long passages spoken by both biron 251 and by rosaline 252much ado about nothing hazlitt found to be an admirable comedy neatly balancing the comic against more serious matter 253 he reflects perhaps that middle point of comedy was never more nicely hit in which the ludicrous blends with the tender and our follies turning round against themselves in support of our affections retain nothing but their humanity 254the taming of the shrew hazlitt sums up very simply as almost the only one of shakespears comedies that has a regular plot and downright moral  it shows admirably how selfwill is only to be got the better of by stronger will and how one degree of ridiculous perversity is only to be driven out by another still greater 255while the comedy of errors has a few passages which bear the decided stamp of shakespeares genius hazlitt for the most part characterises it as taken very much from the menaechmi of plautus and is not an improvement on it 256hazlitt ends his detailed account of the plays with a chapter on doubtful plays of shakespear the greater part of which consists of direct quotations from schlegel whose remarks hazlitt finds worth considering if he does not always agree with them most of the plays now accepted as shakespeares or at least partly by shakespeare were also accepted as his by hazlitt the two notable exceptions were titus andronicus and pericles prince of tyre of the former hazlitt nevertheless respected schlegels defence of it enough to quote the latter at length 257 and he allows that some parts of pericles could have been by shakespeare but more likely were imitations of shakespeare by some contemporary poet 258hazlitt felt compelled to add to his commentary on the plays some words on shakespeares nondramatic poetry in the chapter poems and sonnets while he liked a few of the sonnets 259 for the most part hazlitt found shakespeares nondramatic poetry to be artificial mechanical and overall laboured uphill work 260 on the whole wrote hazlitt our idolatry of shakespear  ceases with his plays 261themes  editcharacters of shakespears plays argues against a century and a half of criticism that saw shakespeare as a child of nature deficient in art and full of faults 262 to anchor his position hazlitt makes an observation by the poet alexander pope—despite popes being one of those very critics—his unifying theme every single character in shakespear is as much an individual as those in life itself 263 and he explores the shakespearean art that as much as observation of nature brought those characters to life 148august wilhelm schlegel much of the book synthesises hazlitts own views with those of his predecessors in shakespearean criticism the greatest of these critics was august wilhelm schlegel the contemporary german literary scholar and critic who also heavily influenced coleridge 264 and who hazlitt believed appreciated shakespeare better than any english critic 263 certainly no writer among ourselves wrote hazlitt has shown either the same admiration of his genius or the same philosophical acuteness in pointing out his characteristic excellences 265hazlitt also merges with his presentation in a general way the approach of his immediate british predecessors the character critics like maurice morgann who had begun to take a psychological approach focusing on how the characters in the plays behave and think like people we know in real life 266in this vein each of hazlitts essays incorporates numerous often very personal commentaries on the characters for example in the account of cymbeline he announces we have almost as great an affection for imogen as she had for posthumus and she deserves it better 38 and comparing falstaff with prince hal he proclaims falstaff is the better man of the two 267 commenting on the character of hamlet he in effect joins a discussion among his contemporaries adding to the mix of similar assessments by goethe 268 schlegel 269 and coleridge 270 his observation that hamlet is not a character marked by strength of will or even of passion but by refinement of thought and sentiment 81although hazlitts attention to characters in this manner was not original 271 and was later criticised 272 he built upon the approach adding his own conceptions of how shakespeare presented human nature and experience 273one idea elaborating on his originally stated theme to which hazlitt returns several times—in macbeth 128a midsummer nights dream 236 henry iv 274 and elsewhere—is that shakespeare does not only create highly individual characters more than any other dramatist he creates characters that are of similar general types and yet as in real life differ in subtle ways shakespear was scarcely more remarkable for the force and marked contrasts of his characters than for the truth and subtlety with which he has distinguished those which approached the nearest to each other for instance the soul of othello is hardly more distinct from that of iago than that of desdemona is shewn to be from aemilias the ambition of macbeth is as distinct from the ambition of richard iii as it is from the meekness of duncan the real madness of lear is as different from the feigned madness of edgar as from the babbling of the fool  275in the classical view through at least dr johnson poetry holds a mirror up to nature 276 the romantics began to shift the focus to the role of the imagination 277 in common with his romantic contemporaries hazlitt focuses on how to communicate the meaning of the play shakespeares imagination 278 by the medium of poetry stimulates the readers or audiences imagination 279 several times hazlitt observes how shakespeare by this imaginative construction seemed to become each character in turn for example in antony and cleopatra he stops to observe the characters breathe move and live shakespear  becomes them and speaks and acts for them 280 and in henry iv he appears to have been all the characters and in all the situations he describes 281we as readers or audience appreciate the characters by the force of our imaginations seeming to participate in the scene as if we were present during such an event in real life commenting on the scene in julius caesar where caesar confides to marc antony his apprehensions about cassius hazlitt writes we know hardly any passage more expressive of the genius of shakespeare than this it is as if he had been actually present had known the different characters and what they thought of one another and had taken down what he heard and saw their looks words and gestures just as they happened 282 in hamlet he observes that the characters think and speak and act just as they might do if left entirely to themselves  the whole play is an exact transcript of what might be supposed to have taken place at the court of denmark  84in troilus and cressida by a comparison with chaucers method of depicting character he explains in detail how shakespeares idea of character is not fixed and shakespeare shows the characters not only by their own behaviour but as they view and react to one another 283 likewise shakespeares attention was not merely to habitual outward behaviour but to the most transitory fleeting inward impressions shakespear exhibited  not only what things are in themselves but whatever they might seem to be their different reflections their endless combinations 284at times shakespeares illumination of his characters inner life was so strong that hazlitt believed no stage presentation could do justice to shakespeares conception in lear he approvingly quotes his friend charles lambs argument that in general shakespeares plays are unsuited for the stage the thought crops up repeatedly that  the stage is not in general the best place to study our authors characters in 285 and elsewhere poetry and the stage do not agree well together 286 in such statements he approached the position of lamb to whom he dedicated characters of shakespears plays  who felt that no stage presentation could do justice to shakespearean drama that the artifice of the stage interposes a barrier between the authors conception and the audiences imagination 287 as critic john mahoney put it to both lamb and hazlitt the performance of shakespeare in a theatre must always be disappointing to an extent because the slightest departure from the vision conjured by the imagination is so immediately detected and so quickly a source of aesthetic displeasure 288certain plays in particular fall into the category of those unfitted for the stage for example a midsummer nights dream and hamlet particularly in the greatest tragedies this inner focus is so strong that hazlitt again advances beyond the idea of individual character to that of the logic of passion 103 —powerful emotions experienced interactively illuminating our common human nature this idea is developed in hazlitts accounts of king lear othello and macbeth 102at least partly explaining why both lamb and hazlitt felt the inadequacy of shakespearean stage performances was that the theatres themselves were huge and gaudy audiences were noisy and unmannerly 289 and dramatic presentations in the early nineteenth century were sensationalistic laden with artificial and showy props 290 in addition unless one sat down in the pit one could easily miss the subtleties of the actors facial and vocal expressions 291for all his insistence that justice could not be done to shakespeares plays on stage hazlitt frequently made exceptions a devoted playgoer from an early age and now a drama critic he relished many of the stage performances he had witnessed in some cases as with edmund kean to whom he refers frequently in this book usually with admiration and sarah siddons he could conceive of nothing grander than her performance as lady macbeth  292 their interpretations of roles in shakespearean drama left indelible impressions extending his ideas of the potential of the characters represented for example in romeo and juliet he proclaims perhaps one of the finest pieces of acting that ever was witnessed on the stage is mr keans manner of doing this scene when romeo is banished  he treads close indeed upon the genius of his author 293hazlitt throughout his book seems to waver between these two opinions—that frequently the actors offer the best interpretations of shakespeare and that no view of shakespeare on stage can match the rich experience of reading the plays—without acknowledging the apparent contradiction 8some plays he considered to be especially suitable for the stage such as the winters tale which he declares to be one of the bestacting of our authors plays 239 here he recalls some acting triumphs he had witnessed long ago mrs siddons played hermione and in the last scene acted the painted statue to the life—with true monumental dignity and noble passion mr kemble in leontes worked himself up into a very fine classical phrensy and bannister as autolycus roared as loud for pity as a sturdy beggar could do who felt none of the pain he counterfeited and was sound of wind and limb 294richard iii for hazlitt was another that was properly a stageplay and in that chapter criticise s it chiefly with a reference to the manner in which we have seen it performed 228 and then compares various actors interpretations of the character of king richard if mr kean does not entirely succeed in concentrating all the lines of the character as drawn by shakespear  he is more refined than cooke more bold varied and original than kemble in the same character 295edmund kean as hamlet hazlitt also objects to the way richard iii was frequently edited for the stage at that time to make room for  worse than needless additions from other plays often not by shakespeare many of the most striking passages in the real play have been omitted by the foppery and ignorance of the promptbook critics 296 viewing it as the stage presentation of a story he finds this play is damaged by these manipulations as in shakespeares original the arrangement and developement of the story and the mutual contrast and combination of the dramatis personae are in general as finely managed as the developement of the characters or the expression of the passions 297 he remarks on another kind of editing—what would soon become known as  bowdlerisation —in the treatment of a passage in romeo and juliet in which the frank speech of juliet alarmed the prudes of his day he quotes the passage commenting that we have no doubt that it has been expunged from the family shakespear 298story development and the business of the plot 45 are scrutinised in several chapters shakespear excelled in the openings of his plays that of macbeth is the most striking of any 119 commenting on the developement of the catastrophe in cymbeline he takes occasion to note that the contention of dr johnson that shakespear was generally inattentive to the windingup of his plots is so far from being true that in king lear romeo and juliet macbeth othello and hamlet among other plays of less moment  the last act is crowded with decisive events brought about by natural and striking means 45 hazlitt will frequently offer a brief sketch of the story 299 and stop to note particular excellences of shakespeares technique he thus finds the whole of the trial scene in the merchant of venice to be a masterpiece of dramatic skill 300occasionally hazlitt also discusses the plays from yet other perspectives shakespeares reliance on earlier source material comes into consideration in coriolanus 301 and alls well that ends well 302 in particular repeatedly hazlitt focuses on scenes as they were staged in the words of arthur eastman he reads the plays like a director quick to detect cues as to motion gesture costume 303 remarking on hazlitts theatrical sense eastman says that its not simply the physical that hazlitt has in mind—its the whole interrelationship of one person with another one mind with other minds—presences both physical and psychological upon a stage 273in line with schlegel more than with any previous englishlanguage critic except coleridge who also followed schlegel hazlitt found unity in shakespeares plays not in their observing the traditional classical unities of time place and action but in their unity of theme 304 his most complete elaboration of this idea is in his chapter on antony and cleopatra the jealous attention which has been paid to the unities both of time and place has taken away the principle of perspective in the drama and all the interest which objects derive from distance from contrast from privation from change of fortune from longcherished passion and contrasts our view of life from a strange and romantic dream long obscure and infinite into a smartly contested three hours inaugural disputation on its merits by the different candidates for theatrical applause 305in the discussion of macbeth it is macbeths unity of character that is significant 306 in many chapters he emphasises the dominant mood a unifying theme the character of the play as a whole 307 in again macbeth the entire play is done upon a stronger and more systematic principle of contrast than any other of shakespears plays 308 he notes that a certain tender gloom overspreads the whole of cymbeline 32 romeo and juliet shows the whole progress of human life in which one generation pushes another off the stage 217 reading a midsummer nights dream is like wandering in a grove by moonlight the descriptions breathe a sweetness like odours thrown from beds of flowers 309another earlier criticism of shakespeare that his writing was not moral was still alive in hazlitts day coleridge frequently emphasised the immorality of characters like falstaff to hazlitt this was entirely the wrong approach to take to morality in the medium of dramatic poetry 310 and he stops from time to time to comment on shakespeares morality in considering hamlet for example he declares that the character of hamlet should not be judged by ordinary moral rules the ethical delineations of shakespeare do not exhibit the drabcoloured quakerism of morality 311 in measure for measure he remarks that shakespeares morality is to be judged as that of nature itself he taught what he had learnt from her he shewed the greatest knowledge of humanity with the greatest fellowfeeling for it 203 shakespeares talent consisted in sympathy with human nature in all its shapes degrees depressions and elevations 202 and this attitude could be considered immoral only if one considers morality to be made up of antipathies 312scattered throughout the chapters are more general critical discussions such as that on tragedy in the essay othello comedy in twelfth night and the value for human life of poetry in general in lear among many others 313 along the way hazlitt intersperses lengthy quotations from the plays sharing with the reader poetic passages he thought particularly excellent this practice resembled the by then common practice of collecting long extracts from the plays as the beauties of shakespeare 299 hazlitt however also adds critical commentary though often far less extensive than would become the practice in later years 314 with the quotations illustrating particular points about the plays as well as sharing with his readers what he thought worthy of attention 314 all this done as no one had before made characters of shakespears plays the first handbook for the study and appreciation of all of shakespeares plays 315critical response  edit1817–1830 contemporary reception  editcharacters of shakespears plays was hazlitts most successful book as he had circulated advance copies before publication it was noticed favourably before it formally appeared on 9 july 1817 leigh hunt proclaimed enthusiastically that it is the least of all its praises to say that it must inevitably supersede the dogmatical and halfinformed criticisms of johnson 316francis jeffrey editor of the edinburgh review after publication not all of the reaction was this positive the tory british critic sniped that the book was stuffed with dull commonplace jacobin declamation 317 and the quarterly review with the same political bias rebuked hazlitt for his uncomplimentary portrayal of king henry viii 318 but for the most part the praise continued hunt in a fuller review in the examiner applauded not only the authors enthusiasm but the very striking susceptibility with which he changes his own humour and manner according to the nature of the play he comes upon like a spectator in a theatre who accompanies the turns of the actors face with his own 319 john hamilton reynolds reviewing it in the champion went so far as to claim that this is the only work ever written on shakespeare that can be deemed worthy of shakespeare 320the first edition sold out in six weeks it was only some months afterward that the voice of francis jeffrey the highly respected editor of the edinburgh review was heard jeffrey began by expressing reservations this is not a book of great learning and less a book of criticism than of appreciation and yet jeffrey concedes the appreciation is of the highest kind and he is not  much inclined to disagree with hazlitt after reading his eloquent exposition of the points he makes about shakespeare the book  is written less to tell the reader what mr h knows about shakespeare or his writings than to explain to them what he feels about them—and why he feels so—and thinks that all who profess to love poetry should feel so likewise while characters does not show extraordinary knowledge of shakespeares production it nevertheless shows very considerable originality and genius 321on 30 may 1818 a second edition appeared this time published by taylor and hessey at first this sold well at that time however literary criticism was subject to exceptionally strong political influences 322 in particular the most unscrupulous of the tory periodicals did not hesitate to indulge in barefaced lies to discredit adherents of what they considered unacceptable political views 323 hazlitt never reticent about criticising kings or government ministers soon became a target only a little more than a week had passed when the quarterly review delivered a diabolical notice of characters of shakespeares plays —possibly by its editor william gifford  324 it could have actually been by a certain john russell writing anonymously but hazlitt laid the blame on gifford who was responsible for the journals contents and may have encouraged russell 323 gifford or russell sliding from literary criticism into character assassination wrote we should not have condescended to notice the senseless and wicked sophistry of this writer  had we not considered him as one of the representatives of a class of men by whom literature is more than at any former period disgraced  it might not be unprofitable to show how small a portion of talent and literature was necessary for carrying on the trade of sedition hazlitt had dared to criticise the character of king henry viii the few specimens which we have selected of his ethics and his criticism are more than sufficient to prove that mr hazlitts knowledge of shakespeare and the english language is exactly on a par with the purity of his morals and the depth of his understanding 325sales completely dried up hazlitt got the chronology a bit wrong but was otherwise not exaggerating when he wrote in 1821 taylor and hessey told me that they had sold nearly two editions of the characters of shakespears plays in about three months but that after the quarterly review of them came out they never sold another copy 326william gifford editor of the quarterly review the attacks in the tory periodicals soon extended to other works by hazlitt killed not merely the sales of characters of shakespears plays but as far as much of the general public was concerned his reputation as a literary critic 3271830–1900 under a cloud  editthough the influence of hazlitts only fulllength treatment of shakespeare somewhat receded it did not completely die out hazlitts son and grandson brought out editions of hazlitts works later in the century his miscellaneous and familiar essays were read and hazlitt was commended as a stylist by a discerning few as a critic though he had passed out of the public eye an even more select few understood how high a place he deserved in the ranking of literary critics 328 william makepeace thackeray for example praised hazlitt in 1844 as one of the keenest and brightest critics that ever lived 329 another rare exception was the scottish journalist alexander ireland who in a brief memoir of hazlitt in 1889 wrote that hazlitts book on shakespeare although it professes to be dramatic criticism is in reality a discourse on the philosophy of life and human nature more suggestive than many approved treatises expressly devoted to that subject 330for the most part although hazlitt continued to be read and his influence was to a degree felt he was throughout most of the remainder of the nineteenth century infrequently cited as a critic 3311900–1950 reemergence  editaround the turn of the twentieth century the influence of characters began to be exerted more explicitly notably in the studies of critic a c bradley who approvingly adopted hazlitts explanation of the character of iago at about this time george saintsbury who wrote a comprehensive history of english criticism finished in 1904 recorded his extreme distaste for hazlitts character and as noted by critic elisabeth schneider found his writings filled with vast ignorance errors prejudice and an unpleasantness of temper amounting almost to insanity 332 yet he also ranked hazlitt high as a critic among the greatest in the language characters he placed lower than some of hazlitts other critical works yet he allowed that aside from such outbursts as his railing against the historical king henry v 333 and his overreliance on quotation from schlegel characters of shakespears plays is filled with much that is admirable notably hazlitts comparison of chaucers and shakespeares characterisation and his observation that shakespeare has no prejudices for or against his characters saintsbury found hazlitts critical judgements sound as a rule and he thought that the characterisations of falstaff and shylock were masterpieces 334even as the character critics began to fall out of favour and hazlitt who was lumped together with them was also pushed aside some influence remained hazlitts general approach to shakespeares plays in conveying the prevailing mood the character of the play itself had its influence on later twentiethcentury critics like g wilson knight 335 other major shakespeareans like john dover wilson would occasionally refer approvingly to one of hazlitts insights or notable passages such as the characterisation of falstaff 731950–1970 revaluation  edithazlitts shakespearean criticism continued to find some acceptance from then on yet a stigma still hung about his character and his criticism was often judged to be overly emotional and impressionistic this attitude changed only gradually 336 in 1955 rené wellek in his history of literary criticism in all western culture for the previous two centuries largely supported these earlier views characters to him centres excessively on shakespeares characters and worse hazlitt confuses fiction and reality and discusses fictional characters as though they were real people 337 yet he also notes a halfcentury after saintsbury and following schneiders lead that for all of hazlitts impressionism there is more theory in hazlitt than is generally realised 338 he also thought that hazlitt shows considerable psychological acumen in explaining certain types of characters such as iago and that hazlitts character sketch of iago is superior to coleridges 339 he also praises hazlitts freedom in characters and elsewhere from the defects which infected his nearest critical rivals johnson and coleridge chauvinism prudery and unctuous sermonising  he is free of the prudery which in his day pervaded english culture 340contemporaneously walter jackson bate a critic specialising in the english romantic period voiced his approval of hazlitts shakespearean criticism seen in the context of that of other romantics like coleridge  or  keats wrote bate hazlitt had the characteristic romantic delight in shakespeares ability to unveil character in a single passage or even a single line—in flashes of passion that offer a revelation as it were of the whole context of our being   341more attention soon came to hazlitts book lionel trilling was the first critic to recognise the importance of hazlitts radically new idea about poetry as expressed in his essay on coriolanus 342 herschel baker in 1962 noted that the best parts of hazlitts book such as the stirring essays on othello and macbeth  place hazlitt near the top of those who have written greatly on the greatest of all writers 343in 1968 arthur m eastman published a retrospective study of 350 years of shakespearean criticism at that time it still seemed necessary to apologise for including hazlitt among the major shakespearean critics of his age but in a short history of shakespearean criticism eastman finally concludes that although much of what hazlitt says about shakespeare is not original it is well enough said to find a place in the story 303before eastman finishes however he enumerates several things that hazlitt did formulate in an original manner besides such memorable expressions as it is we who are hamlet hazlitt like no critic before him was supremely attentive to the whole interrelationship of one person with another one mind with other minds—presences both physical and psychological upon a stage 273 with this focus on what hazlitt had to say about shakespeares stagecraft and the way his plays were acted eastman thus rescued him from the opprobrium of being associated in the most superficial way with the character critics differing from his contemporaries lamb and coleridge hazlitt  brings to shakespeare both a drama critics sense of the plays as theatre and a closet critics sense that the theatre of the mind so far surpasses that of the stage that certain of the plays can only be acted there 344eastman also points to hazlitts focus on the underlying unity of the plays hazlitt may not have done this as well as coleridge who eastman thought was better at suggesting avenues of approach for others to find unity in shakespeares plays yet the demonstrations of unity in cymbeline and othello and king lear make us see what otherwise we might not 345 eastman also rescues hazlitts political commentary which however abrasive it might be opens such questions for general discussion so that the politics of the plays enters into the arena of interpretation in a new and dignified way 346overall eastman concludes despite the books many shortcomings characters of shakespears plays was the best handbook of its century for the study of shakespeares plays 3471970–2000 revival  editit remained for john kinnaird in his 1978 fulllength study of hazlitt as thinker and critic to reconcile hazlitt as character critic with hazlitt as drama critic hazlitt was a character critic to an extent but he was also a dramatic critic who paid attention to staging and dramatic form 348 and even his character criticism transcended the focus on individual characters to create a larger study of the ways of dramatic imagination  148 in the course of his study of shakespeare hazlitt as kinnaird points out also shows how it is shakespeares art that enables him to represent nature dismissing the older critical view that shakespeare was a child of nature but deficient in art 148othello and iago kinnaird further delves into the ideas in characters of shakespears plays especially that of power as involved in shakespeares plays and as investigated by hazlitt not only the power in physical force but the power of imagination in sympathising with physical force which at times can overcome our will to the good he explores hazlitts accounts of shakespeares tragedies— macbeth hamlet othello king lear and especially coriolanus —where he shows that hazlitt reveals that our love of power in sympathising with what can involve evil can overcome the human desire for the good this kinnaird points out has serious implications in considering the meaning and purpose of tragic literature in general 349along the way kinnaird notes the influence of characters on later shakespearean criticism including that of a c bradley 164 g wilson knight 350 and c l barber 351hazlitt concludes kinnaird was too often misunderstood and dismissed as no more than a character critic but his contribution to shakespeare studies was much broader and deeper than that and despite problems with some of hazlitts own theories 352 characters of shakespears plays was a seminal work 28by this time a revival of interest in hazlitt was well under way only a few years later in 1983 in his study of hazlitt as critic david bromwich considers at length some issues involving characters of shakespears plays against some allegations to the contrary in earlier studies of hazlitt bromwich concludes that hazlitt borrowed little from coleridge 353 and he presents several contrasts in their critical views particularly about shakespeare as evidence in extended discussions of hazlitts critical treatment of the character of iago in othello 354 of shylock in the merchant of venice 355 of caliban in the tempest 356 of hamlet 88 and at great length of coriolanus 357 he uses the contrast between coleridges criticism and hazlitts to highlight the essential originality of hazlitts critical stance and he observes that hazlitts views frequently provide a bracing alternative to coleridges 91 he also delves into the issue of hazlitts influence on keats partly by means of characters particularly the chapter on king lear 358 and he finds in hazlitts comments on lear interesting contrasts and similarities with the critical views of wordsworth and shelley 113 building upon the arguments advanced by kinnaird bromwich further challenges the reductive notion that characters was simply a work of character criticism 3592000 and afterward  editsustained by the accelerated revival of interest in hazlitt toward the close of the twentieth century the legacy of characters of shakespears plays has been valued increasingly as well in 1994 harold bloom in voicing his appreciation of hazlitts accounts of coriolanus and of edmund in king lear ranked hazlitt second only to dr johnson as an englishlanguage literary critic 360 he echoed and reinforced that assessment in his 2008 edition of othello 361 other new editions of shakespeare also look back to hazlitts interpretations of his plays 362 in 2000 jonathan arac in the cambridge history of literary criticism placed hazlitt with schlegel and coleridge as distinguished shakespearean critics of their age and noted his study of shakespeare as one of the landmarks that still serve as points of departure for fresh thinking nearly two centuries later 363 in 2006 with hazlitts full reinstatement as a major shakespearean critic philosopher colin mc ginn based an entire book about shakespeares plays on hazlitts idea that shakespeare was a philosophical poet 364notes  edit jones 1989 pp 133–34 maclean 1944 p 300 wardle 1971 p 142 jones 1989 p 134 see a view of the english stage in hazlitt 1930 vol 5 pp 179–90 200–24 maclean 1944 pp
