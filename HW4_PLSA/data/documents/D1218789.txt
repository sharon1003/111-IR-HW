answer the best answers are voted up and rise to the top do waste water pipes for kitchens and bathrooms require a minimum slope to avoid cloggingup vote4down votefavorite when i had a dishwasher installed the plumber refused to install the waste water pipe horizontally saying that this would get it to clog all the time he left a roughly 110 slope on it i thought it made sense now i find that the drain pipes that my sink and bath are connected to and which clog up all the time are lying on the floor completely horizontally for a length of at least 15 meters they are 4cm diameter pvc pipes is this a bad installation and do you think this is why it keeps clogging up are there legal requirements in the uk for the drain pipes to be sloped so i could get my landlord to fix theseplumbing

here are supposed to have 25 fall in most circumstances and 1 inch thats really small drain for a bath and sink should be at least 50 65mm 2 14 – unecs may 6 12 at 2124unecs my bad went in with a tape measure the actual diameter is 40mm this is the single pipe that drains the bathshower two sinks a dishwasher and a washing machine still a bit thin – roman st may 7 12 at 015yes i would say so even at one in ten but at only 15 long you could get away with it i would recommend 50mm min if you had to and of course it will need a slope especially with a kitchen sink and wm  greasefood scraps and hair having to small a pipe with a large load on it will suck your water seals out of your traps also – unecs may 7 12 at 0194cm is about right for a single fixtures drain for stacks i would recommend a bit more like 253 and the main sanitary line should be 34 – keith s may 7 12 at 1922add a comment1 answer active oldest votesup vote4down voteaccepted i am not in the uk but my city uses the international plumbing code everything needs to have the required slope the required slope depends on the size of the pipe ipc table 7041 shows that a pipe with an id interior diameter of 25 or less needs 14 per foot while a pipe that is 3 to 6 only needs 18 per footshare improve this answeredited may 7 12 at 130answered may 6 12 at 2314auujay4234 12 29 50found 10cm deep blockage at a 90° bend  was pretty disgusting it seems that 90° bends are not recommended by plumbers the blockage would explain why also theres no air vent anywhere at all  i guess that would explain the constant glugging overall must be a really terrible installation here – roman st may 7 12 at 10281true standard 90s are often avoided in drain lines for this very reason instead you can either use a long sweep 90 or two 45s this arrangement will flow better than a standard 90 and not clog as frequently – auujay may 7 12 at 14241as for the vent there must be a vent stack within 5 feet of a 25 line the vent does two things first it provides a ready escape for sewer gases and second it provides for the free flow of air behind the water which speeds draining without a vent or with a vent improperly placed some water will enter the pipe creating a vacuum which must be broken by air bubbling up into the stack from downstream similar to upending a bottle of water glugglugglug – keith s may 7 12 at 1929add a
