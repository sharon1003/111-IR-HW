what to do if you fail your essay assignment exam or dissertation one of the most difficult experiences for students in the uk is the receipt of a failing mark usually anything marked 39 or below is a fail it is important to understand that there are many reasons why this can happen to students and there are usually several options to change the failing mark whether you fail an exam coursework or even the dissertation itself you have options available so it’s not necessarily the end of the worldcommon reasons for failure students fail elements of their degree for a number of reasons the most common issues are not attending lectures not keeping up with course reading confusion or lack of understanding of course content and personal problems that distract students how to avoid failure before it happens with all of the problems noted above students can usually avoid failing simply by taking preemptive action before the problem spirals out of control there are several steps to take to ensure that small issues don’t become potential failures talk to your academic tutor this is a member of faculty assigned to you at the beginning of your degree programme who you meet with regularly to discuss your progress you can contact this person at any time and they can advise you on how to address any challenges you are facing don’t wait until problems become large it is always best to be aware that a small issue can quickly become a crisis if you neglect to address it for example if you are struggling to understand the course material one week you will be unlikely to follow along as the course progresses it is far better to consult with your lecturer early to avoid falling seriously behind later file for ‘extenuating circumstances’ most uk universities understand that students will sometimes face unavoidable difficulties due to prolonged sickness family problems or financial issues if you experience one of these problems you can file an ‘extenuating circumstances’ form which formally notifies the university about your problem your academic tutor will sign this form and together you will construct a plan to catch up on any missed coursework or exams and you will possibly be granted extensions to normal coursework deadlines reassessment opportunities if the worst happens and you do receive a failing mark you have several options first you need to understand whether you have failed an element of a module the entire module or the dissertation failed module element if you’ve failed one piece of coursework or an exam it may not be necessary to resubmit that element if your marks for other module elements are high enough that your averaged course mark is 40 or above you will pass the module overall regardless of the one failure in other words if you receive a mark of 35 on an essay that counts for 40 of your module mark you can still pass the module if you receive an average mark of 45 on the remaining 60 of the module assessment however you may wish to resubmit anyway in order to achieve a higher overall degree average the opportunities to allow this vary among universities so check the regulations at your own institution failed module if you fail an entire module you are usually required to resit the assessments either by resubmitting the coursework or in some cases by resitting an exam the form of the assessment will be decided according to the existing module guidelines university regulations and the decisions of the lecturer and board of examiners the resulting mark is usually capped at a bare pass level which is typically in the 4050 range failed dissertation if you fail a dissertation you will usually be given an opportunity to resubmit it by an agreedupon date as with a module failure the marks awarded for a resubmitted dissertation will usually be capped at a bare pass level it is worth noting that a complete failure of a dissertation is rare at uk universities and typically occurs only if a student has neglected to meet with their supervisor at regular intervals or neglected to submit drafts in advance of the final submission a note on plagiarism although university regulations usually allow a student to resit exams and assessments as described above there are special procedures in place in cases of failure due to plagiarism if a student is found to have copied work from another source or used the ideas of others without citing their sources appropriately they may receive a failing mark in serious cases the matter can be referred to a university ethics board that will have the authority to take a range of measures against the student in many cases students found guilty of plagiarising will not be provided an opportunity to improve their marks though they could potentially appeal the decision in short don’t do itappeal procedures in addition to resubmitting assessment elements you may have grounds appeal the marks awarded to you this can happen if your university has neglected to take your extenuating circumstances into account or if you were unfairly disadvantaged in any way each university has its own procedures for student academic appeals and in general it requires a somewhat lengthy process you must be certain to file the appropriate forms before the deadlines and fully document the reasons you feel justified in appealing your marks your case will be considered by a university exam board and if you are successful you will be offered options for resitting or resubmitting work without restrictions on the potential marks you can earn full details of your university’s appeal procedures will be given to you at the start of your degree programme while every student hopes to avoid failing or even coming close to failing sometimes the unthinkable does happen and a failing mark results these situations can seem terribly disheartening for students but it is important to remember that universities do offer second chances for genuinely honest and
