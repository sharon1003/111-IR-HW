so long citrus a look at air tran’s history and final flight experience by jl johnson06 jan2015an air tran boeing 717 lands in atlanta on december 28 2014 air tran flight 1 departed atlanta for tampa retracing the airline’s first flight and bringing an end to its remarkable history i had the honor of being on that last flight and i am excited to share my story but before i discuss the end of “the big little a” i’d like to first revisit the airline’s history because only through knowledge of the airline’s legacy can we truly understand the significance of air tran’s retirement and integration into southwest airlines so sit back relax and enjoy a valu jet dc9 – photo courtesy of aero icarus valu jet fun and friendly… and perhaps a bit dangerous air tran traces its roots back to valu jet an atlantabased upstart with dreams of chipping away at delta’s dominance right in its own backyard operations commenced with just a single dc9 and its first flight was from atlanta to tampa on october 26 1993 in just over a year the airline was solidly profitable and its route map had grown to 17 cities but fast growth and aggressive costcutting practices quickly caught up to the critter valu jet’s faa call sign in the first few years of operation the small airline had a markedlyhigh percentage of emergency landings compared to its peers in addition an faa study indicated that valu jet dominated the accident data for lowcost carriers on may 11 1996 valu jet flight 592 went down enroute from miami to atlanta all 110 on board were lost this tragic highprofile accident would focus attention on the airline its maintenance practices and ultimately lead to its grounding after a month of investigations by the faa which reveled “ serious deficiencies in its operation ” valu jet would voluntarily halt operations but this wasn’t the end for the fledgling airline that had lost its way instead it was just the beginning an air tran 717 seen departing raleighdurham international airport air tran it’s something else… really valu jet never recovered from the stigma left by flight 592 so the airline sought a new brand to compliment its renewed commitment to maintenance and safety that new brand already existed as a much smaller floridabased regional airline named air tran in september of 1997 the overhauled valu jet renamed itself air tran and announced an order for 50 md95s which would later be renamed the boeing 717 as md was folded in to boeing with options for 50 more later that year valu jet’s buyout of floridabased air tran airways would close in january of 1999 air tran would receive a new senior leadership team comprised of industry veterans joe leonard of eastern air lines and robert fornaro of us airways in the following years it became clear that from the ashes of valu jet rose a phoenix an airline stronger safer and more respected than its predecessor in march of 2000 air tran received the faa’s diamond award the agency’s highest maintenance certification in the years between air tran’s transformation and the buyout by southwest the airline had few incidents none of which resulted in casualties an air tran 737700 on approach for san antonio airport your airline has arrived… acquisition by southwest in september of 2010 southwest airlines announced they would acquire all outstanding shares of air tran’s parent company and closed the purchase eight months later with a final purchase price of 14 billion in the following years southwest would orchestrate one of the smoothest airline integrations in history rather than attempt to join the two companies through a “best of each” approach which looks great on paper but rarely goes well see unitedcontinental they would methodically replace air tran planes crews and routes with their own legacy air tran 737s would be reconfigured and rebranded and legacy air tran crew retrained and in most cases given a more generous compensation package air tran’s boeing 717s would head to delta on lease from southwest bonus photos delta begins receiving air tran’s boeing 717s paying special attention to the hazards mergers pose with culture southwest launched its “one luv” initiative to introduce employees of each airline to the other and welcome the air tran family into southwest over the next three years southwest would wind down the company leading up to the final day of revenue operations for air tran 12282014 a very excited and lively cabin of av geeks head to atlanta on n717jlfinal day of air tran operations sunday december 28th was a long day it began with a southwest flight to milwaukee to meet with various operations crew from the combined airline prior to catching the last air tran flight out of milwaukee down to atlanta in interacting with the employees some legacy air tran others legacy southwest it was clear that the cultures of the two airlines complimented one another well and by now had had a chance to integrate after a quick tour of milwaukee’s operations more on that later we boarded n717jl a 717 dedicated to joe leonard and hopped down to atlanta where the party was already underway standing room only literally in atlanta upon exiting the plane i entered an atlanta i’d never seen before music was blaring beverages flowing people dancing hugging and kissing the mood was incredibly upbeat gary kelly ceo of southwest airlines as well as bob jordan president of air tran airways freely walked about the terminal shaking hands and posing with any and all who wanted selfies you know i got one with gary you cannot have a party without a cake an air tran 737 cake in atlanta the celebration focused intensely not on the end of air tran but the beginning of a fully integrated southwest and it seemed all in attendance were fully on board boarding the final air tran flight with a hand shake from gary kelly – photo ben bearup after a quick 90 minutes on the ground in atlanta it was time to reboard n717jl and fly to tampa on air tran’s final flight the party was so loud in a good way and the terminal so crowded that i missed the boarding call it took some time to navigate my way to the gate and by the time i’d arrived they were boarding group 6 i was in group 1 the plane was nearly empty once i made it on board so it was clear i wasn’t alone in missing the call to action southwest knows how to throw a party perhaps too good of a party air tran’s chief pilot floy ponder a 19year veteran of the company in the left seat upon boarding i couldn’t help but stick my nose in the flight deck air tran’s final flight was piloted by floy ponder the company’s chief pilot who has 19 years tenure with air tran final flight goodies i was surprised and excited to see that during the layover each seat was adorned with final flight gifts to include a southwest heart magnet air tran model and 100 southwest gift check passengers slowly fill up air tran flight 1each of the 117 seats on the plane would ultimately fill and at last check there were over 700 standby passengers likely not in an attempt to get a seat but to obtain a security document to join the party at the end of c concourse a former air tran pilot boards to bid farewell to the big little a i would soon find out that the majority of passengers on fight 1 were current and former employees of air tran anxious to be a part of history and send air tran off into the sunset the plane was pushed back from atlanta’s c concourse and received a double water cannon salute as well as an escort to the runway threshold once in the air the champagne flowed freely it was great to hear all of the current and former employees reminisce about the earlier years one theme rang true they’d been through so much and were so incredibly proud of the airline they had built now more than ever i saw the clear correlation between the two airlines’ cultures av geek apparel award for the evening went to the lady wearing a sweet retro valu jet jacket photo jl johnson most albeit not all were happy with the merger “bittersweet” was a common answer when asked for their opinions i’ve been through my fair share of mergers so i can absolutely understand how there could be some residual dissatisfaction after all of the work the employees invested in air tran’s incredible turnaround i can sympathize with those saddened to see the airline in its entirety destined for the history books but from a business perspective a clean break truly is best for integration else “us vs them” mentality edges into culture one passenger a former air tran pilot who sat in my area was particularly vocal about his opposition to the integration he ultimately protested by taking his services to a competing airline which was likely a great move for him as well as the then newly merged company in my experience negativity only festers personally and can sometimes spread it’s an unfortunate fact that postmerger companies aren’t for everyone and it takes a strong employee to recognize the need to be successful elsewhere bob jordan air tran’s president said a number of times over the course of the evening “today is not about celebrating the end of air tran it’s about two great companies coming together and moving forward as one”air tran flight 1 crew gives one last goodbye to passengers as they deplane what felt like the quickest flight ever ended in tampa with the pilot announcing “ladies and gentleman welcome to tampa and the end of an era” we quickly taxied to the final gate an air tran revenue flight would approach and with that it truly was the end of an era n717jl rests at tampa’s gate c44conclusion as a southwest fan and avid av geek it was a sincere honor to have had the opportunity to experience this important part of airline history as it unfolded i never had much of an opinion of air tran one way or the other but after spending the day with air tran’s people i became a fan i am confident the nowunified southwest will go on to do great things but a little part of me will miss what everyone so affectionately referred to as “the big little a”please share your air tran experiences good or bad in the comments go there’s nothing stopping you disclosure a portion of my
