active oldest votesup vote24down voteaccepted codes and other guides provide nominal mix combinations that perform fairly in general conditions in general a 12 mix will give better strength than a 13 mix but it is quite possible that a 105 mix might perform worse strength comes from interparticle force transfer between sand grains and also from shear resistance provided by cement acting as adhesive thus codes provide known balanced combinations that are satisfactory to gain complete control over the properties of a mortarconcrete mix you must consider the following criteria cement amount as a thumb rule increasing the cement increases the strength beyond a certain point it also acts negatively since major force transfer in a concretemortar matrix is from sandsand interaction excess cement will turn the mortar very brittle since cement particles cannot transfer normal contact force  they are good at providing shear strength since cement is expensive in lowstrength applications like roads the amount of cement is less to optimize on the cost water amount generally water content ranging from 20  35 ww cement is considering a safe operable range lower water content gives low strength and less manoeuvrable mix for flat conditions like road laying higher water content is generally used in specific conditions like laying out pile using tremie  where the free flowing nature of mix is necessary although highwater also leads to lower strength there are other workarounds mentioned ahead sand amount a very high amount of sand will make your mix very brittle and weak against all kinds of forces for m20 m25 etc general proportion is 13 however for highstrength mix m35 its better to go with 12 and somewhere about that aggregate amount aggregates have two reasons to be there  economy and strength they are cheap and provide as a good filler very high and very low amounts of aggregate give poor strength but a varied economic solution a moderate amount is good enough aggregate shape generally increasing crookedness of the aggregate particle gives increasing strength as it gives a higher contact area and better interlock capabilities air entrainment a high aircontent in the mix leads to lower strength thats why highstrength concrete is vibrated before laying to expel the small airpockets a low air content gives low manoeuvrability so sometimes airentrainers chemical additives are used to give the desired flowing nature without compromising on changing the water content and consequently the strength additives physical additives like finesilicapowder flyash allow cement reduction and provide economy finesilica is  very fine so it goes into the smallest of voids and provides good contact strength by reducing the air content flyash comes as a general replacement for cement it is a byproduct from thermal power stations and is very cheap upto 15 cement can be replaced by finesilica and upto 40 by flyash chemical additives like superplasticizers do provide a effective workability increase or even a water reduction at similar workability  thus giving a higher strength mixshare improve this answeranswered may 31 11 at

mixtures of portland cement water and aggregates  sand and in the case of concrete gravel concrete is used for structural purposes and its primary role is to support a load the ideal concrete is a solid monolithic block of rock with no cement at all obviously this is not very workable the next best thing is a mix that is mostly aggregate finely graded to include all sizes from dust to boulders so that the amount of cement required to glue it together is minimized the less cement the stronger the concrete provided that there is enough cement to hold it together mortar is semistructural its there to glue bricks together but must be able to support the load over thin layers it is primarily coarse sand held together with portland cement it is sandvssand forces that give the mortar its strength so i would be reluctant to reduce the sand quantity in the mix grouts and thinsets are nonstructural in that they are not required to support any real weight they are used in tiling to prevent lateral movement or to level a structural member ie subfloors they are primarily fine sands and portland cement now we need to consider the cement itself the wc watercement ratio is the single most significant factor in the final strength of the cured cement the less water you put in the stronger the final product again to a certain minimum point so this would tell us that for a good cement we want a relatively dry mix wrong there are two other factors another workability and curing workability this is the ease of pouring shaping smoothing of the mortar obviously you want a mortar to be somewhat stiffer than a concrete as concrete is poured and mortar is spread it has to be able to stand up on its own but if you make it too stiff you cant work it at all the solution is to add more water for structural members there are adjuncts called superplasticizers which work to improve workability without altering the wc ratio but they are not usefulcost effective in a mortar this is also why i would not consider increasing the amount of sand  youll lose workability curing cement never stops curing however we consider 28 days to be a full cure in which the cement reaches its nominal strength curing is the process by which the cement particles bind to available water particles and hardens this means that water must be present for the full 28 days once the original mix has set we now must keep the surface moist youll see structural pads covered with plastic  thats to reduce evaporation youll also see water trucks spraying down freshly poured pads to keep them wet high quality precast is often steam cured at the factory however in the case of a mortar our exposed surface is small and vertical making it difficult to add the required water after the fact so we must include the excess water in the mix of course this reduces the strength from the wc ratio but increases the strength due to the cure as you can see this is actually a very complex science with many factors to consider the upshot is that you or i shouldnt be messing with recommended mixes without a really good reason  we dont have the experience or the knowledge to understand the consequences  industry has determined that the default mixes are the best generalpurpose compromise to the many conflicting factorsshare improve this answeredited may 30 11 at 1614answered may 30 11 at 1359chris cudmore115k 6

expert here there must be an optimal solution to such a problem what mix will last as long as possible hold strongly to the stone that surrounds it be strong in compression etc effectively this is a multiple criterion optimization problem that was long ago solved by practice to find the mix that best satisfies all the goals in combination in fact though if you go a wee bit in one direction you will find that some of those goals will be better achieved while the other goals will be harmed this is how such a problem behaves so the question now becomes suppose i add some more sand or other aggregate to the mix what will happen very likely and again i am just guessing at the exact effects right now as i talk off the cuff the mix will become stronger in compression but at some point it will erode more easily get less sticky of course at some point add too much sand and all you have is a pile of sand which has none of the properties of mortar that you want similarly suppose i increase the proportion of cement it makes sense that it sticks better to the surrounding stone now but it is not as strong in compression adding more water to the mix has other consequences also optimized at the level you have been advised so if you add water the mix gets wetter easier to work stickier but also sloppier it wont stay in place it may also change the cure time my point is that all of these parameters have been chosen to be optimal for the group of characteristics that define what mortar is and what it should do  the physical properties of the mortar in fact those parameters have been optimized by simple experiments by masons for years until they established a mix that reasonably satisfies the best values at a point that is robust and stable to material variations having said all of this now ill do a little actual research on the subject for example this site tells me that the ratio of sand and cement can be somewhere in the range of 12 up to 13 which changes the strength of the mix in terms of its ability to withstand compressive loads it also mentions that adding gravel to the mix will increase the strength as i do more reading i also see that the quality of the cement is a factor with cheap stuff you need more cement so this probably is defined by the composition of the cement itself is there lime in the mix how much ill stop here as there are many factors involved what kind of sand do you use sand that is composed of perfectly round spheres all of the same size will be easily workable but it wont be very strong sand that is sharp fractured with many sharp edges with varying particle size will be less easy to mix less easy to work but stronger in terms of cured material properties a mix of aggregate sizes will change things too very fine sand will require more cement in the mix as the tiny particles have more surface area for the given volume so more cement is needed to coat the sand for good adhesion but fine sand is easier to mix easier to work easier to stuff into a place if the surface it must attach too is very irregular it may stick better but adding larger aggregate to a mix will increase the compressive strength since large stone is stronger at some point this turns the mortar into concrete here is a quote that i find on one sitemortar is a cementsandwater and usually lime mixture designed for laying up masonry units like cement block stone or brick mortar is sticky so it adheres to the block stone or brick concrete is designed to stand alone while i am sure i have not covered all of the factors here this should give you an idea there are very many parameters involved it is not only the amount of cement and sand that is important but the exact cement formulation the type of sand the amount of watershare

think about if mortar is too hard it will not flex and therefore will tend to crack more so separate from the bricks if the mortar is harder than the brick then the mortar will wear down slower than the brick in rainwind other along timer with will leave the mortar sticking out that then collects water and weakens the bricks harder render also lets less water vapour pass so may stopslow building

practicing stone mason for fourty years and i have seen the long term affect of the 13 mix compared to the 12 mix with proper preparation from the base under the footing and throughout the build i recommend the 12 mix particularly with flagstone and surfaces that are going to experience a lot of weather my experience is almost exclusively in stone though and i can see where using the softer mix with brick and block might be more beneficial to avoid cracks in the brick or block i will say that i have built retainer walls and flagstone structures using the 12 ratio over 30 years ago that have no cracks in them to this day 012616 the 12 ratio seems to hold up to water much better than the 13 one more note the freeze  thaw cycle is a major enemy to all masonry work and water intrusion can be
