courtesy of freemantle media australia with every season of foxtel’s wentworth comes higher stakes grittier drama and captivating new characters especially ones who wear boots leather and jackets to die for oh and did we mention the new season also brings a little sexual tension between therapist and patient aka our beloved inmate francesca “franky” doyle okay there are a lot of other amazing things going on in h block but most notably is the season 3 addition of libby tanner ’s compassionate yet hardass character bridget westfall bridget who goes above and beyond for the ladies of the prison might go a tad bit further for nicole da silva ’s character on the show we won’t get too much into the relationship between these two although there are some spoilers in this interview so reader beware but i can say that season 3 will blow… your… mind in more than one way– probably several very unforgiving ways tanner who is one of australia’s most popular actors has made a lasting impression on not only the fans back home with her long list of credits but amongst the deviant tumblr trolling american viewers as well team tanner for life the show which follows a group of women and some hunky corrections officers and their grippingly dark drama while behind bars is the one show you’re not going to want to miss this summer tanner’s portrayal of the prisons new forensic psychiatrist is intriguing compelling and an all around entertaining performance the chemistry between her and the rest of the cast is unmatched to many long running programs currently airing in america man those aussie’s sure know how to make some damn good tvtanner was kind enough to chat with me at length from her home in australia about her characters huge arc this season regarding the governor’s  pamela rabe misconduct and bridget’s budding and borderline unethical romance with one of the inmates we laughed… a lot and shared stories about the impact the show has had around the world so without further ado…mckenzie morrell let’s talk about bridget westfall can you tell us about the character you play on wentworth and what drew you to that role libby tanner she’s a forensic psychologist and i was very excited to audition for her because she enables the inmates to go to a truthful place she kind of facilitates their own stories and their truths to come out so it’s a lovely connection that she has with the prisoners and it’s all a bit rough and tumble script and play and it’s quite interesting to take these characters to a place where they can connect so i think that’s was what was fascinating to me and also i didn’t have to wear teal laughsmm laughs rightlt no they’re very glamorous with bridget i thought they did a very good job dressing me mm oh definitely now is it true that you kind of went in for another role in season one i know that a fan had posted something on twitter asking that question if they had wanted you to be involved earlier in the series is that true or not lt yeah that’s true there was an interview along the way it was misquoted though i didn’t say that i turned it down because i didn’t get it laughs i did go for another part earlier on but i missed out but it was fortunately that i missed out because my baby girl was only six weeks old so it would’ve been pretty tough it’s really good timing now because she is three years old now and running around and it’s a lot easier i have some family support so i can go off and work when it comes along mm right i think it worked out how it was supposed to anyways we’re happy to have you on season 3 wentworth is super hot right now especially in the united states are you surprised that the show has gotten so much global traction lt i’m happily surprised happy for a little ozzie show laughs much smaller budget than an american show which can make such an impact i have seen the other one orange is the new black and they’re two very very different looks and different shows i think that wentworth has a sophistication about it and i’m very proud of it mm definitely was it difficult coming into an already established show and cast did you have any concerns about the fans receptiveness to your character or anything like that lt no no the executive producer jo porter and i go back twenty years so i’ve played a lesbian for her laughs on a show called pacific drive twenty years ago and so you come back to a show you’re pretty much back in the family because you know half the crew i knew half the actors from all saints there are a few women that i haven’t worked with but look it’s an intense set because it’s all women and that’s a different thing altogether a lot of flying estrogen laughsmm laughs a lot more cat fights lt laughs you kind of got to sit next to the blokes in the crew at lunch time you know to kind of balance it all out no it’s absolutely fine i’ve belonged to a few shows two or three seasons down the track and i’ve never had a problem with it that’s what we do you take the work when you get it and you run with it but i really do appreciate the camaraderie and the depth of the cast when you do start off on a show together it’s really special too mm i totally agree your character was sort of the new kid on the block as well she was appointed by the board and starts to grow concerned obviously about the misconduct going on inside the prison with that said were you shocked to see ferguson’s downfall at the end of season 3 lt the character… i don’t think bridget was shocked i think bridget picked ferguson for who she was in the very first scene that we played together she says something like “i’m a wake up for these people whether they think they…” i can’t remember the line now but it was in the first scene we’re walking down the crosswalk together and she gives it to her and she says “you can’t fool me i can see through you you’ll never do my job” so she’s a pretty tough character laughs she’s really gutsy and she actually said that she was a bit of a psychopath in the beginning she just needs to be clear enough to play her game to catch her out and poor old vera  kate atkinson she just wanted her dream to come true and work under this difficult woman and get the kudos for it but i think throughout the season she realizes that bridget’s got something to say and starts to understand where she’s coming from she’s an amazing character played by pamela rabe an incredible actress and so professional probably the easiest to work with on set mm that’s awesome that character is one of the ones where you love to hate her and hate to love her i think she just brings that duality to it and it was really great to see that unfold throughout the season for sure lt she’s a thrill to work with before we shot some of those scenes where she’s glaring at me i’d say “oh pam you’re scaring the hell out of me” and then she’d wink at me and she’d say “let’s do it” laughs she’s a gorgeous gorgeous lady yeah i’ve seen her on stage quite a few times and i’m a great fan of her work wow what a presence she has and that intimacy you know that experience of what you’re putting on stage is really something else mm wow that’s great to hear it sounds like you all get along pretty swimmingly related the fosters star hayden byerly talks jonnor being a role model and groundbreaking storylines lt yeah oh yeah we’re like a little back shed compared to america our industry so we all celebrate “woo hoo look at this taking off all around the world” i’m getting fan mail from all over i can’t believe it you know places that i’ve never even dreamed of going to or know about it’s such an awakening it’s been fun it’s a great ride mm that’s awesome do you guys ever talk about it like did the creator know that that was going to happen it really has taken off over here all my friends are asking if i watch and i’m like “i’ve been watching it where have you been ” i think that it’s so amazing to break in over here because we like our drama lt yes we had an idea that it might take off because prisoner was such an iconic show and it was so well received when i was ten years old trying to watch it i’ll never forget my mum saying “libby get away from the tv you’re too young to watch that” we were all into it funnily enough i remember being on set and thinking my mum passed away nine years ago but i just got the giggles and i looked up and thought “what are you gonna do about it now mum” laughs so we all loved prisoner and we knew that it had such a wide fan base and it was a good bet and it paid off for the producers as you can imagine and it’s globally so hallelujah it’s a good feelingmm well people cannot get enough of it more seasons we need more and more seasonslt what episode are you up to mm i actually am done with season three so i’m waiting for season four i’m technically on australian time but we will just keep that between us until it comes out in america laughslt yes yes so it has been released in america now hasn’t it mm season three has not yet i know that it’s been released in canada on netflix but not in the u s but i definitely need to know what’s going on if i’m going to be talking to you lovely people so…lt yeah you’re ahead of the game laughs you spoke to nicole da silva and socratis otto i believe as well mm yes i did they were wonderful you guys are just a great group of people i’m just going down the line and sharing you all with everyone in the united states i want everyone to know about yoult very cool mc kenzie that’s great i’m so happy you’re excited about it and you’ve spoken to some of us it’s great suns out and it feels like it’s gonna be a good daycourtesy of freemantle media australia mm everybody just took to your character and they were definitely rooting for that slow burn of a relationship between her and franky how important do you think it was for the character to stay objective and not cross the line before franky was released from prison lt she waited for as long as she could but she definitely thought franky was pretty special she said that to her i think it was in episode nine and she’s talking about feelings developing and bridget goes “i wasn’t talking about you franky i was talking about me” there was so much honesty about who they are and their standing and what they can do in that relationship which at the time was nothing and she does the right thing and she’s setting it up that slow burn is a lovely set up she’s going to do whatever she can to make sure that she’s okay and get her out of prison… and love her up laughs and she wants to see her happy and succeed and she takes the right route to do that it’s very interesting mm the relationship between your character and nicole’s really came full circle i loved the parallels of talking about being picked up by a hot girl in a hot car and then it actually happening  laughslt it is cool the writing is lovely i’ve really enjoyed working with her because of that particular thing where she loses it and regresses back to a little girl and she knows that she’s safe with bridget she takes her there she takes her to that place in that room where she can be herself and i don’t think she’s ever been able to trust somebody like that they found that together and bridget recognized that in franky that spirit that she has in herself and that determination and that honesty she’s just going to go for gold and she wants to go there with her mm now since we’re on the topic of nicole… if you could describe your costar with only one word what would it be lt oh… what would it be that’s a tricky one she’s pretty fearless how about that mm i think that’s a perfect word to describe her lt yeah she’s fearless she definitely goes there and doesn’t hold back and that’s what any actor would really like to work with so it’s terrific mm she definitely super talented now if you could swap places with any other character on the show who would it be lt wow i’d have to with the governor wouldn’t i laughs i don’t think i’d want to be one of the moles in that dirty muddy water down there i’d have to go with the governor’s office for sure she has that sensibility mm my friend and i go back and forth because she’s a big governor fan and i’m like “no” we were unsure of the franky situation and if she was going to live or not and what was going to happen to her we were going and back and forth rooting for both of them but that’s not going to work somebody’s got to fall lt i can’t believe how well received it is and how people have really taken to these characters people are asking me “when is the next season we can’t wait” men and women you know mm oh it is it’s crazy i like to introduce little snippets and slip it into conversation for people who haven’t seen it yet and my friend starting watching wentworth and then her boyfriend started to watch it because of her one day she came out of the shower and he was continuing the season on netflix without her because he loved the show so much i think it’s awesome that it’s universal and male or female everybody digs it we definitely need some more seasons over here lt yeah i wonder how far it will go and how long it will be on it will be great to see how far they can take it and where the story will go mm definitely and that leads me to my next question… we have got to know will we see bridget in season four can you tell us anything lt laughs it’s not been confirmed yet no one really knows what’s happening yet there’s a possibility of it but i can’t confirm it mm okay we’ll take that it’s a possibility and we’ll run with that so since you won’t tell us any secrets let’s talk about social media you currently have an instagram and a facebook is that correct lt that’s correct i think it was perhaps three months ago i didn’t even know what a hashtag was laughs my friends who had set it up for me said you’ve got to come figure out how it works now and i’m fascinated by it all i can’t keep up with all the messages it’s a bit overwhelming but it’s really quite lovely and people can tell you directly and personally how much they dig your work and dig your character and how it affects them and how they carry you into their lives some people say things like “i can’t live without her” it’s definitely changing my life in a sense that i’m not just an actor in australia now and that’s how the other cast members feel being that it’s such a global thing and there’s messages coming in from all over the world there are more possibilities for us now and we can open up and do more work so it’s a really positive thing social media i look at it like that i have been told that people can get crazy and you’ve got to watch what people write on your site so i’m weary as well but it’s exciting and beautiful there are incredible artists and people doing all these lovely sketches and it’s amazing it’s good fun… i’m like a little girl around it laughs my daughter she’s nearly fourteen she thinks it’s hilarious she’s like “mom you’ve got more people than i have” laughsrelated ‘finding carter’ star zac pullam on playing the moral compass of the show and dealing with teenage girls in public mm laughs now do you have any plans to join twitter i know that’s a giant leap and people over there can be a little crazy but they also can be very welcoming and loving lt right no not yet i have to educate myself about that i’m a little bit weary because you have to kind of work at what you’re going to tell the world i haven’t even looked at other people’s twitter accounts but i will be looking at it because i’ve been told i have to laughs this is now part of my jobmm i kind of opened up the forum and had people submit some questions that they might want to ask you and it just blew up people were hashtagging you and they were sending all these great questions and so i know that if you’re ever ready to go over there people will be receptive to you and you’ll have loads of followers for sure lt oh wow okay i’ll tell my team and we’ll get ready we’ll prepare courtesy of freemantle media australia mm you do have to prepare some people can be a little crazy but i think if you just ignore them and embrace everybody else who is not cuckoo i think you’ll be fine lt i guess that’s life really isn’t it we all know pretty crazy people gosh you’ve just gotta ignore them and embrace everyone else if i take twitter on just remembering that i’ll be fine mm right one negative comment shouldn’t outweigh all the great ones you’re going to get so you just have to look at it that way lt will do yeah i’m directing a play at the moment so i’m very busy trying to organize and everything we open in nine days it’s called the “ demolition job ” and it’s by gordon graham it revolves around the lives of these construction workers who were in school together when they were twelve and one bullied the other and now they are working together and it’s very intense so that’s keeping me very busy at the moment mm acting or directing which one do you prefer doing more i know they are pretty different lt i like both i really enjoy working with actors and helping them get closer to the character and letting the truth come out giving them a safe place to discover themselves and also kind of break their balls a bit push them around a bit laughs i love doing that this is a new thing for me and i’m going to direct a bit more but it’s completely different they’re really different you know but i love it all i’m happy that i have different avenues and am not just stuck with the one thing i don’t know how people can do the same thing their whole life we get to play all these different characters and tell a story and it’s great i’m happy and i’m going to keep doing it mm that’s great now do you have a favorite moment or scene from the season i mean i just remember that library scene where vera walks in on your character and franky super close and you just mouth “oh fuck” and i thought it was the best subtle moment ever laughslt laughs i think the scene after that where vera and bridget are talking we played it so many different ways and it could’ve been played so many different ways and i’m glad the director chose the one that ended up making the final cut in some of the takes that didn’t make it i really took her on and i’m glad they kept bridget as a level headed character because i think having her lose her game because of her feelings towards franky she’s just a professional and she’s a great character she’s a smart one i guess that scene… they’re all good i really enjoyed the scene in the kitchen with franky and bridget everybody loved that scene laughs i really liked throwing nicole’s character around and she didn’t know where that was coming from so that was fun mm that was a great scene lt they’re all good all the scenes have been fun the therapy sessions in the group room and working with boomer  katrina milosevic  and all the characters at once… i love the character and i love the way the women trust her and she can do so many different styles of play with them because the women are always fighting and so intense the funny thing is everything is intense in wentworth celia ireland who plays liz looked at me after a scene we did and said “welcome to wentworth tanner” and i’m like “wow everything is intense” for most shows you have to be open enough and honest enough for the story to work you can’t be all in your own head the audience will pick up on that you’ve got to keep being brave and keep being open mm we discussed this a bit in the beginning of our interview but people loved bridget’s wardrobe especially the jackets in real life what is your goto fashion style lt i love boots and jackets i’m very comfortable wearing bridget yeah i’m jeans boots and a jacket definitely always boots i have a thing about boots there’s something about putting the right shoe on it just feels good it’s like playing any character as soon as you get that costume on you’re halfway there i don’t wear the high heels that bridget wore though or the leather but i may now i really enjoy them she’s quite sensual in all that leather and all that bondage laughs and those high heels and boots i mean come on for real you want me to wear this in a women’s prison laughs bridget is pretty sassy mm oh she is to conclude are there any american shows that you’re currently hooked on lt i just finished watching bloodline oh my god it’s sort of a slow start but you just keep guessing the whole way it’s just fascinating and it blows your whole mind ben mendelsohn is in it he’s one of my favorite aussie actors so to see him up there was amazing and he’s gorgeous his character is so cool i love watching him because he’s an amazing actor mm it is on my list and i will get to it soon now to close any chance with the popularity of you your character and the show in the states do you have any plans to take on hollywood lt oh definitely we’re getting ready to do some meet and greets later this year and my agent has a lot of contacts over there so she’ll be sending me out to meet some casting directors and see where we
