from wikipedia the free encyclopedianavigation search a reserve battery also called standby battery is a primary battery where part is isolated until the battery needs to be used when long storage is required reserve batteries are often used since the active chemicals of the cell are segregated until needed thus reducing selfdischarge 1a reserve battery is distinguished from a backup battery in that a reserve battery is inert until it is activated while a backup battery is already functional even if it is not delivering current contents  hide 1 uses2 activation3 types4 references uses  editthese batteries are used in radiosondes missiles projectile and bomb fuzes and various weapon systems while not advertised as reserve batteries the principle is illustrated by the sale of dry charged car batteries where the electrolyte is added at the time of sale another example is zincair batteries where the cell is sealed until use a tab is removed to admit air and activate the cell activation  editreserve batteries may be activated by addition of water by adding electrolyte by introducing a gas into the cell that is either the active cathode material or part of the electrolyte or by heating a solid electrolyte to a temperature at which it becomes conductive the missing element of the battery can be added before use in several ways the battery can have water or electrolyte added manually the battery can be activated when the system is dropped into the water such as in a sonobuoy  or electrolyte can be stored in a capsule within the battery and released by mechanical means an electrical trigger or by spin or shock a moltenelectrolyte battery is activated by igniting a pyrotechnic heat source the battery delivers current for a short time seconds to a few minutes but some thermal batteries can be stored ten years or more without deterioration reserve batteries remain uncommon in civilian applications because of their higher cost and relatively short life after activation in missiles reserve batteries typically use a small container of pressurized air to force the electrolyte from a storage tank into the battery for safe disposal the air must be vented in ordnance the batteries are activated by acceleration during gun firing or by spinning the projectile in flight 2types  editsome reserve batteries are aluminium battery a variant of zincair battery where aluminium and air are used silverzinc battery often found in old missiles thermal battery a class of battery types with molten salt as an electrolyte the battery is in an inert state until the electrolyte melts through heating common in military applications especially for missiles and proximity fuzes applications include v2 rockets aim9 sidewinder mim104 patriot bgm71 tow bgm109 tomahawk many nuclear weapons and other singleuse applications wateractivated battery a class of batteries where the electrolyte is water that has to be added such as hydro pak or no po po references  edit david linden thomas b reddy ed handbook of batteries 3rd edition mc grawhill new york 2002 isbn 0071359788 chapter 16 httpwwwwipointpctdbenwojspwo2005093883iawo2005093883displaydesccategories battery applications
