housekeeping products what is a hepa filter and do i need one by sarah aguirre updated 021518share pin email fabrik studiosphotolibrarygetty images hepa is an acronym for high efficiency particulate air basically hepa is a type of filter that can trap a large amount of very small particles that other vacuum cleaners would simply recirculate back into the air of your home hepa vacuums are recommended for minimizing dust dander and other common allergens in homes where people suffer from allergies and respiratory conditions but just because a filter or vacuum bag says hepa doesnt mean youre getting true hepa performance true or absolute hepa filters true or absolute hepa filters must be tested and meet a specific standard to be considered true hepa true hepa filters have a serial number assigned to them and have been proven to trap at least 9997 percent of particles of 03 microns the test results should be printed on the filter true or absolute hepa filters may be more expensive than other hepa filters but they must perform at a certain standard to receive the distinction of true or absolute hepa hepatype filters hepatype filters may be made in similar ways to true hepa filters and may even resemble them however they do not have to meet the same standards as true or absolute hepa filters many filters sold as hepa may capture only 85 to 90 percent of all particles and that percent can fall even lower for particles of 1 micron and below telling the difference look for the serial number and test results printed on true or absolute hepa filters make sure that the test results at 03 microns are 9997 percent or above the size of 03 microns is the testing standard because most filters will perform better with both smaller and larger particles also most household allergens are 03 microns or larger do i need a hepa vacuum its important to note that a hepa vacuum is designed for hepa performance and may be a bagged or bagless model in other words its not the bag that makes a vacuum hepa its also important to understand that simply using a hepatype bag—or adding a hepa filter—in a standard vacuum does not mean youll get true hepa performance hepa vacuums are sealed and have special filters that clean all of the air going out of the vacuum standard vacuums usually filter the outgoing air via the vacuum bag in commercial environments where hepa vacuums are required such as construction or restoration sites using standard vacuums with hepa filters or bags may constitute a violation of epa rules and may result in a substantial fine how to buy a hepa vacuum true hepa vacuums are widely available and are not necessarily more expensive than comparable standard vacuums you can research and buy them just like any ordinary household appliance once youve confirmed that a vacuum is true hepa you can make your selection based on the usual factors such as type price performance and convenience features brand reputation etc consumer reports found that hepa vacuums they tested tend to do a good job at removing pet hair an added bonus for allergy sufferers
