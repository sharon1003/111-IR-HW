question when will my baby smile for the first time share answer julia youll midwife and health visitor there is lots of evidence to show that babies are born with an innate desire to communicate with other humans and that they interact with us long before their first proper smile from very early on they can imitate the facial gestures of their parents by for example moving their tongue and widening their eyes they are in fact programmed to join in the social dance by meeting your eyes in a mutual gaze and by taking turns with these facial gestures as you probably already know this behaviour is very effective in attracting and holding your attention how can you resist a babys first proper social smile generally occurs at about four to six weeks though it may be seen earlier and dismissed as wind psychologist steve biddulph says that as newborns boys tend to make less eye contact and to smile less than female babies this means we have to be extra sure to interact and chatter with them so that they grow to be toddlers who can talk as well as their girl peers in a canadian study of fathers all said that an important factor in their relationship with their baby was when they were first smiled at and spoken to your baby is sending signals all the time and without being aware of it you will respond by echoing back his expressions and sounds encouraging your confidence in each other the smile is the beginning of being a social person and eventually a huge body of people will have experienced that smile but for now it is yours alone when we feel fraught and bowed down by the hard work of a new baby the power of those first smiles never cease to win us over go to our main baby development area share track your baby’s development join now to receive free weekly newsletters tracking your baby’s development and yours throughout your pregnancy enter your due date or childs birthday trying to conceive enter your email address join now privacy policy  terms comments log in or sign up to post a commentpollycent010817my daughter had some smiles that seemed on the reflexive side when she was 24 weeks when she got to about 56 weeks she started smiling more in reaction to myself and her daddy but i really had to work for it cooing chattering making random noises while booping her nose or cheeks and slowing down sounds like ma and pa while she focused on my face and lips that gets her smiling also i find she smiles most if she has just woken up and is not yet fussy for a feed or when she is generally settled content and alert baby smiles just melt me every time report this a baby center member260717everyone is different my son smiled many times since his 2nd week and continues to smile even laugh from time to time at 9weeks report this a baby center member170717my baby smiled for me at 4days report this sookie6734021016my baby boy smiled for the first time at 4 weeks  he always starts smiling when you talk to him he loves it report this pinkrose6220815i also was feeling anxious about this because my baby is 6 weeks old and i havent had much or a smile from him yet i agree with the poster below that 46 weeks isnt the norm because ive spoken with many other moms who feel the same as me report this see more comments home baby baby development social development
