reports resulting in credit score increases for some written by louis de nicola share we generally make money when you get a product like a credit card or loan through our platform but we don’t let that cloud our editorial opinions learn more about how we keep this compensation from affecting our editorial views advertiser disclosure the three major national consumer credit bureaus — equifax trans union and experian — estimate that about half of all tax liens and nearly all civil judgments have been removed from consumers’ credit reports as of july 1 the change is a part of the national consumer assistance plan which is a result of discussions and an agreement between the three major credit bureaus and 31 state attorneys general reached in 2015 the ncap includes a series of actions and policy changes that are intended to improve credit reporting data accuracy quality and consumer credit education tax liens and civil judgments on your reports can lower your credit scores so the removal of this information from credit reports could lead to an increase in scores — for some other credit report changes include prohibiting adding medical debt to credit reports until at least 180 days after the account is reported to the credit reporting agency and the removal of previously reported medical collections that have been or are being paid by insurance the ncap requires new and existing public record data to meet certain criteria in order for them to appear on your consumer credit reports including the public record data must have your name address and either your social security number or your date of birth the data furnisher of the public record information must visit the applicable courthouse at least once every 90 days to obtain newly filed and updated public records common question what if ive never had a tax lien or civil judgment if you didnt have a tax lien or civil judgment on your credit reports before your reports wont change and there wont be an effect on your credit scores as a result of these changes the enhanced public record data standards apply to new and existing bankruptcies tax liens and civil judgment data in consumer credit reporting databases if you have a bankruptcy your credit may not be affected by these changes but the bureaus anticipate that over 95 percent of civil judgment records and over half of tax lien records don’t meet the enhanced data requirements as a result experian equifax and trans union will no longer include the noncomplying tax liens and civil judgments on their consumer credit reports once the credit bureaus remove this information you may see your credit scores increase but don’t necessarily expect a huge jump the average score increase will be modest both trans union and equifax found that about 9 percent of people in the national consumer credit databases have either a tax lien or judgment reported on their credit file that’s about 198 million people who could be affected by the change two of the biggest credit scoring models in the united states fico and vantage score both analyzed credit files to see how the changes might affect consumers fico ran a study based on a national representative random sample of about 10 million credit files from each credit reporting agency it used information from the credit bureaus to distinguish between public records that will and won’t be removed the study found that 6 to 7 percent of the people who fico can score had a judgment or tax lien removed from their file as a result of the enhanced public record standards fico also found that the same people tend to have other derogatory information on their credit file which can lead to low credit scores even if tax liens and judgments aren’t included other results from the study show that over 75 percent of people impacted may see their scores increase by fewer than 20 points5 percent to 1 percent depending on the underlying credit report could have a fico score 9 increase of 20 to 39 points about 02 percent of people who have a fico score 9 may see their scores increase by 60 or more points common question could my score go down because of the change ficos study found that less than 1 percent of consumers fico score 9 scores will decrease most often by 1 to 19 points after the changes take effect it says that this can happen when a consumer moves into a different scorecard and as a result gets scored based on slightly different criteria vantage score ran a similar study using its vantage score 30 creditscoring model to analyze credit files of 4 million consumers and the impact of removing all tax liens and civil judgments it found that just over 8 percent of the people that vantage score can create a credit score for would see a change in their vantage score 30 scores among that group there was an average 10 point increase most people who would see a score change had credit scores between 300 and 600 points if you’re looking at your vantage score credit scores you may see other creditmodelrelated changes soon vantage score is updating its scoring model to vantage score 40 which will be available in fall 2017 sarah davies senior vice president of analytics research and product management at vantage score says “ tax liens aren’t going to carry as significant a penalty in vantage score 40 as in 30”remember the ncap guidelines are only expected to remove about 50 to 60 percent of tax liens from consumers’ reports consumers who still have a lien on their credit reports after the change may see a score improvement with vantage score 40’s release“but it’s not a guarantee” davies says “it depends on what’s in the rest of their credit file”lenders may still consider tax liens and civil judgments a tax lien or civil judgment can still impact you even if it no longer appears on your credit reports or affects your credit scores this may be particularly true for those trying to get a mortgage7 documents you need when applying for a home loan lexis nexis risk solutions an aggregator and seller of information that commercial organizations government agencies and nonprofits use to evaluate individuals businesses and assets found that mortgage borrowers who have a judgment or tax lien are 5 ½ times more likely to go into preforeclosure or foreclosure mortgage lenders therefore may still want to see this information when reviewing an application for example fannie mae a governmentsponsored organization that buys mortgages from mortgage lenders requires its approved lenders the mortgage lenders that you may work with to follow its selling guide the selling guide specifies that borrowers must pay off delinquent credit including judgments and tax liens at or before closing how will mortgage lenders find out lexis nexis now offers a lexis nexis risk view liens  judgments report which was created specifically to fill in the tax lien and judgment information for lenders when you apply for a mortgage the mortgage lender will pull your credit from the big three credit bureaus and could also pull the lexis nexis report and make a decision based on the combined information bottom line there are several important changes to credit reporting and scoring coming in the next few months the removal of some tax liens and judgments from credit reports is an important one that may increase some consumers’ credit scores however any score increase will likely be minimal and in rare cases your scores could drop you can keep an eye on if when and how these changes affect you by monitoring your
