girlfriends of major sports stars blank is married to former nhl player sheldon souray the show is coming up on its third season this august and to help get you prepared barbie lent her time to us and answered some questions regarding her name s her memories of the ring being on a reality show and much morehow did you get the nickname barbie my real name is barbara so it just started from that and i always thought barbara was an older name so i always just went with barbie for short speaking of nicknames you were known as kelly kelly in the wwe where did that originate from that started from vince mc mahon he basically picked kelly out of a list of names and then decided “let’s call her kelly kelly and have her have two first names” “so nice they named her twice” was the sloganyou took some time off from the wwe for many years but you returned to that world earlier this year did you miss it i did take some time off to heal my body i was 19 when i started i was on the road 300 days a year wrestling every night injury after injury and after six years straight of that i finally thought it was time to take a break and let my body heal i always missed it that part of me will never go away and being back at wrestle mania felt like it was a homecoming for me it was just the best feeling in the world what’s your fondest memory of being in the ring how about most painful my fondest memory of being in the ring would have to be winning the wwe divas championship that was always a goal that i aimed to achieve when i was in wwe so when i was given the opportunity i felt like they were giving me the highest honor and i felt i have proved to wwe and the wwe universe that i had earned a place in history my most painful memory in wwe would have to be when i was wrestling beth phoenix i was wrestling with two broken ribs and i performed night after night with those ribs broken and just had to let them heal on their own while i was still wrestling and taking no time off what can you tell me about this season of wags this season on wags we have three new girls altogether there are nine women so once you get nine women together of course there’s going to be drama drama drama you have nine different personalities all trying to get along at one time which is never going to turn out well besides the drama nicole and larry have the most amazing wedding you guys will get to see him you’ll see her planning you’ll get to see us we’ll be a part of her bridal showerbachelorette party you’ll get to see me going through work and then figuring out what i want to do next in my life whether it be having a baby or focusing on myself and my job i’m kind of at a crossroads so you’re going to see the different stages all of the girls are at i’m really excited for the season i think it’s going to be the best one yet do you ever feel like being on a reality show is an intrusion of sorts or are you able to keep it separate from your personal life when you sign up for a reality show you know what you’re signing up for you know you’re putting your life out there for the world to see and there’s not really much you can hide from the cameras what you see is what you get there are some things that you try to keep private but it never really is kept private you know it always comes out somehow and you know that’s what you sign up for when you do a reality show all the girls know that this is what we agreed to at the end of the day how well do you get along with the other girls on the show is there any juicy gossip you can share i get along with all the girls i try to stay very neutral and i try to see each side of every story of every part of drama i listen to each each of the girls’ sides and try and see if we can find a happy medium it’s best if we talk as grown women and not fight argue or throw drinks at each other it’s great if we can actually sit down as civilized women and solve problems that way you’re just gonna have to wait and see on the juicy gossip trust me all i can say right now is there’s a lot of it do you enjoy interacting with your fans on social media do they ever send you presents or anything like that i love interacting with my fans on social media that’s what keeps me fascinated in and posting on social media i love seeing the comments and being able to write back to the fans it just means a lot to be able to interact with you guys and i can’t tell you how much it means to me that i am your support through wwe or wags you guys have always been there for me so thank you for reaching out to me on all my social media platforms i try to get back to you as much as possible but know i read and that i see all of your messages and that it warms my heart do you have interest in starring in movies or tv shows i would

happens if i’m meant to be an actress what is your workout routine like my workout routine is mostly cardio probably four times a week i switch up the cardio so i’ll run one day i’ll do the elliptical one day and i’ll do the stairmaster another for at least 30 minutes that will be after i do an hour of a workout session with my trainer which consists of our circuit training that focuses on one body

rack radio show podcast published by admin  0 comments read more filed under interviews projects wagsformer wwe divas champion and star of the e reality show “wags” barbie blanksouray joined “multitime award winning” the rack thursday night in a nearly 15minute interview she talked about wags season 2 and what we can expect to see this upcoming season what it’s like to be newly married planning the wedding and if we’ll get to see it as part of the show her time in wwe and if she’d considered doing total divas her decision to retire and if that helped when her husband decided to hang up the skates her favorite moment from her wwe days and much more how the newly married life is treating her “i just got married at the end of february and it’s just been amazing i mean i married my soulmate so it’s been a whirlwind planning the wedding and the wedding day was the best day of our lives i’m just excited to call him my husband now and carry on the souray name”w ill we get to see her wedding as part of wags season 2 “oh my gosh you’re going to see everything in season 2 when it comes to the wedding you’re going to see the ups and downs of planning a wedding you’re going to see the bridezilla moments you’re going to see some stuff that goes down where i’m like ‘oh my gosh i don’t know if this wedding is going to happen’ because that went on with planning a wedding but i don’t want to give too much away there’s some drama with the girls leading up to it but you get to see the whole wedding which i can’t wait for the fans to see i can’t wait for them to see all my hard work pay off and just see their year and a half wedding that i’ve been planning that was such a magical day and i can’t wait for everyone to see it”what it was like planning for everything with the wedding “yeah i mean it was my first time planning a wedding so find out all those things down to the place cards and everything like that you’re like ‘i didn’t even realize’ luckily i had an amazing wedding planned and she really helped me with so much it’s hard planning a wedding in mexico and you’re in la los angeles it’s not easy”what can we expect to see on wags season 2 when it premieres “well the beginning of the season that’s mostly just the wedding planning and there’s some drama with the girls but i kind of stay out of that this season i didn’t want to be involved with any of the drama i was like ‘i’m focused it’s my wedding i’m planning my wedding i’m not with any of your girl’s drama’ so you’ll see me walk out a lot where i’m like throw my hands up i’m done and then really after we get married i’m contemplating if i want a family or if i want to get back into work and maybe do some acting or something like that so you’ll get to see where i figure out with my husband what’s our next move”if her previous retirement from wrestling and wwe helped with her husband’s retirement from hockey “yeah i feel like we were both able to relate to each other on another level when it came to that too because when i retired i didn’t know what was next i was like ‘ok now what do i do’ you know and for him i think he just enjoyed being retired and not having to live on a schedule because he he’d played hockey for 20 years so i think he enjoyed being retired and now not being on a schedule and being able to do his own thing and golf but now he’s thinking ‘now what do i do’ and now he just enjoys golfing and just living the retired life but i definitely feel like we were able to relate on that level of now we’re retired and now what’s next so it was the perfect time to get married because he had just retired and we were both able to put our efforts into planning a wedding”what’s the best part about transitioning into a normal life again “with wrestling because you’re on the road for 300 days a year and you don’t have any offseason so your constant to go from that to ‘now what do i do’ it’s not easy but i was able to get into a routine i started cooking a lot more i started working out i got my routine down after being retired for a couple of months and was like ‘ok this is my life now this is normal life’”what attracted her to do the show wags “when wags approached me about the show i was like this is awesome this is such an awesome concept and i think it’s a great thing that it’s not about who we’re dating really it’s about our lives and what it is like dating athletes and we have going on i was a former wrestler and wanted to get into acting now and stuff like that so it’s able to highlight that too and i just kind of missed being in the entertainment industry so when they approached me i was like you know what this will give me what i kind of missed when i left wwe and i’ll be able to start working again i feel like this has been a great opportunity for people to be able to see what it’s like to be married to or dating an athlete and the highs and lows with that that’s definitely what attracted me to that and for season two it was an easy answer because i loved season one and i’m excited about season two”does she ever miss being in the wwe “i miss the performing you know i miss performing for the fans i miss walking through the curtain and having them cheer for me so that’s the part i miss for sure i feel like i’m able to get that fix with being on wags because you either love me or you hate me and so in the end i feel like i’m able to keep my fans and they’re able to see a different side of me they’re able to see how i am in my everyday life which in wwe they weren’t able to see they were just seeing a character”would she have been interested in doing total divas if still with wwe “i think when i left it was my time i just had a lot of issues with my neck and my body when you’re wrestling 300 days a year your body is doing things it’s not meant to do and you definitely get injuries very quickly so i just started to get a lot of injuries and i was just ready to spend time at home with sheldon and we were getting a lot more serious i just felt like it was my time so when total divas came up i just couldn’t go back to doing that schedule but i feel like wags was the perfect place for me to be”what are some of her favorite moment while in wwe “probably when i was able to win the divas championship that was the best day and highlight of my career was winning the belt and how i won it too it was the fan’s choice about who they were going to face so the fans chose me and i went out there and i won the belt i felt like everyone had recognized i had been there for so long and i had earned this it was my time and i was just so happy because once you reach that you can’t go any higher you are the champion of the whole division that’s what motivated me for so long was the fans they mean everything”who does she have the best chemistry with on wags “i mean i love olivia pierson actually it’s so funny seeing from last season until now we’ve gotten so close so i would definitely say olivia and nicole williams nicole and i have gotten really close so you’ll see a different side because last season i was really with the wives and so if you tune in you’ll see how things start to change and it’ll be an exciting entertaining season”is there any tension between the wives and girlfriends of wags “well if you saw last season some women like to think they are the hierarchy that wives are up here and girlfriends are down here that whole thing i’ve never been one to be all about that but i see where the wives come from in that they say ‘oh the girlfriends you never know who is going to be here today tomorrow so you don’t want to get close to them’ i understand that part but i don’t understand how serious they take it like “oh i’m not going to talk with you because you’re a girlfriend’ i’m not like that but there are some ladies that are it does happen and a lot in the athletic world so it is and interesting point of view”is there anyone she’d like to see join the show “i don’t know since sheldon retired last season i haven’t really been around that world lately so i don’t know who all is around now i mean it would be amazing if carrie underwood or someone like that joined”what do you like to do on your day off “i love going to the movies by myself i know it’s a little weird but i love going getting a big popcorn and a coke and sitting down and watching a movie by myself whatever i want to see and not being bothered not having to explain anything to anyone not having anyone sitting right next to me just being alone and in my own space”a huge thank you to
