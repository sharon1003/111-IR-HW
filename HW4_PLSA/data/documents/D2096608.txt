a natural he got the role i fit into this business like a sore foot into a soft shoe he told the uk paper the telegraph in 2009 in britain he gained fame for his performance as a depressionera songplugger in dennis potters miniseries pennies from heaven later turned into a 1980 movie starring steve martin though he had a handful of recognizable roles in films after pennies  including 1980s the long good friday 1982s pink floyd the wall and 1985s brazil in which he played a gleefully malevolent repairman  it wasnt until roger rabbit that he broke through to mainstream american audiences that film drove him a bit nuts he told the telegraph i think i went a bit mad while working on that lost my mind the voice of the rabbit was there just behind the camera all the time he recalled the trouble was i had learnt how to hallucinate my daughter had an invisible friend called jeffrey and i played with her and this invisible friend until one day i actually saw the friend it was his daughter however who set him straight my daughter when i came back from filming in san francisco she said dad slow down slow down youre going barmy mate and i was always a steady and straightforward

ones getting paid for it he told the uk paper the guardian in 2007 the rest of it is a mystery to me in one of his last roles he played the elf muir in 2012s snow white and the huntsman in the 2011 tv
