license level is what is important education level is not usually an issue most people are not that impressed feb 6 08officially it is bsn rn because the bsn cant be taken from you or expire having said that you dont have to sign with your bsn or adn unless you want to feb 6 08quote from caliotter3ive always seen level of education subordinated to license and certifications going with the license personally and in talking with other nurses the license level is what is important education level is not usually an issue most people are not that impressed i agree that unless you are an educator its not that important with that being said congratulations on your new degree and all of the hard work that went into getting it as for your question the accepted format is new nurse rn bsn again congratulations welcome to nursing etnguy feb 6 08thanks guys so i got two different answers i guess it doesnt matter to most but it does to me i worked hard for my bsn and its a big deal to me i will use it whenever i can feb 6 08 fontarial helvetica sansserif when you are signing your name you should follow it with the credentials that can least be taken away from you in descending order with awards or honors last your highest academic degree should be placed immediately after your name before the professional designation and certification credentials taken from httpwwwnapnaporgindexcfmpagec390ssec406 national association of pediatric nurse practitoners fontarial helvetica sansserif hope this clears it up feb 6 08the traditional order is degree most permanent followed by licensure followed by any certifications or honors so bsn rn however as others have noted youre certainly not required to list your degree every time you sign your name lots of people just use rn with any certifications and dont bother with the degree  the license is what matters at work feb 6 08as others have said the official way to list credentials is to list the highest academic degree first and then add the licenses then the certifications however in nursing so many people do it the other way around that the convention is not firmly established i think the practice of listing your license immediately after your name started to become the standard because most nurses start out in work environments where it is not the norm to list your educational level when charting they were taught to just list nurse name rn in their documentation as a staff nurse back then no one listed bsn or adn etc when they charted as nurses got additional education they just continued to list the rn first out of habit and just added the msn or whatever at the end over the years it just became the norm in some places to list the rn first even though it is not technically correct feb 7 08quote from avasmom rnthis is silly and i should know but i dont i just graduated and passed boards how are supposed to write your credentials if you are an rn with bsn thanks does it really matter i honestly didnt care when i was a new graduate even as i graduated from my bs program i thought that the extra time was a waste of money exception unless you want to be an officer in the military a good bedside nurse doesnt need a bs shehe needs experience a bs is good for nurses who dont really want to do hands on nursing administration the nurses who can make rules and more and more paperwork for us nurses doing the real nursing those who without the real experience make our job harder than it needs to be less and less time with the patient and more and more time on paperwork and the computer fine sorry congrats on getting a bachelors in nursing use it well take care of your patients care for them like they were your family good luck to you dont ever think you are any better than another nurse who does not have a bs forget about your letter order your human resource dept will take care of that when they make your id when you sign orders write nurses notes you sign your name only with rn after you dont use your degree your license to practice nursing is what matters not the coursework you chose to enable you to take the licensure exam last edit by zoomoon on feb 9 08feb 7

granted by the licensing state and represented by the letters rn academic credentials are relevant in academia as when writing papers or teaching i agree its been a while since ive done patient care  but when i did i just used llg rn my academic degrees were not relevant in a different context when my academic education is relevant i use them llg ph d rn the hospital i work in has a first name culture  and most people just call me by my first name other people will use ms because i have some gray hair  and they know i am in a leadership position however those who know me just call me by my first name when i teach at a local university i suddenly become professor llg or dr llg it feels weird but thats the culture in that environment i generally bend to blend in with the culture of my
