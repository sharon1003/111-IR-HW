there’s 21 congressmen and senators that have been convicted of felonies that still get their retirement even in jail they don’t have to wait until they’re 65 — jesse ventura on friday september 14th 2012 in an interview on my central jerseycom jesse ventura says convicted congressmen senators can still get retirement in jail by caryn shinske on thursday october 25th 2012 at 730 am jesse ventura doesn’t hold back when it comes to criticizing government as a former governor of minnesota he’s seen his share of politics on both sides of the aisle and details in his new book demo crips and re bloodlicans no more gangs in government why he likens the two mainstream political parties to the infamous street gangs ventura notes that while gang activity generally affects neighborhoods the actions of both parties affect the nation there’s 21 congressmen and senators that have been convicted of felonies that still get their retirement even in jail ventura said in an interview with my central jerseycom ahead of a sept 16 appearance at rutgers university in new brunswick they don’t have to wait until they’re 65 there are quite a few congressmen and senators who have been convicted of felonies but multiple public databases with conflicting information about the number of convicted federal lawmakers makes it impossible to assess an exact number we were intrigued however by the claim that federal lawmakers can collect taxpayerfunded pensions while incarcerated and short of those officials being convicted of treason or espionage it’s true let’s look at how pensions work for members of congress officials participate in one of two retirement systems depending on when they were first elected to the house or senate but they do not forfeit their pensions or accumulated retirement income if indicted or convicted of most felonies that struck a nerve with the national taxpayers union which in mid2011 sent a letter to illinois sen mark kirk a republican to express support for his bill to increase the number of circumstances under which a member of congress could lose his pension since the 1980s ntu has identified lawmakers convicted on charges ranging from bribery to fraud who were each receiving pensions worth tens of thousands of dollars annually or more – sometimes while serving prison terms ntu executive vice president pete sepp wrote the ntu advocates for lower taxes but can a member of congress simultaneously receive a taxpayerfunded pension while incarcerated the short answer is yes john david a senior research fellow with the conservative heritage foundation said in an email times have changed to some extent but if the member is not convicted of one of the offenses that would cost himher the pension it will be paid as promised  even to prison congressmen and senators can lose their pensions if they are convicted of a national security offense or a crime relating to public corruption and abuse of one’s official position according to the 2008 congressional research service report status of a senator who has been indicted for or convicted of a felony so there are circumstances in which a member of congress can’t receive pension benefits as for the rest of ventura’s claim members don’t have to be 65 either to get their retirement a 2007 congressional research service report retirement benefits for members of congress states members are eligible for a pension at age 62 if they have completed at least five years of service the age requirement drops to 50 for member with 20 years of service or any age after 25 years of service ventura did not return three requests for comment our ruling ventura claimed in an interview that there’s 21 congressmen and senators convicted of felonies that still get their retirement even in jail they don’t have to wait until they’re 65 for this factcheck we looked only at the claim that federal lawmakers convicted of felonies and can still collect retirement benefits while in jail we attempted to count the number of convicted national lawmakers but there are multiple public databases with conflicting information on the number of congressmen and senators convicted of felonies in most cases a congressman or senator convicted of a felony can receive his pension as long as the charge is not one that violates national security or relates to public corruption and abuse of official position members also receive pensions based on completed years of service not an age requirement of 65 we rate the claim mostly true to comment on this story go to njcom
