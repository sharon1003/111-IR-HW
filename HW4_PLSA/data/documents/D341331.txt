from wikipedia the free encyclopedia redirected from measures of central tendencynavigation search for the graphnetwork concept see centrality in statistics a central tendency or measure of central tendency is a central or typical value for a probability distribution 1 it may also be called a center or location of the distribution colloquially measures of central tendency are often called averages the term central tendency dates from the late 1920s 2the most common measures of central tendency are the arithmetic mean the median and the mode a central tendency can be calculated for either a finite set of values or for a theoretical distribution such as the normal distribution occasionally authors use central tendency to denote the tendency of quantitative data to cluster around some central value 2 3the central tendency of a distribution is typically contrasted with its dispersion or variability dispersion and central tendency are the often characterized properties of distributions analysts may judge whether data has a strong or a weak central tendency based on its dispersion contents  hide 1 measures2 solutions to variational problems21 uniqueness3 relationships

before calculating a central tendency examples are squaring the values or taking logarithms whether a transformation is appropriate and what it should be depend heavily on the data being analyzed arithmetic mean or simply meanthe sum of all measurements divided by the number of observations in the data set medianthe middle value that separates the higher half from the lower half of the data set the median and the mode are the only measures of central tendency that can be used for ordinal data in which values are ranked relative to each other but are not measured absolutely modethe most frequent value in the data set this is the only central tendency measure that can be used with nominal data which have purely qualitative category assignments geometric meanthe n th root of the product of the data values where there are n of these this measure is valid only for data that are measured absolutely on a strictly positive scale harmonic meanthe reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals of the data values this measure too is valid only for data that are measured absolutely on a strictly positive scale weighted arithmetic meanan arithmetic mean that incorporates weighting to certain data elements truncated mean or trimmed meanthe arithmetic mean of data values after a certain number or proportion of the highest and lowest data values have been discarded interquartile meana truncated mean based on data within the interquartile range midrangethe arithmetic mean of the maximum and minimum values of a data set midhingethe arithmetic mean of the two quartiles trimeanthe weighted arithmetic mean of the median and two quartiles winsorized meanan arithmetic mean in which extreme values are replaced by values closer to the median any of the above may be applied to each dimension of multidimensional data but the results may not be invariant to rotations of the multidimensional space in addition there are the geometric medianwhich minimizes the sum of distances to the data points this is the same as the median when applied to onedimensional data but it is not the same as taking the median of each dimension independently it is not invariant to different rescaling of the different dimensions quadratic mean often known as the root mean squareuseful in engineering but not often used in statistics this is because it is not a good indicator of the center of the distribution when the distribution includes negative values simplicial depththe probability that a randomly chosen simplex with vertices from the given distribution will contain the given center tukey mediana point with the property that every halfspace containing it also contains many sample points solutions to variational problems  editseveral measures of central tendency can be characterized as solving a variational problem in the sense of the calculus of variations namely minimizing variation from the center that is given a measure of statistical dispersion one asks for a measure of central tendency that minimizes variation such that variation from the center is minimal among all choices of center in a quip dispersion precedes location this center may or may not be unique in the sense of l pspaces the correspondence is l p dispersion central tendency l 0 variation ratio mode l 1 average absolute deviation median l 2 standard deviation mean l ∞ maximum deviation midrange the associated functions are called p norms respectively 0norm 1norm 2norm and ∞norm the function corresponding to the l 0 space is not a norm and is thus often referred to in quotes 0norm in equations for a given finite data set x thought of as a vector the dispersion about a point c is the distance from x to the constant vector in the p norm normalized by the number of points n  note that for and these functions are defined by taking limits respectively as and for the limiting values are and for so the difference becomes simply equality so the 0norm counts the number of unequal points for the largest number dominates and thus the ∞norm is the maximum difference uniqueness  editthe mean  l 2 center and midrange  l ∞ center are unique when they exist while the median  l 1 center and mode  l 0 center are not in general unique this can be understood in terms of convexity of the associated functions  coercive functions  the 2norm and ∞norm are strictly convex and thus by convex optimization the minimizer is unique if it exists and exists for bounded distributions thus standard deviation about the mean is lower than standard deviation about any other point and the maximum deviation about the midrange is lower than the maximum deviation about any other point the 1norm is not strictly convex whereas strict convexity is needed to ensure uniqueness of the minimizer correspondingly the median in this sense of minimizing is not in general unique and in fact any point between the two central points of a discrete distribution minimizes average absolute deviation the 0norm is not convex hence not a norm correspondingly the mode is not unique – for example in a uniform distribution any point is the mode relationships between the mean median and mode  editmain
