chicken pox after vaccinationby tom seman md faap march 4th 2011  pediatrician on call is it possible for my child to develop chicken pox even if she has been vaccinated vaccines against viral infections are difficult to make to be 100 effective even after a booster the chicken pox vaccine is no exception after one immunization the vaccine confers immunity in approximately 85 of people so approximately 15 of children and adults who are vaccinated can contract and manifest chicken pox if sufficiently exposed however the duration and intensity of the disease is significantly lessened prior to the advent of the chicken pox vaccine the disease was very common with approximately 80 of children having the disease before they left elementary school the average child had around 300 pox over their entire body with each pox lasting 47 days and new pox erupting over a week’s time hence the child was contagious for 710 days since the initiation of widesprerad vaccination most children have not had the wildtype disease even after being exposed to an infected individual if the person should contract the disease the vaccinated individual will have on average just up to 50 pox with each lasting 24 days with new pox erupting over 24 days therefore there are significantly less lesions and the disease lasts about 47 days but where would the average person be exposed to wildtype chicken pox virus now that wide spread vaccination programs are in place there is a long term reservoir of the disease in any person who has had the disease in the past after a person has recovered from the chicken pox disease the virus never actually leaves the body instead the virus goes dormant within the nerves of the body during times of stress in the body the virus can reactivate and cause a painful itchy rash in the area where the nerve senses these sensations — called dermatomes this is called shingles or zoster short for varicella zoster the name for the chicken pox virus when a person has active shingles those lesions are shedding active virus and thus that individual is contagious so stay healthy and good lucktweet this post
