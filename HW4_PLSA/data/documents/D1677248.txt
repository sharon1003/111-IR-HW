gingerbread in the shape of stars elea at british baby names has a post on starry names up on her lovely advent calendar she also had a post on astronomical names back in october which contains many star names if you name your child after a star you will want to show them “their” star when they get older so i’ve given a few hints as to the best time to view the star from australia to learn more two great resources are the skynotes newsletter from the melbourne planetarium includes video and the beginner’s guide to the night sky at abc science i normally do ten names per list but because it’s the last set for the year i’ve done twelve – besides stars naturally seem to go in groups of twelve don’t they alya alya is a common name for the yellow binary star theta serpentis in the constellation serpens “the serpent” its name comes from the arabic word alyah meaning “fat tail of the sheep” arab astronomers saw this part of the sky as a pasture with alya representing a sheep’s tail the arabs have cooked with the rich fat from a sheep’s tail for centuries and it is still considered a delicious comfort food it might seem like calling your daughter lard but it fits in with the popular aaliyah variants while being simpler to pronounce and spell you can always tell people the baby is named after a star that represents a sheep gambolling in a field however vegetarians may not be able to get past the fact that the arabs were looking up at the star and thinking “yum yum yum” serpens is visible in australia in the middle of winter and its stars are not easy to see andromeda andromeda is a constellation named after a character from greek mythology this princess was chained naked to a rock for a sea monster to gobble thanks to her rather stupid mother’s boasting of her beauty the hero perseus on his way home from other heroic deeds saw her in distress and did the traditional hero’s rescueandmarrydamsel manoeuvre an awkward detail was that andromeda was already engaged to her uncle but perseus turned him into stone which got rid of him nicely the name is pronounced androhmehda and is said to mean “to think as a man” in greek interpreted as meaning to be as intelligent or brave as a man – which sounds a bit sexist but the story isn’t exactly a feminist fairytale and it’s clearly meant to be complimentary andromeda is a stunning name which can easily be shortened to andie annie meda mia or romy it will remind people of the andromeda galaxy which you can see best in november from australia along with the constellation capella capella is a common name for the yellow star alpha aurigae the brightest in the constellation auriga “the charioteer” it means “little shegoat” in latin and represents the divine goat amalthea from roman mythology amalthea was the fostermother of the god jupiter and provided him with milk when jupiter broke off one of her horns it became the ‘”horn of plenty” which provided its owner with whatever food they desired for the boorong people of victoria this star was purra a kangaroo who is chased and killed by the twins in the constellation of gemini the tracks of purra form the bed of the wimmera river capella is a small town in central queensland named after the star so it’s a surprisingly australian choice as a star name it’s a fresh twist on capri or caprice with the popular ella ending you can see capella on the northern horizon during summer in australia and it’s bright enough to be clearly visible carina carina is a constellation of the southern hemisphere its name is latin for “keel” and it represents part of the ship the argo sailed by jason and the argonauts in greek legend the most prominent star in the constellation is canopus the brightest star of southern skies clearly visible and high in the sky if you live in the far south of australia canopus will never set the bibbulum people of southwestern australia saw canopus as their ancestor waa wahn the trickster crow the maoris called it atutahi or “stand alone” because of its brightness carina also has meteor showers which peak around australia day and contains the diamond cross sister to the southern cross considering that the winged keel on australia ii is said to have won us the america’s cup in 1983 carina adds up to being a patriotic star name and suitable for boaties as carina is also a name related to either cara or katherine it has the added advantage of sounding like a “regular name” gemma gemma is a common name for the binary star alpha coronae borealis the brightest in the constellation corona borealis “the northern crown” in greek mythology corona borealis represents a crown worn by ariadne when she married the wine god dionysus gemma is latin for “jewel” so it’s “the jewel in the crown” australian aborigines called this constellation the boomerang because of its shape being in the southern hemisphere we see the constellation upsidedown gemma is a popular name in australia and the star association helps give it another layer of meaning while also showing that you don’t need to have a strange or rare name to be named after a star the constellation is best viewed in winter from australia and its difficult to see without practice lucy in the constellation centaurus “the centaur” is a tiny white dwarf star smaller than the earth with the boring name of bpm 37093 its carbon atoms are believed to have formed a crystalline structure and because diamonds are also carbon arranged in crystalline formation astronomers have nicknamed this star lucy – as in lucy in the sky with diamonds it’s a fun star and song reference for a very popular name and as you probably know lucy means “light” which seems apt for a star because of its size you can only see lucy with a telescope however the constellation centaurus is the most magnificent in the southern hemisphere with two of the brightest stars alpha and beta centauri you can see a great portion of the milky way in centaurus and on a moonless autumn night it will be easy enough to point at lucy’s general location does it matter if it cannot be seen the little prince told us that what is essential is invisible to the eye …lyra lyra is a small constellation whose name is greek for “lyre” it is associated with the myth of orpheus a legendary musician poet and prophet who is best known for his descent into the underworld in search of his wife eurydice according to some accounts he died being ripped apart by savage bacchantes the female worshippers of the god dionysus the muses gave him a proper burial and he was finally reunited with his beloved the muses took his lyre to heaven and placed it amongst the stars in his honour in australia you can see lyra low in the northern sky during winter the name has

name for 20 tauri a blue giant in the constellation taurus and the fourthbrightest star in the pleiades cluster in greek mythology the pleiades were seven beautiful nymphs who were sisters they were pursued by the hunter orion and zeus changed them first into doves and then into stars – where they are still chased by the constellation orion the pleiades are often called the seven sisters and you can see them clearly in summer from australia the aborigines have several legends about the pleiades and one involves seven sisters being pursued by a man just like the greek myth maia was the eldest of the pleiades and the mother of the god hermes the meaning of the name is uncertain it may be a respectful title for a mature lady maia the star appears as a character in mary poppins by p l travers

southern cross represented on the national flag as well as the eureka flag mimosa is the lefthand arm of the cross various aboriginal peoples saw the cross as an eagle’s footprint a stingray a possum in a tree or two brothers cooking a fish on their campfire the aborigines of eastern australia called it mirrabooka mirrabooka was a kind and clever man who was placed in the sky by the creator biami so he could watch over the earth because the southern cross is always visible here mirrabooka never leaves us the maoris call it the anchor it anchors the milky way the star mimosa received its name because of its colour the mimosa is another name for the silver wattle the name is from the greek for “mimic” it’s an extravagant name that’s very patriotic you could use mim mimi mia or mo as

stars to the sun mira is a variable star like other red giants its surface oscillates so that its brightness increases and decreases mira was the first variable star ever observed in modern times and
