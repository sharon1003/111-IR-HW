how to replace a submersible well pump workshop homeimprovement by jamesburkefan follow17012612967posted jun 4 2015ok this is not an easy task and i recommend that anyone thinking about doing it at least consider having the well pump identified as the failed component by a professional prior to undertaking it in my case the water in my house stopped working on a friday night of course i know my system pretty well and was able to determine that the fault in my system could not be anything but my well pump motor before i took any action guess what i called the plumber anyway if nothing else youll pay 60 to have your diagnosis confirmed and maybe even get an estimate that will provide you with the motivation to do the job on your own my estimate to pull and replace the well was 2400 by following these steps i was able to do the job myself for less than 400 add tip ask question comment download step 1 start with understanding what your well looks like and how it works so this is what we start with the drawing is not to scale but essentially most wells look a bit like this there are several different variations on what ends up being pretty much the same thing in my case the casing which is the steel pipe that everything fits into and goes into the ground has a 6 diameter some casings can be as narrow as 4 if youre doing something like this on your own wider is better a 6 well casing gives you plenty of room to work on your own narrower casings can make things complicated the well used in this example is relatively shallow it only runs about 100120 deep some wells can run to depths of hundreds or thousands of feet in the case of anything deeper than about 250 i would recommend that you have it pulled by a pro why because its heavy and there are special tools that contractors have to lift the pump from that kind of depth look at it this way even if you have someone else pull the well you can do the repairreplace action on your own once its out of the ground and still save money  my well was dug about 25 years ago one of the things that happens with older wells is that over a period of several years silt from the aquifer can seep into the bottom of the casing thats a bad thing why because the silt builds up to a depth thats too close to the pump and the pump ends up sucking up the silt and muck from the bottom of the well and then pushes it into your house youll see the result of this kind of thing in the following pictures you basically have three lines running down into the well theres 1 the water tube 2 the electrical wiring that supplies voltage to the well pump motor and 3 the safety rope which is tied directly to the well pump and keeps it from falling down into the abyss if anything goes wrong the weight of the whole pump assembly hangs on the water hose that the pump uses to push water into the house up near the top the water tube hits whats called a pitless connector where it makes a hard right turn toward the house see how the pump looks a bit like a bottle made of two pieces the bottom part is the motor the top part is the impeller that sucks the water out of the well and sends it to the house heres how it works when one turns on the sink to wash ones hands or when we flush a toilet we tend to think that were pulling water directly from the well to do it in actuality were not in a properly outfitted house youre pulling water from a pressurized tank that acts as sort of a middle man some artesian wells dont have this set up but lets pretend they do when you turn on the water to wash your hands or flush your toilet the amount of water stored in the pressure tank is reduced reduced water in the tank means reduced pressure the pressure switch on the tank is set up so that it knows what point to turn on the pump pulling water up from the well to replace what youve used and what point to turn off the pump to keep your system from exploding having a pressure tank does two things for you 1 it provides a nice steady amount of water pressure throughout your house all the time 2 it saves electricity and wearandtear on the pump which is buried deep in the ground ideally your well pump should be able to push more water than aboveaverage household use will require most houses are recommended to have a pump that will support 5 gallons per minute that way more water per minute is pushed up from the well than you can normally expect to be able to get out of a sink or a shower by having a pump that exceeds your practical use the pressure tank is able to maintain steady flow there will always be more water available to the tank than you can pull from the tap with the right pump you can have two showers a sink and a toilet all flowing at the same time without any discernible drop in pressure add tip ask question comment download step 2 pulling the well pump up out of the well now that we know what all is down there and how all of it works together its time to take action in order to pull all of this stuff out of the well you need a special tool called a pitless adapter wrench its basically made of three pieces of threaded metal pipe that you can get from any hardware store a t connector holds them together the handles can be any length you like but i wouldnt go any longer than 12 standard pitless connectors use a 1 threaded pipe mine of course was nonstandard it uses 34 threaded pipe to make one of these wrenches you just go down to the local hardware store buy the threaded pipes and put them together the long pipe the one that goes down into the hole needs to be at least 5 long if you want it to reach once youve made your wrench you just stick it down into the well thread it into the connector and get ready to pull while you do that make sure someone is holding onto the safety rope if anything goes wrong and your partner happens to not be holding the rope the well pump will fall into the abyss lost forever que ominous musicadd tip ask question comment download step 3 take the cap off the well and look inside with a flashlight safety note  before you do anything with the well cap make sure you kill the power at the well pump circuit breaker it should be labeled clearly most of them are wired for 220v well caps are usually secured by three or four bolts loosen the bolts to the point where they almost come off the cap you want to leave them threaded a bit so you dont lose them then give the well cap a few uppercut swings with a mediumsized hammer it should pop off without much trouble once the cap is off take a look down the well with a flashlight you should see something that looks a little like this image which i borrowed from a google search because i forgot to take my own picture youll see utter and complete darkness at the bottom of the well maybe some water if its shallow and the pitless connector on the inside of the casing youll also see your safety rope and the electrical wires that power the motor the idea is to take the pitless connector wrench the one that you just made out of threaded pipe and marry it up with the threaded cap at the top of the connector the part that looks like a circle see notes on the picture add tip ask question comment download step 4 heres a closeup of what the pitless connector looks like as you can see the pitless connector is where the water makes a hard right turn out of the well and toward your house its a pressure fitting and its usually made of brass on most wells theyre about 4 down from the top of the well which means they are usually buried which is scary why are they buried you may be wondering its awfully inconvenient for them to be down so far in the well yes it is but thats just the way it has to be pitless connectors have to be located below the frost line for your area if they arent all it will take is one really cold night to freeze up as i mentioned above the connectors are usually brass brass is a soft metal it doesnt take much for it to split if anything happens to this connector like a crack or a split youre usually going to have to replace the whole thing im not sure when the last time you had to dig a 4 deep hole was but i can assure you its not a pleasant thing to have to do so it goes without saying as you go through this process be very careful not to damage the pitless connector add tip ask question comment download step 5 this should give you an idea of how much digging youll be doing if you damage the pitless connector image borrowed from the internet add tip ask question comment download step 6 heres what it looks like to try to line the threads up on the pitless connector the environment inside of a well is inherently moist this means that corrosion will occur regardless of what kind of metal youre dealing with that corrosion means the pitless connector canwill fill up with gunk that will prevent you from being able to thread the wrench into the adapter easily the trick is to turn the wrench extremely slowly  youll feel it bite if after it bites it skips off the threads you have corrosion i spent more than an hour almost getting it right the corrosion and gunk just wouldnt let me get a good connection thats when i decided to go to next picture add tip ask question comment download step 7 tap tap tappy hit it with a hammer seriously very gentle taps with a hammer as you turn the wrench should do the trick it will allow for you to thread the pipe fully it worked beautifully for me as youre doing this its absolutely vital to make sure that you do not a cross thread the connector work slowly and get it right b try to pull it up without being 100 confident that its got a good connection nice and snug if you dont have a snug connection you take the chance of dropping everything down to the bottom of the well if that happens get yourself a shovel and a checkbook add tip ask question comment download step 8 up she goesonce we had the wrench threaded all the way it was time to start pulling we had to give the adapter wrench a couple of upward whacks with the hammer but it came loose the first picture shows what the pitless connector looks like with the wrench threaded into it start pulling up the assembly again make sure someone holds on to the safety rope add tip ask question comment download step 9 keep pulling its very important that you not get any kinks in the water line the black tube so pulling the pump is definitely a two person job as one person pulls it up out of the well the other person walks it in a straight line or in a curve away from the well add tip ask question comment download step 10 take time to reflect on your life choices dogs are really helpful to have around when doing a job like this moral support is important especially when after a couple of minutes pulling up the well pump you realize that youve been making some very poor decisions about exercise and eating habits alas i used to be a strapping young man weeze those days are no more keep in mind the well pump itself usually weighs about 50 lbs the water trapped in the tube also holds significant weight the deeper the well the more weight youre dealing with plus theres that whole physics and leverage thing to deal with bottom line im guessing that i had to pull a 70lb weight nearly 100 vertical feet its quite a job forearms back hips biceps all of them hurt the next day add tip ask question comment download step 11 eventually it will all come up make sure everything is laid out as straight as possible take a second to marvel at what you have accomplished add tip ask question comment download step 12 its outdo you remember me mentioning something about it sitting down in the mud yeah i knew it was bad i did not know it was this bad furthermore up until this point i had no idea what kind of well pump was down there they come in various configurations of power voltage number of wires and number of gallons per minute normally the horsepower rating is written as a courtesy on the underside of the well cap no such luck here i had to pull it up just to find out what it was you may be in the same boat when its time to do yours add tip ask question comment download step 13 clean it off and figure out what you have turns out that mine was a 34 hp jacuzzi they sold out to a company called franklin electric years ago since it was just the motor that fried it might have been possible to order a replacement motor which would generate significant savings but that might have taken days or weeks to finddeliver i didnt want to measure the amount of time i was without water in terms of days or weeks plus this pump was so clogged with gunk that it wasnt worth taking the chance on another failure a whole new pump was definitely required note this is one of those moments where its good to get along with your neighbors thanks to mine we were able to hose off the motor to find out exactly what the specs were see the source of my water was sitting on the ground hence i had no water with which to hose off the pump the worn out pump ran on about 8 amps and pushed about 68 gallons per minute its a 220v twowire motor thats exactly the sort of thing you need to know when youre buying a replacement make notes or take pictures of this information and take it with you to the store add tip ask question comment download step 14 anatomy of the well pump lets take a look at the cleanedoff pump youll note the two pieces like in my drawing the far left is the electric motor the dirty clyinder in the middleleft is the impeller the black stuff in the middle is a whole lot of electrical tape covering the spliced electrical connections for the motor and the check valve that keeps water from flowing back into the well the thing that looks like a bulb toward the right is called a torque arrestor remember how i told you that my well casing is 6 wide well the well pump is only 4 wide the torque arrestor rubs up against the well casing and keeps the pump from spinning at the bottom of the well did you notice the piece of safety rope tied directly to the pump also did you notice that everything is resting on a couple of saw horses yet another application in which such a simple tool can be incredibly useful if you dont have a set i highly recommend picking a couple up for the purpose of doing this job the ones im using are quite inexpensive lightweight and strong add tip ask question comment download step 15 start taking the failed pump apartin most cases there are going to be salvageable components for mine the torque arrestor was in pretty good shape as were the hose clamps that held them onto the water line once you get them all off set them in a safe place for later then get to work on removing all of that tapeadd tip ask question comment download step 16 exposing the wires and the safety rope once all the tape was removed we could see the electrical wiring and the safety rope see it piled up in the corner of the first picture salvage the remaining hose clamps and get ready to cut the water tube add tip ask question comment download step 17 cutting the water tube since i knew that the well pump had been sitting in muck for who knows how long it seemed like a good idea to shorten the length of the water tube as you can see i walked off about 10 of tube length from the well pump and prepared to make my cut by the way i used a set of ratcheting pipe cutters if you dont have a set of these they go for about 11 at home depot and they make life so much easier when youre doing plumbing making the tube shorter would result in a shallower suspension and hopefully preserve the life of the new pump i was not prepared for what i would find when i made the cut yuck thats a 1 tube so full of compacted muck that it really restricted the flow of water to my house no wonder the pump failed keep in mind weve done testing for harmful bacteria and a slew of other things on our well and its always come up clean but still ew what youre seeing in this picture isnt just silt its residue from iron bacteria these microorganisms live and multiply by oxidizing dissolved ferrous iron theyre harmless to ingest but they can tinge the flavorcolor of water and they impede the yield of the well if left unchecked toward the end of this instructible well talk about the sanitation process which can really help keep these little buggers in check bottom line there was no way to clean this out so a new water line went on the shopping list for the hardware store add tip ask question comment download step 18 cut the wires cut the wires and get ready to head to the store add tip ask question comment download step 19 oh one more thing inspect the pitless connector before we head to the store to buy the replacement pump we needed to make sure that the shopping list included everything we already knew we needed the well pump and the water line but what kind of shape was the pitless adapter in i know it looks rough but its actually not that bad i gave it a quick scrub under the garden hose and inspected the oring its not great but its fine add tip ask question comment download step 20 selecting a replacement pump at the hardware store i genuinely recommend that you do a little searching around on the web for a replacement pump before jumping in your car and assuming that home depot or lowes will have the one you need in stock i got extremely lucky i didnt search before i got in the car the nearest store happened to have the pump i needed i later learned it was the only one in stock within 30 miles of me as luck would have it it also turns out that this one produces ten gallons per minute at a lower rated amperage than the original hooray for improvements in technology this flotec pump had a sticker price of under 340 since it was memorial day they gave me the 10 veterans discount at home depot shameless plug for businesses that respect military service in the end it wound up costing me a little over 300 good deal note this model did not come with the check valve or the reducer needed to get down to the 1 spur i would need for the water line sadly home depot didnt carry the right check valve or spur for this pump i had to go somewhere else for that a place that did not offer the veterans discount and hence shall not be named in this instructable add tip ask question comment download step 21 get the stuff home and start putting it together i got everything home and started throwing it together note that i did not use pipe dope i used teflon tape pipe dope isnt always safe for potable water so its recommended that you just stick with teflon looking at the closeup picture of the assembly theres a 1 14 stainless nipple threaded into the top of the well pump a 1 14 check valve brass and a stainless steel reducer aka spur that goes into the hose line i used my salvaged hose clamps to secure the new water line to the reducer some people may read this and wonder what is a check valve its basically a valve that only allows fluids to move in one direction water can flow into your house when the pump pushes it but it cant drain back into the well when the pump stops this is a vital component because when your system gets pressurized the check valve keeps all the water in your house from dumping back down into the well kind of a big deal note if you have to do something like this dont use plastic components alsomake sure you ask a professional about galvanic corrosion putting the wrong metal in contact with other metals can lead to bad things happening putting incompatible metal in a moist environment only tends to accelerate those bad things add tip ask question comment download step 22 securing the electrical connections while youre at the hardware store make sure to pick up a set of crimp connectors for the electrical connections it should come with two connectors and some heatshrink material strip a clean bit off of the wires coming from the house and crimp the connectors with a good pair of pliers slide the heatshrink material over the connection and then heat it with a heatgun or a butane torch a lighter doesnt get hot enough to do a good job then start wrapping the whole thing up in electrical tape just like you found it add tip ask question comment download step 23 secure the safety rope secure the safety rope to the pump itself they have a handy little loop built into them just for this add tip ask question comment download step 24 put on the torque arrestor test the pump and put it back down the well put the torque arrestor back on its not pictured but i also secured the electrical wiring and the safety rope to the water line by wrapping it with electrical tape at 1218 intervals once you get to this point youre ready to make sure the well pump is working i forgot to take a picture of that part but it goes like this get a big bucket like a 1020 gallon plastic tub and use your awesome neighbors hose to fill it up with water then submerge the assembled well pump into the water making sure water covers the impeller intakes then put your cell phones to good use have your assistant go down into the basement and flip the breaker that will turn on the pump you should immediately see it sucking water out of the tub at a rapid rate if it does the pump is ready to go back down in the hole make sure you kill the breaker before handling the pump again feed the pump back into the casing slowly using the safety rope line up the pitless connector using a flashlight slide it into place and then seat it fully by giving it a couple of downward whacks with a hammer until you feel it seated properly add tip ask question comment download step 25 prepare the pressure tank youre just about ready to turn it back on but first you have to make sure the air pressure in the pressure tank is set correctly unthread the cap on the top of the tank youll see a little nubbin like on a bike tire for the pressure tank to work correctly the ambient pressure while completely drained has to be 2lbs from the pressure at which you want the well pump switch to kick on i like my water pressure to be between 55 and 75 psi that means the ideal air pressure for the bladder in the tank was about 53 psi i hooked up an air compressor and filled it until it reached that point not performing this step will cause a variety of problems not the least of which is short cycling if you have too little or too much air in the tank it can throw off the actual volume of water the tank will hold that can lead to the pump constantly switching onoff which eventually burns out the pump or the pump switch not good add tip ask question comment download step 26 adjusting the pump switch what youre looking at here is a well pump switch they come preset for 3050 and 4060 the first number is the psi at which the switch will sense the pressure in the system is too low and it will turn the pump on the second number is the number at which the pressure in the system makes the switch say okay thats enough this well switch is brand new i bought it the night before i replaced the well pump hoping that it would fix my well problem obviously it didnt anyway i dont like it when my water pressure is set for 4060 i like it to be at about 5575 this particular model of well switch is adjustable with a few turns of this nut i can raise the ratio to the place where i want it warning i did this with power applied this is extremely dangerous because the wires about 14 away from my shiny metal wrench are pushing 250v you have to be very careful when you do this and i dont recommend that anyone try it the reason i do it is that it lets me make my adjustments without constantly having to reset the breaker i tweak it and let the pressure tank fill up i then use the valve underneath to release water pressure as i release the pressure i watch the gauge to see what point the switch kicked on once i adjusted it to the point where the pump flipped on at 55 psi i was good to go once youre done put the cap back on the switch and go upstairs add tip ask question comment download step 27 victory dancego outside and show off your power stance as you spray glorious hose water all over yourself yes thats right im that neighbor add tip ask question comment download step 28 sanitize the well whenever you open the well cap or replace the piping theres a requirement to pour some bleach down there to kill off any harmful bacteria that may want to live in the water after being touched by your filthy human digits first you have to calculate the volume of water thats in the well in my case im going to guess that its about 70 of total water space in a 6 tube using the formula πr²h 314159x9x840 you get a total volume of about 23750 cubic inches thats about 102 gallons of water occupying the well at its fullest point proper chlorination requires 3 pints of 5 chlorine bleach per 100 gallons of water in the well plus 3 pints of the same to sanitize the plumbing inside the house thats a total of 6 pints of 5 chlorine bleach a gallon is 8 pints so a single gallon will be enough to do the job and sanitize the well cap before i put it back on heres what you do dump about 34 of the gallon of bleach in the well with the water pump still on so you can still use your hose then run your hose down the well to circulate the bleach this process will pull bleach water into your house so dont plan on using the water during this process run the hose for about an hour to get the water from the bottom all the way back up to the top ensuring that the chlorine mixes with all the water in the well then use the remaining 14 of the bottle to sanitize the well cap put the cap back on and go inside turn on every tap in the house sequentially run cold water until you smell bleach at every tap give the toilets a few flushes to pull water into them also once you smell the bleach turn it off the chlorine will sit in your pipes and kill off anything living in them repeat the process using the hot water its going to take a little longer for the bleach smell to show up because the water from the well is going to have to make it through your water heater and then up through the hot water pipes go to sleep it has to sit for at least 12 hours undisturbed no sinks no flushies no washies the next day hook up your hoses and start purging dont suck the well dry while you do it also dont drain the bleach water into the leech field for your septic system remember there were about 100 gallons in the well so figure out how many gallons per minute you push through the hoses and stop when you hit about 150 gallons through the system in my case that was about an hour and a half once you hit that point cut the hoses off then purge the inside of the house if you have a septic tank i dont youll want to capture anything out of the sinks with a bucket so that you dont kill off the bacteria in the septic system dont forget that the cold water lines and the hot water lines are completely separate youll have to drain them both make sure you dump the water someplace safe run each tap for a couple of minutes give the toilets a flush or two then test the water for chlorine content to make sure its safe to drink with a kit you can get from the hardware or pool supplies store keep running the water until the test comes back at safe levels to drink thanks for reading i really hope that this instructible is helpful for those of you that find yourself in a spot of trouble and for anyone thats just curious about how this process works it was my first time going through it and the main reason i put this together was that i couldnt find a really good resource that guided me through the whole thing stepbystep this is my way of paying the world back for all of the little kindnesses ive experienced in life if you ever find yourself in a similar position regardless of the topic i would ask that you consider doing the same you never know who you might be helping i do my best to respond to any comments that pop up i appreciate you taking the time to read good luckadd tip ask question comment download step 29 update electrical issuesthis is just a follow on note to capture a lesson learned i wrote this ible in may of 2015 it is now october of 2017 late last night the well cut out on me it was the first time weve had any issue since i did the installation ill spare you all the details of what i went through to figure out the problem bottom line when i replaced the well pump i probably should have replaced the electrical wiring going down to the pump two reasons for this 1 the wire i inherited was some kind of specialized 12 gauge submersible pump wire old school prone to problems it didnt have a ground wire which i thought was weird at the time but figured the previous pump had been working for years without it so made due with what i had 2 that old school wire can go bad on you even with a torque arrestor in place the pumps can spin inside of the casing which twist the power line if given enough time the wire will eventually break which is what happened to me the moral of the story replacing your electrical wiring only costs about 150 if you go with the highend 12 gauge nocasing submersible wiring you can get at places like lowes the good thing about the newer stuff is that it doesnt tend to break when it gets twisted up if you dont want to have to pull your well pump up out of the casing again just to change the wiring three years after you did the job maybe take care of it while you have it out of the ground the first time high fiveadd tip ask question comment download share did you make this project share it with usi made itrecommendations spark plug aeroplaneby

there a way to clear it out or did the pump go back into the mudd or did i miss that part some where im asking cuse im about to do mine this summer and im sur it has the same issue down there answer from jamesburkefan 7 days ago youve hit a sore point on this ible im not entirely convinced that the gunk you see on the outside of the old well pump is mud i think it may be iron bacteria deposits what i did in this case was measure how far the water line was from the top of the casing to confirm that it wasnt way down at the bottom of the well when i was sure that i had a good 70 of submersion i just cut out about 20 of the down pipe this meant that the pump would be suspended higher in the well than it was previously if mud was a problem i pulled it out of it ask question58 commentscammers 2 years ago reply very nice instructable well done  and thanks for sharing just a couple of comments that might be of help just looking at the pictures of the slimy red gunk in your pipe and around your pump makes me think you should do some googling on iron bacteria i cant be certain but it could be a possible cause of your issues adjusting a pressure switch can be very fiddly and frustrating  and as you say very very very dangerous if the switch is live most household applications work perfectly with either 2040 or 3050 psi thats why they are normally sold set up that way when selecting the replacement pump dont just assume that the last guy chose the perfect pump for the job after all there could be a reason the original pump failed i would recommend going back to basics and select a pump based on the bore depth the standing water level the required flow the maximum flow the bore can supply if you know it and the total dynamic head total pressure including friction from pipe work elevation and require operating pressure pump ends are made up of a stack of impellers each impeller increases the pressure developed by the impellers below it without increasing flow so a shallow well might need a six impeller pump while a deep one will need more perhaps twenty or more the upshot of this is that there are hundreds of motorpump end combinations to choose from and while its not a particularly exact science its important to choose one that will operate happily in your application you should be able to find pressureflow charts on pump company websites and catalogues

is definitely a good onejamesburkefan 2 years ago in reply to cammers reply ill just reply to both your comments here since its easier than doing it twice iron bacteria thank you for the tip were in a situation here where the house had two owners before we bought it in 2011 the first owners were amazing the second owners were really nice folks but the word around the neighborhood and the evidence weve seen around the house is that they were not maintenance people weve gradually been replacing the bigticket items as they fail from the years of neglect ive already replaced most of the plumbing between the well pump switch and the house including the water softener and neutralizer they were both so clogged up with gunk that the valve systems failed nothing like a mouth full of salt water after a regeneration weve had the well checked for harmful bacteria a couple of times it always comes up clean i dont know for sure if they test for stuff that isnt particularly harmful now that youve mentioned it its definitely on my radar i had never considered that bacteria might be the cause of the sediment sticking to the plumbing any tips on cleaning out the underground pipe that runs from the pressure tank to the well without having to dig it upcammers 2 years ago in reply to jamesburkefan reply hi i dont have a solution for cleaning out your pipe but im not a plumber im sure there must be a way maybe you could put the question to the instructables community via a forum topic i guess you live in a place with cold winters ive never seen a pipe buried so deep that must really complicate things bores in australia just have the pipe coming straight out the top of the well no need for that pitless connector good luck with it all jonny1128 2 years ago reply i dont need to fix

read it it made my day thank you is not a sufficient response without providing an appropriate qualification 1 interesting is exactly what i was going for even though this was a filthy job 2 this was my first ible it has been so well received that i think i am now hooked you will definitely be seeing more from me and i hope they are as entertaining and informative as it appears this one has been 3

because from the first few things i read it was going to cost me thousands to fix youre the reason i went from i have no water and i cant afford to fix it to i think i can do this and i did i read your instructable several okay like 20 times before i even attempted to begin the process and i referenced it many more times along the way end result is that i have a brand new pump and the best water pressure weve ever had we also changed out the pressure tank and the pressure switch if you dont mind id like to mention a couple things that i came across throughout the process that i think might help some other people first i have a well that is 300 deep so i wasnt sure if i could pull it myself i turns out the i was able to rent a pump puller for 154 from a local rental place for the day which made my life a lot easier both when i took the pump out and when i put it back in also you used liquid bleach to sanitize your well  i tried that but when i tested it it failed testing positive for coliform i did more reading on the issue and apparently a combination of bleach pellets and a bleach slurry can fix a well that tests positive for coliform the jug of bleach pellets was 25 at a local supply store and ive got enough left to sanitize my well probably five or six times from what i read the pellets can drop to the bottom of the well in a way that the liquid bleach cant i know that you mentioned that you tested your water and i think thats really important  i was really surprised that my well failed when weve never had a problem with it before the water test kit i found was around 30 at lowes anyway my well is better than its ever been before and i know an entirely new set of skills as a result i felt great when my brotherinlaws well pump failed not even a week after mine weird right and i was able to help him with it seriously i cant thank you enough for taking the time to post your instructable it absolutely saved my day take carejamesburkefan 3 months ago
