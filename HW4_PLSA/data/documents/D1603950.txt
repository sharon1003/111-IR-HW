cajun 11 2016 206 pmhi important question is that a one way or round trip in just two weeks if the latter its going to be a pacy trip accounting for time in sf still quick if the former but at least it will give you a better chance of doing some decent sightseeing on route edited 209 pm june 11 2016reply report inappropriate contentlaroblesdejesus san antonio texas5 posts save reply2 re road trip

to san francisco cajun 11 2016 258 pmwell its 1700 miles one way the quickest route which is 3 good driving days  2 nights  each way plus the 4 in sf leaving you 5 to extend the drives well heres a suggestion to start with1 san antonio to carlsbad for caverns next day2 to alamogordo for white sands nm after caverns3 to tucson for saguaro4 to northern outskirts of la via joshua tree np drive through5 to sf with a dip into big sur cambria to monterey6 9 sf10 sf to bishop through yosemite11 bishop to kingman through death valley  if temps are viable if not somewhere down ca99 on night before12 kingman to gcnp13 gcnp to albuquerque14 big driving day back to san antonio via lubbock a few more days would make this vastly improved edited 301 pm june 11 2016reply report inappropriate

depending on your routecarlsbad caverns national park white sands national monumentgrand canyon np hoover dam death valley national park yosemite or a more southerly track to the california coast and san diego and the attractions there up the coast along pch with stops at hearst castle julia pfeiffer burns state park point lobos state natural reserve the aquarium at monterey the redwoods at henry cowell state park and into sf of course you will have to make choices about what you can see and do in your time framenot all of this is possible in two weeks with 4 days in sf by going west along one route and returning to sa by another you can fit in a bit more reply report inappropriate contentlaroblesdejesus san antonio texas5 posts save reply5 re road trip from san antonio tx to san francisco
