known as sky captain  jude law and intrepid reporter polly perkins  gwyneth paltrow  angelina jolie also appears as royal navy commander francesca franky cook they begin investigating the affairs of the mysterious german scientist dr totenkopf after his machines attack new york city searching for something further implicating totenkopf is a string of kidnapped scientists all of whom point back to totenkopfs work the plot shamelessly uses the outrageous gadgets and cliches of the pulp magazine and comic book genres plus numerous shout outs to other media of the period filmed with live actors against computergenerated surroundings the movie did not make enough money to offset its production costs so a sequel is unlikely the movie has the following awesome but impractical machines airborne aircraft carrier frankys heliocarrier which serves as mobile recon outpost for the royal navy the royal navy has a lot more of them as seen in the end of the movie attack drone radiocontrolled ornithopters armed with multiple autocannons drill tank the giant drill machine in totenkopfs uranium mine flying car the hoversleds in totenkopfs elaborate underground base humongous tin can mecha giant bipedal robots armed with frickin laser beams stomp through the streets of new york they can fly as well military mashup machine sky captains curtiss p40 can change into a submersible it also has the ability to project limpet mines and grapnelwires robot antennae the giant robots and robotic flying machines all had antennae for receiving instructions schizo tech a radioimager drone sends

robot guarding the underwater entrance to dr totenkopfs island spider tank the crab robots guarding the underwater approaches to totenkopfs island the swarm the oneeyed squid robots that search the

squadron cool planes that can transform in middive into submersibles armed with clustertorpedoes they also have an ejection seat with builtin jet pack leading to a crowning moment of awesome for angelina jolie zeppelins from another world the hindenburg iii docks at the empire state building in the opening scene though in reality the docking spire was inoperable from the beginning due to strong updrafts and the lack of a mooring point for the other end of an airship other tropes include absurdly dedicated worker dr totenkopfs machines carry on his work of assembling a noahs arktype rocket and loading animals on it despite him having died 20 years prior action dress rip polly tears her skirt to run better during the nyc robot attack but leaves on the heels action girl commander francesca franky cook of the royal navy who sports an eyepatch of power she is also part of a love triangle in the movie theres also the mysterious woman a silent but deadly woman who controls totenkopfs machines and turns out to be a robot girl advertised extra angelina jolie s frankie appears for about fifteen minutes despite the very heavy presence of jolie in the films marketing disappointment over this has been blamed for some of the films negative audience reaction aerial canyon chase the title character flies his fighter plane along the streets of new york just above ground level while trying to escape dr totenkopfs robot ornithopters alternate history there is a hindenburg iii zeppelin in the opening scene which implies either that the first hindenburg did not explode or else its explosion was not an impediment to further airship construction the entire movie is obviously alternate history there were no humongous mecha robots destroying the world in 1939 neither was there space travel rayguns or flying british naval squadrons there are some subtler alternate history implications though such as the apparent absence of nazi germany and an americanbritish evacuation of nanjing which of course implies that japan still annexed manchuria and china aluminum christmas trees the concept of a heroic  army for hire  is puzzling to modern viewers but is actually where joes backstory crosses into real life before building the flying legion he flew for the first american volunteer group of the chinese air force a mercenary organization nicknamed the flying tigers anachronism stew anguished declaration of love spoofed joe sullivan believes polly perkins deliberately sabotaged his plane in china while going for the big scoop when theyre trapped in a cave packed with dynamite thats about to explode joe looks her in the eyes and asks  if she really did cut his fuel line polly is understandably annoyed that theyre going to spend their last moments on earth discussing this point and on totenkopfs island she admits she did a pissed off joe then admits that he did sleep with franky apologetic attacker — played with the note totenkopf leaves at his death chair reads forgive me and theres indications he tried to shut down his entire project and its implied his robot assassinkidnapper rebelled when he tried to shut everything down belligerent sexual tension polly and joe bicker throughout the movie joe could we just for once die without all this bickering bedmate reveal after an outrun the fireball moment polly wakes up naked in a bed next to an equally naked joe an embarrassed polly tells him to turn around which a grinning joe does only to find hes also in bed with their guide kaji who is also naked bilingual bonus thanks to understanding what totenkopf actually means germanspeaking viewers will figure out a crucial plot twist long before the rest of the audience does bilingual dialogue polly can understand both written and spoken german blatant lies joe looks polly in the eyes and earnestly says he never had an affair with frankie polly confesses to cutting his fuel line a pissedoff joe promptly confesses to the affair brick joke polly really did sabotage joes plane in manchuria bring it the mysterious woman makes a gesture to sky captain before fighting him outside the rocket ship camera obscurer polly perkins spends much of the movie with only one frame left on her only roll of film and wants to save it for a truly awesome photo in the films denouement she decides to take a photo of joe sullivan only for him to look at her and say  lenscap  catchphrase joe sky captain says good boy dex whenever his sidekick dex does something good chair reveal dr totenkopf only it turns out hes been dead all along chekhovs gun the two metal tubes that polly perkins received from dr jennings dex also built chekhovs ray gun and is seen chewing chekhovs gum chroma key the actors used only the most basic sets and props with cgi backgrounds used in every shot this was allegedly done for two reasons one the producers wanted to give the movie a comic book atmosphere and two the studio was too small to accommodate such large sets cutandpaste environments toward the beginning of the movie just after the robots attack manhattan sky captain lands at his base and drives his plane into a huge hangar at the top of the doors of the hangar are these huge windows of 8x10 panes in every window some of the panes are broken in every window its exactly the same panes that are broken cutting the gordian knot polly and the door to dr jennings lab deliberately monochrome filmed in colour and desaturated then resaturated again to make it more like a painting than a photorealistic movie diesel punk with a healthy helping of tesla punk and raygun gothic to boot disintegrator ray gadgeteer genius dex is shown testing a buck rogers raygun that can burn a hole through solid metal with luminous rings of energy to a lesser extent the superelectric field outside of totenkopfs room that disintegrates anyone who steps on it first stripping them to a skeleton then pulverizing that to dust an unfortunate noname scientist finds this out the hard way the dragon dr totenkopfs action girl agent a rather extreme case of dragon their feet dragon ascendant the agent acts as the effective big bad after we learn that totenkopfs long dead the end of the world as we know it the planetcolonizing rocketship seems benign until its revealed that its afterburners will ignite the earths atmosphere eureka moment rana is a star eyepatch of power franky angelina jolies characterfake shemp laurence olivier via the magic of stock footage and cgi comes back to life as dr totenkopf the fantastic trope of wonderous titles as a deliberate throwback foreshadowing totenkopf is german for deaths head which is a subtle clue to the fact that hes been dead all along totenkopfs monster has starved to death this would seem like simple cruelty except the master isnt around to feed it and the robots arent interested in pet care forgot to feed the monster totenkopfs lair has a giant nowskeletal beast chained up outside his lair the other one however is either alive or something is tugging on its chain just offscreen so joe and penny opt to use a drainage pipe instead of risking it this is the first hint that the robots are running the show genre throwback to 30s scifi and 40s50s war fiction giant flyer the protagonists encounter giant prehistoric birds on totenkopfs island a god am i totenkopf in the video that plays while his rocket is rising through the atmosphere it plays a twisted version of the first few verses of genesis replacing him as god and him seeing that man was evil gratuitous german the german in this movie is often mangled a particularly noticeable example is a button labeled with dringlichkeitsfreigabe which then gets translated as emergency release while it actually means urgency release it should be notfallfreigabeabkopplungentriegelungfreisetzung but then theyd have needed a bigger button the german newspaper headline about the robot invasion translates to very big metallc sic machines steal steal reservesthe grotesque the sole survivor of dr totenkopfs uranium mining and experiments gunship rescue an entire fleet of heliocarriers turns up to rescue the protagonists at the end though they dont really need saving by that stage and dex has a big damn heroes moment when he arrives in a hoversled just in time to save joe and polly from the swarm of flying killer robots hes dead jim dr jennings slumps and his hand opens spilling two metal vials polly tells sky captain hes dead without checking his life signs herr doktor all the scientists are german and austrian hindenburg incendiary principle the film set in an alternate timeline has multiple zeppelins from another world the zeppelin hindenburg iii arrives safely in new york but when dr totenkopfs robots attack sky captains base the zeppelins moored overhead are set aflame by enemy attack holding hands joe is helping polly out of the cockpit only to quickly drop her hand and leave her to clamber off the plane when frankie shows up homages the attack by giant bipedal robots is copied from the 1941 superman cartoon the mechanical monsters the giant robots laser soundeffects are the same as the martian heat ray in the 1953 the war of the worlds film similarly pollys phonedin report on the attack uses lines lifted from the famous orson welles radio broadcast on seeing one of the robots dex mutters  shazam  the silhouette of godzilla can be seen in a newspaper from japan the headline indicates that the big g popped up to fight off the robots anachronisms be damned during an underwater sequence we see both the wreck of the rms titanic and the ship from king kong 1933 complete with apeholding cage king kong himself can be seen at the top of the empire state building during one shot with the robots in the streets the flying robots on totenkopfs island have the same chest controls as commando codys jet pack the wizard of oz is seen playing in the cinema where polly meets with one of the scientists and the entire totenkopf hologram head sequence is a massive homage to the the wizard of oz s giant head scene captain sky even mentions the film when the hologram appears and starts speaking hostage for mac guffin when dr totenkopfs thugs capture polly perkins in the uranium mine hologram projection imperfection as the protagonists approach dr totenkopfs office a teslatype generator creates a huge holographic head of totenkopf that explains his motives and warns them to get out or die both the image and voice are distorted when powering up highlighting the more primitive 1930s zeerust technology of the film the imperfections also hint this is a case of the tape knew you would say that hyperspace arsenal the many many things concealed in joes p40 warhawk its anyones guess where the planes builders found room to put the fuel and engine infodump dex and the scientists explain totenkopfs entire plan as well as mentioning an offscreen escape where the majority of them got killed in a single moment of exposition although not unusual in the comic books on which the movie is based the scene appears clumsy on screen intrepid reporter polly island of mystery totenkopfs island base it is beyond saving totenkopfs motive in creating his world of tomorrow and destroying the old one in the process its the only way spoofed sky captain is it safe dex well theres only one way to find out sky captain and polly step across the boobytrapped threshold holding hands and in lockstep and are relieved to be unharmeddex  i meant throw something justified title the character name and the noun phrase title is obviously a reference to the retrofuturistic nature of the movie but sky captain is the nickname of the main character and the villain calls his scheme to seed life on another planet the world of tomorrow knuckle cracking after joseph joe sullivan aka sky captain enters his office and pours out some milk of magnesia he cracks his neck presumably to relieve stress lets split up gang sky captain while in dr totenkopfs abandoned uranium mine lois lane while polly doesnt have the myopic identity problems lois had shes definitely filling this role in the film as the nononsense female reporter determined to follow the hero to the end and get the story mad scientist laboratory the laboratory of dr walter jennings with mutated fetus and tiny elephant and the room in shangrila shown in a deleted scene where totenkopf conducted experiments on radiation victims from his uranium mine meaningful name totenkopf is german for dead mans head or skull totenkopf wanted to destroy the world and create a new one out in space it also harkens back to nazi germanys ss totenkopf division which was in charge of the concentration camps its most likely an allusion to the fact that he appears as a huge holographic headand that hes actually been dead all along minor crime reveals major plot kidnapping scientists  plot to build a spaceship that will destroy the earths atmosphere misguided missile twice both by frankie and sky captain my god what have i done  totenkopf realizing the error of his ways and unable to stop what he started the rocket hes sending off the planet will destroy the earths atmosphere to escape its gravity simply leaves a note on his corpse forgive me names to run away from really fast dr totenkopf  dead mans head skull in german  subverted hes literally a dead man and it is implied that he was rather a wellintentioned extremist its more commonly used by germans as a name for the bare skull hence the skull motif never trust a trailer angelina jolie is in the movie for all of 15 minutes but youd think she was a main character noahs story arc dr totenkopf believed that earth was doomed due to the destructive nature of humanity so he built a rocket ship to carry two of every animal on earth and genetically engineered humans to another planet he intended them to create a technological utopia there noodle incident polly is visibly annoyed when fellow fliers and implied exlovers franky and joe share an incomprehensible nostalgia moment joe and franky protect the rabbits protect the rabbits no osha compliance the walkways inside the rocket ship theyre barely wide enough to walk on and have no railings justified in that the actual dr totenkopf is long dead and his operation is being carried out automatically via robots drones and mechs obviously they would not bother with human safety hazards one bullet left polly is down to one shot left in her camera so shes forced to forgo the chance to photograph the lost kingdom of shangrila a topsecret flying aircraft carrier a giant prehistoric bird and every creature on earth being loaded twobytwo into a giant rocketship in the end polly passes up the scoop of the century for a photograph of joe  who promptly informs her she left the lens cap on note outrun the fireball as tons of dynamite inside a uranium mine are about to explode sky captain polly perkins and sky captains friend kaji try to run out of the mine to safety when the dynamite explodes theyre blasted out of the mouth of the mine and wind up flat on their faces in the snow percussive prevention joe knocks out polly to stop her from accompanying him on a oneway trip to destroy totenkopfs rocketship it doesnt work plummet perspective happens on at least three occasions practical voiceover a radio announcer along with a spinning paper montage is used to show that the robot attack on new york is part of a worldwide phenomenon prophetic names totenkopf literally dead mans head ie skull in german not only alluding to the skull symbol on his creations but guess what you find him as well still sorta intact put down your gun and step away one of dr totenkopfs mooks tries this on joe in the tibetan uranium mine putting on the reich dr totenkopfs emblem looks very much like nazi germany s coat of arms with a deaths head in place of a swastika raygun gothic reconstruction redshirt army the flying legion gets wiped out by an air raid but joe is only concerned about his missing buddy dex additionally frankys troops reckless gun usage joe emphasizes his get out to polly with a brandished webley pointed at her stomach with his finger on the trigger dex staring at the gun oh great we all made up joe escort polly off the base dex if she resists shoot her recurring camera shot has one near the beginning when the robots arrive in new york first with bystanders pointing at them three of them lined up in a row followed by the police shooting at them arranged and framed the same way reluctant mad scientist the former members of unit 11 running gag polly and joes discussions about whether she cut his fuel line as it turns out she did cut it polly missing a shot with her camera or having it not show up for any reason shes a reporter this is very important the shangrila shangrila itself whose people were forced to work in totenkopfs uranium mine shoot out the lock the title character throws an object and hits the control box for a door causing the door to close shoutout by the dozen everything from the land that time forgot the wizard of oz the neverending story apples 1984 commercial star wars episode i and the anime film castle in the sky some people view the movie as a spiritual licensee of crimson skies godzilla appears on one of the newspaper headlines in a blink and youll miss it cameo in the scene where sky captain is flying back and forth down the street attacking the giant robots in one shot the empire state building is framed in the background  with king kong hanging from the top theyve reached sixth avenue theyve reached fifth avenue theyre a hundred yards away oh my god big slowmoving robots that are immune to bullets and fly around casting ominous shadows and stealing things from baffled citizens seems to pay homage to this old superman cartoon 1the sound effects of the giant robots lasers are the sounds of the martian heat rays in the war of the worlds dr jennings laboratory is located in a new york city basement suite 1138 sidekick dex to joe sky captain but theres a lot more to dex than this he may look like a skinny little nerd but hes taken a level in badass and has matters well in hand when joe finally arrives to rescue him to his credit joe doesnt seem very surprised and just asks for a heads up on the plan sitting duck the flying legion is caught on the ground by an air raid launched by totenkopfs robot flyers stripped to the bone one of the escaping scientists on totenkopfs island gets skeletonised by a bolt of electricity from a tesla coil stylistic suck a couple of effects were cgied to resemble early stopmotion effects from serials note this does not apply to the films overall sepiatone look which is quite elaborate surprise vehicle dex in one of totenkopfs hoversleds that was the last entry when the group finally gets to totenkopfs office they find his papers and discover that the last entry in his journal was made on october 11 1918 20 years before the setting of the film shortly thereafter they find his mummified body there was a door inverted too awesome to use see one bullet left traitor shot two of the guides look at each other while standing under joes plane as sinister music plays travel montage as joe and polly fly around the world lines of latitude and longitude and other cartographic symbols appear superimposed on the scenery below turned against their masters implied when they finally find dr totenkopf the good doctor is in no state to argue and the note reading forgive me left on his corpse seems to suggest that he had second thoughts about his plan and tried to shut down his machines only for them to shut him down first visionary villain dr totenkopf plans to restart the wold with an ark of his own design what happened to the mouse  a survivor of totenkopfs experiments asks for one last favor to be killed we never find out if joe obliges although his rather sad look after theyve left shangrila implies that he did it why wont you die  invoked wordforword when the dragon beaten revealed as a robot girl and left for dead at the villains island sneaks into the rocketship to attack joe one last time would hit a girl in a rare heroicnoble example joe knocks polly out to keep her from needlessly putting her life in danger wouldnt hit a girl on the other hand when sky captain first encounters the mysterious woman he stops to say he doesnt want to hurt her giving her a chance to escape wronski feint subverted it looks like joe is doing this with the ornithopters chasing him out over the water when actually he has every intention of actually crashing into the ocean his plane is able to transform into a submersible modezeerust basically the whole point of the film influences include the futuristic designs of norman bel geddes raymond lloyd and hugh ferriss previous index
