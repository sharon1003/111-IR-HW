to the use of allegra 180 mg tablets 2 i need to get information on the relationship of heart arrhythmia due to use of allegra  oral  180 mg tablets to easy skin rash urticaria symptoms 3 is there a way of restoring normal hr heart function after not longer taking allegra 180 mg tablets thanks for the info i am a 60 year old male with copd and had atrial fib until the ablation 3 months ago immediately after the ablation i felt like superman with no arrhythmia and very moderate copd that was stable this past month i developed atrial flutter the 3 medicines they have attempted with me destroy my breathing capacity with a unpredictable onset those medicines have included metoprolol gave me headaches discontinued amiodarone read about how toxic it is throughout every organ discontinued lastly diltiazem and flecainide the diltiazem does not seem to negatively affect my breathing the last medicine which i am stopping tonight is flecainide i cannot maintain any stable capacitive breathing i am reading that the recommended drugs for these two medical issues contraindicate each other by using some of the same transporters with opposite effects furthermore that cardiologists and pulmonary specialists don’t generally see eye to eye or want to talk to each other is this why they don’t what can i do about it are there two medicines one for copd and one for atrial flutter that work well with each other coffee theopylline is the fastest way to get my breathing back but my heart races and works against any rhythm control drugs wtf after i took one tab of this drug i experienced severe vertigonausea and still am experiencing it more than two days later although not as severe will azo cranberry help my itching caused by high blood pressure will the

allergy season has high impact on most people i am 20 years in the food industry and an amateur foodie i suspected last year that allegra was affecting my taste but couldnt prove it this year i noted exactly the date i took my 1st pill of the season and at certain foods before that date and purposely 1 week later noticeable difference i would not say allegra caused me to loose my sense of taste but it has definitely altered it nothing taste as good or as sharp as it did before allegra i think i am going to risk backing off the allegra i cant stand iti am stopping allegra today to see if it helps in alleviating my rls i am also starting a low fodmop diet gluten free etcas the studies are finding a definite correlation starting higher doses of organic turmeric as well i refuse to go on
