part 3 calculating energy released1 find the difference in temperature subtract the initial temperature from the final temperature this will tell you how much the water temperature was changed by the burning fuel underneath convert this number to celsius if you your measurements were not in celsius you can convert a number from fahrenheit to celsius by using the equation where c is the temperature in celsius and f is the temperature in fahrenheit an example is 24 째c 752 째f  20 degrees celsius  4 degrees celsius2 multiply the temperature difference by the specific heat of water the specific heat of water is the amount of heat it takes to raise the temperature of one gram of water by one degree celsius for water the specific heat is one calorie per gram celsius that means it takes one calorie to heat one gram of water by one degree celsius 5the unit for specific heat is written as 1 calorie  gram x degrees celsius multiplying this by the temperature difference yields 4 째c 392 째f x 1 calorie  gram x degree celsius  4 calories  gram3 factor in the mass of the water now multiply the product of the heat difference and specific heat by the amount of water you used one milliliter of water is equal to one gram of water make sure you are using the unit grams 6this will yield your energetic release 4 calories  gram x 100 grams 35 oz  400 calories4 realize that your system loses some energy while some of the heat released is going directly up and into the water your system is not perfect some heat will be lost to the surrounding air a small amount of heat will also be absorbed by the can itself there is little that can be done to compensate for the heat loss if you are trying to do highly precise experiments you may invest in a commercial calorimeter but even then you will not be one hundred percent efficient 7
