hypersensitivity to any components of prickly pear pregnancylactation avoid use during pregnancy and lactation because of the lack of clinical studies interactions none well documented adverse reactions dermatitis is the most common adverse reaction to prickly pear toxicology little information is available botany prickly pears are members of the cactacceae or cactus family which includes about 97 genera and 1600 species the species are found in europe mediterranean countries africa southwestern united states and northern mexico plants in the genus opuntia prefer a dry hot climate and consist of perennial shrubs trees and creeping plants prickly pear can grow 5 to 8 m in height its roots are shallow but the plant can spread up to 40 m in diameter over the ground the stems are branched leaves are cylindrical in shape and the plant is covered with barbtipped bristles known as glochids that are unique to opuntia  its flowers petals and sepals are numerous in quantity and color the oval pearshaped purplish fruit is pulpy and sweet but may be covered with spines or bristles the seeds within the pulp are diskshaped and have numerous colors 1  2  3  5  6  7because information on this species as a whole is sparse the following subspecies are also included in various aspects of the discussion opuntia fulginosa  opuntia megacantha  opuntia dillenii  opuntia microdasys  opuntia bieglovii  opuntia acanthocarpa  history prickly pear is widely cultivated and used in juices jellies candies teas and alcoholic drinks the fruits and flowers of the plant are used as natural food colorants cactus gum is used to stiffen cloth essential oils from the flowers are used to make perfumes and the seeds are a source of oil prickly pear has also been used as a source of animal feed and dye 1  4there are numerous medicinal uses of the plant american indians used prickly pear juice to treat burns often a cone of plant material would be burned on the skin to treat irritation or infection a process known as moxabustion in chinese medicine the lakota tribe used prickly pear in a tea to assist mothers during childbirth 1prickly pear has a long history of traditional mexican folk medicine use particularly as a treatment for diabetes prickly pear pads have been used as a poultice for rheumatism the fruit has been used for treating diarrhea asthma and gonorrhea the fleshy stems or cladodes have been used to treat high cholesterol blood pressure gastric acidity ulcers fatigue dyspnea glaucoma liver conditions and wounds 1  8 in south korea the plant has been used to treat abdominal pain bronchial asthma burns diabetes and indigestion 9 in sicily a flower decoction of prickly pear has been used as a diuretic the cladodes were valued for their antiinflammatory activity in treating edema arthrosis and whooping cough and for preventing wound infection 1prickly pear has also been planted on steep slopes to control erosion 3chemistry the medicinal components of the plant are found in the flowers leaves or pads and fruit isorhamnetinglucoside kaempferol luteolin penduletin piscidic acids quercetrin rutin and βsitosterol have been found in the flowers of prickly pear 10 the leaves or pads are rich in mucilage and consist primarily of polysaccharides that contain galactose arabinose xylose and rhamnose 11prickly pear fruit is high in nutritional value 12 ethanolsoluble carbohydrates are the most abundant components of prickly pear fruit pulp and skin making up 50 of the pulp and 30 of the skin the betalain compounds are responsible for the various colors of the fruit 13 the skin contains calcium iron potassium magnesium manganese sodium and selenium 12  14 the edible pulp contains biothiols taurine flavonols tocopherols and carotenoids 15  16 however industrial processing of juice components results in some loss of vitamins a e and c 8  15 the seeds are rich in phosphorus and zinc the oils from the seeds and peel are a good source of polyunsaturated fatty acids 17  18  19several older chemical analyses of enzymes from opuntia species are available 20  21  22  23 one study documents the volatile constituents 24 of prickly pear while another identifies the constituents of o fragilis  25 other studies discuss the chemistry of prickly pear including isolation of albumin 26 amino acid composition in the fruits 27 and fatty acids of the seeds 28uses and pharmacology diabetes a mechanism of action remains to be discovered in diabetes however polysaccharides may be responsible for the plants hypoglycemic activity 29animal data an extract of o fulginosa prickly pear maintained normal blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels in streptozotocininduced diabetic rats after insulin was withdrawn 30 similar results were obtained with o megacantha in reducing blood glucose in normal and streptozocininduced diabetic rats however o megacantha was nephrotoxic as shown by elevated plasma urea and creatinine concentrations and reduced plasma sodium concentrations 31  32clinical data the hypoglycemic effects of opuntia species are documented in numerous studies 33  34  35  36  37  38  39 one openlabel study of 14 patients found that o streptacantha decreased glucose and insulin levels in patients with noninsulindependent diabetes mellitus however the plant had no effect on glucose or insulin levels in healthy volunteers 36 another openlabel study involving 32 patients with type 2 diabetes treated with o streptacantha also resulted in decreased glucose and insulin levels 40hyperlipidemia animal data two animal studies examined the effect of prickly pear seed oil on serum and lipid parameters in rats 41  42 an increase in highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol and a reduction in serum cholesterol was observed in rats treated with seed oil raw o ficusindica had beneficial effects on hypercholesterolemia in rats 43 a pectin isolate from opuntia decreased lowdensity lipoprotein ldl metabolism in guinea pigs 44  45  46clinical data in one small study of 29 patients prickly pear significantly reduced cholesterol levels 35 prickly pear may have antiplatelet activity which may be useful in patients with prothrombotic conditions such as diabetes and hyperlipidemia 47 eight healthy volunteers and 8 patients with familial heterozygous hypercholesterolemia were treated with prickly pear 250 mg for 2 months significant  p  001 decreases in total and ldlcholesterol and reduced platelet proteins were found opuntia capsules in a human trial had marginally beneficial effects on cholesterol and glucose levels 48inflammation the mechanism of action is associated with the antiinflammatory principle βsitosterol 49animal data antiinflammatory actions were demonstrated in opuntia dillenii in an induced rat paw edema model 50 βsitosterol from the fresh stems of prickly pear had potent antiinflammatory activity in an adjuvantinduced chronic inflammation model in mice 49clinical data prickly pear may inhibit the production of inflammatory mediators associated with the symptoms of alcohol hangover 51 in a doubleblind placebocontrolled crossover trial 55 healthy volunteers received placebo or 1600 units of prickly pear 5 hours before consuming alcohol patients consumed 175 g alcoholkg of body weight over 4 hours creactive protein and symptoms such as nausea dry mouth and anorexia were reduced in patients treated with prickly pear ulcers a cytoprotective mechanism is associated with an interaction between the mucilage monosaccharides from prickly pear and membrane phospholipids 52  53animal data histological evidence supports the efficacy of prickly pear cladodes against the formation of ethanolinduced ulcers 54clinical data no clinical trials could be found other pharmacological effects antioxidant opuntia species have antioxidant activity that may be associated with their phenolic content 55 shortterm supplementation with 250 g of fresh fruit pulp in a comparative study 56 and a study of patients with familial isolated hypercholesterolemia 57 reduced oxidative damage to lipids and improved oxidative stress status of treated patients diuretic prickly pear cladode fruit and flower infusions increased diuresis in a rat model 58neuroprotective effects animal models in rats demonstrated that the flavonoids isolated from o ficusindica var saboten species had neuroprotective activity against oxidative injury induced in cortical cell cultures and neuronal damage induced by global ischemia 9  16  59nutrition prickly pear fruit liquid has been studied as a natural sweetener 60 opuntia has been studied as a source of dietary fiber 61viral activity one study reports o streptacantha antiviral action in animals and humans 62wound healing histological evidence documents that topical application of polysaccharide extracts from prickly pear cladodes enhanced cutaneous repair and healing of large fullthickness wounds in a rat model 63  64 the polysaccharides from prickly pear cladodes have been studied for their chondroprotective effects in treating joint diseases 65dosage prickly pear is commercially available in numerous doseforms including capsules tablets powders and juices and as food follow manufacturers suggested guidelines if using commercial products typical dosage regimens are two 250 mg capsules by mouth 3 times a day or every 8 hours pregnancylactation avoid use during pregnancy and lactation because of the lack of clinical studies interactions prickly pear may theoretically exacerbate hypoglycemia in patients being treated with hypoglycemic agents eg metformin glyburide rosiglitazone acarbose 66 prickly pear may also exacerbate diuresis in patients being treated with diuretic agents eg furosemide hydrochlorothiazide however these interactions are not well documented adverse reactions dermatitis from prickly pear is the most common adverse reaction a case report of cactus dermatitis in a 2yearold child was described after contact with o microdasys  67 two other patients were also affected by this species both experiencing dermatitis and one developing severe keratoconjunctivitis in the right eye 68 a case of cactus granuloma in a 24yearold man is described from contact with o bieglovii thorns 69 granuloma formation has also been seen from o acanthocarpa spines embedded in the dermis with onset occurring within several days and lasting several months treatment with topical corticosteroids has been recommended 70  71toxicology patients hypersensitive to any components of prickly pear should avoid use o streptacantha is nontoxic in mice horses and humans in oral and intravenous preparations 62 o megacantha is nephrotoxic in rats 31  32bibliography1
