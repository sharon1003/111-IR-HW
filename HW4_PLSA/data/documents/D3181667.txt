this list the sporting news’ “40 most hated nfl players of all time loudmouths cheaters and criminals” has tb12 coming in at no 5 right between greg hardy at no 4 and ray lewis at no 6 ouch we knew the rest of the country wasn’t in love with the patriots’ fourtime super bowl champion quarterback remember the booing at the super bowl 50 pregame ceremony for the game’s mvps  but that’s a little harsh the top 10 1 michael vick 2 terrell owens 3 ndamukong suh 4 greg hardy 5 tom brady 6 ray lewis 7 bill romanowski 8 ben roethlisberger 9 adam “pacman” jones 10 adrian peterson gee theres an awful lot of court cases on that list that don’t involve the inflation of footballs the sporting news says it didnt consider o j simpson aaron hernandez or ray lewis for its list saying it was choosing to narrow its focus to those players who were hated while they were on the field near the bottom of the top 40 are a couple of pats backtoback rodney harrison checking in at no 37 and rob gronkowski at no 38 tags nbc sports boston newswire deflategate greg hardy michael vick new england patriots ray lewis rob gronkowski rodney harrison tom brady ryans 2 td passes enough as falcons hold off seahawks 3431by associated press november 21 2017 147 amseattle  matt ryan and the atlanta falcons did enough through 3 12 quarters that even the best comeback attempt by russell wilson fell short this time a couple of yards short to be exact ryan threw a pair of touchdown passes adrian clayborn returned a fumble 10 yards for a score and the falcons watched blair walshs 52yard field goal attempt in the final seconds fall short holding off the seattle seahawks for a 3431 win on monday night atlanta won its second straight to stay on the heels of new orleans and carolina in the nfc south and handed seattle a second consecutive home loss what an absolute team win from the guys tonight atlanta coach dan quinn said coming here in this environment with the crowd we thought it would be two competitive tough teams that were going to battle for it in the biggest way ryan threw tds to mohamed sanu and levine toilolo while tevin coleman added a 1yard td run on atlantas opening possession but it was clayborns fumble return that helped break the game open early in the second quarter and gave atlanta a 217 lead he scooped up a loose ball after wilson was crunched by takk mc kinley and courtney upshaw i think were moving in the right direction we keep proving we can finish games and beat guys we have to take the momentum and keep rolling with it clayborn said with seattle down 11 points wilson hit doug baldwin on a 29yard td with 3 minutes left and then threw to jimmy graham for the twopoint conversion seattle got the ball back and moved in range for walsh whose attempt was on line but landed short of the crossbar that was in our range and in hindsight i would have just driven it more walsh said i would have driven it more and not left it short i was too accurate and didnt have enough on it wilson again was the entirety of seattles offense throwing for 258 yards and two touchdowns and running for another 86 yards and a td but it was an awful night for the seahawks filled with more injuries and questionable decisions by coach pete carroll he called for a fake field goal late in the first half rather than attempting a 35yard kick he also made a questionable challenge in the fourth quarter that didnt go his way and left seattle with just one timeout that lack of timeouts came back to haunt seattle on the final drive when seconds ticked away and rather than running one more play walsh was sent out to attempt the 52yard kick his long for the season is 49 yards the conclusion only amplified carrolls baffling decision at the end of the first half when seattle ran a fake field goal rather than having walsh attempt a 35yarder that would have pulled seattle within 2420 holder jon ryan completed his shovel pass to luke willson but grady jarrett read the play and tackled willson for a 4yard loss willson said atlantas defense on the play was different than what seattle had seen on film it would have been a really good call if we had made it carroll said terrific opportunity right where we wanted it and the defensive tackle made a better play seattle played a game for the first time since the end of the 2010 season without richard sherman his streak of 99 consecutive starts in the regular season was snapped because of a torn achilles tendon suffered against arizona the seahawks were also without safety kam chancellor because of a neck injury leaving their vaunted secondary with several new faces those two are phenomenal players  it was a lot different sanu said they did a lot of different things but we just had to take advantage of our routes matty iceryan was more than happy to pick on a defense without sherman and chancellor he was 19 of 27 passing for 195 yards and rarely faced pressure seattle had one sack and the falcons went 9 of 14 on thirddown conversions sanu made a great onehanded grab for a 2yard touchdown in the first quarter ryan found toilolo on a 25yard td in the third quarter to give atlanta a 3120 lead matt bryant added a 19yard field goal with 349 left to put the falcons ahead by 11 and wilsons late heroics werent enough ryans streak of 64 straight games passing for at least 200 yards was snapped injuriesseattles injury woes continued the seahawks lost rookie cornerback shaquill griffin to a concussion on the second play of the game forcing newly signed veteran byron maxwell into a more prominent role than expected early in the second half promising running back mike davis was lost to a groin injury after taking a screen pass 21 yards davis had two receptions and had carried six times for 18 yards before getting hurt seattle also lost starting guard oday aboushi in the fourth quarter with a shoulder injury atlanta got a scare when safety keanu neal was checked for a concussion in the first half he was cleared to return up nextfalcons host tampa bay on sunday to open a threegame homestand seahawks travel to division foe san francisco on sunday nbc sports boston
