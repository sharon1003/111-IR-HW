glucosamine are different than glucosamine sulfate for information on these different products see the glucosamine hydrochloride and nacetyl glucosamine listings what is glucosamine sulfate glucosamine sulfate is a naturally occurring chemical found in the human body it is in the fluid that is around joints glucosamine is also found in other places in nature for example the glucosamine sulfate that is put into dietary supplements is often harvested from the shells of shellfish glucosamine sulfate used in dietary supplements does not always come from natural sources it can also be made in a laboratory there are different forms of glucosamine including glucosamine sulfate glucosamine hydrochloride and nacetylglucosamine these different chemicals have some similarities however they may not have the same effects when taken as a dietary supplement most of the scientific research done on glucosamine has been done on glucosamine sulfate the information on this page pertains to glucosamine sulfate for information on the other forms of glucosamine see the specific pages for each of them dietary supplements that contain glucosamine often contain additional ingredients these additional ingredients are frequently chondroitin sulfate msm or shark cartilage some people think these combinations work better than taking just glucosamine sulfate alone so far researchers have found no proof that combining the additional ingredients with glucosamine adds any benefit some glucosamine sulfate products are not labeled accurately in some cases the amount of glucosamine actually in the product has varied from none to over 100 of the amount stated on the products label some products have contained glucosamine hydrochloride when glucosamine sulfate was listed on the label glucosamine sulfate is taken by mouth for osteoarthritis glaucoma weight loss joint pain caused by drugs a bladder condition called interstitial cystitis jaw pain joint pain including knee pain back pain multiple sclerosis and hivaids glucosamine is also in some skin creams used to control arthritis pain these creams usually contain camphor and other ingredients in addition to glucosamine glucosamine sulfate is used parenterally for osteoarthritis is glucosamine sulfate effective glucosamine sulfate can improve pain and movement in knees affected by osteoarthritis it seems to work about as well as some nonprescription pain medications but glucosamine takes about twice as long to work four weeks instead of two there is some evidence that glucosamine sulfate may actually keep the joint problems from getting worse other pain relievers can reduce the pain but do not prevent the disease from slowly destroying more of the joint glucosamine sulfate might not be as effective for reducing pain in more severe longstanding osteoarthritis glucosamine sulfate is often marketed in combination products that also contain chondroitin sulfate so far there is no evidence that the combination products work any better than glucosamine sulfate or chondroitin sulfate alone buying a combination product is probably not worth the extra cost likely effective for osteoarthritis most research shows that taking glucosamine sulfate can provide some pain relief for people with osteoarthritis especially those with osteoarthritis of the knees for some people glucosamine sulfate might work as well as overthecounter and prescription pain medications such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen however pain medications work quickly while glucosamine sulfate can take 48 weeks before it provides pain relief also people who take glucosamine sulfate often still need to take pain medications for pain flareups in addition to relieving pain glucosamine sulfate might also slow the breakdown of joints and prevent the condition from getting worse if it is taken for several years some research shows that people who take glucosamine sulfate might be less likely to need total knee replacement surgery there are several kinds of glucosamine products the most research showing benefit is for products that contain glucosamine sulfate products that contain glucosamine hydrochloride do not seem to work as well many products contain both glucosamine with chondroitin but there is no evidence that these products work any better than glucosamine sulfate by itself insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for joint pain caused by drugs that lower estrogen levels early research suggests that taking a combination of glucosamine sulfate and chondroitin sulfate in two or three divided doses daily for 24 weeks reduces pain in women taking drugs that lower estrogen levels for early stage breast cancer painful bladder syndrome interstitial cystitis early research suggests that taking a specific product containing glucosamine sulfate sodium hyaluronate chondroitin sulfate quercetin and rutin cysto protek tischon corporation westbury ny four times daily for 12 months reduces symptoms of painful bladder syndrome joint pain research shows that taking a specific product containing glucosamine sulfate methylsufonlylmethane white willow bark extract ginger root concentrate indian frankincense extract turmeric root extract cayenne and hyaluronic acid instaflex joint support direct digital charlotte nc in three divided doses daily for 8 weeks reduces joint pain but this product doesnt seem to help joint stiffness or function knee pain some research shows that taking a specific product containing glucosamine sulfate methylsufonlylmethane white willow bark extract ginger root concentrate indian frankincense extract turmeric root extract cayenne and hyaluronic acid instaflex joint support direct digital charlotte nc in three divided doses daily for 8 weeks reduces joint pain in people with knee pain but this product doesnt seem to help joint stiffness or function other early research shows that taking 1500 mg of glucosamine sulfate daily for 28 days does not reduce knee pain in athletes following a knee injury however it does seem to improve knee movement multiple sclerosis early research shows that taking 1000 mg of glucosamine sulfate by mouth daily for 6 months might reduce the relapse of multiple sclerosis jaw pain temporomandibular disorder some research shows that taking glucosamine sulfate works about as well as the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug nsaid ibuprofen  motrin advil etc for relieving jaw pain in some people pain relief appears to continue for up to 90 days after glucosamine sulfate is discontinued however research suggests that when 1200 mg of glucosamine sulfate is taken by mouth daily for 6 months jaw pain and the ability to open the jaw are not improved glaucoma weight loss other conditions more evidence is needed to rate glucosamine sulfate for these uses osteoarthritis overview slideshow pictures osteoarthritis tips for living better daily slideshow exercises for oa of the knee slideshow how does glucosamine sulfate work glucosamine sulfate is a chemical found in the human body it is used by the body to produce a variety of other chemicals that are involved in building tendons ligaments cartilage and the thick fluid that surrounds joints joints are cushioned by the fluid and cartilage that surround them in some people with osteoarthritis the cartilage breaks down and becomes thin this results in more joint friction pain and stiffness researchers think that taking glucosamine supplements may either increase the cartilage and fluid surrounding joints or help prevent breakdown of these substances or maybe both some researchers think the sulfate part of glucosamine sulfate is also important sulfate is needed by the body to produce cartilage this is one reason why researchers believe that glucosamine sulfate might work better than other forms of glucosamine such as glucosamine hydrochloride or nacetyl glucosamine these other forms do not contain sulfate are there safety concerns glucosamine sulfate is likely safe when used appropriately by mouth in adults glucosamine sulfate is possibly safe when injected into the muscle as a shot twice weekly for up to 6 weeks or when applied to the skin in combination with chondroitin sulfate shark cartilage and camphor for up to 8 weeks glucosamine sulfate can cause some mild side effects including nausea heartburn diarrhea and constipation uncommon side effects are drowsiness skin reactions and headache these are rare special precautions  warnings pregnancy or breastfeeding there is not enough reliable scientific information available to know if glucosamine sulfate is safe to take during pregnancy or while breastfeeding until more is known do not take glucosamine sulfate while pregnant or breastfeeding asthma there is one report linking an asthma attack with taking glucosamine it is not known for sure if glucosamine was the cause of the asthma attack until more is known people with asthma should be cautious about taking products that contain glucosamine diabetes some early research suggested that glucosamine sulfate might raise blood sugar in people with diabetes however more recent and more reliable research now shows that glucosamine sulfate does not seem to affect blood sugar control in people with type 2 diabetes glucosamine appears to be safe for most people with diabetes but blood sugar should be monitored closely high cholesterol animal research suggests that glucosamine may increase cholesterol levels in contrast glucosamine does not seem to increase cholesterol levels in humans however some early research suggests that glucosamine might increase insulin levels this might cause cholesterol levels to increase to be cautious if you take glucosamine sulfate and have high cholesterol monitor your cholesterol levels closely high blood pressure early research suggests that glucosamine sulfate can increase insulin levels this might cause blood pressure to increase however more reliable research suggests that glucosamine sulfate does not increase blood pressure to be cautious if you take glucosamine sulfate and have high blood pressure monitor your blood pressure closely shellfish allergy because some glucosamine sulfate products are made from the shells of shrimp lobsters or crabs there is concern that glucosamine products might cause allergic reactions in people who are allergic to shellfish however allergic reactions in people with shellfish allergy are typically caused by the meat of shellfish not the shell there are no reports of allergic reactions to glucosamine in people who are allergic to shellfish there is also some information that people with shellfish allergy can safely take glucosamine products surgery glucosamine sulfate might affect blood sugar levels and might interfere with blood sugar control during and after surgery stop taking glucosamine sulfate at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery osteoarthritis overview slideshow pictures osteoarthritis tips for living better daily slideshow exercises for oa of the knee slideshow are there any interactions with medications warfarin  coumadin interaction rating major do not take this combination warfarin coumadin is used to slow blood clotting there are several reports showing that taking glucosamine sulfate with or without chondroitin increases the effect of warfarin coumadin making blood clotting even slower this can cause bruising and bleeding that can be serious dont take glucosamine sulfate if you are taking warfarin coumadin many natural medicines can interact with warfarin coumadin medications for cancer antimitotic chemotherapy interaction rating moderate be cautious with this combination talk with your health provider some medications for cancer work by decreasing how fast cancer cells can copy themselves some scientists think that glucosamine sulfate might increase how fast tumor cells can copy themselves taking glucosamine sulfate along with some medications for cancer might decrease the effectiveness of these medications for cancer any person who is receiving chemotherapy should talk with their health provider before taking glucosamine sulfate some of these medications are etoposide vp16 ve pesid  teniposide vm26 and doxorubicin adriamycin acetaminophen  tylenol others interaction rating minor be cautious with this combination talk with your health provider there is some concern that taking glucosamine sulfate and acetaminophen tylenol others together might affect how well each works however more information is needed to know if this interaction is a big concern for now most experts say it is okay to use both together medications for diabetes antidiabetes drugs interaction rating minor be cautious with this combination talk with your health provider there has been concern that glucosamine sulfate might increase blood sugar in people with diabetes there was also the concern that glucosamine sulfate might decrease how well diabetes medications work however research now shows that glucosamine sulfate probably does not increase blood sugar in people with diabetes therefore glucosamine sulfate probably does not interfere with diabetes medications to be cautious if you take glucosamine sulfate and have diabetes monitor your blood sugar closely some medications used for diabetes include glimepiride  amaryl  glyburide  dia beta glynase pres tab micronase  insulin pioglitazone  actos  rosiglitazone  avandia  chlorpropamide  diabinese  glipizide  glucotrol  tolbutamide orinase and others dosing considerations for glucosamine sulfate the following doses have been studied in scientific research by mouth  for osteoarthritis 1500 mg once daily or 500 mg three times daily either alone or together with 400 mg of chondroitin sulfate two or three times daily has been used for up to 3 years also glucosamine sulfate 750 mg twice daily in combination with turmeric root extract 500 mg twice daily has been used for 6 weeks applied to the skin  for osteoarthritis a cream containing 30 mggram of glucosamine sulfate 50 mggram of chondroitin sulfate 140 mggram of chondroitin sulfate 32 mggram of camphor and 9 mggram of peppermint oil has been applied to the skin as needed for 8 weeks injected into the muscle  for osteoarthritis 400 mg of glucosamine sulfate has been injected twice weekly for 6 weeks natural medicines comprehensive database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale effective likely effective possibly effective possibly ineffective likely ineffective
