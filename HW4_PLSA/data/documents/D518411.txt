standard when determining disorderly conduct laws this means that a prosecutor must only show that a reasonable person would have been alarmed by the conduct location some states prohibit disorderly conduct in a public area or conduct that disturbs the public order though others do not require the behavior to occur in public or affect the public courts have held that public areas include such places as public restroom stalls carnivals hospital emergency rooms and even private buildings available for public rental and entertainment when the conduct occurs in private courts have held that
