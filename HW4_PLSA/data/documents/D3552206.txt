difference between alpha and beta blockers• categorized under drugs health  difference between alpha and beta blockers alpha vs beta blockers one of the deadliest diseases in the world today is hypertension to prevent such illnesses the human body needs to have these blocking agents to aid their veins in the smooth flow of blood circulation alpha and beta blockers are often supporting medications that will assist in the lowering of blood pressure however there are some differences between these two that you must note of alpha blockers generally help relaxe the muscles which in turn can lead to the opening of the blood vessels for smooth circulation the beta blockers on the other hand work by reducing the persons heart rate thus it results in the reduction of blood flow the bp is decreased because of the dilation of the blood vessels eventually although their purpose is the same they work differently alpha medications work by keeping the hormones of norepinephrine or noradrenaline at bay thus it can lead to a smoother blood flow through open veins the beta blockers meanwhile works by blocking the hormone called epinephrine or better known as adrenaline this hormone often causes increased heart rates that can lead to increased blood pressure levels the beta medication prevents this from happening alpha blockers simply work to lower blood pressure and increase the blood flow to the heart while the beta medications work in slowing the heart rate at the same time lowering bp rates these alpha medications are also known as alpha adrenergic blocking agents or alpha adrenergic antagonists such medications mostly focus on the blood pressure and blood circulation alone the beta blockers’ work on the heart the blood flow and the bp levels however most of the time these beta blockers work on the heart rate alone people with arrhythmias or abnormal heart rhythms and tachycardia or fast heart rates take this medication when it comes to the side effects both the medication can cause dizziness and fatigue when it is first taken however the beta blockers are noted to cause some breathing problems this is why this medication is not suggested for those patients who have history of asthma for the side effects some of the beta blockers are noted to cause weight gain this is probably because of the decreased metabolism rates as the heart rate does down many experts believe so does the digestive and metabolism rate alpha blockers on the other hand do not necessarily result in weight gain the alpha blockers are noted to have the risk of heart failure if they are taken for a longer time at the same time the beta blockers must not be stopped immediately as this may cause heart attacks or other cardiac problems summary1 alpha blockers work on the blood muscles to open up the blood vessels while the beta medications work on the heart to ease the flow of blood 2 alpha meds work on the hormone of norepinephrine or noradrenaline while the beta works on the epinephrine or adrenaline 3 alpha blockers work for the blood pressure levels alone while the beta blockers can work for both heart and the blood pressure 4 beta blockers can cause weight gain while alpha medications do not search difference betweennet  custom search help us improve rate this post  8 votes average 363 out of 5email this post  if you like this article or

mr fraser december 20 2012 • 520 amvery good article on blood pressure meds reply joseph m february 18 2013 • 529 pm there are a number of grammatical errors in this article that hurts your credibility massively more importantly you make no mention of how they compare for handling prostate swelling issues they are both used for that purpose a good bit more than for blood pressure it seems let me know if you fix all this reply la toya woolfork november 9 2017 • 1248 am joseph m i am a nurse and worked in a heart failure and heart transplant clinic for 7 years as far as prostaglandins they can effect blood pressure when nsaids are used i don’t remember anything about beta blockers or alpha blockers causing prostate swelling if a heart failure patient is volume overloaded then a beta blocker coreg or toprol xl are held since they can exacerbate volume overload ace inhibitors can cause tongue swelling and could effect potassium and creatinine levels and calcium channel blockers can cause lower extremity swelling your reply to the author is completely wrong and disrespectful yours truly la toya i wish i could remember the medication we used for large prostates for some reason bph comes to mind replysuraj december 29 2013 • 939 am nice article clear explanations thanks  i was searching for propranol side effects reply mohammed may 22 2017 • 805 am

blocker i’ve arrhythmia and enlarged prostate problems thanking you in advance for any information joseph reply la toya woolfork november 9 2017 • 100 am first you need to monitor your blood pressure

massively” really are you donald trump this guy likely spent hours writing this article doing the research and publishing it although the article didn’t discuss a topic you wanted it still provides readers with a lot of valuable information“let me know when you fix this” were you abused as a child since you seem to be an authority on this subject i suggest you get off your swollen prostate and
