hike messenger app review ks sandhya iyer 15 february 2013share on facebook tweet share share email reddit comment instant messaging im has become a trend these days especially with the youth a trend pioneered by the immensely popular whats app im application others like nimbuzz and samsungs proprietary chat on messenger are trying to follow suit as well the latest entrant in this genre is hike a communication app that offers both instant messaging and sms under one roof developed by bharti softbank a 5050 partnership between indias bharti telecom and japans softbank telecom provider the app is the brainchild of kavin bharti mittal a cross platform messenger app hike is similar to whats app but is better in the sense that it also allows users to communicate over sms which is certainly a big advantage for those who do not have access to mobile internet or data on thego and for communicating with your friends without hike app from within the same app that said we played around with the app a bit on the i os and android platforms to see what is refreshing about it that has made it the no1 top free app in the google play store it is placed at the third position under top free apps in the india apple app store let the smsing begin hike offers messaging in three different ways hiketohike messaging with other phones is unlimited and free worldwide second you can communicate with other smartphone users who dont have hike via sms which is only restricted to india at the moment finally you can message any other phone user via sms but beware if you constantly bug another user with hike they are given a code that they can use to block you on the bright side each hike user gets 100 free hike sms every month to message those friends who arent on hike which gets replenished each month and in case any friend joins the app on your request via sms you get 10 free sms extra and the company will also be awarding each user with 50 free sms per month for each friend they have invited to hike other ways of inviting friends are through facebook twitter and email furthermore hike users will also be rewarded onetime sms bonuses of 100 each for connecting to twitter and facebook and the company plans to keep offering such bonuses time and again these onetime bonuses will be valid for life until you run out of them getting started and user interface the user interface of hike is very clean simple and basic with pleasant hues of white and blue once youve downloaded the app youll be prompted to enter your mobile number while the i os version sends a 6digit verification code via sms that expires within a minute reminiscent of google authenticator the android version simply greets you to the welcome screen asking you to enter your name and complete the registration this is then followed by a tutorial of the apps basics also as soon as you enter the app an inbox message welcomes you with a reward of rs10 every time you successfully invite a friend via sms you earn credit of an additional rs20 in order for you to earn rewards your friends must download and activate the app soon after you invite them features and usage hiketohike communication via instant messaging has features such as group chat and photo and video sharing which are right up there with any top smart im app group chats can be initiated by an icon in the top right corner while a  icon on the bottom right can be used to send a new message the app supports various audio and video formats and uploads up to 6mb for each file that said we experienced almost instantaneous responses over a stable internet connection especially with group chat that works pretty well and so does the image and video transfer this is of course dependent on internet connection speeds using the app is fairly simple the app smoothly integrates your entire existing phone contacts you can access various menu options such as home invite friends free messaging and more by swiping left swiping right reveals search bar along with favourites and friends on hike we couldnt help but notice this functionality as being very similar to facebook messenger another feature resembling facebooks poke is nudge you can nudge a friend by double tapping anywhere in their conversation screen once you send a message you can see sent s delivered d read and typing  notifications similar to whats app which has a different notification convention apart from the standard emojis on your device hike has its own set of emoticons for variety i os versus android the ui as well as functionality on both platforms is pretty much the same a word of caution android users will not be able to play mov files sent by i phone users the company is aware of the scenario and plans to soon implement a fix soon to convert the video to a universal mp4 file format at their backend so that it can be played on every device other issues include couple of emoji smileys not appearing properly for the i phone 3gs android hike app unable to open the correct image at times from a clicked thumbnail multiple file uploads failing on edge networks and the d and r notifications currently unavailable from hiketo sms for android the app works only on v22 or later overall the app offers a fresh alternative to other instant messaging clients out there and is a welcome addition to the pool its true that the app is pretty nascent and does not offer video calling support like nimbuzz or even voice recording as offered by whats app and chat on but it does deliver a quality performance at what its best  messaging instant or otherwise it is available across all major platforms  apple android windows phone and on various nokia asha full touch devices namely asha 305 306 308 309 and 311 it is expected to launch soon for black berry as well that will help it gain the much needed attention amongst its current competitors apart from certain issues like we mentioned earlier the app seems to deliver a holistic user experience the company has promised to rectify all issues and we hope that the app receives timely updates in the future to offer a more refined experience across all platforms the problem with any new closed chatting platform is the lack of users while almost everyone in our contact list in now on whats app hardly any users showed up on hike we expect this problem to get fixed as more people discover hike as a compelling alternative until then the ability to sms nonhike users will sure come in handy start hiking hike messenger i os free hike google play free hike windows phone free
