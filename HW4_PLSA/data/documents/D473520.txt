history stories7 fascinating facts about the panama canal history stories7 fascinating facts about the panama canal by elizabeth nix august 15 2014panama canal hailed as one of the great achievements of the 20th century the panama canal connects 160 countries and 1700 ports around the world print cite august 15 1914 marks the 100th anniversary of the official opening of the panama canal the americanbuilt waterway across the isthmus of panama that connects the atlantic and pacific oceans the 50milelong passage created an important shortcut for ships after the canal was constructed a vessel sailing between new york and california was able to bypass the long journey around the tip of south america and trim nearly 8000 miles from its voyage the canal which uses a system of locks to lift ships 85 feet above sea level was the largest engineering project of its time find out more fascinating facts about this iconic waterway including why thousands of workers died during its construction and how it’s now being modernized the idea for a canal across panama dates back to the 16th century in 1513 spanish explorer vasco nunez de balboa became the first european to discover that the isthmus of panama was just a slim land bridge separating the atlantic and pacific oceans balboa’s discovery sparked a search for a natural waterway linking the two oceans in 1534 after no such passage across the isthmus had been found charles v the holy roman emperor ordered a survey to determine if one could be built but the surveyors eventually decided that construction of a ship canal was impossible the men behind the suez canal and eiffel tower were convicted in connection with failed effort to build a canal in the ensuing centuries various nations considered developing a panamanian canal but a serious attempt wasn’t made until the 1880s in 1881 a french company headed by ferdinand de lesseps a former diplomat who developed egypt’s suez canal began digging a canal across panama the project was plagued by poor planning engineering problems and tropical diseases that killed thousands of workers de lesseps intended to build the canal at sea level without locks like the suez canal but the excavation process proved far more difficult than anticipated gustave eiffel who designed the famous tower in paris that bears his name was then hired to create locks for the canal however the de lessepsled company went bankrupt in 1889 at the time the french had sunk more than 260 million into the canal venture and excavated more than 70 million cubic yards of earth the canal venture’s collapse caused a major scandal in france de lesseps and his son charles along with eiffel and several other company executives were indicted on fraud and mismanagement charges in 1893 the men were found guilty sentenced to prison and fined although the sentences were overturned after the scandal eiffel retired from business and devoted himself to scientific research ferdinand de lesseps died in 1894 that same year a new french company was formed to take over the assets of the bankrupt business and continue the canal however this second firm soon abandoned the endeavor as well america originally wanted to build a canal in nicaragua not panama throughout the 1800s the united states which wanted a canal linking the atlantic and pacific for economic and military reasons considered nicaragua a more feasible location than panama however that view shifted thanks in part to the efforts of philippejean bunauvarilla a french engineer who had been involved in both of france’s canal projects in the late 1890s bunauvarilla began lobbying american lawmakers to buy the french canal assets in panama and eventually convinced a number of them that nicaragua had dangerous volcanoes making panama the safer choice in 1902 congress authorized the purchase of the french assets however the following year when colombia which panama was then a part of refused to ratify an agreement allowing the united states to build a canal the panamanians with encouragement from bunauvarilla and tacit approval from president theodore roosevelt revolted against colombia and declared panama’s independence soon afterward u s secretary of state john hay and bunauvarilla acting as a representative of panama’s provisional government negotiated the haybunauvarilla treaty which gave america the right to a zone of more than 500 square miles in which it could construct a canal the canal zone was to be controlled in perpetuity by the americans all told the united states would shell out some 375 million to build the canal which included a 10 million payment to panama as a condition of the 1903 treaty and 40 million to buy the french assets a century after the united states completed the panama canal a navigable link across nicaragua remains a possibility in 2013 a chinese company announced it had struck a 40 billion deal with the nicaraguan government for the rights to construct such a waterway more than 25000 workers died during the canal’s construction the canal builders had to contend with a variety of obstacles including challenging terrain hot humid weather heavy rainfall and rampant tropical diseases the earlier french attempts had led to the deaths of more than 20000 workers and america’s efforts fared little better between 1904 and 1913 some 5600 workers died due to disease or accidents many of these earlier deaths had been caused by yellow fever and malaria diseases that the medical community at the time believed were caused by bad air and dirty conditions by the early 20th century however medical experts better understood the role of mosquitoes as carriers for these diseases allowing them to significantly reduce the number of deaths among canal workers thanks to a host of sanitation measures that included draining areas with standing water removing possible insect breeding grounds and installing window screens in buildings between 13000 and 14000 ships use the canal every year american ships use the canal the most followed by those from china chile japan colombia and south korea every vessel that transits the canal must pay a toll based on its size and cargo volume tolls for the largest ships can run about 450000 the smallest toll ever paid was 36 cents plunked down in 1928 by american adventurer richard halliburton who swam the canal today some 18 billion in tolls are collected annually on average it takes a ship 8 to 10 hours to pass through the canal while moving through it a system of locks raises each ship 85 feet above sea level ship captains aren’t allowed to transit the canal on their own instead a specially trained canal pilot takes navigational control of each vessel to guide it through the waterway in 2010 the 1 millionth vessel crossed the canal since it first opened in 1914 the united states transferred control of the canal to panama in 1999 in the years after the canal opened tensions increased between america and panama over control of the canal and the surrounding canal zone in 1964 panamanians rioted after being prevented from flying their nation’s flag next to a u s flag in the canal zone in the aftermath of the violence panama temporarily broke off diplomatic relations with the united states in 1977 president jimmy carter and general omar torrijos of panama signed treaties that transferred control of the canal to panama in 1999 but gave the united states the right to use military force to defend the waterway against any threat to its neutrality despite opposition by a number of politicians who didn’t want their country to give up its authority over the canal the u s senate ratified the torrijoscarter treaties by a narrow margin in 1978 control of the canal was transferred peacefully to panama in december 1999 and the panamanians have been responsible for it ever since the canal is being expanded to handle today’s megaships in 2007 work began on a 525 billion expansion project that will enable the canal to handle postpanamax ships that is those exceeding the dimensions of socalled panamax vessels built to fit through the canal whose locks are 110 feet wide and 1000 feet long the expanded canal will be able to handle cargo vessels carrying 14000 20foot containers nearly three times the amount currently accommodated the expansion project expected to be completed in late 2015 includes the creation of a new larger set of locks and the widening and deepening of existing navigational channels however while the new locks will be able to fit many modern ships they still won’t be supersized enough for some vessels such as maersk’s triple e class ships the planet’s biggest container ships which measure 194 feet wide and 1312 feet long with a capacity of 18000 20foot containers
