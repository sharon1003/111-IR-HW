this is real player which does provide much better quality than previous real audio stream formats below is qcd which apart from playing your cds will play ogg streams as standardthis is microsofts media player  be warned its a big download about 9mb generally the first impression of media player streams is good but this disappears after a few minutes of listening if you listen anyway closely to most media player streams you will be able to hear annoying and often uncomfortable compression artefacts such as a high speed warbling tinny shallow audio is also common you can usually get rid of most of these annoying effects by adjusting your soundcardmedia players equaliser controls if you have these but if you havent youll just have to bear it i tend to think that a real plauyer stream will sound much better than a media player stream and even better than a real player stream is in my opinion an mp3 stream  just have a listen to das soundportals 64k stream from austria to hear what i mean unfortunately many stations are moving over to using media player despite the best quality seeming to be from real audio and mp3 streams its like the vhsbetamax battle again a vcr standards battle where betamax was techincally superior but vhs more popular the newest player on the block below is the surfer network mp3 player this has to be downloaded only once between 3 and 4 mb and provides the fastest start of any of the players currently available  from clicking a link until the audio starts is typically 23 seconds and sometimes quicker and this includes the time to load the player this is quite a difference from the likes of ms media player which can take up to 30 seconds in addition to providing good quality fast audio the player also includes nice touches like showing the name of the currently playing song a link to allow you to buy the cd and the time remaining until the next song one downside is that it is very difficult to bookmark stations in the actual player and to do this takes manually creating a link in your browser which is very fiddly
