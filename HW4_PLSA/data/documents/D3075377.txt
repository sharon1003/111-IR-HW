peroneal tendon subluxation or dislocation causes symptoms treatment recovery exercises reviewed by pramod kerkar md ffarcsithe peroneal tendon passes posteriorly to the lateral malleolus which is located on the external side of the ankle a tough connective tissue known as the peroneal retinaculum holds the peroneal tendons in place if the peroneal retinaculum is torn due to any injury then the peroneal tendons move out of their place and slip over the lateral malleolus on the external part of the ankle this condition is known as peroneal tendon subluxation or dislocation the peroneal tendons continue to remain in the dislocated position or they may return to their previous position on their own as the peroneal retinaculum is torn the tendons are inclined towards recurrent dislocations in the future about the peroneal tendons a tough connective tissue called as the peroneal retinaculum holds the peroneal tendons in place if the peroneal retinaculum is torn due to any injury then the peroneal tendons move out of their place and get displaced over the bony prominence on the external part of the ankle this condition is known as peroneal tendon subluxation or dislocation recurrent peroneal tendon subluxation or dislocation cause inflammation peroneal tendon subluxation or dislocation is common in athletes who have unstable ankles another causative factor is the tightness in the muscle belly of the peroneal tendon this tension can be released by deep tissue massage which is extremely helpful causes of peroneal tendon subluxation or dislocation unnecessary inversion of the foot usually in conjunction with moving the knee forward over the toes dorsiflexion while weight bearing peroneal tendon subluxation or dislocation also commonly occurs with ankle sprain and with activities which require rapid changes in direction such as basketball football and volleyball peroneal tendon subluxation can also occur with playing sports on uneven surfaces symptoms of peroneal tendon subluxation or dislocation pain upon pronation of the soles of the feet is one of the symptoms of peroneal tendon subluxation or dislocation audible snap or a sound during the injury pain or tenderness posterior to the lateral malleolus patient suffering from peroneal tendon subluxation or dislocation will have inability to bear weight swelling may be present bruising may be present there may be stiffness present treatment of peroneal tendon subluxation or dislocation rest ice compress and elevate r i c e technique should be applied on patients suffering from peroneal tendon subluxation or dislocation after the inflammation has subsided gentle stretching should be done sports massage techniques are extremely helpful in releasing the tension in the peroneal muscle due to peroneal tendon subluxation or dislocation a plaster cast can be applied for 3 to 4 weeks for rapid healing following peroneal tendon subluxation or dislocation patient suffering from peroneal tendon subluxation or dislocation should enroll in a rehab program surgery for peroneal tendon subluxation is required if the damage is severe to repair the tissue that keeps the tendon in place strengthening and balance exercises should be done to restore normal function of the ankle after the surgery for peroneal tendon subluxation or dislocation what is the recovery time for peroneal tendon subluxation or dislocation when it comes to the recovery phase posttreatment for peroneal tendon subluxation the recovery period or the healing time can be variable depending on the severity of the injury since the basic treatment for peroneal tendon subluxation or dislocation is casting hence healing period starts once the cast is fitted for the patient and once the patient is through with the casting treatment then focus is put on strengthening and achieving normal range of motion of the injured leg so that the patient can return back to normal activities at the earliest possible time frame the initial phase of rehabilitation for peroneal tendon subluxation or dislocation starts with casting which is done for a period of about 6 weeks during this period the leg is completely immobilized so as to allow the subluxed peroneal tendon to heal once cast is taken off the patient has to be in a walking boot for a period of about 3 weeks so all in all it takes approximately 10 weeks to heal from peroneal tendon subluxation injury once healing is complete a rehabilitation procedure is formulated by the physical therapist to facilitate strength and range of motion of the injured leg the exercises include range of motion exercises and strengthening exercises the physical therapy for peroneal tendon subluxation will continue until the patient has achieved at least 90 of the range of motion and strength in comparison to the normal ankle the patient is then allowed to perform certain activities in a brace the patient may stay in a brace for up to as long as 6 months depending on what type of treatment the patient has had one important aspect of peroneal tendon subluxation rehabilitation is proprioceptive rehab as recurrent ankle sprains tends to damage the peroneal tendons even more it is also important to note here that if a sportsman returns to competitive sports without adequate rehabilitation for peroneal tendon subluxation then it may prove costly as it may destabilize the ankle and make the individual disabled and unable to participate in competitive sports again what are the exercises that one can do following treatment of peroneal tendon subluxation some of the exercises that an individual can do following a peroneal tendon subluxationdislocation are towel stretch exercise to help recover from peroneal tendon
