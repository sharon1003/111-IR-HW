the spellings mate and maté are used in english to refer to the plant but the latter spelling is never used in either spanish or portuguese for this meaning in spanish maté is understood as being a conjugation of the verb matar to kill and it means i killed the corresponding portuguese conjugation of matar to kill would be matei i killed 49 there are no variations in spelling of mate the plant in spanish 5 the addition of the acute accent over the final e in the english spelling was likely added as a hypercorrection indicating that the final é is not silent and thus the word is distinct

counterparts é being more open ɛ like ó ɔ and á a and ê being more closed e like ô o and â ɐ the usual pronunciation of the mat e vowel is i  ɪ  e never ɛ the standard in all regions where the
