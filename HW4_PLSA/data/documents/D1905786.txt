arsenic geological information arsenic is found as the free element occasionally but is found more normally in a number of minerals mispickel arsenopyrite fe sas is the most common mineral locations include france germany italy romania siberia and north america abundances of arsenic in various environments in this table of abundances values are given in units of ppb parts per billion 1 billion  10 9  both in terms of weight and in terms of numbers of atoms values for abundances are difficult to determine with certainty so all values should be treated with some caution especially so for the less common elements local concentrations of any element can vary from those given here an orders of magnitude or so and values in various literature sources for less common elements do seem to vary considerably abundances for arsenic in a number of different environments use the links in the location column for definitions literature sources and visual representations in many different styles one of which is shown belowlocation ppb by weight ppb by atoms universe 8 01sun no data no datameteorite carbonaceous 1800 460crustal rocks 2100 580sea water 23 019stream 1 001human 50 4the chart above shows the log of the abundance on a parts per billion scale of the elements by atom number in our sun notice the sawtooth effect where elements with even atomic numbers tend to be more strongly represented than those with odd atomic numbers this shows up best using the bar chart option on the chart a cartogram depicting the abundance of elements in the earths crust squares for each element are distorted in proportion to the numerical value of the abundancelog abundance in earths crustppb by weighth he li be b c n o f ne na mg al si p s cl ar k ca sc ti v cr mn fe co ni cu zn ga ge as se br kr rb sr y zr nb mo tc ru rh pd ag cd in sn sb te i xe cs ba la ce pr nd pm sm eu gd tb dy ho er tm yb lu hf ta w re os ir pt au hg tl pb bi po at rn fr ra ac th pa u np pu am cm bk cf es fm md no lr rf db sg bh hs mt ds rg cn nh fl mc lv ts oglog abundance in the universeppb by atomsh he li be b c n o f ne na mg al si p s cl ar k ca sc ti v cr mn fe co ni cu zn ga ge as se br kr rb sr y zr nb mo tc ru rh pd ag cd in sn sb te i xe cs ba la ce pr nd pm sm eu gd tb dy ho er tm yb lu hf ta w re os ir pt au hg tl pb bi po at rn fr ra ac th pa u np pu am cm bk cf es fm md no lr rf db sg bh hs mt ds rg cn nh fl mc lv ts og web elements chemistry shop you can buy periodic table posters mugs tshirts periodic table fridge magnets games molecular models and more at the web elements periodic table shop details » details » details » details »
