home buying advice smartphones buying advice which is better android or windows phone by matt egan  30 nov 2012we like windows phone we like android but which is best theres only one way to find out one of the questions we are asked most often is which is better android or windows phone the good news for smartphone fans who dont fancy being locked into apples world or tied to a black berry is that there are now two great alternatives google android and windows phone here we compare android and windows phone it is a subjective question and one that is impossible to definitively answer  ultimately windows phone fans claim their platform is the best and android lovers will hear of no other os they are both now polished and featurefilled mobile operating systems but it is possible to compare some elements of both android and windows phone here then is our guide to which is better android or windows phone which is better android or windows phone handsets android has much the greater market share and this is reflected in the amount of handsets from which you can choose there are literally dozens of android smartphones you can buy in the uk and at the last count only five windows phone 8 handsets with a few more now outdated windows phone 75 phones kicking around the remainder bins in phone shops you can grab a bargain here but they will never be updated to windows phone 8 see also group test whats the best windows phone this doesnt necessarily mean that android is best however  the five major windows phone 8 smartphones out now are all highend highquality devices built by nokia htc and samsung to showcase wp8 those manufacturers rarely make poor hardware but android also has great high end handsets such as the hugely popular galaxy s3 and galaxy note ii from samsung and googles own lgmade nexus 4 indeed because of googles price lowering support the nexus 4 is probably the biggest bargain available to smartphone buyers right now see also group test whats the best android phone and google really wins out if you dont want to shell out a fortune android handsets range in price from bargain basement up to the toppriced phones mentioned above you get what you pay for but for those who simply want an entrylevel smartphone on a major platform android is where it is at windows phone is very much a premium product right now microsoft will hope that it becomes sufficiently popular for handsets to appear at all price levels but only time will tell verdict the windows phone 8 handsets available are nice but if you want choice android is where it is at htc windows phone 8s vs samsung galaxy note  find the best which is better android or windows phone apps again on the face of it a big win for android at the last count there were around 700000 apps for android on google play the vast majority of them optimised for smartphones two years after launch and windows phone is still hovering around the 100000 most of which were written for windows 7 they are forwards compatible with wp8 the bald numbers really dont matter so long as the key apps are represented but at the time of writing key big name apps missing from the windows phone appsgames store include spotify bbc i player instagram and games like bad piggies and temple run not that android is perfect in this regard its fair to say that google play is second only to the i tunes app store in the list of worlds great app stores pretty much all major apps are there but there are a couple of major caveats because of androids relatively open nature rogue apps do make it on to the android app platform because google play informs you of the permissions required by each app you can make a solid judgment in most cases but you do have to tread carefully also not all apps are available for all android smartphones a relatively small number of android apps are tablet only more pertinantly because of the multitude of different versions of android that abound on smartphones old and new app makers struggle to keep up with every flavour and will often target only the most popular so if you have a handset with android 23 you can choose from a very different list of apps from which those with an android 42 smartphone can choose dont worry if that sounds confusing google play shows you only apps compatible with your phone so you never know what you are missing verdict microsoft will be hoping that this changes soon and google play is far from perfect but right now android is the winner which is better android or windows phone upgrades  versions weve hinted at this earlier but the plethora of android versions and the chances of each being upgraded is positively byzantine android is to an extent an open platform so smartphone makers can use it as they please this means that they sometimes use older versions of android in order to fit lower specified hardware they also tweak the operating system to fit their own stylings and phone makers are under no obligation to upgrade your software when a new android comes out  which may mean you lose apps as they are updated most android phones never get an update which increases the bewildering variety of android oses on the loose the benchmark in this area is apple we did well not to mention i os up to this point right because apple is both hardware and software maker for the i phone upgrades are rolled out seamlessly to the later generations of handsets microsofts relationship with windows phone 8 then is a hybrid of the android and i os situations it will endeavour to keep phones updated and wants only a single wp8 os in the wild but it is reliant on hardware makers passing on the upgrade to end users the early signs are good  for windows phone 8 at least the apollo update for windows phone 8 is akin to an 81 release and is coming to all wp8 users windows phone 7 users will read the above paragraph with a raised eyebrow however in launching windows phone 8 microsoft announced that windows phone 7 devices would be upgraded to something called windows phone 78 but no further and to add insult to the injury of pulling up the ladder on early adopters microsoft has subsequently failed to release the 78 os saying now that it will be out in early 2013 verdict this is one area in which windows phone is a winner for windows phone 8 at least which is better android or windows phone speed stability features this is another area in which androids very openness can be both a good and a bad thing because of the vast variety in android handsets from which you can choose prescribing on the speed and stability of android is something of a pig in a poke for every galaxy note ii or nexus 4 that nukes our speed tests there is a bargain basement handset crawling along in the slow lane and because hardware makers can tweak the software there is a variety of speed stability and features in the android world ultimately you are advised to read lots of reviews from publications such as pc advisor and if possible try before you buy windows phone 8 is much more of a known quantity it is zippy and stable and has a couple of nice extra features such as rooms and the brilliand kids corner this turns your phone into a childfriendly toy on demand verdict a score draw android varies from phone to phone windows phone 8 is fast and friendly tags smartphones  software  android  windows share

21022013lol one big mistake in this article you claim android dont update and you would be correct some what there is cyanogenmod etc however you said windows does update you are very wrong when they want to force another sale they stop updating ask windows 7 users  they will never update windows 7 to windows 8 and conveniently for microsoft a bunch of viruses will all the sudden come out but you can update android to a newer one with a little know how further more ubuntu will soon be in this market with android drivers and they are way more feature rich than windows and as always linuxes andriod ubuntu are way safer frankwatson12368  0648 11022013android is the best samsung gt5302craigor304  0139 06022013really what it boils down to with an android phone is proper use i own an lg optimus l3 granted its a low end 384mb of ram 800mhz single core small low res screen but if you stop unused applications and manage your storage it is a smooth operating quick little smartphone gingerbread is very lightweight and the hardware carries it well all i have found are just a few apps that are unsupported windows phones are ok if you want ease of use but you just can not do as much with them and thats what a smartphone is all about android is a true experience of its own and very hard to compare iphonewell lets not go there lolfraserb64  1545 02022013which is better for personal use i am favouring windows for business use until the bb10 proves itself but for personal use i dont know if its wiser to stick with android thoughtssunil dutt  1258 29012013as a owner of both premium brands in both android and windows i would say everything has its own if and buts its really consumer discretion which is best option for himatheneoss  0905 13012013android apps are all with spyware i was trying to download an app for a simple flashlight for my new samsung note and i was searching for an hour to find one that would not ask for permissions to 1 trigger my camera and take pictures 2 make an internet connection 3 read my contacts list 4 send emails and text messages and more finally i gave up i dont use any apps for this reason because all apps ask for the same things so i have a 600 dollar smartphone with out being able to use the full power of it my son has one too he is 16 i got a message from att at some point that he is going over his data limit and that they would charge me more money his limit was 3 gigs i asked my son what the heck was he downloading and this is what he said nothing all i did was do load a free app for my photos from android market what was happening was that the app that he downloaded was sending advertisements to other lines and apps and that is were all the data was going as soon as he deleted the app the data went back to normal now you might say well you can have unlimited data with other companies yes but your phone is working very hard in your pocket and a its draining your battery and b your being hit with more radiation because its always on connection mode and when a phone is connected the level off radiation increases so i am getting rid of it most of the android apps are useless anyway i prefer now to go with windows and less apps but useful assuming windows apps do not ask for the same permissions cause if they do it will be a no no for them as well vs from androids many and worthless this is the last droid for me even though i liked it thanks abhishek kadu  1102 11012013windows phones are far better than android have used samsung galaxy android phone although there are lot of apps on google play much better than windows apps but most of the android phones do not have the bandwidth to load these apps and finally you end up uninstalling the app for the basic phone usage adarshagarwal  1114 07012013i am a nokia lumia 800 user n i feel shit using it n from hearing that windows 7 cant be update to windows 8  so they said they are updating windows 75 to 78 so i had updated it the features are a windows 8 start screen bing wallpaper which as a locks teen image or we can set our any image  there are two most important things which is ringtone maker n bluetooth sharing through which i can share files such as picture n music but no videos n there is another thing in internet explorer i can make bing or google n the last thing in the update is a1b2c3 password which is good this is all about in windows update 78boostin91tsi  0604 24122012its hard to decide which phone is better being a person who has had multiple android os phones i went to a microsoft store and played with a wp8 htc and liked the smoothness of it however i feel that i have more control with my rooted 41 jellybean android os wp8 is still in the progress of gaining root access last i checked and doesnt have a voice search function such as google now andor siri its really based upon your preference i hope wp8 will get better and have the ability to gain root access for more control of the phone but even still with my android i can always update to the newest and greatest versions google has leaked or sourced lets see what microsoft can do to make wp8 succeed in the market samanthaheartsu  2255 21122012thanks for this article it really helped brandon simms  0040 19122012i would like to add some insight if i may i personally own a galaxy note 2 and nokia lumia 920 yellow phone i have literally owned almost every single smart phone that was either a flagship or close to since 2009 needless to say i am addicted to smartphones i love working with developers and running custom settings whether it be roms or simply launchers i have to say i have read a lot of authors posting an article for some major reputable companies and quite frankly i dont know how they have a job dont even get me started but stupidity is just the start but since this author did a fairly good nonbiased view of things i wanted to take the time so give some of my own experience on the table when people ask what is the best phone out there that really is broad question not to mention if answered correctly has a slew of information that follows with it the windows 8 phone really is amazing and believe it or not i have dabbled with lower end hardware specs of the cheaper windows 8 phones and i will say this they are all fast and smooth which is great some people only have 50 bucks to shell out and that will get you an windows phone the one thing that if you compare a low end windows phone to a low end android phone is this low end windows phones work flawlessly and smooth where as for android low end phones you want to start banging your head into a wall not to mention when there is an update lets say going from ice cream sandwich to key lime chances are your phone is going to slow down even more since the developers over at google are taking the most common stats of hardware and building software around that structure not the hardware from a year ago so if you really want to enjoy android to its fullest potential you need a high end phone or flagship phone which some people are not willing to pay on to the other part of things people are saying  google playstore has 700000 apps ok for starters no one has that many apps and even for geeky people such as myself i have a 152 apps and i only use about 45 of them on a daily basis for the big name apps such as facebook twitter readers reddit windows has these apps not only that have you ever looked at the ui of facebook twitter readers reddit youtube on windows dear mother of god there is no debate there is not opinion on this windows hands down absolutely destroys android and i os uis and user friendliness youtube by the way for windows is called metrotube amazing now when i look at benefits and likes of an android there are really a lot of things to love especially for geeky people such as myself custom roms root there are some apps like root call blocker that actually will work and do what they are supposed to i os and windows offer nothing of the sort unfortunately changing the ui with a custom rom or making the phone run at amazing speeds to increase the performance for games is awesome another thing to point out is that on android phones there are quite a few that offer the big screen for watching videos and gaming which is a real treat where the biggest screen you will get now is about a 45 now there is one thing that a lot of the windows phones do not have that android does offer and that is a ton of upgradable storage space if you really need it personally if i have that much music i just select what i need and transfer it to my phone i dont need 64 gigs of space on my phone but for those who do its also another major benefit well thats all i am going to post for now i could go on in much much more detail with things on all the pros and cons with phones but that can wait at the end of the day people need to stop saying windows has catching up to do they really dont they are already there and now its just of adding something more and unique that others dont have to windows android and windows are amazing in their own rights
