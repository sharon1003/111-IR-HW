you are consulting or contracted with another entity your employer and affiliation will typically be different eg your employer selfemployed or your consulting firm name as the employer the client s

other participation privileges within the ieeesa for such participants and any affiliated entities back to topwhat if i represent more than one affiliate or multiple companies are funding my participation if they are financially or materially supporting your participation you should declare all of them a small number of entities are more likely to be influencing your positions with a large number of entities with none explicitly or implicitly influencing your positions through financial or other incentives it is less likely that your positions would be influenced by the relationship the person disclosing has to honestly judge if their positions are materially supported and if so declare it back to topi consult for multiple companies but none pay for my time or expenses to attend standards development meetings am i affiliated with those companies if they are influencing what positions you take on issues eg continued work is probably dependent on taking an agreeable position then you are materially supported by that affiliate back to topim employed but my employer isnt funding my participation what should i record for affiliation it is recognized that some ieeesa participants may participate on their own time on standards development projects eg sponsor ballot participation in this case it may be factually accurate to list your employer but for affiliation indicate that you represent yourself or are selffunded on that particular ieeesa activity a participant is encouraged to check with their employer or legal advisor that this participation is consistent with any employee agreement to which they are subject back to topif am i retired do i need to list an affiliation if you are not financially or materially supported by another person or entity eg you participate as a volunteer for the good of the industry you could declare employer as self employed and affiliation as the same back to topif i am being funded by a subsidiary do i need to disclose its parent affiliation if parent entities are not obvious and are material to the standards development activity certainly you may disclose them this is one area that is likely to be pursued in the event there is ever an investigation of domination of a standards development activity back to topif the parent affiliate is not financially supporting participation are they still considered my parent affiliate in the event of an investigation on possible domination this information may be required independent of financial support of your activity back to topwhat is the sponsors responsibility related to affiliation declarations in a sponsor ballot group is there any exception for publishing declared affiliations in the minutes the rules regarding sponsor ballot groups are detailed in the ieeesa standards board bylaws 5223 there are no exceptions defined regarding minutes if though a participant makes a declaration that is obscene defamatory to an individual
