ringing out in american schools used to be rare and shocking now it seems to happen all the time the scene in benton ky on tuesday was the worst so far in 2018 two 15yearold students were killed and 18 more people were injured but it was one of at least 11 shootings on school property recorded since jan 1 and roughly the 50th of the academic year researchers and gun control advocates say that since 2013 they have logged school shootings at a rate of about one a week“we have absolutely become numb to these kinds of shootings and i think that will continue” said katherine w schweit a former senior f b i official and the coauthor of a study of 160 active shooting incidents in the united states related coverage newtown is ‘still so raw’ 5 years after sandy hook shooting dec 13 2017columbine shocked the nation now mass shootings are less surprising nov 10 2017‘tell your story to everyone’ readers affected by mass killings offer advice for fellow survivors nov 8 2017some of the shootings at schools this year were suicides that injured no one else some did not result in any injuries at all but in the years since the massacres at columbine high school in colorado virginia tech and sandy hook elementary school in newtown conn gun safety advocates say all school shootings seem to have lost some of their capacity to shock shannon watts the founder of moms demand action a gun safety group said that’s because in 2012 in newtown “20 first graders and six educators were slaughtered in an elementary school”“the news cycles are so short right now in america and there’s a lot going on” she said “but you would think that shootings in american schools would be able to clear away some of that clutter”gov matt bevin of kentucky said the gunman who opened fire tuesday morning at marshall county high school in benton near the western tip of the state was a 15yearold student the authorities said the student entered the school just before 8 am fired shots that struck 14 people and set off a panicked flight in which five more were hurt one girl who was shot bailey nicole holt died at the scene a boy preston ryan cope died of his injuries at a hospital bryson conkwright a junior at the school said he was talking with a friend on tuesday morning when he spotted the gunman walking up near him “it took me a second to process it” mr conkwright 17 said in an interview “one of my best friends got shot in the face and then another one of my best friends was shot in the shoulder”he said he was part of a group of students who fled kicked down a door to get outside and ran the suspect who was not immediately identified was taken into custody in “a nonviolent apprehension” mr bevin said and officials said he would be charged with two counts of murder and several counts of attempted murder but the authorities had not yet decided whether to charge the suspect who was armed with a pistol as a juvenile or as an adult of the 18 people injured five remained

from the school described the area as a “very closeknit community” where just about everyone would have known a student at the school “it’s personal when it’s a small town like this” he said about a mile from the high school a large american flag flew at halfstaff over a ponderosa steakhouse on tuesday night taylor mc cuiston 21 a manager at the restaurant who graduated from marshall county high school two years ago was working when the shooting occurred down the road“it was very scary because like 90 percent of the staff that works here goes to that school” she said “so for the first hour we were just scrambling trying to make sure they were all o k and accounted for”the town of italy tex is not any bigger than benton on monday a 15yearold girl there was hospitalized after she was shot by a 16yearold classmate according to local news reports that suspect a boy was taken into custody by the ellis county sheriff’s department the authorities said on tuesday that the victim was recovering the f b i study that ms schweit helped write examined active shooter episodes in the united states between 2000 and 2013 it found that nearly onequarter of them occurred in educational environments and they were on the rise in the first half of the study period federal officials counted 16 active shooter incidents in educational settings meaning instances of a person “actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a confined and populated area” in the second half the number rose to 23 many but not all of the school shootings tallied by advocates so far this year meet that definition “any time there’s a school shooting it’s more gutwrenching and i think we have a tendency to react in a more visceral way” ms schweit said in an interview on tuesday “but i really don’t think as a whole in society we’re taking shootings more seriously than we were before — and that’s wrong”even so jarred and fearful school administrators across the country have been placing greater emphasis on preparing for the possibility of an active shooter according to a report issued by the government accountability office in march 2016 19 states were requiring individual schools to have plans for how to deal with an active shooter only 12 states required schools to conduct drills but twothirds of school districts reported that they had staged active shooter exercises school safety experts say steps like the drills are crucial if imperfect safeguards“i think we’ve become somewhat desensitized to the fact that these things happened and it takes a thing like sandy hook to bring us back to our senses” said william modzeleski a consultant who formerly led the department of education’s office of safe and drug free schools“my fear is that if you don’t hear about a school shooting for a while educators move on to other things” he said “principals are busy teachers are busy superintendents are busy”in kentucky lawmakers have grappled with how to address the risk of school shootings last year state legislators considered but did not pass a bill that would have allowed people with concealedcarry permits to bring weapons on to public school campuses where proponents argue they could be used to respond to active shooters a similar bill limited to college campuses and certain other government buildings has been introduced this year it was not immediately clear how the shooting in benton might affect the debate in frankfort the kentucky capital but in benton “this is a wound that is going to take a long time to heal” said mr bevin the governor “ and for some in this community will never fully heal”correction january 23 2018a picture in an earlier version of this article mistakenly identified one of the schools that have had shootings in recent days the school was
