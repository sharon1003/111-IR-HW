held me still as a deeply breathing statue all the planets at once  fred schaaf the starry room mercury venus mars asteroidsjupit e r saturn uranus  neptune  plutothe five brightest planets  mercury venus mars jupit e r and saturn  have been known since ancient times and can easily be seen with the naked eye if one knows when and where to look they are visible for much of the year except for short periods of time when they are too close to the sun to observe all of the planets will not normally be visible on a single night however jupiter libra and scorpius at first light jupit e r was in the constellation of libra when this photo was taken at dawn in january 2006 jupiter  the bright white star visible towards the upper right  then shone at an apparent magnitude of 20 outshining all of the stars in its vicinity move your cursor over the image  or click here  to identify jupiter and the constellations and click for a fullscreen picture the planets can be distinguished from the stars because their position changes slightly against the background stars from one night to the next and their brightness varies in a regular cycle over a period of time stars are so distant that they appear as points of light in the night sky and they appear to twinkle or scintillate because of turbulence in the earths atmosphere even in the largest earthbound telescopes a star appears as little more than a point of light the naked eye planets on the other hand are close enough to the earth to form a sizeable but nonetheless tiny disk in the night sky and consequently when they are well above the horizon the planets shine with a more steady light than the stars of the brighter planets only saturn and mars are ever likely to be mistaken for ordinary stars  but only during their dimmer more distant periods the stars generate their own light by internal nuclear fusion reactions however the planets do not produce any light of their own instead they shine by reflecting a proportion of the sunlight they receive back out into space the proportion of sunlight they reflect known as the albedo depends upon the planets size the amount of cloud cover it has and  where there is little or no cloud cover  the reflectivity of the features on its surface the brightness of a planet to the naked eye depends upon a number of factors its distance from the sun itsapparent size ie its angular size when seen from the earth and the relative positions of the planet and the earth in their orbits the period of time during which any given planet or any other celestial body can be seen is known as anapparition for mercury and venus this is the period during which the planet is well seen in either the morning sky or the evening sky for mars and beyond an apparition is measured from the time the planet becomes visible in the dawn sky rising shortly before the sun to the time it disappears into the dusk sky setting shortly after the sun  the length of a planets apparition depends upon its orbital period ie the time it takes the planet to orbit the sun and its position in relation to the sun and the earth at any given time apparitions can last from just a few weeks in the case of mercury to almost two years for mars although a planet is normally seen at its best for only a part of this time unlike galaxies and nebulae which are invariably faint the nakedeye planets can easily be seen in lightpollutedskies ie where the night sky glows yelloworange due to a multitude of poorlydirected lighting from streetlights and other illuminations the naming of the planets the planets each have their own movement brightness and colour characteristics the ancient greeks around the sixth century bc referred to them as planetes asteres wandering stars from which the word planet is derived they named each planet mainly according to its brightness and colour the name given to them being mostly associated with heat and light hence venus  brilliant white colouration earned it the name phosphoros the lightbearing one and mars  orangered colour was associated with fire so it was given the name pyroeis the fiery one and so on in the fourth century bc the greek philosopher aristotle converted these descriptive names into the names of greek gods and one goddess each planets attributes roughly matching those of its chosen god the romans later acquired these greek names and translated them into their own equivalent gods and these are the names that we still use today hence the greek goddess aphrodite became the roman goddess venus and the greek god ares became the roman god mars etc saturn in leo 2007between 2006 and 2009 goldenyellow saturnappeared as an additional bright star in the constellation of leo the lion move your cursor over the image  or click here

graecoroman gods continuing the earlier tradition uranus is the only one of themajor planets which retains the name of a greek god ouranos  this is because the romans had no god which was equivalent to uranus the names of the ancient roman and greek gods and one goddess which were associated with the planets are given in the planet appearance section below together with a picture of each one in the form of a statue a statuette or a bust pluto loses its planet status at a meeting of the international astronomical union iau in prague czech republic in august 2006 astronomers decided that pluto will no longer be officially classed as a planet in the true sense instead it is now part of a new class of solar system bodies known as dwarf planets together with ceres the largest of the asteroids and eris previously known as 2003 ub313 or  xena  in 2008 makemake pronounced mahkeh mahkeh  and haumea joined the growing list of dwarf planets consequently there are now officially only eight true

following table provides an indication of the times of the day in which to view each of the planets in 2018  pluto is not included because it is solely a telescopic object the table entries can be read horizontally by planet to track the changing visibility of a particular planet during the year or vertically by month to determine the visibility status of all the planets in any single month visibility tables for the years 2008 to 2020 can be seen on the visibility of the planets page when two or more planets are listed as being visible at  dawn  or  dusk  in any particular month eg if mercury venus and mars all appear listed under  dusk  in a single month they are likely to appear close together in the sky during this time and planetary conjunctions when two planets are at the same celestial longitude are most likely to take place tables of planetary conjunctions through to 2020 can be found on the following pages venus mars jupit e r saturn uranus and neptune because they mostly occur around dawn or dusk conjunctions can often be difficult to observe depending upon the observers latitude and the local season for this reason the tables include an assessment of the likely visibility of each conjunction from both northern and southern hemispheres general visibility times of the planets in 2018 visibility times of the planets are shown here in general terms for the current year for an explanation of each entry see the box below with the exception of mercury the times are based on the planets positions at midmonth note that although a planet may be listed as being visible at a particular time in a month this does not necessarily mean that it will be visible from all locations on earth the observers latitude and the local season can affect whether a planet is seen or not this is particularly so for the  dawn  and  dusk  entries and especially so in the case of mercury see under mercury s description for more details since the planets viewing times can change in the course of a month eg from dawn to mor ning sky visibility the entries inevitably contain an element of imprecision consequently the table should only be used as a general guide to assess the times at which to view the planets back to top of page finding the planets in your local night sky where in the night sky should i look for a planet tonight in which direction and how high up will it be the location of a planet or any other celestial body in your local night sky depends upon several factors the constellation in which it is positioned your geographical latitude and longitude the local season and the date and time at which you observe to find a planet in the night sky at any particular date and time we must know two things a direction in which to look along the observers

position the red circle represents the horizon around you the lower half of the display represents the part of the sky you are facing the centre of the circle is the point directly above your head known as the zenith  the ecliptic the path along which the sun moon and planets will be found is marked by a r e d d a s h e d li n e passing as it does through the zodiac constellations the b l u e d

down to the horizon whenever the view has been zoomed information on a celestial body can be viewed by clicking on the object in the case of a planet its magnitude distance elongation and apparent diameter  note that if a planets elongation its angular distance from the sun as seen from the earth is less than about 15° it will not be visible because it is too near the sun the much fainter planets uranus and neptune are not visible at elongations less than about 20° remember that local twilight can affect the visibility of a particular planet making observation difficult or even impossible this particularly applies throughout the local summer months at higher latitudes to find the location of a planet in your night sky first see if it is above the horizon at the time you are requesting if it is visible within the circle move the bottom scroll bar left or right to rotate the image until the planet is positioned on the vertical red line the altitude scale  zoom in to the area using the lefthand scroll bar where necessary the direction of the planet at the requested time will be indicated at the bottom  w sw etc the altitude of the planet its angle above the horizon can be read off on the altitude scale it is marked at 10° intervals hence if it is three notches up its altitude is 30° at the displayed time to understand how to determine a planets altitude in the night sky refer to the two diagrams below if the planets altitude is less than about 10° it may be difficult to see because of the dimming effect of the earths atmosphere and in town and city locations the effects of light pollution orskyglow if the planet is not shown within the circle it is below the horizon and you will have to wait until after it next rises before you can see it provided it is not too near the sun to find when it next rises click the hours forward button  repeatedly until the planet appears over the eastern horizon then note down the time and direction this occurs by clicking the minuteshours forward buttons   the planet can then be tracked across the sky for the remainder of the night using direction and altitude as described above if the planet rises in daylight ie if the sun is already above the horizon you will have to wait until after dusk to see it  in which case fast forward to a time shortly after sunset then note down the time and direction angular altitude or elevation is measured as 0º at the horizon when an object is at the point of rising or setting 45º when half way up the sky and 90º when directly above the observers head at the zenith  in the above picture the bright star has an altitude of about 60º ie it is 60º high  using direction and altitude to find a star or planet in the night sky  in this case the starplanet is in the southeast se at an altitude of 20 º dawn and dusk planets which planets are visible at dawn and dusk today this is easily found from miniastro viewer ®by positioning the sun on the eastern horizon ie sunrise for dawn planets and on the western horizon sunset for dusk planets click the minuteshours backward  or forward  buttons until the sun is positioned on the required horizon this will also give the time of local sunrise or sunset whichever planets are positioned in the eastern half of the sky at sunrise are dawn planets visible before sunrise and whichever planets are positioned in the western half of the sky at sunset are dusk planets visible after sunset in some cases it will be found that a planet is rising whilst the sun is setting  or likewise a planet is setting whilst the sun is rising  in which case the planet is at opposition ie it is directly opposite the sun in the sky and shining at its brightest for the year this can only happen in the case ofsuperior planets and it

descending order of their average apparent magnitude brightness when seen from the earth the brightness values listed for mercury venus mars and jupit e r are the brightest and dimmest magnitudes the planet can attain throughout its orbit the brightest magnitude is listed first those for saturn uranus neptune and pluto are the average brightness values for when the planet is closest to the earth

with a brilliant white light although some claim that it has a slightly bluish tint it is the brightest planet in the night sky when visible it outshines all the other planets  and indeed all the other stars in the night sky  at which time only the sun and the moon are brighter venus has a cycle of alternating morning and evening appearances and is popularly named the morning star when seen in the eastern sky before sunrise  see photo and the evening star when seen in the western sky after sunset each apparition lasts for several months during which time the planet slowly moves away from the sun reaches itsgreatest elongation around 46 degrees away and then slowly moves back towards the sun eventually disappearing into the morning or evening twilight remaining visible for most of the time at greatest elongation venus risessets some 3 hours beforeafter the sun when seen through a telescope venus shows phases much like the moon to understand why the phases of venus appear as they do when seen from earth orbit refer to the  inferior planets  section of the planet movements page venus thin crescent phase can be discerned in good quality binoculars when it is in the nearer part of its orbit to the earth ie when it is closing in on the sun in the evening sky or pulling away from the sun in the morning sky some keeneyed observers have even claimed to see the crescent with the naked eye however venus brilliance produces considerable glare when seen against a dark sky so when using optical aid it is best observed in bright twilight when shining at its greatest brilliancy venus can cast faint shadows at night and it can even be glimpsed in daylight given a clear hazefree sky and provided that the planet is well clear of the sun the best way to see venus in daylight is when it is a morning star when it can be continually observed through to sunrise and beyond venus comes closer to the earth than any other planet  to within 26 million miles 41 million kms its brilliance is largely due to the high reflectivity  albedo of its clouds which perpetually obscure the view of the planets extremely hot surface ephemeris 20162020venus is visible for about 8 months before its greatest eastern elongation date evening apparition and for a further 2½ months afterwards after which it disappears into the evening twilight for morning apparitions it is visible for about 2½ months before its greatest western elongation and for a further 8 months afterwards following which it disappears into the morning twilight its greatest brilliance occurs about 5 weeks after greatest eastern elongation evening apparition and about 5 weeks before greatest western elongation morning apparition in the following list greatest elongation details are given in brackets in the format solar elongation constellation hence 46º ari means 46º from the sun in the constellation aries its elongation from the sun at dates other than greatest elongation can be estimated on the basis that the angular elongation is 0º at inferior and superior conjunction venus typically remains close to its greatest elongation for about a week or two before and after the greatest elongation date

the phases of venus were first observed telescopically by italian astronomer philosopher and physicist galileo galilei in 1610 using one of the worlds first telescopes the first telescope is believed to have been made by dutch spectacle maker hans lipperhey around 160910 the observation of venus moonlike phases was an important discovery because it provided clear evidence in favour of the  copernican  system of planetary orbits  proposed by polish cleric and astronomer nicolaus copernicus in the 16th century  which said that the sun was at the centre of our solar system in galileos time the  ptolemaic  system  which put the earth at the centre of the solar system  was the widely held view galileos defence of the copernican system brought him into conflict with the roman catholic church and it ultimately led to him being held under house arrest until his death in 1642 back to planet index move cursor over image jupit e r iove  joveking of the gods apparent magnitude29 to

of telescopic observation jupiters four brightest moons were first seen telescopically by galileo in 1610 for this reason they are often referred to as the galilean satellites or simply the galileans  a year later the moons were observed independently by german astronomer simon marius who subsequently named them jupiters great red spot was probably first observed by english scientist robert hooke in 1664 followed a year later by italian astronomer giovanni cassini back to planet index move cursor over image mars martegod of war apparent magnitude29 to 18original greek name pyroeis fiery onegreek god ares mars is easily recognised since it has the most distinctive coloration of all the naked eye planets although it is popularly called  the red planet  it rarely appears red to the naked eye in fact it varies from pale orangeyellow to orangered depending upon its distance from the earth and therefore its brightness the reddish colour is caused by the presence ofiron oxide rust on the planets surface mars attractive coloration has often given rise to descriptive terms such as orange spark campfire orange pumpkin orange and so on occasional global dust storms on mars such as those which happened in 2001 and 2007 can however make it appear decidedly yellowish because of its eccentric orbit mars distance from the earth varies considerably from one opposition to the next which typically take place about every 2 years and 7 weeks see mars oppositionspage mars brightest and best oppositions occur in groups of two or three which repeat in a cycle of about 16 years when its orbit brings it closest to the earth 35 million miles56 million kms distant in the opposition of 2003 mars came closer to the earth than it had been for almost 60000 years for about six weeks either side of opposition mars can clearly be seen in twilight at its brightest mars outshines the star sirius but even at its more distant oppositions it outshines the star arcturus magnitude 004  note that because of mars eccentric orbit the dates of its opposition and its closest approach to the earth can differ by up to two weeks when it is on the far side of its orbit from the earth ie in between oppositions mars appears as an unremarkable orangered star shining only about as bright as the stars of orions belt for much of the time through a telescope mars typically appears amber or salmonpink in color it is a difficult planet to observe  despite its relative closeness  since it is only about half the size of the earth under good atmospheric seeing conditions small telescopes

telescopic observation the first telescopic observation of mars was by galileo in 1610 he was able to resolve the gibbous phase of the planet but no surface details the first definite surface details were observed by dutch astronomer christiaan huygens in 1659 his drawings show a dark triangular feature which is now known to be  syrtis major  mars polar caps were first observed by giovanni cassini in 1666 when italian astronomer giovanni schiaparelli turned his telescope on mars in 1877 he saw what he believed to be a series of linear features crisscrossing the planet which he named  canali  italian for channels though it was incorrectly translated into english as canals he thought they might be artificial structures built by the martians to irrigate the planet by transferring water from the polar caps to the warmer drier regions of the planet his observations were supported by other astronomers the most notable being percival lowell founder of flagstaff observatory in arizona but the idea was rejected by numerous others who were unable to see the features that schiaparelli had claimed to see the  canals on mars  controversy was finally resolved when the first spacecraft were sent to take closeup pictures of the planet in the 1960s no canals were found to exist on mars and what schiaparelli had probably seen were the result of telescopic defects or tricks of the eye schiaparelli had also believed that the dark regions on mars were caused by vegetation growth an idea first suggested by french astronomer e liais in 1860 the idea seemed credible because the dark areas appeared to expand and retract in synchrony with the martian seasons today we know that these dark regions are simply a colour contrast effect their apparent spreading and shrinking being the result of seasonaldust storms which blow lightcoloured dust away from the darkercoloured surface in 1898 partly inspired by schiaparelli and lowells ideas english writer h g wells published his classic novel the war of the worlds which described a martian invasion of the earth as witnessed by a londonbased writer  see reference 1 the moons phobos and deimos were discovered by american astronomer asaph hall at the u s naval observatory in washington dc in 1877 remarkably two martian moons had been suggested by author jonathan swift in his fictional novel gullivers travels part iii a voyage to laputa published in 1727  some 150 years before their discovery voltaires short story micromégas published in 1750 also referred to mars having two moons see reference 2 for online links the logic behind their idea seems to have been that since the earth had one moon and jupiter was known to have four moons mars must have had an intermediate number ie two moons however an alternative explanation may be that the authors drew their inspiration from german astronomer johannes kepler who in 1610 had apparently suggested that mars may have two moons all three visionaries were officially recognised following spacecraft missions to the martian moons in the 1970s  kepler had a geological ridge on phobos named after him whilst swift and voltaire each had a crater on deimos named after them back to planet index move cursor over image mercury mercuriusmessenger of the gods apparent magnitude19 to 38original greek name stilbon shining onegreek god hermes mercury is generally more difficult to spot than the other bright planets mainly because from the vantage point of the earth mercury never appears very far from the sun between 17 and 28 degrees away the variation being due to its highly eccentric orbit consequently it can only be seen with the naked eye when it is low down in twilight shortly after sunset or before sunrise and it is never seen in fully dark skies mercury typically makes three morning appearances and three evening appearances each year though for any given location on earth mercury will only be well placed for viewing on about half of these occasions because of the length of local twilight and the angle of the ecliptic to the local horizon for northern hemisphere observers mercury is best seen on marchapril evenings and septemberoctober mornings southern hemisphere observers get their best views on septemberoctober evenings and marchapril mornings around greatest elongation in the evening binoculars will help to locate it  in the general direction of the sunset  around 45 minutes or so after sundown the exact time to start looking depends upon the length of local twilight after which its position should be easily pinpointed with the naked eye likewise during morning apparitions the planet should be found in the general direction of sunrise about 45 minutes or so before sunup mercury is generally white in colour though its low altitude angular height above the horizon causes it to take on a somewhat pinkish hue for the same reason that the sun appears reddish at sunrise or sunset indeed both venus and jupiter can appear orangered when they are close to the horizon because mercury is the closest planet to the sun and it moves so swiftly its brightness varies rapidly during any given apparition like venus mercury shows phases when seen through a telescope however mercury is a less impressive sight because of its smaller apparent size and the much poorer seeing conditions at low altitude for the same reason mercury appears to scintillate twinkle more readily than the other bright planets greatest elongation dates 20162020  greatest elongation dates 20052015mercury is easiest to see when it reaches greatest elongation however it can normally be seen for several days either side of this date a flat unobstructed horizon is required to see it in the following list details are given in

another polish observer  johannes hewelcke commonly known as hevelius  in the first half of the 17th century the first serious observation of the planet was by english but germanborn astronomer and

christiaan huygens following his telescopic observations of the planet in 1655 correctly described the true nature of the rings when he said saturn is surrounded by a thin flat ring not touching it anywhere which is oblique to the ecliptic huygens also discovered titan that same year the early astronomers often referred to saturns rings as  ansae  latin for handles because of their handlelike

discovered in 1781 by sir william herschel who initially thought he had found a new comet in his own wordson tuesday 13th of march between ten and eleven in the evening while i was examining the small stars in the neighbourhood of h geminorum authors note  this star is now called 1 geminorum i perceived one that appeared visibly larger than the rest being struck with its uncommon magnitude i compared it to h geminorum and the small star in the quartile between auriga and gemini and finding it to be much larger than either of them suspected it to be a comet the finnish astronomer anders lexell proposed that what herschel had found was in fact a planet and he suggested it be called george iiis neptune or great britains neptune herschel discovered the planet whilst observing from his home town of bath in england herschel himself proposed the name georgium sidus the georgian star or the georgian planet in honour of george iii then king of england other suggested names included hypercronius and transaturnis by swiss mathematician daniel bernoulli herschel by french astronomer joseph lalande and austräa by german scientist georg christoph lichtenberg none of these names followed the traditional naming scheme however and it was the german astronomer johann bode who suggested that uranus would be a more appropriate name for the planet although bode suggested this name soon after its discovery it took several decades to become accepted worldwide in fact the english astronomer john flamsteed had already observed uranus  but not identified it as a planet  some 90 years before its discovery but he had assumed it was an ordinary star there were no less than 16 other observations of this star by three other independent astronomers before its true nature was correctly identified in 2013 belgian amateur astronomer rené bourtembourg suggested that uranus had first been glimpsed but noted as a star around 128 bc by hipparchus of nicaea ca 190120 bc the observation was noted in the almagest a 2ndcentury ad star catalogue usually credited to claudius ptolemy but considered by some to have been the work of hipparchus the planet was magnitude 54 and

called minor planets  are small rocky bodies which mostly occupy the region of the solar system lying between mars and jupiter by 2009 over 420000 asteroids had been discovered of various shapes and sizes though only 14000 of them have been officially named asteroids typically have highlyelliptical orbits and their orbital inclinationsoften carry them well outside the narrow band of the ecliptic occupied by the major planets of the four brightest asteroids  namely vesta ceres pallas and iris  only vesta becomes bright enough to be glimpsed with the unaided eye from dark sites reaching magnitude 52 although it does so only occasionally eg in 2011 2014 and 2018 all four of these asteroids  and a handful of others including juno hebe and eunomia  can be seen through binoculars appearing as starlike points of light which move a short distance against the background stars from one night to the next the standard procedure for identifying an asteroid through binoculars  once its general location has been found from a detailed astronomical ephemeris  is to sketch the stars seen in the binocular field of view then return a night or two later to the same region of sky and note which of the stars has moved  this will be the asteroid in question following an iau meeting in the czech republic in 2006 the largest asteroid ceres pronounced  seerees  is now officially classed as a dwarf planet  one of a new distinct category of solar system bodies the remaining asteroids are now technically referred to assmall solar system bodies a category which also includes comets and all the moons of the solar system ephemerides asteroid orbits are continually subject to gravitational effects known as perturbations from the major planets and from neighbouring asteroids consequently ephemerides for minor planets are not normally calculated a long time in advance because this could result in significant positional errors finder charts of the brighter asteroids visible in the current year together with their opposition dates and magnitudes can be obtained at the baas computing section website history of discovery the asteroids were discovered as a result of a curious numerical law of planetary distances first proposed by johann titius of wittenberg in 1772 but which has no obvious relationship with the scientific laws of planetary motion the law was popularised later that year by johann bode and it became known as bodes law or rather more fairly titiusbodes law  the law suggested that a major planet should exist in the rather large gap between the orbits of mars and jupiter as a result an extensive telescopic search was begun in 1800 by a group of six european astronomers calling themselves the  celestial police  the team did not discover a major planet however but a series of minor planets instead ceres was the first to be discovered in 1801 by sicilian clergyman and astronomer guiseppe piazzi followed by pallas in 1802 by german heinrich olbers juno in 1804 by karl ludwig harding also german and vesta in 1807 also by olbers iris  the fourth brightest asteroid  was the seventh to be discovered by englishman john russell hind in 1847 all of these asteroids were named after ancient greek and roman goddesses the term asteroid was coined in 1802 by sir william herschel discoverer of uranus it is greek for starlike indicating their starlike appearance when seen through telescopes the term did not attain widespread usage until the 1850s however back to planet index move cursor over image neptune god of the sea apparent

urbain le verrier independently predicted the position of a new planet based on its gravitational effects  perturbations on other planets in the solar system adams findings were met with little enthusiasm however although a search for the new planet was eventually undertaken at cambridge observatory in england in september 1846 le verrier forwarded his own calculations to astronomers johann galle and heinrich darrest at the berlin observatory in germany giving precise instructions on where to search for the new planetdirect your telescope to a point on the ecliptic in the constellation of aquarius in longitude 326 degrees and you will find within a degree of that place a new planet looking like a star of about the ninth magnitude and having a perceptible disk galle and darrest discovered neptune only days later there followed a heated international debate over who should be given credit for the discovery although adams and leverrier themselves took little part in it and they later became friends today they are both credited with neptunes discovery like uranus neptune had also been unknowingly observed by other astronomers long before its actual discovery galileo while he was busy observing jupiter apparently marked it down as a star in his notebook in 1612  some 233 years before its discovery joseph lalande also recorded it in 1795 and james challis  who in 1846 had been put in charge of the british search for neptune  had also recorded the planet just six weeks before its discovery but he failed to identify it at the time both astronomers had recorded

below history of discovery pluto was discovered in 1930 by the then amateur astronomer clyde tombaugh at lowell observatory in arizona usa  ending a 25yearlong search for what had become known as  planet x   a sizeable planet beyond neptune which was thought to be having a significant gravitational effect on the orbits of uranus and neptune having found the ninth planet tombaugh continued to search for other new planets for a further 13 years but without success in 1943 he reported that it seems safe to conclude from the lowell surveys that no unknown planet beyond saturn exists that is brighter than magnitude 16½ at the time of search the name pluto was proposed soon after its discovery by 11yearold british schoolgirl venetia burney who had become aware of the scale of the solar system during a recent nature walk with her school appropriately the first two letters of pl uto matched the initials of astronomer p ercival l owell see mars history of discovery above who had first suggested the existence of a planet beyond neptune but did not live to see its discovery see reference 3 for the full story however pluto turned out to be much smaller than astronomers had expected  so small in fact that it could not have had the gravitational effect on uranus and neptune that had been predicted even though the calculations had  by sheer good luck  led them to find pluto itselfmainly due to its small size plutos continuing status as a planet has been the subject of much debate in recent years many astronomers had thought that pluto should not be considered a planet but rather one of the larger members of the kuiper belt  planetoids which orbit the sun in the outer reaches of the solar system beyond neptune socalled transneptunian objects or tnos the first kuiper belt object kbo was discovered in 1992 and by the end of 2005 some 900 kbos were known these include in approximate descending order of size erismakemake haumea sedna orcus quaoar pronounced kwahwaa and varuna  which are all below magnitude 172 evidently there must be numerous largersized kbos still awaiting discovery see reference 4  at a meeting of the iau in the czech republic in august 2006 the issue of plutos planetary status was finally resolved in accordance with the new qualifying requirements for a planet see reference 5 astronomers decided that pluto would no longer be classed as a true planet because its highlyelliptical orbit overlaps with that of neptune in the words of the iau resolution pluto has not cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit pluto is now one of a new class of solar system bodies called dwarf planets whose other members are currently the asteroid ceres see above  eris makemake and haumea many astronomers disagree with the iaus new definition but in the meantime the iau is considering numerous other solar system objects with a view to also awarding them dwarf planet status in june 2008 the iau adopted the term  plutoid  to describe plutolike objects orbiting at transneptunian distances which have sufficient mass to form a nearspherical shape as of 2008 only four objects were known to meet these criteria namely pluto eris makemake and haumea see
