based on the concept that the brain is the organ of the mind and that certain brain areas have localized specific functions or modules 1 although both of those ideas have a basis in reality phrenology extrapolated beyond empirical knowledge in a way that departed from science developed by german physician franz joseph gall in 1796 2 the discipline was very popular in the 19th century especially from about 1810 until 1840 the principal british centre for phrenology was edinburgh where the edinburgh phrenological society was established in 1820 although now regarded as an obsolete amalgamation of primitive neuroanatomy with moral philosophy phrenological thinking was influential in 19thcentury psychiatry galls assumption that character thoughts and emotions are located in specific parts of the brain is considered an important historical advance toward neuropsychology 3 4contents  hide 1 mental faculties2 method3 history4 application5 reception51 britain52 france53 ireland54 united

editphrenologists believe that the human mind has a set of various mental faculties each one represented in a different area of the brain for example the faculty of philoprogenitiveness from the greek for love of offspring was located centrally at the back of the head see illustration of the chart from websters academic dictionary  these areas were said to be proportional to a persons propensities the importance of an organ was derived from relative size compared to other organs it was believed that the cranial skull—like a glove on the hand—accommodates to the different sizes of these areas of the brain so that a persons capacity for a given personality trait could be determined simply by measuring the area of the skull that overlies the corresponding area of the brain phrenology which focuses on personality and character is distinct from craniometry which is the study of skull size weight and shape and physiognomy the study of facial features method  editphrenology is a process that involves observing andor feeling the skull to determine an individuals psychological attributes franz joseph gall believed that the brain was made up of 27 individual organs that determined personality the first 19 of these organs he believed to exist in other animal species phrenologists would run their fingertips and palms over the skulls of their patients to feel for enlargements or indentations 5 the phrenologist would often take measurements with a tape measure of the overall head size and more rarely employ a craniometer a special version of a caliper in general instruments to measure sizes of cranium continued to be used after the mainstream phrenology had ended the phrenologists put emphasis on using drawings of individuals with particular traits to determine the character of the person and thus many phrenology books show pictures of subjects from absolute and relative sizes of the skull the phrenologist would assess the character and temperament of the patient galls list of the brain organs was specific an enlarged organ meant that the patient used that particular  organ  extensively the number – and more detailed meanings – of organs were added later by other phrenologists the 27 areas varied in function from sense of color to religiosity to being combative or destructive each of the 27 brain organs was located under a specific area of the skull as a phrenologist felt the skull he would use his knowledge of the shapes of heads and organ positions to determine the overall natural strengths and weaknesses of an individual phrenologists believed the head revealed natural tendencies but not absolute limitations or strengths of character the first phrenological chart gave the names of the organs described by gall it was a single sheet and sold for a cent later charts were more expansive 6history  edita definition of phrenology with chart from websters academic dictionary circa 1895among the first to identify the brain as the major controlling center for the body were hippocrates and his followers inaugurating a major change in thinking from egyptian biblical and early greek views which based bodily primacy of control on the heart 7 this belief was supported by the greek physician galen who concluded that mental activity occurred in the brain rather than the heart contending that the brain a cold moist organ formed of sperm was the seat of the animal soul—one of three souls found in the body each associated with a principal organ 8the swiss pastor johann kaspar lavater 1741–1801 introduced the idea that physiognomy related to the specific character traits of individuals rather than general types in his physiognomische fragmente published between 1775 and 1778 9 his work was translated into english and published in 1832 as the pocket lavater or the science of physiognomy 10 he believed that thoughts of the mind and passions of the soul were connected with an individuals external frame of the forehead when the forehead is perfectly perpendicular from the hair to the eyebrows it denotes an utter deficiency of understanding p 24in 1796 the german physician franz joseph gall 1758–1828 began lecturing on organology the isolation of mental faculties 11 and later cranioscopy which involved reading the skulls shape as it pertained to the individual it was galls collaborator johann gaspar spurzheim who would popularize the term phrenology 11 12in 1809 gall began writing his principal 13 work the anatomy and physiology of the nervous system in general and of the brain in particular with observations upon the possibility of ascertaining the several intellectual and moral dispositions of man and animal by the configuration of their heads it was not published until 1819 in the introduction to this main work gall makes the following statement in regard to his doctrinal principles which comprise the intellectual basis of phrenology 14the brain is the organ of the mind the brain is not a homogenous unity but an aggregate of mental organs with specific functions the cerebral organs are topographically localized other things being equal the relative size of any particular mental organ is indicative of the power or strength of that organ since the skull ossifies over the brain during infant development external craniological means could be used to diagnose the internal states of the mental characters through careful observation and extensive experimentation gall believed he had established a relationship between aspects of character called faculties with precise organs in the brain johann spurzheim was galls most important collaborator he worked as galls anatomist until 1813 when for unknown reasons they had a permanent falling out 11 publishing under his own name spurzheim successfully disseminated phrenology throughout the united kingdom during his lecture tours through 1814 and 1815 15 and the united states in 1832 where he would eventually die 16gall was more concerned with creating a physical science so it was through spurzheim that phrenology was first spread throughout europe and america 11 phrenology while not universally accepted was hardly a fringe phenomenon of the era george combe would become the chief promoter of phrenology throughout the englishspeaking world after he viewed a brain dissection by spurzheim convincing him of phrenologys merits george combe the popularization of phrenology in the middle and working classes was due in part to the idea that scientific knowledge was important and an indication of sophistication and modernity 17 cheap and plentiful pamphlets as well as the growing popularity of scientific lectures as entertainment also helped spread phrenology to the masses combe created a system of philosophy of the human mind 18 that became popular with the masses because of its simplified principles and wide range of social applications that were in harmony with the liberal victorian world view 15 george combes book on the constitution of man and its relationship to external objects sold over 200 000 copies through nine editions 19 combe also devoted a large portion of his book to reconciling religion and phrenology which had long been a sticking point another reason for its popularity was that phrenology balanced between free will and determinism 20 a persons inherent faculties were clear and no faculty was viewed as evil though the abuse of a faculty was phrenology allowed for selfimprovement and upward mobility while providing fodder for attacks on aristocratic privilege 20 21 phrenology also had wide appeal because of its being a reformist philosophy not a radical one 22 phrenology was not limited to the common people and both queen victoria and prince albert invited george combe to read the heads of their children 23phrenology came about at a time when scientific procedures and standards for acceptable evidence were still being codified 24 in the context of victorian society phrenology was a respectable scientific theory the phrenological society of edinburgh founded by george and andrew combe was an example of the credibility of phrenology at the time and included a number of extremely influential social reformers and intellectuals including the publisher robert chambers the astronomer john pringle nichol the evolutionary environmentalist hewett cottrell watson and asylum reformer william a f browne in 1826 out of the 120 members of the edinburgh society an estimated one third were from a medical background 25 by the 1840s there were more than 28 phrenological societies in london with over 1000 members 19 another important scholar was luigi ferrarese the leading italian phrenologist 26 he advocated that governments should embrace phrenology as a scientific means of conquering many social ills and his memorie risguardanti la dottrina frenologica 1836 is considered one of the fundamental 19th century works in the field 26traditionally the mind had been studied through introspection phrenology provided an attractive biological alternative that attempted to unite all mental phenomena using consistent biological terminology 27 galls approach prepared the way for studying the mind that would lead to the downfall of his own theories 28 phrenology contributed to development of physical anthropology forensic medicine knowledge of the nervous system and brain anatomy as well as contributing to applied psychology 29john elliotson was a brilliant but erratic heart specialist who became a phrenologist in the 1840s he was also a mesmerist and combined the two into something he called phrenomesmerism or phrenomagnatism 25 changing behaviour through mesmerism eventually won out in elliotsons hospital putting phrenology in a subordinate role 24 others amalgamated phrenology and mesmerism as well such as the practical phrenologists collyer and joseph r buchanan the benefits of combining mesmerism and phrenology was that the trance the patient was placed in was supposed to allow for the manipulation of hisher penchants and qualities 25 for example if the organ of selfesteem was touched the subject would take on a haughty expression 30phrenology has been psychologys great faux pas— j c flugel 1933 31phrenology was mostly discredited as a scientific theory by the 1840s this was due only in part to a growing amount of evidence against phrenology 25 phrenologists had never been able to agree on the most basic mental organ numbers going from 27 to over 40 32 33 and had difficulty locating the mental organs phrenologists relied on cranioscopic readings of the skull to find organ locations 34 jean pierre flourens  experiments on the brains of pigeons indicated that the loss of parts of the brain either caused no loss of function or the loss of a completely different function than what had been attributed to it by phrenology flourens experiment while not perfect seemed to indicate that galls supposed organs were imaginary 28 35 scientists had also become disillusioned with phrenology since its exploitation with the middle and working classes by entrepreneurs the popularization had resulted in the simplification of phrenology and mixing in it of principles of physiognomy which had from the start been rejected by gall as an indicator of personality 36 phrenology from its inception was tainted by accusations of promoting materialism and atheism and being destructive of morality these were all factors which led to the downfall of phrenology 34 37 recent studies using modern day technology like magnetic resonance imaging have further disproven phrenology claims 38during the early 20th century a revival of interest in phrenology occurred partly because of studies of evolution criminology and anthropology as pursued by cesare lombroso  the most famous british phrenologist of the 20th century was the london psychiatrist bernard hollander 1864–1934 his main works the mental function of the brain 1901 and scientific phrenology 1902 are an appraisal of galls teachings hollander introduced a quantitative approach to the phrenological diagnosis defining a method for measuring the skull and comparing the measurements with statistical averages 39in belgium paul bouts 1900–1999 began studying phrenology from a pedagogical background using the phrenological analysis to define an individual pedagogy combining phrenology with typology and graphology he coined a global approach known as psychognomy bouts a roman catholic priest became the main promoter of renewed 20thcentury interest in phrenology and psychognomy in belgium he was also active in brazil and canada where he founded institutes for characterology his works psychognomie and les grandioses destinées individuelle et humaine dans la lumière de la caractérologie et de levolution cérébrocranienne are considered standard works in the field in the latter work which examines the subject of paleoanthropology bouts developed a teleological and orthogenetical view on a perfecting evolution from the paleoencephalical skull shapes of prehistoric man which he considered still prevalent in criminals and savages towards a higher form of mankind thus perpetuating phrenologys problematic racializing of the human frame bouts died on march 7 1999 his work has been continued by the dutch foundation ppp  per pulchritudinem in pulchritudine  operated by anette müller one of bouts students during the 1930s belgian colonial authorities in rwanda used phrenology to explain the socalled superiority of tutsis over hutus 40application  edit1848 edition of american phrenological journal published by fowlers  wells new york city europeans looking for a scientific basis for their racism found phrenology attractive as justification for european superiority over other lesser races by comparing skulls of different ethnic groups it supposedly allowed for ranking of races from least to most evolved broussais a disciple of gall proclaimed that the caucasians were the most beautiful while peoples like the australian aboriginal and maori would never become civilized since they had no cerebral organ for producing great artists 41 surprisingly few phrenologists argued against the emancipation of the slaves instead they argued that through education and interbreeding the lesser peoples could improve 42 another argument was that the natural inequality of people could be used to situate them in the most appropriate place in society gender stereotyping was also common with phrenology women whose heads were generally larger in the back with lower foreheads were thought to have underdeveloped organs necessary for success in the arts and sciences while having larger mental organs relating to the care of children and religion 43 while phrenologists did not contend the existence of talented women this minority did not provide justification for citizenship or participation in politics 44one of the considered practical applications of phrenology was education due to the nature of phrenology people were naturally considered unequal with very few people would have a naturally perfect balance between organs thus education would play an important role in creating a balance through rigorous exercise of beneficial organs while repressing baser ones one of the best examples of this is félix voisin who for approximately ten years ran a reform school in issy for the express purpose of correction of the mind of children who had suffered some hardship voisin focused on four categories of children for his reform school 45slow learners spoiled neglected or harshly treated children willful disorderly children children at high risk of inheriting mental disorders phrenology was one of the first to bring about the idea of rehabilitation of criminals instead of vindictive punishments that would not stop criminals only with the reorganizing a disorganized brain would bring about change 46 voisin believed along with others the accuracy of phrenology in diagnosing criminal tendencies diagnosis could point to the type of offender the insane an idiot or brute and by knowing this an appropriate course of action could be taken 45 a strict system of reward and punishment hard work and religious instruction was thought to be able to correct those who had been abandoned and neglected with little education and moral ground works those who were considered mentally challenged could be put to work and housed collectively while only criminals of intellect and vicious intent needed to be confined and isolated 47 phrenology also advocated variable prison sentences the idea being that those who were only defective in education and lacking in morals would soon be released while those who were mentally deficient could be watched and the truly abhorrent criminals would never be released 22 48 49 for other patients phrenology could help redirect impulses one homicidal individual became a butcher to control his impulses while another became a military chaplain so he could witness killings 50 phrenology also provided reformist arguments for the lunatic asylums of the victorian era john conolly a physician interested in psychological aspects of disease used phrenology on his patients in an attempt to use it as a diagnostic tool while the success of this approach is debatable conolly through phrenology introduced a more humane way of dealing with the mentally ill 24the american brothers lorenzo niles fowler 1811–1896 and orson squire fowler 1809–1887 were leading phrenologists of their time orson together with associates samuel robert wells and nelson sizer ran the phrenological business and publishing house fowlers  wells in new york city meanwhile lorenzo spent much of his life in england where he initiated the famous phrenological publishing house l n fowler  co and gained considerable fame with his phrenology head a china head showing the phrenological faculties which has become a symbol of the discipline 51 orson fowler was known for his octagonal house in psychiatry phrenology was proposed as a viable model in order to reform the disciplinary field the south italian psychiatrist biagio miraglia proposed a new classification of mental illness based on brain functions as they were described by gall in biagio gioacchino miraglias view madness is consequent to dysfunctions of the cerebral organs “the organs of the brain that may become ill in isolation or in complex get their activities infected through energy or depression or inertia or deficiency so the madness can take the appearance of these three characteristic forms ie for enhanced activity or for depressed activity or for inertia or deficiency of brain activities” 52in the victorian era phrenology as a psychology was taken seriously and permeated the literature and novels of the day many prominent public figures such as the reverend henry ward beecher a college classmate and initial partner of orson fowler promoted phrenology actively as a source of psychological insight and selfknowledge 53 thousands of people consulted phrenologists for advice in various matters such as hiring personnel or finding suitable marriage partners 54 as such phrenology as a brain science waned but developed into the popular psychology of the 19th century reception  editbritain  editphrenology was introduced at a time when the old theological and philosophical understanding of the mind was being questioned and no longer seemed adequate in a society that was experiencing rapid social and demographic changes 55 phrenology became one of the most popular movements of the victorian era in part phrenologys success was due to george combe tailoring phrenology for the middle class combes book on the constitution of man and its relationship to external objects was one of the most popular of the time selling over two hundred thousand copies in a tenyear period phrenologys success was also due in part because it was introduced at a time when scientific lectures were becoming a form of middleclass entertainment exposing a large demographic of people to phrenological ideas who would not have heard them otherwise 56 as a result of the changing of the times along with new avenues for exposure and its multifaceted appeal phrenology flourished in popular culture 57 although it was discredited as scientific theory by 1840 france  editwhile still not a fringe movement there was not popular widespread support of phrenology in france this was not only due to strong opposition of phrenology by french scholars but also once again accusations of promoting atheism materialism and radical religious views politics in france also played a role in preventing rapid spread of phrenology 58 in britain phrenology had provided another tool to be used for situating demographic changes the difference was there was less fear of revolutionary upheaval in britain compared with france given that most french supporters of phrenology were liberal leftwing or socialist it was an objective of the social elite of france who held a restrained vision of social change that phrenology remain on the fringes another objection was that phrenology seemed to provide a built in excuse for criminal behaviour since in its original form it was essentially deterministic in nature 58ireland  editphrenology arrived in ireland in 1815 through spurzheim 59 while ireland largely mirrored british trends with scientific lectures and demonstrations becoming a popular pastime of the age by 1815 phrenology had already been ridiculed in some circles priming the audiences to its skeptical claims 60 because of this the general public valued it more for its comic relief than anything else however it did find an audience in the rational dissenters who found it an attractive alternative to explain human motivations without the attached superstitions of religion 61 the supporters of phrenology in ireland were relegated to scientific subcultures because the irish scholars neglected marginal movements like phrenology denying it scientific support in ireland 17 in 1830 george combe came to ireland his selfpromotion barely winning out against his lack of medical expertise still only drew lukewarm crowds this was due to not only the vaticans decree that phrenology was subversive of religion and morality but also that based on phrenology the irish catholics were sui generis a flawed and degenerate breed 62 because of the lack of scientific support along with religious and prejudicial reasons phrenology never found a wide audience in ireland united states  editamerican institute of phrenology new york 1893through the teachings of gall and spurzheim phrenological teachings spread and by 1834 when combe came to lecture in the united states phrenology had become a widespread popular movement 63 sensing commercial possibilities men like the fowlers became phrenologists and sought additional ways to bring phrenology to the masses 64 though a popular movement the intellectual elite of the united states found phrenology attractive because it provided a biological explanation of mental processes based on observation yet it was not accepted uncritically some intellectuals accepted organology while questioning cranioscopy 65 gradually the popular success of phrenology undermined its scientific merits in the united states and elsewhere along with its materialistic underpinnings fostering radical religious views there was increasing evidence to refute phrenological claims and by the 1840s it had largely lost its credibility 54 in the united states especially in the south phrenology faced an additional obstacle in the antislavery movement while phrenologists usually claimed the superiority of the european race they were often sympathetic to liberal causes including the antislavery movement this sowed skepticism about phrenology among those who were proslavery 66 the rise and surge in popularity in mesmerism phrenomesmerism also had a hand in the loss of interest in phrenology
