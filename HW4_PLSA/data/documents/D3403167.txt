how to ›windows usb type beverything you need to know about the usb type b connector share pin email print usb 30 type b connector picture by anil öztasby tim fisher updated march 27 2018usb type b connectors officially referred to as standardb connectors are square in shape with either a slight rounding or large square protrusion on the top depending on the usb version usb typeb connectors are supported in every usb version including usb 30 usb 20 and usb 11 a second type of b connector called poweredb also exists but only in usb 30 usb 30 type b connectors are often the color blue while usb 20 type b and usb 11 type b connectors are often black this is not always the case because usb type b connectors and cables can come in any color the manufacturer chooses note a male usb type b connector is called a plug while a female connector is called either a receptacle as used in this article or port usb type b uses usb type b receptacles are most commonly seen on larger computer devices like printers and scanners youll also sometimes find usb type b ports on external storage devices like optical drives floppy drives and hard drive enclosures usb type b plugs are typically found at one end of a usb ab cable the usb type b plug fits into the usb type b receptacle on the printer or another device while the usb type a plug fits into the usb type a receptacle located on the host device like a computer usb type b compatibility the usb type b connectors in usb 20 and usb 11 are identical meaning that the usb type b plug from one usb version will fit into the usb type b receptacle from both its own and the other usb version usb 30 type b connectors are a different shape than previous ones and so the plugs do not fit in previous receptacles however the new usb 30 type b form factor was designed in such a way to allow previous usb type b plugs from usb 20 and usb 11 to fit with usb 30 type b receptacles in other words usb 11 and 20 type b plugs are physically compatible with usb 30 type b receptacles but usb 30 type b plugs are not compatible with usb 11 or usb 20 type b receptacles the reason for the change is that usb 30 type b connectors have nine pins several more than the four pins found in previous usb type b connectors to allow for the faster usb 30 data transfer rate those pins had to go somewhere so the type b shape had to be altered somewhat note there are actually two usb 30 type b connectors usb 30 standardb and usb 30 poweredb the plugs and receptacles are identical in shape and follow the physical compatibility rules already outlined but usb 30 poweredb connectors have two additional pins to provide power for a total of eleven pins if youre still confused which is completely understandable then see our usb physical compatibility chart for a graphical representation of physical compatibility which should help important the mere fact that a type b connector from one usb version fits in the type b connector from another usb version doesnt imply anything about speed or functionality was this page helpful
