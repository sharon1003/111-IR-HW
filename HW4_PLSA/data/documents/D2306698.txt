rating newest oldest best answer the marketing planning process in most organizations strategic planning is an annual process typically covering just the year ahead occasionally a few organizations may look at a practical plan which stretches three or more years ahead to be most effective the plan has to be formalized usually in written form as a formal marketing plan the essence of the process is that it moves from the general to the specific from the overall objectives of the organization down to the individual action plan for a part of one marketing programme it is also an interactive process so that the draft output of each stage is checked to see what impact it has on the earlier stages  and is amended accordingly marketing planning aims and objectives behind the corporate objectives which in themselves offer the main context for the marketing plan will lay the corporate mission which in turn provides the context for these corporate objectives this corporate mission can be thought of as a definition of what the organization is of what it does our business is … this definition should not be too narrow or it will constrict the development of the organization a too rigorous concentration on the view that we are in the business of making meatscales as ibm was during the early 1900s might have limited its subsequent development into other areas on the other hand it should not be too wide or it will become meaningless we want to make a profit is not too helpful in developing specific plans abell suggested that the definition should cover three dimensions customer groups to be served customer needs to be served and technologies to be utilized abell defining the business the starting point of strategic planning thus the definition of ibms corporate mission in the 1940s might well have been we are in the business of handling accounting information customer need for the larger us organizations customer group by means of punched cards technology fortunately as the name itself international perhaps the most important factor in successful marketing is the corporate vision surprisingly it is largely neglected by marketing textbooks although not by the popular exponents of corporate strategy  indeed it was perhaps the main theme of the book by peters and waterman in the form of their superordinate goals in search of excellence said nothing drives progress like the imagination the idea precedes the deed the marketing imagination if the organization in general and its chief executive in particular has a strong vision of where its future lies then there is a good chance that the organization will achieve a strong position in its markets and attain that future this will be not least because its strategies will be consistent and will be supported by its staff at all levels in this context all of ibms marketing activities were underpinned by its philosophy of customer service a vision originally promoted by the charismatic watson dynasty the emphasis at this stage is on obtaining a complete and accurate picture in a single organization however it is likely that only a few aspects will be sufficiently important to have any significant impact on the marketing plan but all may need to be reviewed to determine just which are the few in this context some factors related to the customer which should be included in the material collected for the audit may be who are the customers what are their key characteristics what differentiates them from other members of the population what are their needs and wants what do they expect the product to do what are their special requirements and perceptions what do they think of the organization and its products or services what are their attitudes what are their buying intentions a traditional  albeit productbased  format for a brand reference book or indeed a marketing facts book was suggested by godley more than three decades ago financial data facts for this section will come from management accounting costing and finance sections product data from production research and development sales and distribution data  sales packaging distribution sections advertising sales promotion merchandising data  information from these departments market data and miscellany  from market research who would in most cases act as a source for this information his sources of data however assume the resources of a very large organization in most organizations they would be obtained from a much smaller set of people and not a few of them would be generated by the marketing manager alone it is apparent that a marketing audit can be a complex process but the aim is simple it is only to identify those existing external and internal factors which will have a significant impact on the future plans of the company it is clear that the basic material to be input to the marketing audit should be comprehensive accordingly the best approach is to accumulate this material continuously as and when it becomes available since this avoids the otherwise heavy workload involved in collecting it as part of the regular typically annual planning process itself  when time is usually at a premium even so the first task of this annual process should be to check that the material held in the current facts book or facts files actually is comprehensive and accurate and can form a sound basis for the marketing audit itself the structure of the facts book will be designed to match the specific needs of the organization but one simple format  suggested by malcolm mc donald  may be applicable in many cases this splits the material into three groups review of the marketing environment a study of the organizations markets customers competitors and the overall economic political cultural and technical environment covering developing trends as well as the current situation review of the detailed marketing activity a study of the companys marketing mix in terms of the 7 ps  see below review of the marketing system a study of the marketing organization marketing research systems and the current marketing objectives and strategies the last of these is too frequently ignored the marketing system itself needs to be regularly questioned because the validity of the whole marketing plan is reliant upon the accuracy of the input from this system and garbage in garbage out applies with a vengeance portfolio planning in addition the coordinated planning of the individual products and services can contribute towards the balanced portfolio 8020 rule to achieve the maximum impact the marketing plan must be clear concise and simple it needs to concentrate on the 20 per cent of products or services and on the 20 per cent of customers which will account for 80 per cent of the volume and 80 per cent of the profit 7 ps product place price and promotion physical environment people process the 7 ps can sometimes divert attention from the customer but the framework they offer can be very useful in building the action plans it is only at this stage of deciding the marketing objectives that the active part of the marketing planning process begins this next stage in marketing planning is indeed the key to the whole marketing process the marketing objectives state just where the company intends to be at some specific time in the future james quinn succinctly defined objectives in general as goals or objectives state what is to be achieved and when results are to be accomplished but they do not state how the results are to be achieved 1 they typically relate to what products or services will be where in what markets and must be realistically based on customer behaviour in those markets they are essentially about the match between those products and markets objectives for pricing distribution advertising and so on are at a lower level and should not be confused with marketing objectives they are part of the marketing strategy needed to achieve marketing objectives to be most effective objectives should be capable of measurement and therefore quantifiable this measurement may be in terms of sales volume money value market share percentage penetration of distribution outlets and so on an example of such a measurable marketing objective might be to enter the market with product y and capture 10 per cent of the market by value within one year as it is quantified it can within limits be unequivocally monitored and corrective action taken as necessary the marketing objectives must usually be based above all on the organizations financial objectives converting these financial measurements into the related marketing measurements he went on to explain his view of the role of policies with which strategy is most often confused policies are rules or guidelines that express the limits within which action should occur simplifying somewhat marketing strategies can be seen as the means or game plan by which marketing objectives will be achieved and in the framework that we have chosen to use are generally concerned with the 7 ps examples are price the amount of money needed to buy products product the

certainly provided an exhaustive and detailed explanation of how the strategic planning process works and such planning is definitely vital to coming up with a successful marketing plan but to be more succinct a marketing plan is basically a year long plan of action broken down by weeksmonthssales periods with specific tactics and budgets assigned throughout the calendar period you might also want to identify which marketing programs are overlapping this will help you to determine more appropriate launch dates for each project so that you dont have either major lapses between campaigns or too many projects going on at one time i think you will also find it helpful if when building your marketing plan you outline projected costs and actual costs this way as you plan for next year or need to revise your plan you will be able to see how much you are actually spending on each project you may find that you are allocating too little resources for one type of project and too many for another
