of 1970 gave the environmental protection agency epa the authority to establish and enforce air pollutionstandards and to set emission standards for new factories and extremely hazardous industrialpollutants the states were required to meet ambient air quality standards by regulating theemissions of various pollutants from existing stationary sources such as power plants andincinerators in part by the installation of smokestack scrubbers electrostatic precipitators andother filters auto manufacturers were mandated to install exhaust controls or develop less pollutingengines the clean air act as amended in 1977 authorized the epa to impose stricter pollutionstandards and higher penalties for failure to comply with air quality standards in 1990 when the act was reauthorized it required most cities to meet existing smog reductionregulations by the year 2005 the 1990 amendments also expanded the scope and strength of theregulations for controlling industrial pollution the result has been limited progress in reducing thequantities of sulfur dioxide carbon monoxide nitrogen oxide ozone particulate matter and lead in the air the epa also regulated hazardous air pollutants which in 1992 included mercury berylliumasbestos vinylchloride benzene radioactive substances and inorganic arsenic the most satisfactory longterm solutions to air pollution

industrialized nations although the united states abandoned thetreaty in 2001 saying it was counter to u s interests most other nations agreed that year on thedetails necessary to make the protocol a binding international treaty and the necessary ratificationsbrought the treaty into force in 2005 efforts to develop a new more encompassing binding treatythat would build on the kyoto protocol were long unsuccessful and in 2012 canada became thefirst ratifying nation to withdraw later in 2012 the kyoto protocol was extended to 2020 in 2015however the worlds nations agreed for the first time to take measures to hold global warming below36°f 2°c and all parties not just developed nations agreed to reduce emissions a revision of emissions targets beginning in 2020 and a review of actual
