arnav studied at sikkim manipal institute of technology answered dec 31 2017the answer depends on the type of intercontinental ballistic missile icbm but most of these rockets launch from a device on the ground travel into outer space and finally reenter earths atmosphere plummeting rapidly until they hit their target the titan ii intercontinental ballistic missile an icbm as its name implies can travel from one continent to another once launched icbms travel in a parabola much like a baseball flying through the air just like a baseball an icbm can be released at any angle but in north koreas case the icbms are being launched almost straight up”they fly straight up against the force of gravity and come down some distance from north korea … if theyre longrange the north koreans usually drop them on the other side of japan which of course makes japan very nervous at takeoff the icbm enters the boost phase during this phase the rockets send the icbm into the air pushing it upward for about 2 to 5 minutes until it reaches space icbms can have up to three rocket stages each one is discarded or ejected after it burns out in other words after the first stage stops burning rocket no 2 takes over and so on moreover these rockets can have liquid or solid propellant liquid propellants generally burn longer in the boost phase than solidpropellant rockets  in contrast solid propellants provide their energy in a shorter amount of time and burn faster liquid and solid propellants can send rockets equally far but most countries start out with liquid propellant technology because its well understood they graduate they move to solid propellant to get the faster burn times it also avoids the hazards of dealing with dangerous liquids that are both flammable and toxic in the second phase the icbm enters space as it continues on its ballistic trajectory its flying through space very fast maybe 15000 mph or 17000 mph 24140 or 27360 kmh since theres no air resistance out there some icbms have technology that allows them to take a star shot — that is they can use the location of the stars to help them better orient toward their target in the third phase the icbm reenters the atmosphere and hits its target within minutes if the icbm has rocket thrusters it might use them to better orient itself toward its target however because of the intense heat encountered when they reenter the atmosphere icbms can burn up and fall apart unless they have proper heat shields for the hwasong15 the entire trajectory took 54 minutes significantly longer than north koreas 37minute test on july 4 and its 47minute test on july 28 however although some countries have icbms — including the united states russia china and india — none have fired them in a deliberate attack against another country we all have tested them to show we can do it which is exactly what north korea is doing now but weve never actually used them in war and the reason is it would be allout nuclear war

missiles work when you think missiles you may be thinking about something like an icbm sending nukes over oceans can’t help you with that missiles are anything that is launched like an arrow in military usage we talk about things like tow javelin missiles blowpipe or stingers my sources are i’ve fired blowpipe like a stinger simulator and done sim training with a live tow missile launcher i’ve also been reading janes for the last 30 years janes is the premier catalogue of everything from ships to small arms the firer and his assistant puts the missile in the launcher unit usually it’s slide it in plug it in you define what the target is sometimes it’s as simple as putting the crosshairs of very high powered binoculars on what you want to hit and just keep it there as it zigs and zags sometimes you put the seeker on the target like a heat seeker usually you have to tell the system you agree with the launcher unit that it’s the right target not with tow then you fire it some missiles like javelin have a 2 stage rocket the 1st is like a rocket launcher it pushes the missile far enough that you aren’t going to get burnt by the rocket as it leaves some is just the rocket using it’s fuel this is a clip of what happens when only the 1st stage fires the missile uses it’s fuel mostly not gunpowder to get to the target it makes tiny corrections in flight from it’s guidance system which is usually held in the front there are a huge number of possible guidance systems this is the fun part sometimes missiles aren’t supposed to hit the target some like anti aircraft missiles explode before reaching the target sending thousands of tiny bits like a flying claymore mine some 2 stage anti tank missiles send off a starter bomb to set off the tanks defensive systems like blazer reactive armor then after the reactive ‘armor’ has exploded then hits the tank with it’s main charge bill will fly above the tank and fire it’s charge into the weak top armor javelin will actually change course fly above it come down on top to add it’s terminal velocity to the top attack‘now the firer reloads the launcher for the next shot some systems you have to walk the missile onto the target some are ‘fire and forget’ so you can be reloading while the missile is engaging the target257 views · view upvoters rishi vashista engineering student  constantly reading about military technology and wepons answered dec 12 2016a ballistic missile is a a missile that has a ballistic trajectory over most of its flight path  this is something like you are throwing stone over a long range  where you power or propelled the stone for short interval of time until it is in your handfist and then it moves by its own with the help of gravity by following a ballistic flight path  unlike other missiles  ballistic missiles are powered only for short period of time after lunch and then with the help of gravity and guidance they hit there target  most of the long range ballistic missiles leaves the earth atmosphere after booster phase and then move without any air resistance to cover more distance at greater speeds and then again re enter the earth atmosphere and destroy the target  ballistic missile trajectory consists of three parts the powered flight portion the freeflight portion which constitutes most of the flight time the reentry phase where the missile reenters the earths atmosphere these missiles can carry various types of warheads from nuclear to conventional and also multiple warheads  it is said that ballistic missiles are the most deadliest weapon ever made  which has the capacity to destroy whole planet  some of the ballistic missiles are agni  k  prithvi ballistic missiles indiass and rs missiles russiaminuteman iii  ugm133 trident ii usaand many more …………………

ballistic missile is a missile that follows predefined trajectory path for delivering warhead bomb to a target an intercontinental ballistic missile trajectory consists of three parts the powered flight portionthe freeflight portion which constitutes most of the flight timethe reentry phase where the missile reenters earth atmosphere the flight phases for shorterrange ballistic missiles are essentially the first two phases of the icbm as some ballistic categories do not leave the atmosphere ballistic missiles can be launched from fixed sites or mobile launchers including vehicles eg ground launchers aircraft ships and submarines the powered flight portion can last from a few tenths of seconds to several minutes and can consist of multiple rocket stage when in space and no more thrust is provided the missile enters freeflight in order to cover large distances ballistic missiles are usually launched into a high sub orbital spaceflight for intercontinental missiles the highest altitude apogee reached during freeflight is about 1200 kilometers 750 mi the reentry stage begins at an altitude where atmospheric drag plays a significant part in missile trajectory and lasts until

missiles as they have the most stages the missile is held in place until it has “first prime” this is where the missile is released and sits in its tube it is then given a blast of air from behind to launch it forward and it drops for a small period of time after the missile has reached safe distance it has its “second prime” where the engine ignites fully and it propels itself to the target some re position constantly using thermal or a set target upon nearing the target the missile will depending on it’s model either detonate above the target usually carrying phosphorus in these models or detonate on contact223 views · view upvoters · answer requested by carlos caicedo
