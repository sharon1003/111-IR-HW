beethovens influence on other composers mahler brahms schoenberg changing the symphony forever and redefining string quartets classic fm explores the composers influence on succeeding generations had ludwig van beethoven never existed could he have been invented any hollywood film director with an eye for a good story could have sketched out the finer details young genius composer who studies with haydn realises he is a genius as eureka moments hit him with exhilarating regularity but then – in a twist of fate worthy of a jeffrey archer blockbuster – our hero enjoying his hardearned success goes deaf in the end he descends into a frustrated depressive struggle – as tortured geniuses tend to – his deafness alienating him from the world and from the pleasure of sound as at the same time his music achieves unheralded plateaus of intricacy and perfection in that his life occupied a nearshakespearean arc of triumph and tragedy reimagining beethoven is easy everybody perhaps invents his or her own beethoven indeed mythology surrounding him has become so engrained within the collective consciousness there’s a danger the music becomes perceived only as the soundtrack to an imagined life but nobody else could have created beethoven’s music which is why the music will always be more important than beethoven the myth music is real myths aren’t and all life anyway exists in beethoven’s music from the orgiastic joy that flows through the finale of the symphony no 7 to the unsettling intensity of those late string quartets here was a composer who increasingly found his art lay at the dangerous fringes of what we normally define as art – exploding the language of music in an attempt to mirror the complexities of his mind and imagination throughout the remainder of the 19th century and into the 20th century the idea of progressive composers asserting their individual voices became the yardstick by which history judged them as brahms writes symphonies in the years after beethoven’s death we’re interested in the inventiveness of his melodic material yes but also the extent to which he imposes himself on symphonic form remoulding our existing understanding of symphonies asking the question “what is a symphony”mahler who came to artistic maturity shortly after brahms’s death pressed that question even harder arnold schoenberg posed the same question so pointedly that musical syntax as it had been understood for centuries snapped it was beethoven who created the idea of composers not just adding to tradition but recasting it in their own image beethoven unlike mozart was spared the indignity of dying in poverty his last symphony the ninth consolidated an already robust reputation and he was never short of commissions a lesser composer might have taken advantage and flown on automatic pilot but beethoven never lost sight of his muse the history of 20thcentury music from schoenberg to stravinsky and stockhausen is often written like a soap opera of scandals and spats between composers eager to explore and performers keen to show off – a tradition that can be traced to beethoven’s door a performer today struggling with stockhausen or boulez may be wise to recall beethoven’s words to the schuppanzigh quartet after it refused to play the last movement of his string quartet no13 “what care i about you and your bloody fiddles”
