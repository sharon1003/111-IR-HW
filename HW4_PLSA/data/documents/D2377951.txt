review new york marchapril 1996   i was always having bright ideas and suffering for them lillian gish wrote in her memoirs describing her incredible performance on the ice floes in way down east 1920 perhaps the actress who logged more hours of suffering onscreen than any other gish brought both dignity and complexity to the genre of silent melodrama from the very beginning of her 85year career gish dedicated her all to the art of acting and as is littleknown about her to writing editing and even directing her one directing effort remodeling her husband 1920 is unfortunately lost the great director d w griffith treated gish as something close to a collaborator in many of their works together she responded with a loyalty that bordered on devotion who else but gish would write memoirs that are primarily about griffith rather than herself early in her career gish demonstrated the restraint and subtlety that adds such depth to her performances even before her famous role in birth of a nation 1915 gish had developed many of her characteristic poses in the musketeers of pig alley 1912 she cradles her cheek with her hand a gesture that she later adapts by moving her pinky finger over to her mouth and chewing on her fingernail other early poses include the indignant thrust of an elbow as her fist goes to her hip a head thrown down onto her arms in despair and the prim pressing of her hands and pursing of her lips as she rebuffs an overzealous lover gish under griffiths encouragement often improvised these details that came to define her ingenuous style in broken blossoms 1919 she created the famous gesture of lifting the corners of her mouth with two fingers when her abusive father berates her for not smiling enough she also suggested trailing her hair and her hand in the freezing water as she lay collapsed on the ice in way down east gish studied literature and philosophy fencing and dancing to prepare her mind and her body for acting she practiced with the denishawn company of los angeles which produced martha graham among other famous modern dancers similar to bogarts expressive face however gishs eyes and mouth were her primary instruments of communication upon hearing that her lover has been killed in the white sister 1923 she delivers the gaze that is found in so many of her films wideeyed vulnerable distant and tragic the intertitle describes her as being in a trancelike state of dryeyed despair some of gishs most powerful moments on film occur when her stoic suffering gives way to an expressive panic in the climatic scene of broken blossoms she flings her body around a tiny room and expresses on her face all of the fear and terror of someone who is about to be beaten brutally in a similar scene from the wind 1928 gish is shown clawing at a window pane eyes wide in horror as she watches the wind uncover the dead body of her rapist too often gishs acting abilities have been undervalued because they are associated with the stereotype of the simplistic moral universe of melodramas rarely does gish express any singular emotion happiness is tinged with wistfulness envy with irony grief with hope if there is any continuity in her roles it would have to be that her characters are always thoughtful gish allows the viewer to watch as her characters progress from one emotion to another so one can follow as her true heart susie first feels disbelief then horror then irony touched by hysterical laughter and finally a weary acceptance when she discovers her lover plans to wed another or again in way down east when anna baptizes her dying child the grief desperation and loneliness of her character are all discreetly visible in her facial expression and bodily action gishs characters are never entirely predictable unlike the tableau poses of earlier melodramatic acting gishs emotional moments flow together realistically and logically while still retaining an element of surprise while gishs reputation has been established primarily on the basis of her extensive silent film career she found equal fame on the stage and in sound film and television after studying voice lessons her speaking characters appear as natural and as unpretentious as her silent performances she eased quite gracefully into older roles such as the toughasnails shotguntoting mother of orphans in the night of the hunter 1955 or the selfsacrificing sister to a bitter bette davis in the whales of august 1987 these final film performances demonstrate gishs talent for refining and adapting her craft even as film technology and trends in film acting styles changed radically during her prodigious career—elizabeth coffman
