ethical issues related with babies born at risk ethical issues associated with organ transplantation ethical issues associated with human experiments ethical issues associated with eugenics glossary3 anencephalic babies samplethe literal meaning of anencephaly is no brain but the term is not exactly accurate for an  negative enkephalos  brain describing the condition of anencephalic babies such babies have no cerebrum or cerebellum but they do have a brain stem the brain stem allows them to breathe and allows their hearts to beat but the babies cannot see hear or feel anything they will never be able to think or achieve what is called personhood anencephalic babies are thus not technically brain dead yet there is general consensus that heroic measures should not be used to keep them alive in fact anencephaly may be one of the few medical conditions that all doctors agree is futile to treat about 1000 anencephalic babies are born in the united states each year the condition can be diagnosed prenatally and most women about 95 who learn that they will have an anencephalic child choose to have an abortion of the 5 of the anencephalic infants who are born about 55 are stillborn the restthe remaining 1000are said to be born dying sometimes the parents of an anencephalic infant want to donate the infants organs to other babies who need healthy organs they say that by donating the newborns organs they feel that the pregnancy would at least have had some value their own loss can be another familys gain in the united states about 2000 babies each year need organs and the only suitable organs for tiny babies are those from other tiny babies organs cannot however be removed from individuals who are alive and anencephalic babies though born dying are not dead thus the debates have raged about whether it is appropriate to make an exception exclusively with anencephalic infants changing the definition of dead in their case so that needed organs can be removed in time to be of use in 1992 for example the parents of an anencephalic baby named baby theresa wanted to donate her organs but the courtsall the way to the florida supreme courtwould not declare her dead she lived for ten days when she died her organs could no longer be transplanted on the day of her death baby theresas parents and a surgeon appeared on the phil donahue show to talk about the need to change the law so that organs from infants like baby theresa could be made available to others not all parents who have an anencephalic fetus choose abortion not all those whose babies are born alive want to donate the organs some do not even choose a strategy for caring for the infant that focuses strictly on keeping the baby comfortable while she dies one such parent was the mother of baby k she fought the hospital the doctors and even the babys father to whom she was never married to continue aggressive treatment for baby k despite the futility of the treatment the fight went all the way to the u s supreme court baby k was born on october 13 1992 at fairfax hospital in virginia her mother knew from the 16 th week of her pregnancy that her babys brain had not developed but she was adamant that baby k be kept alive motivated by a strong religious conviction that all life is precious and that god rather than herself or the doctors or the law should decide how long the baby would live baby k left the hospital when she was seven weeks old from there she went to a nursing home no neonatal intensive care unit nicuwould accept her every time baby k stopped breathing her mother would rush her back to fairfax hospital to be resuscitated and put on a respirator baby ks medical bills ran up to 500000 she lived longer than most anencephalic babies but she died of a heart attack when she was 25

of fetal development characteristics of anencephalic babies how prenatal tests such as measurement of alphafetoprotein amniocentesis ultrasound etc work and the benefits of and problems created by such tests problems associated with defining personhoodwhy anencephaly presents a special problem for organ transplantation legal arguments associated with the definition of personhood for anencephalic babies legal issues associated with the treatment of anencephalic babies and organ harvesting suggested questions for discussion what position do you think you would take if you had an anencephalic babythat of baby ks mother that of baby theresas parents or a different position do you think individuals have the right to demand and get expensive longterm care in futile cases such as the case of baby k do you think it is appropriate for insurance companies to cover the costs in such cases what does this do to the rates for others covered by the same company does a situation like baby ks make doctors instruments of technology is this an appropriate position for them to be in discussions of organ transplantation include words like organ donation harvesting organs and other euphemisms if an organ is a gift should the parents be allowed to give that gift on behalf of an infant do you think that the recipient of an organ has lasting obligations to the donor of that organ or the donors family if so what form should the obligations take do you think that the definition of brain dead should be changed in order to benefit the small number of babies who need new organs baby k lived for 25 years her medical bills totaled half a million dollars do you think this is an appropriate use of the money do you think baby ks mothers religious beliefs should trump issues of fair distribution of resources for example the money spent on baby ks care could have been used to provide prenatal care for thousands of poor women and possibly improve the health of their unborn babies is it possible andor appropriate to make medical decisions on the basis of dollars what would you say constitutes personhood nurses who took care of baby k felt that her dignity as a human being was violated they saw no point in prolonging her dying with technology her mother did not agree where do you stand in this debate topics for discussionwritten assessment consider the subject of respect for patient autonomy that is respect for individual freedom and choice how is this problematic when dealing with anencephalic newborns was baby ks dignity violated by the intervention of technology should the professional autonomy of the nurses who cared for baby k have been factored into the decisions that were made about baby ks care in the treatment of devastating medical conditions with new technologies what issues should be considered what similarities and differences exist in the use of respirators and other technologies for anencephalic babies the iron lung in the 1940s for those with polio and dialysis machines for those with kidney failure today what personal issues and choices come into play in organ donation and reception what factors might account for the stark differences between the positions taken by the parents of baby k and baby theresa what constitutional financial religious policy and contractual ie insurance factors need to be considered when dealing with the treatment of anencephalic children topics for teacher preparation the biology of brain development organ transplantation issues insurance coverage issues hospital legal issues trumping hierarchy in futile cases sensationalist media coverage and its effects religious issues and beliefs that affect medical treatments
