how to cut porcelain tile using a wet saw do you need a wet saw joe i need to know how to cut porcelain tile should i use a wet saw this is a question i am asked all the time a wet saw is probably the most expensive tool that you can buy at least one of the most expensive the only other alternative is a tile cutter these are also expensive and the price can add up quicki’m really not talking about a tile cutter that you can buy at a home improvement store i’m talking about a good high quality tile cutter although home depot has finally stepped up their game and got rid of most of their junk cutters they now have rubi tile cutters these are a really good brand of cutters that’s the brand i use the price tag they have on them well they are really good too i would say they have done a good thing for the diy’er looking to buy a tile cutter don’t buy a tile cutter at least not yet i love my tile cutter and it is what i use the most but if you ask me how to cut porcelain tile i’m going to say use a wet saw there are a few reasons for thisa wet saw is easier to learn how to use you can cut any tile with the same blade a wet saw can be rented ok a tile can be rented toono dustcleaner cuts less chipped and broken tiles while cutting if you are installing ceramic tile porcelain glass or stone you can use a wet saw without ever changing the blade a tile cutter has many different types of cutting wheels i have them all because you never know which one is going to work sometimes none of them workthat’s when i pull out my wet saw the cutting wheels can be expensive if you rent a tile cutter it probably has a cutting wheel that should have been thrown away last year so i should use a wet saw i believe that i need to point you in the right direction on how to cut porcelain tile or any tile i would say a wet saw is the best tool for you to use i do like my tile cutter because it’s faster i can use it anywhere and it’s just more convenient but we are talking about the most user friendly cutting tool so i choose a wet saw i do want to say though that not all wet saws are created equal i have used some junk wet saws and it would be hard for me to tell you if the wet saw you are renting is worth renting or not i just want to say that if you have a big project that you are working on you might want to consider buying a wet saw the money you spend on renting might be close to what you would pay for one here is a link to a saw i think would be a great saw wet saw click herei know it’s expensive i’m really not telling you to buy it if it doesn’t make sense if you have a custom shower to install chances are that it would be a minimum of 200000 just for installation let me be clear i do not make any money from this link i am sharing i have a dewalt tile saw that costed me over a 100000 i really wanted to be able to recommend a saw that was more reasonable in price so i went to home depot and bought the saw that you see in the link above i wanted to test it before i recommended it to you i have used it for over a year now and it’s really a good sawwhat if you did buy it you could sell it when you are done with it on craigslist or ebay i’m sure you could get your money back okay enough on that let me show you why i like this saw you can make multiple types of cuts with a wet saw when you are wondering how to cut porcelain tile or any tile what type of cuts are you thinking of straight cuts l cuts outlets diagonal cuts circles all of the above you can cut all of these types of cuts on a wet saw it has to be able to plunge cut though take a look at this video and i’ll show you what i mean your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available click here to visit our frequently asked questions about html5 video the wet saw

quick sorry to bother you with this again but would you rather use a 7″ 9amp saw from the link on your page or a 8″ 12amp saw that ridgid also offers for 200 more thanks again for all your help james reply james mc bee on august 28 2016 at 1101 pm hey joe i appreciate all your info i just want to make sure which saw your using the link showed model 4030 for 297 you mentioned you payed 500 are you using model 4040 do you think it’s worth 200 more for the 4040 i also apppreciate and agree with your faith in god statement thanks again james reply joe letendre on august 29 2016 at 534 am that is the saw it has just come down in price since i shot that video thank you for your commentsreply james bergman on january 29 2016 at 946 am i much prefer using a wet saw for cutting tile than any other method it is just so much easier and that is all that really needs to be said if you have a big project then rent a wet saw or get your own you won’t regret it however i am curious about the blade you said you don’t ever have to change it when cutting ceramic tile porcelain glass or stone so do most wet saws have diamond tipped blades reply joe letendre on january 29 2016 at 1111 am i agree totally on the saw yes i do use a diamond blade honestly i usually toss the blade that would come with the saw dewalt has a blade that cuts most everything that i use and i highly recommend it reply carl on january 19 2016 at 813 pm thanks joe for the great info im still not sure though what is best way to ‘rip’ a 24×12 tile can i do this with a basic table saw my concern is there is not a lot of table surface in front of the blade and it seems difficult to get a straight cut trying to feed that 24″ tile thru am i better off putting a diamond blade in my 712 circular sawalso … if you have to taper the 24″ tile for the last piece next to a wall… ie take a long triangular ‘sliver’ off the 24″ side not sure how to do that with a table saw reply joe letendre on january 20 2016 at 950 am you can rent a saw that will do all of those things the saw i am using in the video will cut a 24″ tile and the head plunges and it can be tilted to cut a beveled edge home depot probably rents a saw capable of that reply les smith on november 16 2015 at 124 pm joe great how to videos i’m about to start a tile job laundry room and was worried about using a tile cutter on the porcelain tile i have a lot of cross cuts i do have a wet saw cheap one but bought a good blade and will use for the long cuts tile is 6×24 particularly liked the grinder i’ll have to get a small one reply karen on may 10 2015 at 1015 am great help from you i like your explanations as it really ma keys it easy to understand for the diy’er replyjennieg on april 30 2015 at 1015 am your instructions were very helpful i watched your video on the angle grinder for the toilet flange not sure i’m ready for that do you have any advice for making a somewhat circle with the wet saw reply joe letendre on may 19 2015 at 538 am just take your time it would need to be a saw that can plunge cut reply david crewz on april 15 2015 at 1009 am just what i needed to see we have purchased porcelain tile after a disaster with marble that was free i have many curved cuts around the flange and the bathtub as well and an angle grinder is what i will purchase good info and well presented reply kelly k on november 12 2014 at 128 pm hi joethank you so much for these detailed instructions and reviews would you be able to provide the name of the wet saw that you recommend the link no longer works kelly reply joe letendre on december 1
