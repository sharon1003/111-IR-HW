kids health  for teens  figuring out fat and calories whats in this article listenen español cálculo de grasas y calorías from all you hear youd think fat and calories are really bad for you its true that many people are eating more fat and calories than they need but we all require a certain amount of fat and calories in our diets to fuel our growth and activities — everything from solving a math problem to racing up and down the soccer field so whats the truth on fat and calories what are fat and calories fats are nutrients in food that the body uses to build cell membranes nerve tissue like the brain and hormones the body also uses fat as fuel if fats that a person has eaten arent burned as energy or used as building blocks they are stored by the body in fat cells this is the bodys way of thinking ahead by saving fat for future use it plans for times when food might be scarce do you read food labels or look up nutrition information online most of the time sometimes rarely or not at all vote view results a calorie is a unit of energy that measures how much energy food provides to the body the body needs calories to function properly food labels calories food labels list calories by the amount in each serving size serving sizes differ from one food to the next so to figure out how many calories youre eating youll need to do three things look at the serving size see how many calories there are in one serving multiply the number of calories by the number of servings youre going to eat for example a bag of cookies may list three cookies as a serving size but if you eat six cookies you are really eating two servings not one to figure out how many calories those two servings contain you must double the calories in one serving food labels fat when it comes to fat labels can say many things low fat reduced fat light or lite and fatfree are common terms youre sure to see on food packages the u s government has strict rules about the use of these phrases by law fatfree foods can contain no more than 05 grams of fat per serving lowfat foods may contain 3 grams of fat or less per serving foods marked reduced fat and light lite are a little trickier and you may need to do some supermarket sleuthing light lite and reducedfat foods may still be high in fat the requirement for a food to be labeled light lite is that it must contain 50 less fat or one third fewer calories per serving than the regular version of that food foods labeled reduced fat must contain 25 less fat per serving than the regular version but if the regular version of a particular food was high in fat to begin with a 25 to 50 reduction may not lower the fat content enough to make it a smart snacking choice for example the original version of a brand of peanut butter contains 17 grams of fat and the reduced fat version contains 12 grams thats still a lot of fat4 4 and    9 the calories in food come from carbohydrates proteins and fats a gram of carbohydrate contains 4 calories a gram of protein also contains 4 calories a gram of fat though contains 9 calories — more than twice the amount of the other two thats why one food with the same serving size as another may have far more calories a highfat food has many more calories than a food thats low in fat and higher in protein or carbohydrates for instance 12 cup of vanilla ice cream contains178 total calories2 grams of protein 2 grams times 4 calories  8 calories from protein12 grams of fat 12 grams times 9 calories  108 calories or 61 from fat155 grams of carbohydrate 155 grams times 4 calories  62 calories from carbohydratecompare this with the same serving size 12 cup of cooked carrots36 total calories1 gram of protein 1 gram times 4 calories  4 calories from protein0 grams of fat 0 grams times 0 calories  0 calories from fat8 grams of carbohydrate 8 grams times 4 calories  32 calories from carbohydrateso fat makes quite a difference when it comes to total calories in a food but lets face it whos going to choose a heaping bowl of cooked carrots over ice cream on a hot summer day it all comes down to making sensible food choices most of the time the goal is to make tradeoffs that balance a higherfat food with foods that are lower in fat so if you really want that ice cream its ok once in a while — as long as you work in some lowerfat foods like carrots that day not all fats are the same although all types of fat have the same amount of calories some are more harmful to your health than others saturated fat and trans fat increase a persons risk of heart disease food labels show the amounts of saturated fats and trans fats in a particular food saturated and trans fats are solid at room temperature — like butter shortening or the fat on meat saturated fat comes mostly from animal products but some tropical oils like palm oil and coconut oil also contain saturated fat small amounts of trans fat are also found in whole dairy and meat products trans fats are often found in packaged baked goods like cookies or crackers they also may be found in fried foods like french fries and doughnuts because saturated fat and trans fat raise blood cholesterol levels increasing a persons chances of developing heart disease a gram of one of these fats is worse for a persons health than a gram of unsaturated fat one of the most common sources of trans fat in todays foods is partially hydrogenated vegetable oil hydrogenation is a process that changes liquid oils into a solid form of fat by adding hydrogen this process allows these fats to keep for a long time without losing their flavor or going bad unsaturated fats are liquid at room temperature unsaturated fats can be polyunsaturated or monounsaturated polyunsaturated fat is found in soybean corn sesame and sunflower oils or fish and fish oil monounsaturated fat is found in olives olive oil or canola oil most nuts and their oils and avocados fat and calories in a healthy diet fats should be eaten in moderation the american heart association recommends that people get as much of their daily fat intake as possible from unsaturated fats and that they limit saturated fats and trans fats its a bad idea to try to avoid fat completely fats are an important source of energy and they can help you feel full fats are needed to absorb certain vitamins vitamins a d e and k are fat soluble meaning they can only be absorbed if there is fat in a persons diet also body fat cells act as insulation to keep the body warm and help protect and cushion internal organs like fat you need a certain amount of calories in your diet to fuel your body nutritionists do not recommend calorie counting keeping track of the number of calories in everything that you eat for teens unless a doctor has specifically recommended it so if you are concerned about your weight speak to your doctor a healthy eating pattern means choosing a variety of foods including vegetables and fruit whole grains lowfat dairy and protein foods limit saturated fats trans fats and added sugars think about substitutes for foods that have a lot of sugar fat or calories for example drink water or lowfat milk instead of soft drinks or choose mustard instead of mayonnaise on your sandwich being aware of the amount of fat and calories you eat makes sense as long as you eat a balanced diet choosing foods wisely and exercising regularly are the keys
