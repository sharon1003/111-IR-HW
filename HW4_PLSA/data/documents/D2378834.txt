only hasten its release but also to make the song the title track 1critical reception  editneil strauss from the new york times wrote about the song ace of base creates another pop ballad about an imperfect relationship by repeating a deceptively mystical hook i saw the sign and it opened up my eyes over a minimal bass line 2chart performances  editin europe the sign reached 1 in denmark

another case of striking the right balance between happy and sad in a 2015 interview with billboard jonas berggren said about how the song was made“ when we recorded the sign it was a bit too merry  so we put the hums da nana nana nana in between the melody lines its a bit minor in that part it becomes major and minor as a total but the chorus is mostly major 8”music video  editace of base in the sign music video the music video of the song features the pop group singing amidst romantic and joyful images the sign was depicted as a computer generated ankh also known as key of life and a djed ancient egyptian symbol representing stability the music video is directed by mathias julien amid the images is a little story of a man and woman sitting side by side until the man leaves seemingly abandoning the woman however he comes back with a rose and offers it to the woman the woman graciously accepts and takes his hand however a bright light shines in the womans face drawing her away abandoning the man and dropping the rose on the chair the video was released in five different edits throughout various territories in the us the original edit of the video was later reedited changing
