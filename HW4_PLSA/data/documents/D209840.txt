from wikipedia the free encyclopedianavigation search this article is about the organism for the infection caused by this organism see helminthiasis helminth eggs of different helminth species which are produced for reproduction of the worms helminths   ˈ h ɛ l m ɪ n θ s   also commonly known as parasitic worms are large multicellular organisms which can generally be seen with the naked eye when they are mature they are often referred to as intestinal worms even though not all helminths reside in the intestines for example schistosomes are not intestinal worms but rather reside in blood vessels the word helminth comes from ancient greek ἕλμινς hélmins an intestinal worm there is no consensus on the taxonomy of helminths it is simply a commonly used term to describe certain worms with some similarities these are flatworms platyhelminthes namely cestodes tapeworms and trematodes flukes and roundworms or nemathelminths  nematodes – both of these are parasitic worm types – and the annelida which are not parasitic or at the most ectoparasites like the leeches 1helminths are wormlike organisms living in and feeding on living hosts they receive nourishment and protection while disrupting their hosts nutrient absorption this can cause weakness and disease of the host those helminths that live inside the digestive tract are called intestinal parasites they can live inside humans and other animals in their adult form helminths cannot multiply in humans 2 helminths are able to survive in their mammalian hosts for many years due to their ability to manipulate the immune response by secreting immunomodulatory products 3 all helminths produce eggs also called ova for reproduction these eggs have a strong shell that protects them against a range of environmental conditions the eggs can therefore survive in the environment outside their hosts for many months or years many but not all of the worms referred to as helminths belong to the group of intestinal parasites an infection by a helminth is known as helminthiasis helminth infection or intestinal worm infection there is a naming convention which applies to all helminths the ending asis or in veterinary science osis is added at the end of the name of the worm to denote the infection with that particular worm for example ascaris is the name of a type of helminth and ascariasis is the name of the infection caused by that helminth contents  hide 1 taxonomy2 common characteristics3 use in medicine4 eggs41 in the environment42 levels of infectiousness43 removal versus inactivation in

pinworms image showing life cycle inside and outside of the human body of one fairly typical and well described helminth ascaris lumbricoides there is no real consensus on the taxonomy or groupings of the helminths particularly with the nematodes 4 the term helminth contains a number of phyla many of which are completely unrelated however for practical considerations the term is still used nowadays to describe four groups with superficial similarities the phyla annelida platyhelminths nematoda and acanthocephala 4there is in fact no helminth classification it is an artificial term 5 6the most important helminths in the sanitation field are the human parasites which is why most people relate the term helminth to them where they are classified as nemathelminthes nematodes and platyhelminthes depending on whether they possess a round or flatshaped body respectively the latter are further divided into cestodes and trematodes depending on whether or not they have a segmented body 7ringworm dermatophytosis is actually caused by various fungi and not by a parasitic worm common characteristics  edithelminths are a group of organisms which share a similar form but are not necessarily related as part of evolution helminths include members of the following taxa monogeneans cestodes tapeworms nematodes roundworms and trematodes flukes the number of different helminth species is vast it is estimated to be around one million species  citation needed the nematodes are the most diverse of all the helminths with the highest number of species  citation needed there may be as many as 300000 species of parasites affecting vertebrates 8 and as many as 300 affecting humans alone 9characteristics that are common for all helminths include life time the life time of adult worms varies tremendously from one species to another but is generally in the range of 1 to 8 years see following table this life time of several years is a result of their ability to manipulate the immune response of their hosts by secreting immunomodulatory products 3helminths can be either hermaphrodites ie can have both sexes  like tapeworms and the flukes except the blood fluke which is not a hermaphrodite or have their sexes differentiated like the roundworms eggs all helminths produce eggs also called ova for reproduction helminth eggs have a strong shell that protects them against a range of environmental conditions this shell consists of three layers a lipoidal inner layer a chitinous middle layer and outer proteinic layer 10generally thousands or even hundreds of thousands of eggs are produced each time the female worm deposits its eggs  a process called ovoposition the following table shows a large variation in the number of eggs produced by the different worms in one event it varies in the range of 3000 to 700000 the frequency of egg deposition from an adult helminth is generally daily or up to six times per day for some taenia species adult trematodes lay smaller numbers of eggs compared to cestodes or nematodes however the egg develops into a miracidia from which thousands of cercariae swimming larvae develop this means that one egg may produce thousands of adult worms 11helminth eggs remain viable for 1–2 months in crops and for many months in soil fresh water and sewage or even for several years in feces fecal sludge historically called night soil and sewage sludge a period that is much longer compared to other kinds of microorganisms 12 13larvae larvae hatch from these eggs if the eggs are viable inside or outside the host depending on the type of helminth life cycles of the helminths differ in this and other specific aspects eggs that are no longer viable do not produce any larvae the larvae maturing in the host take from about two weeks up to four months depending on the helminth species the following table shows the principal morphological and reproductive distinctions for three helminth groups tapeworms cestodes flukes trematodes

and are available through the para site subportal of worm base 22use in medicine  editmain article helminthic therapy parasitic worms have been used as a medical treatment for various diseases particularly those involving an overactive immune response 23 as humans have evolved with parasitic worms proponents argue they are needed for a healthy immune system 23 scientists are looking for a connection between the prevention and control of parasitic worms and the increase in allergies such as hayfever in developed countries 23 parasitic worms may be able to damp down the immune system of their host making it easier for them to live in the intestine without coming under attack 23 this may be one mechanism for their proposed medicinal effect one study suggests a link between the rising rates of metabolic syndrome in the developed worlds and the largely successful efforts of westerners to eliminate intestinal parasites the work suggests eosinophils a type of white blood cell in fat tissue play an important role in preventing insulin resistance by secreting interleukin 4 which in turn switches macrophages into alternative activation alternativelyactivated macrophages are important to maintaining glucose homeostasis ie blood sugar regulation helminth infection causes an increase in eosinophils in the study the authors fed rodents a highfat diet to induce metabolic syndrome and then injected them with helminths helminth infestation improved the rodents metabolism 24 the authors concluded although sparse in blood of persons in developed countries eosinophils are often elevated in individuals in rural developing countries where intestinal parasitism is prevalent and metabolic syndrome rare we speculate that eosinophils may have evolved to optimize metabolic homeostasis during chronic infections by ubiquitous intestinal parasites… 24eggs  editanalysing for helminth eggs in samples of feces from a dry toilet in kenya processed helminth eggs samples from a dry toilet in kenya in the environment  editeggs can reach the soil when polluted wastewater sewage sludge or human excreta are used as fertilizer such soil is often characterized by moist and warm conditions therefore the risk of using contaminated wastewater and sludge in agricultural fields is a real problem especially in poor countries where this practice is prevalent 10 25 helminth eggs are regarded as the main biological health risk when applying sewage sludge fecal sludge or fecal matter on agricultural soils 12 the eggs are the infective stage of the helminths’ life cycle for causing the disease helminthiasis helminth eggs are resistant to various environmental conditions due to the composition of the egg shell each helminth egg species has 3 to 4 layers with different physical and chemical characteristics a the 1 to 2 outer layers are formed of mucopolysaccharides and proteins b the middle layers consist of chitinous material and serve to give structure and mechanical resistance to the eggs and c the inner layer is composed of lipids and proteins and is useful to protect eggs from desiccation strong acid and bases oxidants and reductive agents as well as detergent and proteolytic compounds 10 26 27 28due to this strong shell helminth eggs or ova remain viable in soil fresh water and sewage for many months in feces fecal sludge and sewage sludge they can even remain viable for several years 12 13 helminth eggs of concern in wastewater used for irrigation have a size between 20 and 90 μm and a relative density of 106–123 10 it is very difficult to inactivate helminth eggs unless temperature is increased above 40 °c or moisture is reduced to less than 5 10levels of infectiousness  edithelminth eggs contained in wastewater sewage sludge or human excreta are not always infectious ie able to cause the disease helminthiasis fertilized eggs and unfertilized eggs can exist side by side unfertilized eggs are identifiable under the microscope by their elongated shape no larvae can hatch from these kinds of eggs therefore unfertilized eggs do not pose a danger to human health in the case of ascaris lumbricoides giant roundworm which has been considered the most resistant and common helminth type fertilized eggs deposited in soil are resistant to desiccation but are at this stage of development very sensitive to environmental temperatures the reproduction of a fertilized egg within the eggshell develops at an environmental soil temperature about 25 °c which is lower than the body temperature of the host ie 37 °c for humans 21however development of the larvae in the egg stops at temperatures below 155 °c and eggs cannot survive temperatures much above 38 °c if the temperature is around 25 °c the infectiousness occurs after nearly 10 days of incubation 7 29 30 finally after 2 to 4 weeks in moist soil at optimal temperature and oxygen levels the embryo develops into an infective larva named secondstage larva this larva has the ability to get out of the egg hatch in the small intestine and migrate to different organs these infective larvae or infective eggs may remain viable in soil for two years or longer 21removal versus inactivation in wastewater and sludge treatment  editin order to physically remove but not inactivate helminth eggs from wastewater processes that remove particles such as sedimentation filtration or coagulationflocculation are employed 31 32 therefore waste stabilization ponds lagoons storage bassins constructed wetlands rapid filtration or upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactors can be used these conventional wastewater treatment processes do not inactivate the helminth ova but only removes them from the wastewater and moves them to the sewage sludge helminth ova cannot be inactivated with chlorine uv light or ozone in the latter case at least not with economical doses because 36 mgl ozone are needed with 1 hour contact time inactivation of helminth ova can be achieved in sewage sludge treatment where the temperature is increased over 40 °c or moisture is reduced to less than 5 10 best results can be obtained when both of these conditions are combined for an extended period of time 33 details about the contact time under these conditions and other related environmental factors are generally not welldefined for every type of helminth egg species 7 helminth eggs are considered highly resistant biological structures 10indicator organism  edithelminth eggs or ova are a good indicator organism to assess the safety of sanitation and reuse systems because they are the most environmentally resistant pathogens of all pathogens  viruses bacteria protozoa and helminths and can in extreme cases survive for several years in soil 12 therefore the presence or absence of viable helminth eggs viable helminth egg means that a larva would be able to hatch from the egg in a sample of dried fecal matter compost or fecal sludge is often used as an indicator to assess the efficiency of diverse wastewater and sludge treatment processes in terms of pathogen removal in particular the number of viable ascaris eggs is often taken as an indicator organism for all helminth eggs in treatment processes as they are very common in many parts of the world and relatively easy to identify under the microscope however the exact inactivation characteristics may vary for different types of helminth eggs 7measurement techniques  editenvironmental samples  editfor the purpose of setting treatment standards and reuse legislation it is important to be able to determine the amount of helminth eggs in an environmental sample with some accuracy the detection of viable helminth eggs in samples of wastewater sludge or fresh feces as a diagnostic tool for the infection helminthiasis is not straight forward in fact many laboratories in developing countries lack the right equipment or skilled staff required to do so an important step in the analytical methods is usually the concentration of the eggs in the sample especially in the case of wastewater samples a concentration step may not be required in samples of dried feces eg samples collected from urinediverting dry toilets human stool samples  editfor medical purposes the exact number of helminth eggs is less important and therefore most diagnoses are made simply by identifying the appearance of the worm or eggs in feces due to the large quantity of eggs laid physicians can diagnose using only one or two fecal smears  citation needed the kato technique also called the katokatz technique is a laboratory method for preparing human stool samples prior to searching for parasite eggs eggs per gram is a laboratory test that determines the number of eggs per gram of feces in patients suspected
