womens fiction vs romance a tale of two genresby lisa craig return to writing romance·printmobilefriendly version understanding womens fiction is important to successfully crafting a novel and submitting the work to the right publisher there are similarities between womens fiction and romance but also distinct differences while many of the publishers may be the same for both genres editors are looking for the key elements that make for compelling womens fiction my pursuit to uncover a clear definition of womens fiction and understand what differentiates it from romance sent me to the depths of the publishing industry and back what is womens fiction what is the appeal among todays readers how do publishing companies view the genre i share with you my quest to answer these questions a growing market the first stop on this grand adventure took me in search of hard warm facts nichole robbins fiction buyer at the tattered cover bookstore states most bookstores dont differentiate womens fiction from mainstreampopular fiction tattered cover shelves womens fiction in the general fiction area this practice makes it difficult to analyze sales since womens fiction isnt sold or shelved as its own category after examining industry statistics from the american bookseller association and book industry study group one can easily conclude that womens fiction comprises at least 40 of adult popular fiction sold in the united states and approximately 60 of adult popular fiction paperbacks according to a gallup poll were talking a 24 billion dollar industry women read more than men and women buy more books than men these conclusions support the theory that the concerns of womens lives are very important in todays literature scouring my own dusty archives of previous romance writers reports and romance writers of america industry statistics it is clear the romance genre is a staple of womens fiction the romance market is serious business producing serious revenues by serious women womens fiction however  like the women who read it  has evolved to include subjects and themes that range far beyond romance womens contemporary fiction is a growing market and includes many of the facets of other genres harper collinsavon senior editor micki nuding explains womens fiction can be commercial and usually is or literary it can be hereandnow contemporary or a multigenerational saga like rosamund pilchers books the woman is the star of the story and her changes and emotional development are the subject empowerment  and more a number of published authors provided insight into this growing market according to susan elizabeth phillips womens fiction is about womens empowerment jane heller defines womens fiction as novels written with any relationship at the core of the plot trying to wrap a definition around womens fiction is a little like trying to put a fence around a band of wild mustangs new york times bestselling author nora roberts says it best womens fiction is a story that centers on a woman or on primarily womens issues not necessarily the romantic relationship based books i do but the womans story publisher guidelines for the womens fiction market are varied and that variety is reflected in published books most womens fiction tends to be longer about 100000 words or more but can be in the 50000word range nicholas sparks the notebook zoomed up the new york times bestseller list with a 52000word love story about an elderly couple coping with alzheimers disease longer womens fiction uses the space to develop intricate and multicharactered subplots and deeper characterization these books have more introspection and description and arent as tightly focused as shorter novels a man or a hero might be waiting for the heroine of these novels at the end of her journey but he does not usually get equal time or equal depth to his internal journey during the course of a book in straight romance fiction the author renders the hero in every detailan expectation of readers this is not necessarily the case in womens fiction stories about sisters and womens friendships seem to be a current trend according to micki
