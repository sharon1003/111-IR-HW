fill embankments foundation pads road bases is compacted to a dense state to obtain satisfactory engineering properties such as shear strength compressibility or permeability in addition foundation soils are often compacted to improve their engineering properties laboratory compaction tests provide the basis for determining the percent compaction and molding water content needed to achieve the required engineering properties and for controlling construction to assure that the required compaction and water contents are achieved note 3 the degree of soil compaction required to achieve the desired engineering properties is often specified as a percentage of the modified maximum dry unit weight as determined using this test method if the required degree of compaction is substantially less than the modified maximum dry unit weight using this test method it may be practicable for testing to be performed using test method d698 and to specify the degree of compaction as a percentage of the standard maximum dry unit weight since more energy is applied for compaction using this test method the soil particles are more closely packed than when d698 is used the general overall result is a higher maximum dry unit weight lower optimum moisture content greater shear strength greater stiffness lower compressibility lower air voids and decreased permeability however for highly compacted finegrained soils absorption of water may result in swelling with reduced shear strength and increased compressibility reducing the benefits of the increased effort used for compaction  2 use of d698 on the other hand allows compaction using less effort and generally at a higher optimum moisture content the compacted soil may be less brittle more flexible more permeable and less subject to effects of swelling and shrinking in many applications building or construction codes may direct which test method d698 or this one should be used when specifying the comparison of laboratory test results to the degree of compaction of the inplace soil in the field52 during design of an engineered fill testing performed to determine shear consolidation permeability or other properties requires test specimens to be prepared by compacting the soil at a prescribed molding water content to obtain a predetermined unit weight it is common practice to first determine the optimum water content  w opt and maximum dry unit weight γ dmax by means of a compaction test test specimens are compacted at a selected molding water content  w  either wet or dry of optimum  w opt or at optimum  w opt  and at a selected dry unit weight related to a percentage of maximum dry unit weight γ dmax  the selection of molding water content  w  either wet or dry of optimum  w opt or at optimum  w opt and the dry unit weight γ dmax may be based on past experience or a range of values may be investigated to determine the necessary percent of compaction53 experience indicates that the methods outlined in 52 or the construction control aspects discussed in 51 are extremely difficult to implement or yield erroneous results when dealing with some soils the following subsections describe typical problem soils the problems encountered when dealing with such soils and possible solutions for these problems531 oversize fraction— soils containing more than 30  oversize fraction material retained on the 3  4 in 19mm sieve are a problem for such soils there is no astm test method to control their compaction and very few laboratories are equipped to determine the laboratory maximum unit weight density of such soils usdi bureau of reclamation denver co and u s army corps of engineers vicksburg ms although test methods d4914 and d5030 determine the “field” dry unit weight of such soils they are difficult and expensive to perform5311 one method to design and control the compaction of such soils is to use a test fill to determine the required degree of compaction and the method to obtain that compaction then use a method specification to control the compaction components of a method specification typically contain the type and size of compaction equipment to be used the lift thickness acceptable range of molding water content and number of passes note 4 success in executing the compaction control of an earthwork project especially when a method specification is used is highly dependent upon the quality and experience of the contractor and inspector5312 another method is to apply the use of density correction factors developed by the usdi bureau of reclamation  3 4 and u s corps of engineers  5 these correction factors may be applied for soils containing up to about 50 to 70  oversize fraction both agencies use a different term for these density correction factors the usdi bureau of reclamation uses d ratio or d – value while the u s corps of engineers uses density interference coefficient  i c 5313 the use of the replacement technique test method d1557 –78 method d in which the oversize fraction is replaced with a finer fraction is inappropriate to determine the maximum dry unit weight γ dmax of soils containing oversize fractions  5532 degradation— soils containing particles that degrade during compaction are a problem especially when more degradation occurs during laboratory compaction than field compaction the typical case degradation typically occurs during the compaction of a granularresidual soil or aggregate when degradation occurs the maximum dryunit weight increases  1 so that the resulting laboratory maximum value is not representative of field conditions often in these cases the maximum dry unit weight is impossible to achieve in the field5321 again for soils subject to degradation the use of test fills and method specifications may help use of replacement techniques is not correct533 gap graded— gapgraded soils soils containing many large particles with limited small particles are a problem because the compacted soil will have larger voids than usual to handle these large voids standard test methods laboratory or field typically have to be modified using engineering judgement note 5 the quality of the result produced by this standard is dependent on the competence of the personnel performing it and the suitability of the equipment and facilities used agencies that meet the criteria of practice d3740 are generally considered capable of competent and objective testingsamplinginspectionetc users of this standard are cautioned that compliance with practice d3740 does not in itself assure reliable results reliable results depend on many factors practice d3740 provides a means of evaluating some of those factors1 scope11 these test methods cover laboratory compaction methods used to determine the relationship between molding water content and dry unit weight of soils compaction curve compacted in a 4 or 6in 1016 or 1524mm diameter mold with a 1000lbf 4448n rammer dropped from a height of 1800 in 4572 mm producing a compactive effort of 56 000 ftlbfft 3 2700 k nmm 3  note 1 the equipment and procedures are the same as proposed by the u s corps of engineers in 1945 the modified effort test see 313 is sometimes referred to as the modified proctor compaction test111 soils and soilaggregate mixtures are to be regarded as natural occurring fine or coarsegrained soils or composites or mixtures of natural soils or mixtures of natural and processed soils or aggregates such as gravel or crushed rock hereafter referred to as either soil or material12 these test methods apply only to soils materials that have 30  or less by mass of their particles retained on the 3  4 in 190mm sieve and have not been previously compacted in the laboratory that is do not reuse compacted soil121 for relationships between unit weights and molding water contents of soils with 30  or less by weight of material retained on the 3  4 in 190mm sieve to unit weights and molding water contents of the fraction passing the 3  4 in 190mm sieve see practice d471813 three alternative methods are provided the method used shall be as indicated in the specification for the material being tested if no method is specified the choice should be based on the material gradation131 method a1311 mold— 4in 1016mm diameter1312 material— passing no 4 475mm sieve1313 layers— five1314 blows per layer— 251315 usage— may be used if 25  or less by mass of the material is retained on the no 4 475mm sieve however if 5 to 25  by mass of the material is retained on the no 4 475mm sieve method a can be used but oversize corrections will be required see 14 and there are no advantages to using method a in this case1316 other use— if this gradation requirement cannot be met then methods b or c may be used132 method b1321 mold— 4in 1016mm diameter1322 material— passing 3  8 in 95mm sieve1323 layers— five1324 blows per layer— 251325 usage— may be used if 25  or less by mass of the material is retained on the 3  8 in 95mm sieve however if 5 to 25  of the material is retained on the 3  8 in 95mm sieve method b can be used but oversize corrections will be required see 14  in this case the only advantages to using method b rather than method c are that a smaller amount of sample is needed and the smaller mold is easier to use1326 other usage— if this gradation requirement cannot be met then method c may be used133 method c1331 mold— 6in 1524mm diameter1332 material— passing 3  4 in 190mm sieve1333 layers— five1334 blows per layer— 561335 usage— may be used if 30  or less see 14 by mass of the material is retained on the 3  4 in 190mm sieve134 the 6in 1524mm diameter mold shall not be used with method a or b note 2 results have been found to vary slightly when a material is tested at the same compactive effort in different size molds with the smaller mold size typically yielding larger values of unit weight and density  1 214 if the test specimen contains more than 5  by mass of oversize fraction coarse fraction and the material will not be included in the test corrections must be made to the unit weight and molding water content of the test specimen or to the appropriate field inplace unit weight or density test specimen using practice d471815 this test method will generally produce a welldefined maximum dry unit weight for nonfree draining soils if this test method is used for freedraining soils the maximum unit weight may not be well defined and can be less than obtained using test methods d425316 all observed and calculated values shall conform to the guidelines for significant digits and rounding established in practice d6026 unless superseded by these test methods161 for purposes of comparing measured or calculated value s with specified limits the measured or calculated value s shall be rounded to the nearest decimal or significant digits in the specified limits162 the procedures used to specify how data are collectedrecorded or calculated in this standard are regarded as the industry standard in addition they are representative of the significant digits that generally should be retained the procedures used do not consider material variation purpose for obtaining the data special purpose studies or any considerations for the user’s objectives it is common practice to increase or reduce significant digits of reported data to be commensurate with these considerations it is beyond the scope of these test methods to consider significant digits used in analytical methods for engineering design17 the values in inchpound units are to be regarded as the standard the values stated in si units are provided for information only except for units of mass the units for mass are given in si units only g or kg171 it is common practice in the engineering profession to concurrently use pounds to represent both a unit of mass lbm and a force lbf this implicitly combines two separate systems of units that is the absolute system and the gravitational system it is scientifically undesirable to combine the use of two separate sets of inchpound units within a single standard these test methods have been written using the gravitational system of units when dealing with the inchpound system in this system the pound lbf represents a unit of force weight however the use of balances or scales recording pounds of mass lbm or the recording of density in lbmft 3 shall not be regarded as a nonconformance with this standard18 this standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns if any associated with its use it is the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use19
