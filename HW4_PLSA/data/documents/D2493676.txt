overview in depth synflorix ® will be administered on the routine national immunisation schedule from approximately midaugust as a primary course at 6 weeks 3 months and 5 months and a booster dose at 15 months healthy children who missed these events can catch up at any time up to their 5th birthday children with a medical condition that increases their risk of invasive pneumococcal disease and is listed on the pharmaceutical schedule will be funded to receive prevenar 13 vaccine in place of synflorix synflorix is designed to protect people from severe forms of pneumococcal disease egbacteraemia blood infection and meningitis but children may also be protected from less severe forms of the disease such at acute otitis media middle ear infection glue ear in addition there is good evidence that vaccinating young children reduces the amount of carriage people who carry the bacteria in their nose and throat but do not get sick from it in the population this means that people not vacinated may be protected from the groups of disease covered by the vaccine this is called herd or community immunity responses to vaccine synflorix pcv10common responses mild pain redness and

vaccine in place of synflorix prevenar 13 is available for purchase by people with a medical condition that is not listed on the pharmaceutical schedule catchup doses healthy children under 5 years who have not completed a course of pcv vaccine are eligible to receive ageappropriate catch up doses the required number of doses are determined by the age of the child and whether they completed a course of pcv in their first year of life ie three doses if commenced aged under 7 months or two doses if commenced between 7–11 months refer to appendix 2 in the immunisation handbook 2017 planning immunisation catchups note two catchup doses of synflorix are required for children aged 2–5 years this is different to the number of catchup doses of prevenar 13 for this age group one dose table 1

and preparation store as per cold chain between 2°c to 8°c protect from light administration synflorix can be administered concurrently with other vaccines including all the national immunisation schedule vaccines separate syringes and different injection sites should be used administration of synflorix is by intramuscular injection into the vastus lateralis muscle in infants and the deltoid muscle in toddlers and children no data are available on subcutaneous administration of synflorix vaccine safety synflorix should not be given to anyone with severe allergy anaphylaxis to a previous dose of this vaccine or other pneumococcal conjugate vaccines or a component of the vaccine administration of synflorix should be postponed in individuals suffering from a fever over 38°c the presence of a minor infection is not a reason to delay immunisation vaccine effectiveness invasive pneumococcal disease surveillance in new zealand reported that ipd notifications reduced by around twothirds in infants following the 2011 switch from pcv7 to pcv10 finland fin ip the largest study to be conducted on pcv10 found vaccine effectiveness ve against cultureconfirmed vaccineserotype ipd was 100 following a threedose primary series and a booster in the second year of life 31 schedule rates of nonlaboratory confirmed ipd in children aged 3–42 months declined by twothirds following the introduction of pcv10 in latin america during the compas study 100 ve was also shown against ipd brazil ageappropriate pcv10 immunisation was shown to be 838 effective overall against ipd including 822 effectiveness against crossreactive serotype 19a following the initiation of the pcv10 vaccination programme mortality from pneumococcal meningitis decreased by 69 in infants aged 2 years and the number of cases halved particularly in those aged 6–11 months canada at least one dose of pcv10 was shown to be 97 effective against vaccinetype ipd in children aged under 5 years 72 effective against any ipd and had a 71 crossreactive ve against serotype 19a ipd when comparing at least two doses of pcv7 pcv10 or pcv13 ve did not differ against vaccinetype ipd pneumonia decreases in pneumonia hospitalisation in infants were observed in brazil latin america and finland following the introduction of pcv10 immunisation of infants ve against all infant pneumonia hospitalisations was calculated to be around 25 in the fin ip trial otitis media pcv 10 has been shown to provide protection against pneumococcal acute otitis media aom in latin american and indigenous australian children in new zealand a decline in incidence of otitis media in children aged under 6 years has been observed since the introduction of pcv to the childhood immunisation schedule from 2006 in special groups and 2008 universally during the pcv7 usage time period om incidence declined by 55 then by 66 during the pcv10 period and 81 during the pcv13 period these declines were greatest in the children of māori and pacific ethnicity resulting in little ethnic disparity in disease incidence between the main ethnic groups following the introduction of pcvs in new zealand the dominant pathogen associated with otitis media became nthi which was detected in 95 of children requiring surgery for otitis media due to conjugation of eight of the ten vaccinetype polysaccharides with nthi protein d it has been suggested that pcv10 may also protect against this major cause of aom in children however the data is not conclusive there is evidence from the fin ip study that pcv10 immunisation initiated prior to 12 months of age may reduce the frequency of tympanostomy tube placements ttp grommets the fin ip study also found that there were fewer outpatient prescriptions for antimicrobial drugs used to treatment aom following immunisation with pcv10 ve ranging from 3–8 across study cohortsnasopharyngeal carriage vaccination with pcv10 reduces nasopharyngeal carriage npc of vaccinetype pneumococci the fin ip study found that npc was reduced by 1956 in infants aged under 2 years immunised with pcv10 as 31 schedule the compas study showed a 256 reduction in npc for vaccineserotypes following a threedose primary series in brazil npc was reduced by 44 carriage of vaccinetype pneumococci declined from 34 to 13 in vaccinated kenyan children following the introduction of pcv10 to the childhood schedule the reductions in npc were shown to persist for at least 28 months following a 31 infant schedule of pcv10 in the czech republic pcv10 immunisation was not found to reduce nthi carriage in the compas fin ip and other studies a dutch study also found that effect of pcv10 on nthi np colonisation in healthy children was no greater than that from pcv7 vaccination in new zealand the carriage of pcv10 serotypes but not nthi declined in children aged under 3 years following the introduction of the vaccine to the childhood schedule there was an increase in np carriage of nonvaccine type 19a in new zealand children herd immunity pcv10 immunisation has been shown to have indirect populationwide effects herd immunity on vaccinespecific disease including in new zealand a reduction in ipd cases of 48 among unvaccinated children aged 2–5 years was observed following the introduction of the pcv10 vaccination programme in finland in kenya the pcv10 had 66 effectiveness among unvaccinated individuals aged ≥5 years against np carriage of pneumococcal vaccineserotypes this reduction in transmission may lead to a reduction in vaccinetype ipd in all age groups in new zealand significant reductions of 60 and 70 were observed in vaccineserotype ipd notifications in those aged 5–64 years and over 65 years respectively between 2006 and 2014 however no corresponding decline was seen in the overall ipd rate for the nontarget age groups synflorix will not protect against pneumococcal serogroups other than those included in the vaccine although antibody response to diphtheria toxoid tetanus toxoid and protein d protein d is highly conserved in all haemophilus influenzae strains including nthi occurs immunisation with synflorix does not substitute routine immunisation with diphtheria tetanus or haemophilus influenzae type b vaccines
