heather bresch chief executive of mylan holds up epi pen medication while speaking at a house oversight and government reform committee on sept 15 andrew harrerbloomberg newsmylan chief executive heather bresch said one thing at a contentious hearing last week that should be music to the ears of people with lifethreatening allergies her company will soon push to extend the shelf life for epi pen currently epi pens expire 18 months from date of manufacturing facing criticism for the drugs rapidly rising price bresch said the company hopes the expiration date can be extended to a minimum of 24 months to make the case mylan will need to convince regulators that their data demonstrates that a new epi pen formulation can remain effective for months longer we hope within the next 12 months we will have approved a new formulation that will extend the shelf life bresch said during thursdays hearing  mylan’s epi pen profits are 60 percent higher than it told congressan extension would increase the time between refills and help quell a common complaint among patients and parents who have to toss out unused epi pens annually and buy new ones theres a common misconception that epi pens shelflife is just a year because time elapses between the manufacturing of the drug and when people pick up their prescriptions this wouldnt be the first time epi pens expiration date was altered in 2002 the shelf life was 27 months but a formulation change by the thenowner meridian medical technologies required a shorter expiration date said theresa eisenman a spokeswoman for the food and drug administration initially the approval was for 20 months but subsequent data supported 19 months the company decided to use 18 months she said epi pens are fortunately needed only in emergencies discarding them unused on a regular basis can feel wasteful particularly when the price tag has gone up to more than 600 for a pack of two  but its also critical that they work exactly as designed when they are needed doctors say questions about the expiration date of the product come up all the time the origins of epi pens expiration date epi pens shelf life has been limited by the chemistry of the drug inside it epinephrine is an old and cheap medication but its also notoriously finicky if exposed to light heat or air it can degrade turning rust colored the fdaapproved label warns that if the liquid in the pen is discolored it should be discarded epinephrine solution deteriorates rapidly on exposure to air or light turning pink from oxidation to adrenochrome and brown from the formation of melanin but what about an expired epi pen that looks perfectly normal the little published data that exists shows that the drug degrades over time  and color is not an accurate way to gauge whether the epinephrine inside is still good  why mylans savings card wont make epi pen cheaper for all patientsone study published in the journal of allergy and clinical immunology in 2000 examined epi pens one to 90 months after the expiration date most were not discolored but the epinephrine content decreased over time the study stated that it was best to use epi pens that had not expired but found that the pens contained at least twothirds of the intended dose up to a year after expiration even a suboptimal dose could be better than nothing in a lifeordeath situation the authors concluded another study published in the annals of allergy asthma and immunology in 2015 found that epi pens contained more than 90 percent of the labeled dose for up to two years after the expiration date the study also found that the color did not reliably indicate whether the epinephrine had degraded eisenman said that because of concerns about the ability to extend its shelf life epi pen is not in the federal shelflife extension program a federal program designed to aid in stockpiling drugs for public health emergencies the program allows for the shelf life of stockpiled drugs to be extended after products undergo stability testing in 2012 fda’s office of testing and research examined several epi pen samples that were beyond their expiration date and the data raised concerns eisenman said in an email the agency found an indicator that the drug had decreased in potency and concerns about discoloration which indicates degradation is likely occurring what happens when an epi pen expires medical professionals say that they would always recommend patients carry indate epi pens but that if an expired epi pen is all that is on hand in an emergency people should use it data suggests the drug can remain useful after the expiration date  with a predictable slow decline over time julie brown an emergency medicine physician at the university of washingtons health care system said in an email  how mylan the maker of epi pen became a virtual monopolyin one case reported by abc news in 2013 a mother who had only an expired epi pen on hand when her teenage son went into anaphylactic shock was instructed not to use it by first responders a neighbor brought over an epi pen but the young man died it was unclear whether the outofdate pen would have saved his life according to the news report the effect of degradation products of epinephrine on health is unknown but when you are talking about a lifethreatening reaction and no alternative options you are weighing that unknown and likely small risk against the greater risk of not treating the lifethreatening reaction brown said not using an available device even an expired one likely places someone in anaphylaxis at greater risk than using it wayne shreffler chief of pediatric allergy and immunology at massachusetts general hospital said in an email that parents ask questions about expired epi pens all the time in the absence of data im confident in i recommend that people replace their devices when theyre expired but say use if you have nothing else shreffler wrote mylan isnt the only company working on the problem chris stepanian runs a startup called windgap medical based in somerville mass which is focused on creating an epinephrine autoinjector that is more compact resistant to temperature extremes and longlasting than the epi pen his tiny company is still in a very early stage  it wont submit an application to regulators until 2018  but he said that it was not trivial to prove that a product can be safe and effective for a very long time if you want a very long shelf life say five years youre probably going to have to test it for five years before you can submit
