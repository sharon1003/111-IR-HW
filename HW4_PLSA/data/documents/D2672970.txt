clipings from the mower are completely safe the exhaust fumes are poisonous and im not 100 sure if the fumes get on the grass in the bag to be on the safe side if you use a gas powered mower i wouldnt give the pigs the grass my girls have been loving some grass clipings lately though i take a big pair of headge clippers and get two good handfuls of grass a week i want to slowly get them on the grass that way they think that its more of a treat050707 1139 am 5fay cavy champion joined jul 06 2006location california posts 1617thanks 188thanks 270 recd181 posts mentioned 0 post squoted 84 post

i wouldnt feed any fresh grass clippings cut by any type of mowers right before you go out to cut the grass take some clippers or scissors and cut a good amount of grass for the pigs and put it in a plastic bag then put it in the icebox it will stay fresh for several days050707 1235 pm 7jar bax cavy star joined mar 18 2006location scotland posts 2457thanks 173thanks 197 recd146 posts mentioned 0 post squoted 0 post sre grass clippings i have a dim and distant memory of reading somewhere that the interaction of metal blade and grass is not a good one when feeding grass to guineas  so i always pick my grass now my neighbours have stopped asking what im doing  bent over in the rain every morning picking grass i have had a pushalong mower and now use an electic one but still gather grass by hand not use the mowings the electric mower in particular just turns the grass to mush  not very appetising another reason not to use mowings if you need another is that it is more difficullt to determine what is grass and what is weedmossunidentified stem at least with hand picking you can hand  pick what you want your pigs to eatthe artist formerly known as jarbax050707 1242 pm 8fay cavy

was actually employed in ag research identifying samples of different grasses and plants cut from pastures fascinating work i just dont get it i agree it doesnt make sense but i remember vaguely reading somewhere that it is better to pick grass than to cut it be it with mower or scissors or shears or anything  dont ask me why  i dont remember infact i think the reason i remember it is because it seemed so strange at the time  but being the worry wart that i am i stick to picking grass rather than cutting basically if you are going to mow the lawn i suggest going out and picking some of it first  for the piggies then mowing as the grass will be quite short afterwards i personally find it easier to leave a few areas unmown for those inbetween mowing nibbles does that make any more sense

nutrition discussion thread i just noticed your charts and all your hard work let me just say that i think fresh grass which we cant find good data for is one of the best things you can feed your guinea pig start slowly if they arent used to it i used to feed fresh grass yearround even brushed off the snow and picked grass in the winter from here httpwwwguineapigcagescomforumthread3html post 42 going on this advice i give my guineas loads of grass in their diets  especially at this time of year though they ofcourse still have unlimited hay some pellets and veggies  their evening supper at this time of year is mainly grass instead of the salad type mix they get when the grass stops growing the artist formerly known as jarbax050807 1005 am 17jar bax cavy star joined mar 18 2006location

either way until its proven right or wrong it might be best to just pick grass instead of mowing just to be sure i tried searching on here im sure it was a post on here a year or so ago but didnt come up with anything certainly i would always use picked grass rather than mown  but using scissors or shears is perhaps less important another factor ofcourse is watching out for other animal poop  cats and dogs or even birds could leave undesirable residues on the grass off to search againit must be here somewherethe artist formerly known as jarbax050807 1033 am 18jabberwock cavy slave joined apr 12 2006location sheffield ukposts 298thanks 23thanks 38 recd24 posts mentioned 0 post squoted 0 post sre grass clippings i think that the whole action of any mower bashes and bruises the grass which doesnt make it very appetising and if you collect the grass in a grass box it heats up really quickly and will start to decompose and the clippings from the mower are very short  my piggies like long grass i go out at all times of year with my scissors to cut grass  usually in the back garden but in winter sometimes in the front like jar bax im sure my neighbours think im mad we mow the middle of the lawn but dont strim the edges  they grow to about 2030cm and are our source of grass for the piggies i should explain that we have absolutely no aspirations to have a posh show lawn but the piggies favourite grasses are probably couch grass and yorkshire fog and those grow abundantly as weeds in our borders thank you jabberwock for this useful post says jar bax050807 1117 am 19lypigs

is grass that has been mowed down by a mechanical tractor that is fueled by gas or diesel  hay is grass that is mowed by a large tractor but its left to sit in the field for anywhere from 2 days to a week or so to dry before being baled the grass in the hay fields is left to grow rather long as well before being cut heres an older thread from gl that i found rather interesting guinea lynx  topic

the metal blade thing  i think it must be some kind of reaction between blade of metal and blade of grass  where the cut oxidises am seriously poor at science but dont think this causes a large threat to guinea pigs  but still i will pick rather than cut seemingly random link  but in some small way verifies my sanity re blades doesnt it edit oops  just rubbished that theory in one fail swoop
