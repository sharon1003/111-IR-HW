dissociated without disrupting the membranes integrity membrane lipids are capable of many different types of movement which of these does not occur spontaneously in biological membranes switching between lipid layers the most common lipids in most cell membranes are the phosphatidylcholine a bacterium is suddenly expelled from a warm human intestine into the cold world outside which of the following adjustments might the bacterium make to maintain the same level of membrane fluidity produce lipids with hydrocarbon tails that are shorter and have more double bonds cholesterol serves several essential functions in mammalian cells which of the following is not influenced by cholesterol membrane thickness red blood cells have been very useful in the study of membranes and the protein components that provide structural support which of the following proteins is the principal fibrous protein in the cortex of the red blood cell spectrin the endothelial cells found closest to the site of an infection express proteins called lectins each lectin binds to a particular  that is presented on the surface of a target cell oligosaccharide it is possible to follow the movement of a single molecule or a small group of molecules this requires the use of antibodies linked to small particles of gold which appear as dark spots when tracked through video microscopy what is this method called sptwhich of the following statements about the carbohydrate coating of the cell surface is false the arrangement of the oligosaccharide side chains is highly ordered much like the peptide bonds of a polypeptide chain although the extracellular environment has a high sodium ion concentration and the intracellular environment has a high potassium ion concentration both must be neutralized by negatively charged molecules in the extracellular case what is the principal anion clwhich of the following has the lowest rate of diffusion across an artificial membrane that does not contain any proteins glucose transporters in contrast to channels work by specific binding to solutes pumps are transporters that are able to harness energy provided by other components in the cells to drive the movement of solutes across membranes against their concentration gradient this type of transport is called active transport the nak atpase protein is responsible for maintaining the high extracellular sodium ion concentration and the high intracellular potassium ion concentration what happens immediately after the protein hydrolyzes atp the protein is phosphorylated the direction of passive transport across a membrane is determined by the  for an uncharged molecule and  for a charged molecule concentration gradient electrochemical gradient when a transporter moves two ions in the same direction across the membrane it is considered a n symporter which of the following best describes the behavior of a gated channel it opens more frequently in response to a given stimulus the stimulation of auditory nerves depends on the opening and closing of channels in the auditory hair cells which type of gating mechanism do these cells use stressgated if na channels are opened in a cell that was previously at rest how will the resting membrane potential be affected it becomes more positive which of the following is required for the secretion of neurotransmitters in response to an action potential voltagegated ca2 channels during an action potential the membrane potential changes from  to  negative positive both excitatory and inhibitory neurons form junctions with muscles by what mechanism do inhibitory neurotransmitters prevent the postsynaptic cell from firing an action potential by opening cl channels the advantage to the cell of the gradual oxidation of glucose during cellular respiration compared with its combustion to co2 and h2o in a single step is that  energy can be extracted in usable amounts the final metabolite s produced by glycolysis is pyruvate glycolysis generates more stored energy than it expends what is the net number of activated carrier molecules produced in this process number and type of molecules produced minus the number of those molecules used as input 2 atp 2 nadhon a diet consisting of nothing but protein which of the following is the most likely outcome excretion of more nitrogenous ammoniaderived wastes than with a more balanced diet what purpose does the phosphorylation of glucose to glucose 6phosphate by the enzyme hexokinase serve as the first step in glycolysis it helps drive the uptake of glucose from outside the cell which of the following cells rely exclusively on glycolysis to supply them with atp anaerobically growing yeast pyruvate must move from the cytosol into the mitochondria where it oxidized to form co2 and acetyl co a by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex how many different enzymes and what total number of polypeptides respectively are required to perform this oxidation process in the mitochondrion 3 60during glycolysis atp is produced by substratelevel phosphorylation pyruvate is an important metabolic intermediate that can be converted into several other compounds depending on which enzyme is catalyzing the reaction which of the following cannot be produced from pyruvate in a single enzymecatalyzed reaction citrate step 3 in glycolysis requires the activity of phosphofructokinase to convert fructose 6phosphate into fructose 16bisphosphate which of the following molecules is an allosteric inhibitor of this enzyme atpthe conversion of fructose 16bisphosphate is catalyzed by a fructose 16bisphosphatase and is one of the final steps in gluconeogenesis which of the following molecules is an allosteric activator of this enzyme atpin humans glycogen is a more useful food storage molecule than fat because it can be utilized to produce atp under anaerobic conditions whereas fat cannot modern eukaryotes depend on mitochondria to generate most of the cells atp how many molecules of atp can a single molecule of glucose generate 30an antiporter in the inner mitochondrial membrane moves atp out of the matrix and brings in adpin which of the four compartments of a mitochondrion are the citric acid cycle proteins located matrix electron transport is coupled to atp synthesis in mitochondria in chloroplasts and in the thermophilic bacterium methanococcus which of the following is likely to affect the coupling of electron transport to atp synthesis in all of these systems an adp analogue that inhibits atp synthase stage 1 of oxidative phosphorylation requires the movement of electrons along the electrontransport chain coupled to the pumping of protons into the mitochondrial intermembrane space what is the final result of these electron transfers o2 is reduced to h2o which component of the electrontransport chain is required to combine the pair of electrons with molecular oxygen in mitochondria cytochrome c oxidase in the reaction centers in photosystem ii lowenergy electrons are taken from water and high energyelectrons are given to plastiquinone in a process involving charge separation experimental evidence supporting the chemiosmotic hypothesis was gathered by using artificial vesicles containing a protein that can pump protons in one direction across the vesicle membrane to create a proton gradient which protein was used to generate the gradient in a highly controlled manner bacteriorhodopsin in stage 1 of photosynthesis a proton gradient is generated and atp is synthesized where do protons become concentrated in the chloroplast thylakoid space in noncyclic photophosphorylation how many electrons are required to generate one glucose molecule 48in photosynthetic cyanobacteria that grow in long chains some cells differentiate into heterocysts that specialize in nitrogen fixation which requires a microenvironment with low oxygen heterocysts do not make glucose but instead exchange nutrients with their neighbors which of the following components of the electron transport chain is able to be degraded in heterocysts photosystem iibelow is a list of breakthroughs in energy metabolism in living systems
