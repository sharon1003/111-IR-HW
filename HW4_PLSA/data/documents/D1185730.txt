mechfp mechanical op 6 feb 13 0824is there any difference between operating pressure  residual pressure of sprinkler head when nfpa 13 says operating pressure of sprinkler  25psi what does it meancdafd specifierregulator 6 feb 13 0852what he said httpwwwengtipscomviewthreadcfmqid193757mechfp mechanical op 7 feb 13 0250thanks cdafd but one thing is again disturbing me when we see any design criteria for rack storage in nfpa 13 for example table 16221 cmsa sprinkler design criteria for there is something called as minimum operating pressure given in that table what does this mean is it the minimum operating pressure of last most remote sprinkler head or is it the minimum operating pressure of the system or is it the minimum operating pressure of design area 2000 sqft what i know is minimum pressure for last sprinkler head must not be less than 7 psi if i design my system considering 25psi or 50psi to be the minimum pressure at the last sprinkler head with k112 or k196 sprinklers then the pressure for the system is going too high please helpcdafd specifierregulator 7 feb 13 0820not an engineer designer or anywhere near one of those but i take it that is the minimum pressure any head in the system is required to have to work properly cannot address the high pressure as long as you are not over 175 on the system there is nothing extra needed what they said again httpwwwengtipscomviewthreadcfmqid235664 can i ask what you do for a living travis mack mechanical 7 feb 13 1054using cmsa as your example you have x number of sprinklers at y pressure this is the minimum pressure that must be available at any sprinkler if you have a gridded system the pressures will be pretty similar and flows fairly close between all heads if you have a tree system the most hydraulically remote sprinkler will have y pressure all other sprinklers will have y pressure you system demand at the base of the riser will be y in almost all cases unless your base of riser is far above your sprinklers example k17 esfr at 44 elevation the minimum sprinkler demand pressure is 52 psi 44 of elevation is going to add 19 psi you will likely have somewhere around 30 psi of friction losses depending on pipe sizes so the base of riser pressure would be 101 psi there would be extra pressure requirements if you have a backflow preventer or other devices in the riser assembly hopefully this makes sense travis mack mfp design llc wwwmfpdesigncommechfp mechanical op 9 feb 13 0606thanks cdafd  travis you guys always give brilliant response  explanation it really helped a lot i am designing a fire sprinkler system for storage facility wherein i am using cmsa sprinklers considering k112 with 50psi operating pressure for the remote sprinkler head i am getting total inlet pressure to be 800psi 55bar approx design area  2000 sqft  total no of sprinklers 16 pressure seems to be too high but m going to discuss this with ahj cdafd m mechanical engineer working in middle east travis your example raises one more question how you have minimum sprinkler demand pressure as 52 psi it depends on total no of sprinkler right if you consider 20 sprinklers then the pressure will go much higher than what you describedstookeyfpe specifierregulator 9 feb 13 2140this sounds like an fm design for plastics with a k factor of 112 and discharge pressure of 50 psi the total flowsprinkler is 80 gpm i have no idea of how you are getting a 800 psi inlet pressure and no sprinkler pipe or fittings are designed for these pressuresmechfp mechanical op 10 feb 13 0519yes stookeyfpe you are right i know am wrong somewhere i am not getting exactly what i am looking for my question is  the discharge pressure 50psi for k112 sprinklers as mentioned in nfpa 13 is it for all 20 sprinklers in design area or only for the most remote sprinkler if it is for the most remote sprinkler then the pressure at the inlet riser will be too high which is surely wrong if it is for all the 20 sprinklers  50psi for 20 sprinklers then the last sprinkler will not get minimum operating pressure travis already gave one example but number of sprinklers there are not clear i hope i am clear with my question this time and am waiting for your responsescdafd specifierregulator 10 feb 13 0603fire protection analysis procedure 1 determine density  area requirements 2 evaluate possible hydraulically remote areas 3 measure out the area of operation 4 measure out each sprinkler area 5 calculate flow at remote sprinkler q  density x area then use outlet formula to determine pressure at that point 6 follow a path from the remote head to the supply point for each pipe along that path a use pressure at pipe start point to calculate flow from any sprinkler b add sprinkler flow to previous pipe flow c use dia length accumulated flow and roughness to calculate friction loss d use elevation differences between pipe ends to calculate elevation pressure e calculate pressure at other end of pipe p 2  p 1  p e  p fcdafd specifierregulator 10 feb 13 0609check pages 21 to 33 httpaucacheautodeskcomau2011sessions5517nstookeyfpe specifierregulator 10 feb 13 1003this is a cmsa design so it does not use the conventional discharge densitydesign area method also it is inappropriate to reference some dribble out of an autocad manual when the governing criteria is nfpa 13 in this case the designer determines the 20 most hydraulically most remote sprinklers and calculates the design so that each of the 20 sprinklers has a minimum discharge pressure of 50 psig this is a more demanding design because it is based on a minimum pressure rather than flow ratemechfp mechanical op 10 feb 13 1021cdafd thanks for your explanation but as stookeyfpe said this is not the normal design i am using cmsa sprinklers can you explain me the design procedure for cmsa type of sprinklerscdafd specifierregulator 10 feb 13 1150stookey explained it in his last post maybe find a fire protection engineer near you to design or help with the design i read you need whatever the manufacture says is the minimum pressure for the head to work per its listingcdafd specifierregulator 10 feb 13 1155this is on example of a cmsa head maybe looking at the manufactures design criteria might help answer your questions httpwwwvikinggroupinccomdatabooksprinklers travis mack mechanical 10 feb 13 1725as i stated above if you are on a gridded system each head will be very close to your 50 psi for all 20 heads if you are on a tree type or looped system then only your most hydraulically remote head will be at 50 psi the others will increase based on friction losses of the piping travis mack mfp design llc wwwmfpdesigncom
