anger slowly getting worse every dayby sunny missourii always had an anger problem when i was a child it started to grow worse and worse everyday when i was in school and trying to deal with my parents they didnt want to help me out with my homework and would take things out on me when i didnt deserve it i noticed something one time when i was around 19 years old i was drinking alcohol one evening and i realized i was angry every time my mom would try to talk to me positive or not positive i couldnt understand why i was so mad at her when i had no reason to be i literally told her to please not talk to methat i was feeling really angry and i did not know why i said that i was getting really hotheaded and that everything she said to me made me feel like hitting her i had never felt like this before in my life and i couldnt explain why i was going through it that night im so glad that my mom never called the cops on me like her friend told her to i am very relieved as im pretty sure the outcome would not have been good ive even wondered if i might have been shot and killed that night i never experienced that feeling again until the age of 27 when my 3 yr old was driving me nuts i am a single mom and on that day in particular he was really getting on my nerves then i had that same feeling again that i had with my mom i did not hit my kid or harm him in any way i just sent him to timeout i could barely control myself i walked outside to take a breather before i felt like doing something to him what is this and why do i feel like this once in a great blue moon i know my anger is passed down on my fathers side of the family but i dont understand why i have only experienced this type of anger twice in my lifetimewithout anyone really creating it for me it just came on response from dr de foore hello sunny and thanks for writing your story on this site i want to respond to several things you said but first i want to congratulate you for asking for help youre a good person who wants to do the right thing and thats why youre reaching out for help here your anger just doesnt feel right to you and thats because it doesnt match up with who you really are and how you want to be you mentioned drinking alcohol in connection with one of the incidents above while i dont know anything about your drinking i just want to share these early warning signs of alcoholism with you in case thats a part of the problem read this page on alcohol abuse and that should help you know where you stand the anger problems youre having do not seem once in a blue moon you said you always had anger problems as a child and that they got worse every day by the way im really glad you didnt hurt your child thats why its so great that youre asking for help here this is what i want you to do after youre sure that alchohol is not part of the problem 1 write a detailed account of any abuse and mistreatment you received as a child dont hold back or leave anything out try to describe every detail this is for no ones eyes but yours so dont worry about that the benefit is how it will help you to revisit these memories from your present position 2 use the guided imagery healing processes you will find on this page to heal emotionally from the abuse 3 use the journaling processes you will find described on this page to begin managing your anger more effectively on a daily basis this will include a daily journaling process of writing from your anger and then shifting to positive journaling about the good things in you your life and your son 4 moment by moment day by day every time you think of your son think of his positive aspectswhat you like admire and love about him use this to extend the benefit of the positive journaling process above the answers are withing you sunny you have what it takes to resolve your anger problems use these tools and you will get good results most importantly believe in yourself you dan do this my very best to you dr de foore
