know which was which when he decided to name one direction positive and the other direction negative the labels positive and negative had been used in maths to indicate direction for years by then he guessed that the charge carriers whatever they might be travelled from one electrode to the other and he labelled them to indicate what he thought was the correct way round with the charge carrier carrying what he assumed was a positive charge turned out he guessed wrong but by the time it was worked out that the charge carriers electrons were going in the opposite direction to the one assumed and so the charge must be negative it was too late to change the convention for labelling531 views · view upvoters related questions more answers below why is it that there are positive and negative charges why we call it negative and positive how do i know that the body is positive charged or negative charged how does a large negative charge produce from a small positive charge what is a negative charge why does an electron have a negative charge only but not a positive charge what kind of charge is a negative and positive charge said to be ask new question abhishek prabhu just a physics enthusiast updated feb 5 2017benjamin franklin coined the terms positive and negative charges in the 18th century due to the fact that when equal amounts of the two different charges ve and ve were added or present in a body they cancelled each other ie it was as if there was no charge it is universally accepted that when a positive integer is added with a negative integer of same magnitude the resultant is zero it can also be observed that the naming was clever since positive and negative charges produce electric fields having opposite direction usually the terms positive and negative represent an opposition in direction hope this answer helps you thanks11k views · view upvoterspromoted by uc berkeley extension organic chemistry course at uc berkeley extension prepare for grad

answers and 2931k answer views a2a why are positive charges called positive and negative charges called negative you can call them anything you wantit is just that the convention helps while determining the direction of vector quantities that depend on the kind of charge you are talking about forces between the charges hence also fields current densities etc negative means this way and positive means that as long as this convention is defined clearly you can as well reverse the definitions if you call the “left” and “right” for example you will have to find a suitable way to determine the direction of these vector quantities in a writeable manner thats all867 views · view upvoters susanta debnath trying to understand the nuances of electricityanswered apr 13 2016very simply put negative charges have a surplus of electrons and positive charges have a deficit of electrons all that you see around is made up of electrons however big or small it is but they are electrically neutral take for example two painted metallic balls alike in every respect except their colours one is painted green and the other blue since they have equal number of electrons and are electrically neutral you see no attraction or repulsion between them if you somehow manage to remove an electron from the green ball and donate it to the blue ball the blue ball becomes negatively charged with respect to the green ball alternately we can say that the green ball becomes positively charged with respect to the blue ball so you see it is just like calling a glass exactly half filled as half empty or vice versa652 views stephen frantz former director of the reed college nuclear reactor answered feb 21 2016 · author has 36k answers and 17m answer views originally answered why do we call electrons negative and protons positive it is just a standard that was defined it could be either way notably benjamin franklin got the direction of electrical current backwards from the electron flow which has caused confusion ever since he had no way of measuring the electron flow so he had a 50 chance and got it wrong902 views · view upvoterspromoted by scott phillips trading

doesnt matter which is positive and which is negative it only matters that we are consistent about which is which i believe the original terms were “vitreous” and “resinous” though i think we moved towards positive and negative as terms due to the realisation that magnetism and electricity are two aspects of the same thing electromagnetism as for how you know which is which you can use the earths magnetic field as a reference the earths north pole is magnetic south so the north pole of the magnet will point towards it when suspended from a string assuming there isnt a stronger electromagnetic field nearby 488 views · view upvoters binita kumari dash graduate in electrical engineering basic is electricity answered apr 13 2016 · author has 128 answers and 2448k answer views its just a convention you can take it opposite but since sir benjamin franklin discovered the concept of positive and negative charges we are using it since then as per the conventional naming it just help us determine the flow of electrons from one matter to another as you know positive charge means deficit of electrons and negative charge means surplus of electrons so we use this concept to determine the direction of flow of electrons275 views · view upvoters sreehari variar the power of electricityanswered may 28 2016 · author has 462 answers and 1839k answer views for no apparent reason when you have two of anything that are opposite in nature people have tendencies to attach positive and negative or left and right to it just for identification purposes the only take away should be they are opposite in nature there isnt anything inherently negative about negative charge302 views · view upvoters robert harvey answered oct 31 2017 · author has 97k answers and 4m answer
