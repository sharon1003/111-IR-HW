the age of seven though not a star student his drawing skills were good both his teachers and his parents encouragement led to samuels success with miniature portraits on ivory samuel graduated from yale college in 1810 he wished to pursue a career in art but his father was opposed to this samuel took a job as a clerk in a charlestown bookstore during this time he continued to paint his father

at work in 1815 morse returned to america and set up a studio in boston massachusetts he soon discovered that his large canvases attracted attention but not sales in those days americans looked to painters primarily for portraits and morse found that even these sales were difficult to get he traveled extensively in search of work finally settling in new york city in 1823 perhaps his two bestknown canvases are his portraits of the marquis de lafayette 1757–1834 a french general who served with george washington 1732–1799 during the american revolution which he painted in washington d c in 1825 in 1826 morse helped found and became the first president of the national academy of design an organization that was intended to help secure sales for artists and to raise the taste of the public the previous year morses wife had died in 1826 his father died the death of his mother in 1828 dealt another severe blow and the following year morse left for europe to recover electromagnetism in october 1832 morse returned to the united states on the voyage he met charles thomas jackson an eccentric doctor and inventor with whom he discussed electromagnetism jackson assured morse that an electric impulse could be carried along even a very long wire morse later recalled that he reacted to this news with the thought that if this be so and the presence of electricity can be made visible in any desired part of the circuitsamuel f b morse courtesy of the library of congress  i see no reason why intelligence might not be instantaneously transmitted by electricity to any distance he immediately made some sketches of a device to accomplish this purpose even as an art professor at the university of the city of new york the telegraph was never far from morses mind he had long been interested in gadgetry and had even taken out a patent document protecting the owner of an invention from having it stolen he had also attended public lectures on electricity his shipboard sketches of 1832 had clearly laid out the three major parts of the telegraph a sender which opened and closed an electric circuit a receiver which used an electromagnet to record the signal and a code which translated the signal into letters and numbers by january 1836 he had a working model of the device that he showed to a friend who advised him of recent developments in the field of electromagnetism—especially the work of the american physicist scientist of matter and energy joseph henry 1797–1878 as a result morse was able to greatly improve the efficiency of his device invention trial in september 1837 morse formed a partnership with alfred vail who contributed both money and mechanical skill they applied for a patent the american patent remained in doubt until 1843 when congress approved thirty thousand dollars to finance the building of an experimental telegraph line between the national capital and baltimore maryland it was over this line on may 24 1844 that morse tapped out his famous message what hath god wrought made morse was willing to sell all of his rights to the invention to the federal government for one hundred thousand dollars but a combination of a lack of congressional interest and the presence of private greed frustrated the plan instead he turned his business affairs over to amos kendall morse then settled down to a life of wealth and fame he was generous in his charitable gifts and was one of the founders of vassar college in 1861 his last years were spoiled however by questions as to how much he had been helped by others
