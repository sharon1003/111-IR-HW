are jurors contacted for service in federal court before potential jurors are summoned for service their names are randomly drawn from voters lists and sometimes drivers lists to receive a questionnaire to determine whether they meet the legal qualifications for jury service individuals who receive questionnaires are required to complete and return them to the clerks office which then screens the completed questionnaires to determine eligibility for jury service in some courts qualification questionnaires and summonses are mailed together must i respond to my jury duty notice yes it is legally required and there are penalties for noncompliance jurors perform a vital role in the american system of justice jury service is an important civic function that supports one of the fundamental rights of citizens  the right to have their cases decided by a jury of their peers who may serve as a juror the jury act which is set out at title 28 u s code sections 18611878 calls for random selection of citizens names from voters lists or from voter lists supplemented by additional sources such as drivers lists because random selection is required individuals may not volunteer for service more on jury service the act states that individuals are legally disqualified from serviceif they are not a citizen of the united states 18 years old who has resided for a period of one year within the judicial districtif they are unable to read write and understand the english language with a degree of proficiency necessary to fill out a qualification formif they are unable to speak the english languageif they are incapable by reason of mental or physical infirmity to render jury service orif they have felony charges pending against them punishable by imprisonment for more than one year or they have been convicted of a felony and their civil rights have not been restored in addition the jury act lists three groups that are exempt from federal jury servicemembers of the armed forces on active dutymembers of professional fire and police departments andpublic officers of federal state or local governments who are actively engaged in the performance of public duties persons belonging to these groups may not serve on federal juries even if they so desire will i be paid for jury service yes federal jurors are paid 40 a day employees of the federal government are paid their regular salary in lieu of this fee in most courts jurors also are reimbursed for reasonable transportation expenses and parking fees your employer may continue your salary during all or part of your jury service but federal law does not require an employer to do so nonetheless the jury act forbids any employer from firing intimidating or coercing any permanent employee because of their federal jury service what if the dates of my jury service conflict with my work or vacation schedule the jury act allows courts to grant temporary deferrals of service on the grounds of undue hardship or extreme inconvenience the qualification questionnaire and juror summons provides specific information on how to request a deferral from your individual court whether to grant a deferral is a matter of discretion for the court and cannot be reviewed or appealed to congress or any other entity why have some people never been called for jury duty eligibility for federal jury service is dependent both upon an individual meeting the legal qualifications for service and upon the random chance of having ones name drawn from the source lists each judicial district must have a formal written plan for the selection of jurors which provides for random selection from a fair crosssection of the community in the district and which prohibits discrimination in the selection process voter records  either voter registration lists or lists of actual voters  are the required source of names for federal court juries some courts supplement voter lists with other sources such as lists of licensed drivers a copy of a districts jury plan is available for review in the clerks office in addition many courts offer excuses from service on individual request to designated groups of persons or occupational classes such groups may include persons over age 70 persons who have within the past two years served on a federal jury and persons who serve as volunteer fire fighters or members of a rescue squad or ambulance crew may i volunteer for jury service while the federal courts appreciate your willingness in participating in jury service you cannot volunteer to serve each judicial district must randomly
