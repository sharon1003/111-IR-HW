why were early cars righthand drive historians have yet to agree on why control of an automobiles steering switched from right to left but i have my theories to begin with a horsedrawn wagon was always driven on the right side because the teamster could always hold the reins with his left hand while pulling on the brake with his strongest arm some wagons used a foot brake directly on the wheel but that too required a persons strongest side many but not all cars continued this tradition by placing the tiller in the middle of the car where it could be steered by either the right or left side of the car another reason for the right hand steering was that lots of roads turned to mud in poor weather it was far better stepping down out of the car directly on the sidewalk than in walking around the car i have also heard that while driving on dangerous mountain roads drivers wanted to see how close they were getting to the edge in any case premium manufacturers thought it crude to place the gear shift and emergency brake in the middle of the car where they would be in the way of the passengers it is likely that the switch to lefthand steering was accelerated by the rapid increase in the number of automobiles poor drivers worried about passing oncoming traffic on the narrow roads of the day why henry moved to lefthand steering when he started producing the model t ford in late 1908 is generally thought to be because it was cheaper but that seems unlikely since all controls were still just as far from the center of the car on the other hand the move from right to lefthand drive saved most other companies a bundle since it eliminated a whole lot of linkage to the transmission and provided a strong foundation for the emergency brake the move also provided access to the emergency brake to all riding in the front seat the last american cars to switch were piercearrow in 1920 and stutz the following year although stutz did offer righthand steering on some 1921  22 modelshome
