fandom did ‘supernatural’ just give fans the queer romance they’ve been hoping for gavia bakerwhitelaw — 20131015 0656 pm  last updated 20151211 0357 pm if a male tv character says “i love you” to another male character but the line is cut from the script did it ever really happen if a male tv character says “i love you” to another male character but the line is cut from the script did it ever really happen and if it happens in supernatural does it mean the showrunners are finally admitting that one of the show’s leads dean winchester might be bisexual a few seasons ago supernatural was the last tv show you’d expect to include a canonically queer relationship involving one of the male leads sure fans love to write about the malemale pairing of dean and the angel castiel commonly known as “ destiel ” but the show itself doesn’t have a great track record when it comes to representing gay men as a rule minorities do not tend to last long in supernatural  but in recent years the showrunners have begun to develop a grudging respect for destiel fans partly because the pairing is so darn popular thanks to the backlot’s poll of online fandom’s favorite slash pairings we know that destiel is the most popular pairing of the year beating out the 2012 winner teen wolf ’s sterek  dean and castiel have had a very intense relationship since castiel first showed up four seasons ago and many fans think this relationship could plausibly evolve into an onscreen romance supernatural is no stranger to queerbaiting let’s be real here there is a lot of “no homo” humor between sam and dean but recently there have been hints that dean and cas might just make the leap into canon romance maybe possibly season 8 episode 17 is one of the slashiest hours of television a destiel fan could’ve hoped for but according to a recent interview with the cast at a toronto fan convention the perceived romance could’ve been a whole lot more explicit in fact the original script had dean saying “i love you” to castiel actor jensen ackles replaced the line with “we’re family i need you” because dean isn’t really the touchyfeely type tumblr is exploding because they’ve discovered dean was originally scripted to say “i love you” instead of “i need you” in 8×17 destiel— destiel † allonsycastiel october 15 2013this revelation was enough to send supernatural fandom into turmoil was ackles’ script alteration another hint of possible homophobia like when he refused to answer a fan’s question about destiel or does the inclusion of an “i love you” imply that destiel might actually happen for real right now tumblr and twitter are aflutter with debates over whether the scripted “i love you” counts as canon and whether it can even be construed as anything stronger than platonic love as tumblr user spookyfangirlspookynovel put it “woah woah woah guys i ship them so hard but there’s still a hella difference between ‘i love you’ and ‘i’m in love with you’”when the show went on air in 2005 this kind of fan theory would’ve had trouble gaining any traction among its mainstream fanbase but with the rise of canonically queer characters in tumblrpopular shows like glee and yes teen wolf a “real” relationship between dean and cas no longer seems like a pieinthesky fannish dream in 2013 maybe you can see your favorite slash pairings come to life onscreen or at least that’s what many fans are hoping aside from the popularity of destiel for its own merits a lot of fans would like to see dean winchester come out as bisexual it’s relatively rare to see bisexual men on tv and rarer still to see them come out in later life after previously identifying as straight dean’s ubermacho behaviour and slightly homophobic attitude are often interpreted as signs of denial and many longtime viewers feel it wouldn’t be much of a stretch to admit that dean winchester is into dudes unfortunately there’s one other thing getting in the way dean winchester himself“i’ve begun to believe that the writers and the actors have set up this impossible scenario with regards to dean and castiel and related with dean and his sexuality” writes tumblr user heyheyrenay “i feel like the narrative since season four has been telling me one thing slowly but surely and the payoff of that narrative is never going to be ‘romantic love’ and if dean winchester as jensen believes cannot cope with verbalizing those feelings i also see my hope for any storyline supporting a explicit bisexual relationship between dean and castiel… fading because with castiel it’s been years years”in other words there’s a distinct possibility that the main thing preventing a destiel romance isn’t just the conservative fears of the showrunners or tv network—it’s dean’s own personality he might simply be too repressed to ever admit anything on the bright ish side if dean winchester is going to fall for any guy it’s definitely going to be castiel illustration via sweetdari deviant artgavia
