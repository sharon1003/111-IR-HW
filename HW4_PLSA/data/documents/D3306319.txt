closes to the 15 how do i adjust the distributor to get a wider gap log in to reply no emailmo c02072010 141536report to moderator re 8n distributor point setting in reply to mo c 02052010 094334i just finished reading all the comments to my original question i am not sure how the majority of them would help me to solve the problem i am a retired u s air force member but that does not have anything to do with solving the problem except that your experience is as a mechanic bruce did ask me for more information and before he did i realized i did not tell enough information about the tractor before posting the message so thanks bruce i realize that you must have more information before you can give an intelligent answer the tractor is a 6 volt front mounted distributor early 1947 model i purchased the tune up kit from the ford dealership after looking at another forum post i noticed that the front mount and side mount are different in my research of the manuals i did not find the information about setting the points at 015 it appears that the setting of 025 is incorrect bruce i tried to open your reference to the differences but could not get it to open since you now have my email address could you possible sent me a copy of the article so that i can put it in my binder with the repairmaintenance manuals that i have on the ford 8n thanks log in to reply no emailken

me dell jr because i was a little bit terse to someone which maybe i shouldnt have been but i always felt that you can agree to disagree as long as you dont make it a personal attack  the tiffs we have here are usually over ideologies and not personalities  a couple cold beers and all is well again  there are times i read one of bruces posts and think he is going overboard but then i realise two things  one is he does follow through to solve the problem no matter how long it takes  and two sometimes the questions sounds cut and dry but 612 frontside yearmodel fills in the missing piece of the solution  usually the sarcasm comes on the second reply and it gets the poster to stop and actually thinklearn about the topic instead of fix it and forget it  teach a man to fish type deal  i still get a grin on my face when i see hobo telling someone they would be better dropping the hydraulic pump to clean it  after twenty rounds of sparring i understood the pros and cons of debris floating around  i still owe him a box of shop rags  he he  but it never got personal  heated yes  personal no  log in to reply no emailjmor02052010 221418report to moderator re thats why i dont fly

the 15 how do i adjust the distributor to get a wider gap dont care what voltage or even if its a ford  to answer your question  if you are trying to get 025 and they will not open that far check to see what the gap is on each lobe and if the gap changes if you pushpull the shaft  you could have worn lobes  worn bushings or defective points with a short rubbing block  try the old points and see if they were getting the 025 gap  log in to reply no emailjmor02052010 145752report to moderator re 8n distributor point setting in reply to mr in mn 02052010 094334jack ss said quoted from post at

in reply to mo c 02052010 094334so we are to assume this is a late 8n with a sidemount distributor since you are trying to get a point gap of 025 you are setting them with the rubbing block of the points on the high point of a cam lobe right log in to reply no emailold02052010 102230report to moderator re 8n distributor point setting in reply to mo c 02052010 094334bet you got your self a set of them cheap junk tsc points that are not worth the  to even go look at them take them back and buy a good set of points like blue streak or bw also and this is important is yours a side mount or front mount distributor only the side mounts are set at 0025 and the front mounts are set at 0015 set either one wrong and they will not run well if at all and as bruce says more info for use to be able to help you with out use guessing what you may or may not have and that in turn can lead to wrong answers log in to reply no emailbruce va02052010 095548report to moderator re 8n distributor point setting in reply to mo c 02052010 094334when you ask a question here it’s usually a good idea to tell us1 the model of your tractor 2n 9n 8n naa etc2 if it is 6v or 12v3 if it’s an n if the distributor is on the front or side of the engine4 if it has any major parts that are not oem such as electronic ignition a side coil on a front distributor etc troubleshooting is different depending on the model of the tractor voltage ignition system  distributor placement the point gap is different on the front  side distributors so is setting the timing when you post back w enough info for us to answer your question also tell us where you got the points  the brand name50 tips log in to reply no emailannoyed of bruce02052010 122834report to moderator re 8n distributor point setting in reply to bruce va 02052010 095548bruce you must think you are some kind of genius because every time some one asks a question without giving you all the information you need you respond the same way every time with the list i think that your list of required information is a joke and that you should stop posting if that is all you are going to post its annoying and i have seen people answer questions

of bruce 02052010 122834i have to agree with the others having all the info up front makes it much easier to answer the questions without typing out all the possible configurations at least bruces

122834well what bruce says is 100 correct and with out the info on a person tractor like front or side mount 6 or 12 volts etc etc etc it is hard for us to be able to help them just because bruce may have it set up so he can answer the same way is just fine just think if you went to see a doctor and you told him i hurt and that was it then what could he do but give you a pill which probably would not help the real problem so back off jack ss log in to reply no emailjack ss02052010 142353report to moderator re 8n distributor point setting in reply to old 02052010 132642i just went out to where
