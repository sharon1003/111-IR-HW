2007 at 843 am 2bilbob wellknown member afaik asbestos is only a problem if you are removing it again afaik theres no liability or need to remove it if its in and causing no harm as long as the ceiling is in good condition i dont see why you would need to remove it if toilet seats are cleaner than the kitchen work surface why not make tea on the lavvy xbl spinal flap feb 16 2007 at 845 am 3joe90s dad banned you can even do it yourself if youre a competent diyer hire an asbestos skip buy disposable suits and p2 masks keep the whole garage roof wet with a hose and remove each panel intact by removing or cutting the fixings alternatively paint it over feb 16 2007 at 900 am 4achy active member wed want to remove it as its a bit shabby and wed want to put spotlights etc in so removing is our only route feb 16 2007 at 911 am 5dunwa active member there used to be a myth that asbestos cement white asbestos was safe to handle as long as you didnt break or cut it i belive this

2007 at 1006 am 8drskhaled active member personally i wouldnt go near broken asbestos with a barge pole i used to work in southampton where there was alot of asbestos workers they were in direct contact with the stuff alot of them developed asbestosis and a type of cancer called mesothelioma this was many years after the inhalation of the dust rarely even their poor wives would sometimes catch it from washing the clothes they worked in certainly there are different types of asbestos some more dangerous than others and the asbestos in your house is safe if left alone however breaking it up yourself would not be good idea even if the absolute risk is tiny why take it my rockband 2 progress so far guitar expert 449451 damned caprici diablo drum expert warmup 4040 apprentice 3636

my neighbour was told by our council that they would dispose of it for free as long as he dismantled and double bagged the panels feb 16 2007 at 1028 am 10achy active member i wouldnt got down the diy removal route anyway its internal like a platerboard celing not corrugated i just wondered if anyone had had it removed and how much it cost ive heard of some horror stories with places charging about 8k which would pretty much blow the garage conversion budget before we even got started feb 16 2007 at 1125 am 11bilbob wellknown member if the ceiling in the garage is high enough forget about it being shabby just fit a lowered ceiling if toilet seats are cleaner than the kitchen work surface why not make tea on the lavvy xbl spinal flap feb 16 2007 at 1133 am 12achy active member nope ceiling is already low feb 16 2007 at 1141 am 13bilbob wellknown member then kneel down man crikey some poeple if toilet seats are cleaner than the kitchen work surface why not make tea on the lavvy xbl spinal flap feb 16 2007 at 104 pm 14neilneil active membergenerally the advice is leave asbestos where it is asbestos is perfectly safe left undisturbed i would only attempt to diy remove asbestos if it was sheets that could be unbolted like on a garage roof if removal requires any cutting then i would not attempt a diy job unfortunately if you need to cut or break it out then that is when the fibres are released into the air and specalist work is needed the cost of a professional removal could vary greatly on the friability dust creation when broken of the particular asbestos on site the contractor will have to control that dust probably moreso if you intent on the room being livable i would also not consider leaving it there and just cutting holes in it myself for ceiling lights neil

of risk people overreact when they hear about asbestos but handlebreathe all sorts of other carcinogens day in day out seek professional advice do not trust internet hearsay of course do your research but at the same time dont just listen to some asbestos removal companies who will fleece you for thousands of pounds with their scare tactics mod edit this post is the private opinion of jo90s dad as a private individual feb 16 2007 at 257 pm 16mylo wellknown member sorry but having lost my grandfather because of the lack of knowledge about asbestos i treat the subject very seriously it only takes a single fibre feb 16 2007 at 406 pm 17ko threads wellknown member captain black offline my dad now 75 worked for years cutting up white asbestos he recalls times when rooms were thick with dust so thick that you couldnt see more than a few inches at times no masks nothing my dads breathing is very very wheezy most of the guys he worked with nearly all died of breathing related problems to take it down is big money the stuff is dangerous not a diy job if cuttings involved feb 16 2007 at 532 pm 18neilios distinguished member get the pros in building sites are closed down when this stuff is found trust me im in the trade  and a word to joe last time you gave dodgy advice on working on gas and now asbestos maybe you have a problem with tradesmen but what your suggesting is dangerous you have not converted a man because you have silenced him feb 16 2007 at 608 pm 19p6410guest hiif it is of any help we got a specialist firm in to remove cementitous fibre panels asbestos  there are 3 types and any specialist firm will carry out sample testfrom a garage ceiling and it cost £850 which included an air test upon completionall the time it is inert it is ok but i would not think of even touching it feb 16 2007 at 846 pm 20nictry wellknown member we chose to have all our ceilings removed when we bought our property as they had clearly raised the issue of asbestos ceilings when we had the full survey done we got quotes from a couple of pro companies specialising in this work which included site surveys afterwards air quality etc etc we had 7 rooms done and total cost was £5000 which we did manage to negotiate in the price of the house before we bought but that seemed to be a ball park figure from discussions we had with the surveyor and others feb 16 2007 at 847 pm 21nictry

well but we chose to leave that but the quote from the same company we used for the house ceilings was £800 so seems to match well with the above posters figuresfeb 16 2007 at 849 pm 22nictry

good condition i dont see why you would need to remove it and what about when you decide to change the lights or the kids want a hook screwed in so they can hang a mobileteddy storage net etc etc sorry but my view was if i was buying a house which my kids were going to live in i wasnt prepared to even consider the possibility of infecting their lungs with something proven to be potentially fatal in the future 40 yrs or not feb 16 2007 at 858 pm 23woodywizz distinguished member when we moved into our house 1930s there was a delapidated garage on one side of the garden  with corrugated asbestos roof and asbestos sidepanels luckily one of my wifes mates husbands was a professional asbestos remover  he charged me £500 for complete removal of the garage  though he said his firm would have charged about £25k matt samsung ue55h8000  samsung ue46d8000  sony strd1050 amp  tannoy hts101 51  canon 500d with a few lenses psn woodywizz my flick r feb 16 2007 at 906 pm 24p6410guest prefabricated cementitious profiled roof panels on a pre 1992 garages again should be removed by specialist believe me as soon as you disturb the panels you will see the fibres floating in the air feb

represent those of the avforums or its associated websites feb 16 2007 at 1124 pm 26mrwactive member i agree with the get professional advice theme im involved in ceiling installation work in schools some of which have asbestos in the ceilings as soon as asbestos is found work stops and we get the professionals in 1 do not risk yours and your familys health 2 get 3 quotes from asbestos removal companies 3 get it removed properly 4 the alternative to removal is to get the asbestos company to make the holes that you need asbestos is only a problem when you release the fibres so breakingsawingdrilling etc in response to an above post you will see fibres but these are not the ones that do damage as they are filtered out by the hairs in your nose etc the fibres that cause problems are too small to see with the naked eye and they go straight into your lungs where they do not degradebreak down etc i can go into more detail about the damage it does to you but from the rest of the thread i hope the message is clear thanks x 2 list panasonic 50pv500  xbox 360  moaning wife may 21 2009 at 622 pm 27angel cake standard member i have just started renting a property and
