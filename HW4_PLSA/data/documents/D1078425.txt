according to steve jobs with i cloud everything happens automatically and theres nothing new to learn cnetwhen the late steve jobs introduced i os 5 during his last keynote address in june he touted i cloud as something that just works and that users would have nothing to learn as it turns out he was right but only on his first point not only is there a lot to learn about i cloud but users have little control over it once they start so before you jump in its important to know a few things about it what is it if you dont quite understand i cloud youre not alone even apple hasnt done the best job of explaining iti cloud makes life easier for users at a potentially large expense in terms of the internet bandwidth and possibly personal privacy screenshot by dong ngocnetin a nutshell i cloud is more than just a cloud storage solution that gives you the first 5gb of storage for free you can use it to store songs apps and ebooks youve purchased from the i tunes app store or photos shot with your device on apples servers it also pushes that data to up to 10 i couldenabled mobile devices and computers running i tunes 105 or later that belong to the same apple id account so for example when you download an app on one i device that app will also be downloaded to your i phone i pod touch and to your computer for the most part its all pushed in real time with the speed depending on the internet connection so by replacing the old way of syncing your mobile devices with a computer one at a time you can keep your digital library updated as soon as you download a new song as far as convenience goes this seems to be a genius solution however youll pay a potentially hefty price for the privilege the abuse of internet data and bandwidth lets say you want to download a game thats 20mb which is pretty small as mobile apps go in the past you downloaded it to your computer using i tunes then synced it to your i phone i pod touch or i pad by plugging the devices into the computer or if you chose to download directly to an i device you could transfer that app back to i tunes before syncing to other devices this way no matter how many i os devices you wanted to put the game on you just needed to use only 20mb of your internet bandwidth for the initial download turning the automatic download setting on within i tunes means that apps songs and ebooks will be redownloaded on the computer you can save bandwidth by turning these off plug the i os device in and choose transfer purchases screenshot by dong ngocnetnow with i cloud this changes dramatically lets say that you have an i pad an i phone an i pod touch and a mac book pro all with i cloud turned on once you have started downloading the 20mb i os game on one of these devices the same game will be downloaded to the other three making the total internet data needed 80mb the data concern aside youll probably find this automatic downloading very cooli didat first until you realize that there are four concurrent downloads instead of just one going through the pipe this means that your internet connection will also be significantly slower for other use now lets imagine that you intend to download about 20mb worth of apps songs and books from the app store per day 20mb is equal to about six songs by the way with i cloud your data use jumps to 80mb per day or 2400mb about 24gb a monthan excessive amount that 24gb is more than the firsttier data cap that most wireless carriers impose on a mobile cellular hotspot router such as the tmobile sonic 4g mobile hot spot and the verizon 4g lte mobile hotspot schlc11 so watch out when youre on the road with these i os devices especially if you like snapping photos with your i phone more on this below on i os devices you can turn off certain download types from the app store to minimize internet use screenshot by dong ngocnetnote that when you use a mobile cellular router the router creates a small wifi network for the other mobile devices to connect to and share internet access but remember that youre still using a carriers data network to access the internet so any device connected to a router will still eat up your mobile routers data allowance including those you have set not to use cellular data even while at home where your internet provider offers a high monthly cap such as comcasts 250gb  i cloud could still put a strain on your connectioni cloud also allows you to sync photos that you take across i devices via photo stream yet because these features also need to use the internet to upload the data from one device before pushing it to others they can be even bigger bandwidth killers with i cloud youll use much more internet data and bandwidth than you would normally do to get the same tasks done on average each photo taken by an i device is about 2mb in size so if you take 10 photos per day the total monthly upload will be about 600mb and keep in mind that this amount gets progressively larger if you have multiple people in the family using multiple i devices for snapping photos and what would happen if different people shared one apple id account their privacy might be at risk when sharing the same apple id with others turning photo stream off will not just help save internet bandwidth but also the risk of sharing something that causes embarrassment screenshot by dong ngocnetthe risk of sharing sensitive information i os devices like the i phone and i pad are designed to build a personal relationship between the product and the user unlike a pc they dont support multiple profiles which is why some families buy multiple tablets rather than share one device even with multiple devices families may still share a single apple id this saves them from having to buy the same app more than once parents can monitor which apps their children use and they can use one find my phone app to know the whereabouts of one another before i cloud this sharing scenario worked well because regardless of how many i devices a family has each member could pick and choose which apps he or she wanted on the device when syncing with a pc with i cloud however thats no longer the case anything you buy for yourself will be downloaded on all of the devices instantly so if youre using the same apple id there may be times when books or songs not appropriate for kids will end up on their devices this could becomes even more embarrassing with photo stream which as mentioned above automatically upload photos taken by one device and pushes them to all the others note that when you turn on the i clouds photo stream feature even photos taken before that will be uploaded from the device and downloaded to others that share the same apple id account what you can do to keep things in check now that its pretty obvious that i cloud offers convenience at the expense of excessive use of the internet and potential risk of privacy there are few ways for you to keep it under control using i tunes wifi sync is a great way to keep your i os devices synced without using the internet screenshot by dong ngocnetuse automatic download selectively turn off types of automatic downloads that are not important to you for example you probably dont need to use the automatic download for ebooks on the i pod touch if you only use your i pad to read books also note that your i devices have different amounts of storage space your 8gb i phone cant hold everything you want to put on your 64gb i pad so dont fill it with unnecessary downloads opt to use i tunes wifi sync instead of i cloud check out this detailed i tunes wifi sync how to post  i tunes wifi sync allows you to download purchases from the apple store to one computer then sync them with other i os devices via your local wifi network it basically works the same as plugging the i devices to a computer without actually plugging it in use the traditional pluggedin to sync method this works especially well for those who use the computer to charge the device anyway note that though more convenient syncing using i cloud is not always faster than the alternative ways this is especially true for those with a slow internet connection in regard to privacy its best not to share your apple id account with others if you can afford it its also a good idea to use a separate i cloud account from the apple id account and dont lend others your i devices that share the same i cloud account you should too consider turning off photo stream or just be aware that photos you take with your device can be seen by others maybe in the future apple will offer a way for users to disable this feature on certain photos in all fairness this doesnt mean that i cloud is not a great feature it really is and you should definitely turn it on for nondataintensive applications like contacts calendars bookmarks and notes however like all online storagebased services you need to exert more control over it or risk finding yourself paying more than you should or even worse
