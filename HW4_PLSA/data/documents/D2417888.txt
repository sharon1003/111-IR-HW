206 am may 3 2015john eligon‘i outboxed him’the fight here at the mgm grand garden arena was vintage mayweather he ducked under pacquiao’s flurries he sidehopped out of the corner when his opponent attempted to lunge at him and every now and then mayweather thrust his right fist square into pacquiao’s skull or swept his left glove across the side of his face as if clawing skin from pacquiao’s cheek while mayweather 480 had been prone in recent fights to standing in the middle of the ring and scrapping it out with his opponents he clearly reverted to his old ways on saturday night perhaps a sign of his respect for the threat that pacquiao 5762 posed to his undefeated record the casual fan may not have liked it but this was a boxing aficionado’s tactical dream“i outboxed him” mayweather said after the fight “i wasn’t getting hit with a lot of shots until i sat right there in the pocket we did what we had to do tonight”while mayweather won a unanimous decision by a large margin on the final scorecards — 118110 on one 116112 on the other two — the fight actually did not appear easy to score pacquiao spent much of the night stalking forward toward mayweather while the undefeated champion tapdanced around the ring in a few instances pacquiao cornered mayweather and unleashed punches in waves but mayweather either grabbed ahold of pacquiao or slid out of the way the fans booed regularly when mayweather would hold pacquiao or when he would backpedal away from the action so while it may have looked and sounded like pacquiao was doing damage to mayweather the judges were forced to look closely tune out the noise and determine whether pacquiao was indeed scoring against mayweather“i thought i caught him many more times than he caught me” pacquiao said “i was never hurt”in fact however it was mayweather who threw and connected more punches according to compu box fight stats mayweather landed 148 of 435 punches 34 percent while pacquiao landed just 81 of 429 19 percent
