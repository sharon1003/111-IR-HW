wildlife tip using moth balls as a deterrent  you have many choices when it comes to getting rid of rodents there are traps repellents poisons exterminators animal control specialists and even predators moth balls as a deterrent are one of the most popular choices but unfortunately those who use it most of the time will have to get a plan b to get rid of rodents the reason is that repellents are not the best way to get rid of rodents in fact it may be one of the least effective methods the reason is not that rodents are ok with moth balls but rather that they can avoid them the fact that the rodent does not have to be in the same small area with the moth balls makes them ineffective think of someone taking off smelly shoes and leaving them in one room all you have to do is walk to the next room and you will not even know that the sneakers are there you can not place moth balls all around your home because they actually are toxic to small animals if you have pets or small children then you should never use mothballs as there is always a risk they will get to them salem or wildlife news clip is it safe to feed a baby opossum you found humans adore animals and especially the young ones it is therefore a normal reaction to feel the need to help a baby opossum once you have found it however you need to be cautious as opossums are known to be disease carriers how to proceed when you find a baby opossum greatly depends on the circumstances that surround it baby opossums do not always stay far from the mother and you need to determine whether the opossum is actually alone or not sometimes the opossums can be orphaned and this may be evident by the foul smell of the mother or the body of the mother lying close by in such a case the baby opossum does need help you also need to look for the signs as to whether the animal is sick or not you have to look out for signs in the behavior of the young one and the physical appearance especially the eyes and the skin if it sickly you will definitely not want to handle it leave that to the wildlife removal specialist to be on the safe side it is not advisable to feed the baby opossum you should call wildlife services or rehabilitators who will take the animal in and take care of it until such a time that it is ready to survive in the wild all alone the rehabilitators know what to feed the animal and the kind of environment to put it in they also know the kind of care that the animal needs and if it needs any medical attention it will be administered after it is rescued there are some things that you can do before the wildlife rehabilitators get to you you can wear protective clothing including gloves and catch the opossum if you have a cage you can put it in and feed it from there a cage is the best option since the opossum will still be able to breathe without any difficulty if you do not have a cage you can create a hospitable space within a box and pierce holes all around to ventilate it
