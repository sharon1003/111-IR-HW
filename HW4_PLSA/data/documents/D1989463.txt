the devins advocate who is starlordâ€™s father the guardians of the galaxy movie may be taking a very different path than the comics by devin faraci aug 03 2014slight spoilers for guardians of the galaxy follow at the very end of guardians of the galaxy nova prime tells peter quill that theyve discovered something about his physiology hes only halfterran his mom who we saw on her death bed at the beginning of the film was from earth but his dad was something nonterrestrial and something more ancient than the nova corps had ever seen this comes on the heels of the revelation that quill had been kidnapped by the ravagers to deliver the boy to his father who yondu calls a jackass that leaves a small mystery for guardians 2 who is quills dad this reflects the marvel comics character of starlord but i somehow doubt the movies will be following the same path as the books in the comics quills alien dad ends up being json seriously king of the planet spartax spartax is the home of the spartoi people who are pretty much just humans jsons not much of a character although recent marvel comics  in anticipation of the guardians movie  have been giving him more panel time still its unlikely that guardians 2 is going to reveal that quills dad is json for one thing the spartoi arent particularly ancient or interesting for another his mom tells the boy that his dad was an angel a being of pure light that doesnt gibe with the spartoi being your standard space people although i did briefly entertain the idea that she was talking about the tractor beam that we see the ravagers use to pick up quill later  a tractor beam that by the way really reminds me of the rainbow bridge effect from the thor films the reality though is that setting this up as a mystery when the information is available on wikipedia doesnt make a lot of sense especially considering how clumsily it was set up in the film so who is starlords dad talking to james gunn at the guardians of the galaxy junket he told me only four people know himself kevin feige michael rooker and sean gunn who played kraglin yondus number two if it was json many more people would know so im pretty sure we can definitively rule out spartax as quills secret origin that leaves us with some possibilities from the comics  although theres no guarantee that gunn is going to the comics for this at all one possibility is that hes a cosmic being if the marvel cinematic universe is going to follow the comics thanos is in love with the anthropomorphic embodiment of death a whole new level of weird that needs to be introduced having quills dad be another one of these nextlevel beings would help ease the introduction could eternity or lord order or the inbetweener have become corporeal and sired quill it does seem unlikely and it would probably make quill way way too weird and too close to a jesus figure or maybe his dad is an eternal guardians introduces the celestials the giant race of ancient beings who travel the galaxy guiding and ending evolution on many planets i believe that in guardians we see the celestial known as arishem the judge in the comics the celestials came to earth and created the eternals the first race of intelligent life on earth in the process they also created the deviants a grotesque race of deformed and evil monsters the eternals acted as protectors of the earth and they eventually built a colony off world there the scientist kronos engaged in experiments that went wrong turning himself into an energy being and giving his people godlike powers it should be noted that kronos is actually thanos grandfather so having quill be halfeternal is a nice way to tie him in with the larger threat facing the entire marvel cinematic universe the eternals also created the inhumans a group of secretive superpowered beings on earth who many have speculated will be the mcus analogue for mutants actually the kree created the inhumans but were inspired to do so after experimenting on a captured eternal im getting all my ancient astronaut stuff mixed up making quill halfeternal opens up a lot of doors for the mcu the eternals are ancient  most of the active eternals are more than 3000 years old  and their direct connection to the celestials makes them odd and intriguing its actually worth noting that the celestials were introduced in the eternals 1 in 1976 of the eternals the character most likely to be quills dad is eros aka starfox his powers give him control over the emotions of others and he usually uses these powers to seduce women if this sounds like date rape it sort of is and he was eventually brought up on charges of sexual assault on earth his pelvic sorcery could certainly have been passed on to quill and its worth noting ive heard starfox after being on the run for his crimes is coming back to the marvel comics universe a geeky sidenote it would be amazing if the eternals a really lesserknown part of the marvel universe made it to the big screen before the new gods dcs pantheon of cosmic beings jack kirby created both but he created the eternals only after his fourth world saga at dc had been canceled thanos himself is more or less a knockoff of kirbys darkseid and the eternals picked up a lot of the thematic concerns kirby had in his new gods books my sources tell me not to expect darkseid in the dc movieverse until justice league 2 so that means a guardians 2 in 2017 would definitely have the eternals beating the new gods to big screens could quills dad be adam warlock a cosmic heavyhitter whose comic book appearances almost always have him going against thanos maybe but only if warlock is significantly changed from the comics in the comics he is originally him an artificially created perfect human who ends up in control of one of the infinity gems and in fact is the center of the story that revealed their existence adam warlock was born out of a cocoon on earth and that cocoon was visible in the collectors museum again gunn would have to be changing up warlock in big ways to make him work as quills dad theres one other possibility when it comes to quills father what if hes the beyonder this is really really unlikely but the idea of the dad being an angel and a being of pure light certainly fits in with the beyonders natural state it took human male form in secret wars ii and was only defeated when he chose to put himself in a mortal body and was then killed truthfully the beyonder is so powerful  hes god basically  that hiring someone to pick up his son doesnt make a lot of sense but how bizarre would that be having the beyonder show up in the mcu and open the door for a secret wars movie related product the eternals book 1book  marvel9888 on amazon related itemsguardians of
