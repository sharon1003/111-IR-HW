marriott status match silver gold  platinum – taste of silver gold or platinumby john ollila  sep 7 2012 25 comments6facebook6twitter reddit email marriott recently changed their status match requirements the old one was based on number of nights stayed during the match period now the requirement is based on stays note that one stay can consist of multiple nights and would only count as one stay this new requirement is easier to those that can switch between marriott branded hotels and have one night stays you can get a temporarily match to silver gold or platinum status with marriott rewards and then you have at minimum three months to complete the requirements of the challenge you requestedwere targeted for the normal silver status requirements is 10 nights gold status requirement is 50 nights and platinum status 75 nights within a calendar year hyatt hilton and club carlson have similar programs available you can read about starwood options here hyatt’s procedures here hilton options here and finally club carlson one here the new marriott taste of silvergoldplatinum requirements are1 silver 3 stays during three month period  the month when you sign up2 gold 6 stays during three month period  the month when you sign up3 platinum 9 during three month period  the month when you sign up marriott uses somewhat interchangeably words taste of silvergoldplatinum status match and challenge when it comes to accelerating the status with the program the key is to start the challenge after the 1 st of the month if you start the taste of challenge on september 1 st you have only september october and november to complete it by starting september 5 th you would have not only september october and november but also december to complete it marriott will give you an instant silver gold or platinum status for the duration of the taste of period and will extend it upon completion of the required number of nights if you fail to successfully complete the challenge you can do it again after 12 months from the ending of the challenge period the best time to apply for a challenge would be right at the beginning of the month then you would have the temporarily silver gold or platinum status close to 4 months and if you successfully completed the challenge the status would be valid until february 2014 then in 2014 you can probably do another taste of silvergoldplatinum or simply buy back the goldplatinum status for additional year marriott rewards has offered every year a chance to buy back the previous status if you have been downgraded you can read more about the process on a recent piece that i wrote how to request you can call your local marriott rewards customer service number i would however rather request the challenge by email this way you have everything in writing and there is no chance of miscommunication or misunderstanding the requirements marriott tends to be quite fast at replying to emails email addresses that you can use for requesting challenge are rewardsproceduresmarriottcom marriottconciergemarriottcom or elitemembermarriottcom what if i am denied the challenge that i requested there are few reasons that marriott tend to give when they are denying the challenge1 account not eligible2 not enough commitment to have marriott stays3 no forward bookings all these are rather easy to argue if you are switching from another chain it is rather obvious that you don’t have prior stay history with marriott or have future marriott bookings you can always reiterate the number of stays that you have had with competing chains and that it would be difficult to switch to marriott if you don’t get the elite status benefits during the “transitioning” period you may get different answer depending what email address you use andor if you call marriott if the answer you received is not to your liking it doesn’t hurt to contact marriott using other contact channel ie phone conclusion it is normally rather easy to get a status match challenge from marriott the number of stays to get platinum status extended is only 9 during the month you sign up  3 full months if you start the challenge at the beginning of the month you have close to four months to complete it trying to requalify the hard way is somewhat problematic though marriott requires 75 nights during a calendar year and only paid nights count if you don’t requalify and would prefer maintaining the status you can always use the buy back your statusoffer from marriott or to do another challenge make sure that you have signed up
