whom it may concern for over 100 years fire lookouts have been a mainstay in fire suppression and forest management in the united states strategically placed fire lookouts and the people who work in them have performed the crucial service of early fire detection operated as vital communications liaisons and in many cases tourist information centers and tourist destinations some fire lookout personnel such as those dedicated people who have worked at the needles and buck rock lookouts have even served uniquely as invaluable usda forest service ambassadors and spokespersons the needles fire lookout for almost threequarters of a century has been one of the premier representatives of all that is positive and good about public land management since 1937 the needles fire cab has served the public interest helped to suppress catastrophic fires been a vital communications link for foresters been a spectacular tourist destination for multiple generations and been a big part and participant in the natural and climbing history of the southern sierra the history of the needles fire lookout is well known among members of the forest service it would be rare to find a forester in southern and central california who hasn’t been to the needles or heard of it its primary function as a fire lookout is obvious and it served diligently in that capacity for 74 years during its tenure as one of the most uniquely placed fire lookouts it also became a valuable communications link for forest personnel fire suppression units and even at times emergency response units and law enforcement the location of the needles fire cab placed high on one of the most spectacular rock formations in america set it apart as a must see must visit must experience piece of public architecture and history the needles fire cab was not just a fire lookout and it was more than a popular tourist destination for more than a few generations of outdoor enthusiasts the two and onehalf mile scenic hike was a legacy experience many generations of children had their first outdoor experience hiking out to visit “that little gray castle in the sky” many older people today had a formative experience trailing behind their parents immersed wideeyed in the wonder of that magical place climbing the stairs stepping on to the catwalk atop the highest point of the needles rock formation and taking in the astounding view that might otherwise only be had by raptors ringtail cats and few daredevil rock climbers making a yearly pilgrimage to the needles has become a tradition for many like john muir wishing to pass the experience on to future generations many lovers of the breathtaking beauty of the outdoors brought their children and grandchildren to the needles yearafteryear it would be difficult to match such a formative experience so many times have people made the journey to the needles spirits elevated and soaring like the peregrine falcons that dive and lord over the rocks and souls embraced by this unique experience unlike any other many of the old lookouts have been abandoned or replaced by technology that can do as good a job at fire detection as any human being many of the old lookouts have been perched on high obscure and mundane overlooks that although functional in their day were not spectacular or breathtaking to those who seldom visited them very few fire lookouts have been worthy of the word of mouth reputation magazine articles newspaper articles or the television coverage the needles has garnered over the decades the needles has captured the attention of many and fueled the imaginations of all who have been there seen it or read about it the needles has served the people of the united states well over its 74 year history an antenna and webcam could do a good enough job of detecting fires but an antenna and a webcam could never do the ambassadorship the public relations the character building the history talk or the awakening of the love of the outdoors that the old needles fire lookout has done with a pleasant representative there each summer day to tell stories show people what is out there and help them reflect on the awesome majesty within their view the needles has provided more than anyone expected the tax payers who paid for it generations ago had no idea that they were creating a living museum a goodwill ambassador’s post a comfort station a nature preserve a climber’s mecca and a shrine to the workers of the ccc and wpa of the great depression the needles was and still could be a great taxpayer investment the needles must be restored for those who have come to love it for those want to see their tax dollars spent on meaningful endeavors that reinforce and support real american values and for future generations of people who deserve to share in the unique experience that previous generations were so lucky to have please rebuild the needles fire lookout use the resources you have the resources that are being offered to you and the resources that will be mustered if you commit to this project i urge you to make a public announcement and file a press release stating that the forest service will rebuild the fire lookout at the needles sincerely patrick paul former southern sierra climbers’ association president rock climber outdoor enthusiast and lover of nature and the needles experience  from denise alonzo public affairs update 8262011 future of needles fire lookout pending sequoia national forest the needles fire lookout tower located in the western divide ranger district within giant sequoia national monument sequoia national forest was destroyed in a structure fire on july 28 2011 no one was injured in this tragic event the fire in the tower and multiple debriscaused fires on the ground have been suppressed by firefighters now the question on everybody’s mind is whether the forest service will rebuild the tower or not and if yes what will it take “i have been contacted by quite a few people who have voiced their interest and support in seeing the tower rebuilt” stated priscilla summers western divide district ranger “the first priority is to remove the charred debris from the top of the rock” stated summers some of the materials in or under the tower that burned were batteries and propane tanks that charged radios and other communication devices in the tower these items some of which are considered hazardous material need to be removed in a safe manner and could take until the end of september to complete forest officials will continue to keep the area adjacent to the rock formation where the tower was perched closed for public safety until the charred debris can be safely removed and hauled away the closure area is within onequarter mile circle of where the tower once sat including the formation popular for rock climbers known as “the magician” the needles road 21s05 and trail 32e22 that leads to the site has been reopened for hikers and rock climbers to access the area outside this closure there are many steps to consider and complete should the forest service propose to construct a new tower an assessment of the rock and foundation where the tower once sat would be necessary to determine its integrity to support a new structure new building requirements would need to be researched and considered in any design an environmental analysis and documentation with public review would be required funding for a replacement tower and the planning efforts it would require to complete will be considered “all of this cannot be completed quickly” stated summers the lookout tower was constructed in 193738 by the civilian conservation corps atop the rock formation at 8245 feet a forest service employee stationed in the tower was responsible for detecting fires and relaying radio messages to a dispatcher who in turn sent firefighters and support equipment to extinguish the reported fire the employee who worked in the needles tower has been reassigned to another lookout tower on the district needles overlooked the kern river drainage mt whitney olancha peak farewell gap and dome rock the tower was the primary communication line for persons in the backcountry where cell phones do not work the needles lookout tower was one of the most popular places to visit on the western divide ranger district “the loss of this historic landmark and the communication it provided to backcountry travelers is significant” stated summers “i ask for everyone’s patience and understanding as we move through the steps required to consider a rebuild of the tower similar to other projects proposed on the national forest whatever action we take at the site will have to go through an extensive evaluation process under the national environmental policy act nepa even though it the tower was there historically it does not exempt us from having to conduct analysis and public involvement for any proposed actions at the site”  from our executive director kathy allison update 8242011 the current priority for the forest service is the cleanup and safe removal of what remains of the fire lookout zone archaeologist linn gassaway hiked out to the rock the week following the fire and assessed the situation although most everything was destroyed linn discovered a few pieces of pottery and part of the osborn firefinder while sifting through the rubble the wood stove was still standing in place the forest service has been receiving many phone calls and emails regarding the future of the needles with many people advocating to rebuild the buck rock foundation brf is assisting the forest with documentation of any interest or comments regarding the needles please send your contact information to the brf buckrockinreachcom if you would like to be notified when the forest service puts the nepa together after a brief stay at her home in colorado fire watcher margee kelly is back in the saddle staffing jordan peak lookout for the western divide ranger district and plans on remaining there through the end of fire season she is overwhelmed by the outpouring of support and thanks those who have expressed their wellwishes her grandchildren and their cat are doing well  7292011 the needles lookout “porterville needles emergency traffic the roof of the lookout is on fire and i need immediate assistance” with those words margee kelly called in the most important smoke report of her career an ember from the wood stove landed on the shake roof of the needles fire lookout sparking a fire that quickly spread along the roof and eventually into the attic grabbing the fire extinguisher margee fought to put the fire out even climbing up on a ladder placed on the catwalk in an attempt to get closer to the blaze sequoia forest helicopter 522 launched from the peppermint helibase in a matter of minutes dropping several buckets of water on the structure in what margee calls “a heroic effort to save the lookout” unfortunately their efforts were in vain margee and her two grandchildren who were visiting her at the time escaped without injury and stood helpless as they watched their beloved tower succumb to the fire twenty four years of margee’s accumulated treasures went up in flame  collections of photos memorabilia newspaper clippings first edition authorautographed books a recently refurbished telescope pottery and so much more perished in the fire it is not surprising that there has been an overwhelming outpouring of concern for margee as well as questions about the future of the needles margee is taking some time to recover but hopes to continue working this summer staffing one of the unmanned fire towers on the western divide ranger district there is talk of organizing an effort to take up a collection to help replace some of the items she lost it is too soon to speculate about the intentions of the forest service to rebuild the lookout – it is a daunting task given current health and safety regulations codes redtape and location however there is already a substantial public outcry supporting the restoration of the lookout and we are hopeful those pleas will be recognized built by the ccc’s in 19371938 the needles was quite possibly the most impressively situated fire tower perched as it is on one of several granite needlelike domes rising up from the depths of the kern canyon recognized for its worldclass climbing the needles has long been a popular destination for adventurers from all over the world
