in 1976 mr bill was a clay figurine who was the star of a series of short skits that was meant to be a parody of kiddie shows he had a highpitched voice and usually met some kind of sadistically violent end at the hands of… well “mr hands” a pair of human hands complete with voiceover that would proceed to squash or dismember mr bill and his little clay friends eliciting mr bill’s trademark cry “ohhh nooooooooo…” tonight’s ods seems to be a perfect mimicry of one of those shorts except that mr hands this time is actually mrs hands allison who tortures mr bill for a minute or so before
