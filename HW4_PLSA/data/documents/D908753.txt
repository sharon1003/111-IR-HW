introduction welcome to the perfect stats guide for final fantasy ix this guide will help you achieve the highest possible combination of speed strength magic and spirit for all your characters perfecting stats in ff9 is no trivial matter the only way to permanently increase your characters stats is by leveling up while wearing statboosting equipment since the total number of levelups a character can get is limited the extent to which you can increase their stats is also limited for example even though strength and magic can theoretically grow to 99 its not possible to reach those values in normal gameplay no matter how much effort you put into it the key to getting the best stats is to equip your characters with carefully calculated sets of statboosting equipment when they level up to achieve perfect stats youll need to follow these basic steps pick your stat path ff9s stat system forces you to make tradeoffs between the four stat attributes and other achievements as such there can be many different interpretations of how stats should be perfected section 3 of this guide will help you make your choices and form your personal path avoid gaining levels most of the best statboosting gear only becomes available very late in the game so you must save as many levelups as possible until then in order to take full advantage of them no character should absorb any experience points before you can obtain all the necessary equipment unless theres no way to avoid it there are only three places where youre forced to absorb experience points the first is in evil forest after defeating plant brain you must avoid gaining levels in the forced battle against plant spiders by making sure only two of them are in the enemy party and their experience is divided among all four of your party members for 11 exp each the second place is in disc 3 in alexandria thats your last chance to defeat tantarian and receive 12585 exp if you choose to do so finally three consecutive forced battles in pandemonium will give you 26376 exp a piece which character absorbs the experience from each forced battle is a decision youll need to make for your stat path section 4 of this guide will help with this by showing you how much each character stands to lose if they take on the forced experience and by suggesting ways to minimize the total loss find all necessary equipment for each case covered in section 4 of this guide youll find a link to the exact sets of equipment that need to be equipped when your characters level up some setups will require rare and hardtoobtain items so be prepared to spend extra effort to find them all also keep in mind that some characters will leave your party immediately upon reaching bran bal and they dont return until the pandemonium battles make sure to equip them with the proper setup for pandemonium before you venture out of terra train your characters this is probably the easiest part but also takes the longest once you have chosen the stat path you want to take determined the strategy for distributing forced experience and found all the equipment you need all that remains is to grind your characters simply equip each item for exactly the prescribed number of levelups and youll achieve perfect stats when you reach level 99this guide will primarily focus on stat growth and equipment setups and wont go into walkthroughs battle strategies or item locations there are many highquality guides on game faqscom that cover those aspects of the game i highly recommend atomos199s excalibur ii perfect game guide to help you through the game without gaining levels plus practically anything else you might want to accomplish along the way rebirth flames equipment location list is also an excellent reference for finding every item you need2 stat growth mechanics the four stats that can be increased permanently in ff9 are speed spd strength str magic mag and spirit spr each character has a hardcoded set of base values that determine hisher initial stats at level 1 character spd base str base mag base spr base zidane 23 21 18 23dagger 21 14 23 17vivi 16 12 24 19steiner 18 24 12 21freya 20 20 16 22quina 14 18 20 11eiko 19 13 21 18amarant 22 22 13 15the effective stats of a character are determined by those initial values plus any increases from levels gained and equipment used21 growth formula according to terences discoveries outlined in kadfcs max stats faq on game faqscom the values of stats that you see in the games equip and status menus are calculated using the following formulas spd  spd base  lv  1  10   lv ups  0  spd eq bonus  32  spd eq curr str  str base  lv  3  10   lv ups  3  str eq bonus  32  str eq curr mag  mag base  lv  3  10   lv ups  3  mag eq bonus  32  mag eq curr spr  spr base  lv  3  20   lv ups  1  spr eq bonus  32  spr eq curr terms enclosed in square brackets are rounded down to the nearest whole number before they are added to the result  lv  is the current level of your character  lv ups  is the number of levels your character has gained since first joining your party the various  eq bonus  values reflect the total number of bonus points accumulated while training your character with statboosting equipment the various  eq curr  values represent the amount of stat boosts given by your characters currently equipped gear eq curr is only a temporary value if you change the items equipped on a character eq curr will also change to update your characters effective stats if you remove all your characters equipment eq curr will drop to 0 on the other hand any gain made to eq bonus is permanent every time your character gains a level a number of points equal to eq curr at the time is added to eq bonus points added to eq bonus accumulate through levelups and are never taken away for example lets say amarant was at level 10 when he first joined your party you train him to level 19 9 lv ups wearing only the bandana 1 spr followed by more training until level 33 14 lv ups wearing only the glass buckle 2 spr you then change his equipment to only a dark gear 3 spr at this point his spirit would be calculated as follows spr base  15 lv  33 lv ups  9  14  23 spr eq bonus  9  1  14  2  37 spr eq curr  3spr  15  33  3  20   23  1  37  32  3  15  4  1  3  23if spr or spd become greater than 50 they will be adjusted down to 50 if str or mag become greater than 99 they will be adjusted down to 99 due to the eikomarcus glitch eikos eq bonus and lv ups include both values gained by eiko herself plus those gained by marcus during his brief stay in your party in disc 2 as the formula suggests lv lv ups and eq bonus are the three quantities that contribute to permanent stat growth lv is effectively a constant it will always reach 99 for all characters lv ups can go as high as 98 or 196 for eiko if you use the eikomarcus glitch by having all your characters join your party at level 1 finally to maximize eq bonus your characters must have the best statraising equipment with every level they gain the fact that there are four stats to handle simultaneously complicates the issue of maximizing eq bonus many items grant bonuses to multiple stats at the same time and its not easy to find the right mix to achieve a balanced growth having stats limited by a maximum bonud and having numbers rounded down in the formulas also add to the complexity its not necessarily best to always greedily choose gear that simply gives the highest bonus22 statboosting equipment this table lists all equipment that gives bonus points to at least one stat also shown are the characters who can equip each item in this order zidane dagger vivi steiner freya quina eiko amarant marcus and whether each is available when you fight tantarian and in pandemonium an item with yes as its availability means its very timeconsuming to obtain and it wont be possible to get the excalibur ii if you spend the time to find

access to statboosting equipment how high each stat can become will depend on how you choose to play the game and distribute bonus points ultimately different people will prefer different styles so this guide will try to address the most common views and let you decide what you like best your choices for two main factors will determine the general approach to follow and five additional factors will have more targeted impact on specific characters31 stat priority this factor addresses how the meaning of maximize should be applied over the set of four stat values you can rank them according to their importance maximizing the most important ones first while sacrificing less important ones or you can consider the combined sum of all stats trading a small number of points from more important stats in exchange for a higher number of points to less important ones ordered approach use this option if you want to prioritize maximizing more important stats first even if it severely decreases the growth potential of less important stats the order of stats from most important to least important is spirit  strengthmagic primary  strengthmagic secondary  speed strength is the primary stat for zidane steiner freya and amarant magic is the primary stat for dagger vivi and eiko quina is a special case with several options you can choose from this will be covered below for all characters spirit is always ranked first because it affects a wide swath of battle mechanics and having the highest spirit makes a huge difference speed is ranked last because it has practically no effect due to how the games atb system behaves atomos199s excalibur ii perfect game guide has more details for why this ordering is chosen please refer to his guide if you want a more thorough explanation this option is arguably better in the practical sense its designed to give your characters the best performance in battles combined approach use this option if you want to get the highest sum when the value of all four stats are added together even if it means devoting growth to useless stats while preventing the most important ones from reaching their full potential usually there are multiple combinations that give the same maximal sum and among those combinations both this guide and the stats calculator will use the order of importance stated above to break ties this option is arguably better in the theoretical sense it gives you a higher overall number of points and is the most straight forward interpretation of the word maximize alternate approach if you like the idea of the ordered approach but dont agree with the order of importance or you want to use the combined approach on 23 stats while leaving the rest ordered then youll need to use the stats calculator to find optimized setups yourself this guide cant cover all the cases because there are too many ways to rank and combine the four stats32 final equipment this factor addresses whether temporary stat bonuses granted by final equipment should be considered in the calculations final equipment is the set of gear that you plan to equip after your characters have reached level 99 you might want your characters raw stats without wearing any final equipment to be perfected or you might want to leave some room for final equipment bonuses in the target calculations no final equipment use this option if you want to bring your characters stats to their highest possible values ignoring any equipment that may be used after reaching level 99 with this option your characters stats are guaranteed never to drop below their perfect target values if you use this along with the ordered approach for stat priority then all your characters spirit will stay at a uniform value of 50 on the other hand since spirit is capped at a maximum value of 50 characters whose spr is already maxed out will simply lose any spr bonus provided by their final equipment their effective stats while wearing any sprboosting final equipment will be lower than what you can otherwise achieve many of the games best gear such as robe of lords ribbon and protect ring provide a bonus to spirit recommended final equipment use this option if you want your characters stats to be a bit lower than their theoretical max while unequipped and rely on temporary bonuses from the recommended set of final equipment to bring their effective stats up to a perfect amount recommended final equipment is the set that provides the best combination of attack defense evade etc as well as elemental protection for your characters its what you would most likely choose to use in battle once your characters reach level 99 because theres less strain on raising spirit to 50 this option will allow other stats to grow higher on the other hand this will leave your characters perfect stats entirely dependent on their final equipment if you remove the equipment or switch to a weaker set stats will no longer look perfect if you choose to use a set that grants even higher bonuses than the recommended amount you still risk wasting those bonus points this table lists the recommended final equipment for all characters character weapon head arms body addon zidane ultima weapon circlet bracer brave suit protect ring dagger tiger racket circlet bracer robe of lords ribbon vivi mace of zeus circlet bracer robe of lords ribbon steiner

fork circlet bracer robe of lords protect ring  ribbon amarant rune claws circlet bracer brave suit protect ring note that you can only get one tiger racket so either dagger or eiko will have to settle for a weaker weapon if they are both in your active party steiner can switch to a weaker weapon if youre not getting the excalibur ii and can use tin armor if you got that item through synthesis quina should be given a protect ring if you value hisher strength more or a ribbon if you value hisher magic more none of these tweaks affects setups or strategies in this guide custom final equipment if you have a different idea for final equipment then youll need to do the extra work of using the stats calculator to figure out everyones setup and strategies due to the huge number of possible combinations that you can choose its impractical for this guide to list every individual case33 character and gameplayspecific choices these choices affect the availability of items in specific situations and the growth path of individual characters tantarian defeating tantarian will give you a copy of the rare item running shoes and the pleasure of having beaten a somewhat difficult optional boss it may also be one of your goals if youre playing a perfect game however this comes at the cost of one character gaining 17 levels early in disc 3 which can lead to a few points lost from that characters stats you can choose to fight tantarian and take the stat loss or skip it excalibur iithis item being steiners ultimate weapon and a trophy for completing a speed run may also be part of your goals as you play through the game getting it however puts you under a severe time constraint if you choose to get the excalibur ii youll have a much harder time collecting all the necessary statboosting items some items will be completely inaccessible under the time constraint which might force you to take higher stat losses finally the eikomarcus glitch cant be exploited to any meaningful extent under this time constraint you can decide if these disadvantages are worth trading for the sword quinas orientation not sexual this is where you decide whether strength or magic should be considered the primary stat for quina heshe is a mixed physical attacker and blue magic user although damage from hisher physical attacks is extremely random and damage from blue magic is rarely determined by the magic stat which one to maximize first is up to you this guide will also cover a third alternative a balanced approach which maximizes the sum of hisher str and mag while minimizing their difference so that both of these stats are raised as evenly as possible eikomarcus glitch its possible to raise eikos stats to unnaturally high levels by training marcus in disc 2 it reportedly takes about 150 hours of nonstop battles to take full advantage of this glitch ie raise marcus to level 99 do it if you think the time is worth it forced experience since there will be unavoidable experience from forced battles there will always be someone who must absorb the experience and sacrifice some of hisher stats in the process you will need to decide which characters you want to dispatch for each battle and the next section will give you all the information to make that decision4 optimal stat paths here is where youll find listings of optimal stats for every character and every choice described above each case will have a link pointing you to the equipment setup to use refer to the faq in section 51 to learn how to use the equipment setups at least one of your characters will inevitably gain levels during forced battles with tantarian or with amdusias abadon and shell dragon in pandemonium in most cases whoever gains those levels will also lose a few points from hisher perfect stats here youll also find information on how to distribute all the forced experience in order to minimize everyones stat loss as a general rule only one character should absorb the full exp from any single battle do this by putting everyone else in ko status before the battle ends this section is divided into four parts each one covering one common interpretation of perfect stats each part will then address any applicable character or gameplayspecific factors on a casebycase basis use these links to skip to the part relevant to your preferences

before you enter pandemonium up to a point where one of them is at least 26377 exp away from the next levelup this character wont level up during the pandemonium battles so you are free to equip

for suggesting this strategy5 frequently asked questions51 how do i use equipment setups the equipment setups given in this guide and the stats calculator contain a list of items that you need to equip in each situation heres an example of a setup for tantarian barbut bronze gloves or mythril gloves plate mail pearl rouge at any time head 57 barbut 24 kaiser helm arms 4 bronze gloves or dragon wrist or mythril gloves 77 venetia shield body 81 minervas plate addon 77 barette 4 pearl rouge the items under the for tantarian heading gives you the exact set of equipment your character should be wearing for that battle since you cant change equipment midbattle this will always be a single set equipment setups for pandemonium battles will appear the same way the items under the at any time heading come with a number that tells you how many levelups your character should gain while wearing that item in the example 57 barbut 24 kaiser helm means the character should gain 57 levels while wearing a barbut and gain another 24 levels wearing a kaiser helm an entry like 4 bronze gloves or dragon wrist or mythril gloves means you should gain a total of 4 levels while wearing any of those items your character must wear each of the listed items for exactly the specified number of levelups before reaching level 99 make sure your character is fully equipped any time you level up and as soon as an item has reached its number of levels exchange it immediately for a different one you can do the items in any order and you can substitute different items as long as the item you use has the same or better stat bonuses than the one youre supposed to have as an example one way to carry out the setup given above for freya is have freya join at level 1 and remain at level 1 until you find tantarian in disc 3 equip freya with barbut mythril gloves plate mail pearl rouge and any weapon you like before triggering the battle with tantarian defeat tantarian and have freya absorb all of its experience ko all other characters before the battle ends gaining 17 levels dont let freya gain any more levels until you get all the remaining equipment once you get all necessary equipment train freya so that she gains 57 levels wearing barbut venetia shield minervas plate and barette you can use any weapon you like gain another 20 levels wearing kaiser helm venetia shield minervas plate and barette gain 4 more levels wearing kaiser helm dragon wrist minervas plate and pearl rouge doing these steps will bring freya to level 99 and account for all required levelups for all items this will complete the equipment setup and give freya her target stats52 why dont the guide and the calculator give the same setups if you try to calculate some of the stat paths in the guide using the stat calculator you might find that the calculator doesnt always find the same setup as the one in the guide this is because i have manually tweaked some setups for a variety of reasons for example if the calculator returns a solution that requires a hardtofind item in pandemonium i could have chosen to find a different solution which doesnt need that item some setups could also have been manually simplified to reduce the number of times you need to switch equipment the tweaked solutions would be presented in the guide while the calculator has no way of offering those solutions automatically you can choose to follow any setup you like its only the final optimal stats that matter you might also find setups in atomos199s excalibur ii perfect game guide to be different from both this guide and the calculator this is because all the setups were found and tweaked at different times so they could have been adjusted in different ways53 can multiple characters split forced experience from a battle its possible to have multiple party members absorb the experience from a single battle doing this will reduce the maximum level anyone reaches and might theoretically reduce the impact on stats in practice however ive never found a case where this helps the reason has to do with the fact that characters at lower levels take fewer exp to level up dividing exp points among multiple party members will actually increase the total number of levelups you suffer take tantarian for example a character absorbing its full 12585 exp will gain 17 levels two characters sharing the exp will gain 14 levels each the benefits of one character avoiding 3 levelups is easily offset by the other one gaining 14 threeway or fourway divides are even worse54 can steiner get better stats by using defender in pandemonium no defender is available in bran bal which technically comes before pandemonium but steiner and dagger leave the party right before you enter the village and youll never get a chance to equip the sword before the forced battles55 how do i get robe of lords before pandemonium in a speed run this is probably the single hardest item to obtain in short you need to upgrade to a gold chocobo find yans and get virus status for all your party to avoid the upcoming exp and defeat ozma using your virusd level 1 party robe of lords can be stolen from ozma atomos199s excalibur ii perfect game guide on game faqscom will have more detailed strategies on how this can be realistically done other ways of obtaining robe of lords before pandemonium either exchanging for 10000 chocobo hot  cold points or stealing from quale are much more time consuming and arent feasible in an excalibur ii speed run6 mathematics behind the scenes this section gives an overview of all the theory and algorithms that go into finding optimal setups its written for those of you who are mathematically inclined and curious about how the calculator works however it isnt meant to be a comprehensive course on the subject and wont go into too much depth if you want to learn more about any particular topic mentioned in this section a web search is always a good place to begin the source code for the calculator written in java can be downloaded from httpletaoisageeknetff9statsff9statszip this is a standalone version that runs on any windows computer with java runtime environment version 6 or higher installed and doesnt include the web interface of the online version which requires a web server with servlet capabilities to run61 combinatorial optimization and linear programs the problem of optimizing stats in ff9 is one of combinatorial optimization  the goal is to find a combination of equipment to wear during levelups that optimizes the final outcome this type of problem is generally difficult to solve due to the enormous number of possible combinations as you would know if you ever tried solving it by hand for example if a character only had 5 different pieces of head gear to consider then the possible number of ways to distribute 98 levelups among those 5 items is 98  5  1  98  5  1  4249575 thats already much more than a person can handle in fact the number of possibilities becomes so high when all five types of equipment are considered that even a computer would take millions of years to try them all using a naive approach the number of possibilities can be reduced by eliminating ones that arent worth considering but efficiently throwing away useless combinations is in itself a difficult problem mathematicians have devoted a considerable amount of research on solving optimization problems because of their practical applications a mathematical program is a construct that mathematicians use to describe these problems despite the name its not related to computer programs it consists of a set of variables a set of constraints and an objective function a solution to the mathematical program is a set of values which when assigned to the variables satisfies all the constraints and at the same time optimizes the value of the objective function more specifically a linear program is a mathematical program where all constraints are linear equations or inequalities and the objective function is a linear combination of the variables relatively efficient ways to solve this class of problems have been found the most wellknown being the simplex algorithm furthermore if all variables are also constrained to be integers then the problem becomes an integer linear program ilp with some thought the problem of optimizing stats in ff9 can be encoded and solved as a series of ilps this is the approach taken by the calculator good algorithms for solving ilps are very complex and i didnt implement any myself the one actually used in the calculator is an opensource package called glpk in the sections below whenever i say solve the ilp it means pass the problem onto glpk let it crunch all the numbers and retrieve its solution62 basic ideas as stated before the central idea for the calculator is to encode the problem of optimizing stats into a series of ilps for this to happen we need to define the variables constraints and objective function that make up an ilp as an example consider the case for dagger base stats at level 1 17 spirit 23 magic 14 strength 21 speed useful equipment for her all items that are inferior statwise are ignored type name stat bonus spr mag str spd weapon magic racket  2  stardust rod 2   head bandana 1   1green beret   1 1holy miter 2 1  arms magic armlet  2  nkai armlet 2   power wrist   2 body dark gear 3   minervas plate  2 1 power vest   2 robe of lords 1 1 1 1addon barette 1 1 3 black belt 2  2 cachusha 1 2  1dark matter  2 3 glass buckle 2 1 1 pearl rouge 4 2  ribbon 1 3 1 running shoes    2variables should represent the basic quantities were trying to find it makes sense to define variables as the number of levelups to train with each piece of equipment because this is the number were trying to find for the optimal setup once we have this information everything else including final value of stats achieved can be calculated very easily so the list of variables for dagger can be written asxmagicracket xstardustrod xbandanaetc where xmagicracket represents the number of levels gained while having magic racket equipped and similarly for the others constraints are rules that every solution must respect the fact that a character can only wear one equipment of each type weapon head arms etc at a time is a constraint dagger can only gain 98 levels and in order to maximize her stat growth well want to use one item of each type during every levelup that gives us a total of 98 levelups per type of equipment these constraints can be written asxmagicracket  xstardustrod  98 xbandana  xgreenberet  xholymiter  98 xmagicarmlet  xnkaiarmlet  xpowerwrist  98etc where the first line accounts for all her weapons the second accounts for all her head gear and so on later in the calculations there will also be other constraints for stat values which will be covered below finally the objective is the quantity that were seeking to maximize namely the number of stat points recall the formula for calculating stats for example the one for daggers spirit with known quantities plugged in spr  spr base  lv  3  20   lv ups  spr eq bonus  32  spr eq curr  17  99  3  20   98  spr eq bonus  32  spr eq curr  31   98  spr eq bonus  32  spr eq currwhere spr eq bonus is the sum of all bonuses for spirit from equipment which is spr eq bonus  2 xstardustrod  xbandana  2 xholymiter  2 xnkaiarmlet  3 xdarkgear  xrobeoflords  xbarette  2 xblackbelt  xcachusha  2 xglassbuckle  4 xpearlrouge  xribbonand similarly for the other stats unfortunately the formula contains a term in  square brackets  that needs to be rounded down the round down function isnt linear and so this cant be adequately represented in an ilp to get around this problem a separate ilp must be solved for each stat without any rounding and the rounding operations done manually on the result63 calculating optimal stats for the ordered approach consider the simplest case for dagger with the ordered approach without any final equipment and without absorbing forced experience since we have a strict ordering of stats the top priority is to maximize spirit with no regard for any other stat using the variables constraints and objective function seen above we can find the maximum achievable spr eq bonus with the following ilp objective to maximize spr eq bonus constraints xmagicracket  xstardustrod  98 xbandana  xgreenberet  xholymiter  98 xmagicarmlet  xnkaiarmlet  xpowerwrist  98 xdarkgear  xminervasplate  xpowervest  xrobeoflords  98 xbarette  xblackbelt  xcachusha  xdarkmatter  xglassbuckle  xpearlrouge  xribbon  xrunningshoes  98solving this ilp gives the optimal spr eq bonus  1274 which involves training all 98 levelups with stardust rod holy miter nkai armlet dark gear and pearl rouge this solution should come as no surprise since those are the items that provide the max spirit boost with this setup daggers spirit will end up being spr  31   spr eq bonus  98  32  spr eq curr  31   1274  98  32  0  73which of course is a huge waste since it will be capped at 50 in reality we only need spr eq bonus  510 to raise her spirit to exactly 50 and can allow the remaining points to go into other stats we can now define an additional constraint to represent exactly this fact spr eq bonus  510as long as this constraint is obeyed spirit is guaranteed to be optimal now with the value of spirit settled the next priority is magic the number of bonus points to her magic can be calculated as mag eq bonus  2 xmagicracket  xholymiter  2 xmagicarmlet  2 xminervasplate  xrobeoflords  xbarette  2 xcachusha  2 xdarkmatter  xglassbuckle  2 xpearlrouge  3 xribbon and the maximum achievable mag eq bonus dagger can achieve without ruining her spirit can be found by solving the following ilp objective to maximize mag eq bonus constraints spr eq bonus  510 xmagicracket  xstardustrod  98  same equipment constraints as beforethe solution to this ilp includes a more carefully balanced set of equipment than the one for spirit alone while maintaining 50 spirit the highest mag eq bonus that can be achieved is 908 which yields 89 magic when rounded down are all of the 908 bonus points necessary to achieve 89 magic again the answer is no  having only 890 is already sufficient and the extra 18 points are simply rounded away from this we can derive yet another constraint concerning the optimization of magic mag eq bonus  890now that we have both spirit and magic fixed strength comes next the idea is the same as before simply maximize str eq bonus while respecting goals for both spirit and magic the ilp would look something like this objective to maximize str eq bonus constraints spr eq bonus  510 mag eq bonus  890 xmagicracket  xstardustrod  98  same equipment constraints as beforefinally once a constraint for strength has been determined the max speed can be found by extending the same process the optimal setup is a solution to the ilp that satisfies all the constraints including reaching the optimal target values of all four stats64 calculating optimal stats for the combined approach and other factors the combined approach is more difficult to calculate ideally the problem should be solved by a single mathematical program with sprmagstrspd as the objective function but this cant be written as an ilp because each of spr mag str and spd involves rounding down a term and unlike the ordered approach its not possible to calculate combined stats one at a time in sequence because all four stats affect each other the calculator actually uses a branchandbound algorithm for this case the process often involves solving dozens of ilps continuing by trial and error using dagger as an example we know her optimal stats in the ordered approach without final equipment or forced experience is 50 spr 89 mag 56 str and 30 spd for a grand total of 225 this number is useful as an initial lower bound because it has three nice properties it is easy to calculate as the previous section described it is sound meaning any valid solution for the combined approach must achieve at least this lower bound paths that cant achieve this lower bound can be safely rejected it is a tight bound since optimal stats in the combined approach are usually not too different from the ordered approach having a tight bound like this helps reduce the search effort by allowing the algorithm to quickly reject a larger number of possibilities once this bound is established the branch part of the algorithm tests all other possible stat values to see if a better one can be found one such possibility is keeping spr at 50 and mag at 89 but lowering str to 55 if this could allow spd to increase by 2 or more then that would give a better solution translating this into an ilp we get objective to maximize spd eq bonus constraints spr eq bonus  510 mag eq bonus  890 str eq bonus  90 xmagicracket  xstardustrod  98  same equipment constraints as beforethe solution to this ilp tells us that the maximum speed achievable under these conditions is still 30 which doesnt help similar calculations will prove that lowering str to any other value will not help either on the other hand if we only keep spr at 50 but lower mag to 88 the situation changes using this ilp objective to maximize str eq bonus  spd eq bonus constraints spr eq bonus  510 mag eq bonus  858 xmagicracket  xstardustrod  98  same equipment constraints as beforewe can calculate that a maximum str eq bonusspd eq bonus of 224 can be achieved with spr at 50 and mag at 88 taking base stat values and levelup bonuses into account that means the sum of strspd can be as high as 89 in this case compared to the initial bound which had 56 str and 30 spd for a sum of 86 this is better this branch is therefore worth exploring further by trying different values of str and spd while keeping mag at 88 similarly setting mag to 87 or 86 will yield even better results repeating the same kind of calculations will eventually exhaust all remaining possibilities the optimal stats for the combined approach is the best solution found among all these possibilities when adding forced experience into the calculations we need to introduce additional variables to represent equipment used during those battles since it is not possible to change equipment midbattle the variables will represent whether the equipment is used during the forced battle not the number of levels each variable can take on a value of 1 or 0 representing used or not used the number of levels gained with these equipment is fixed determined by the amount of exp gained from the battle for example the equipment that dagger can equip for the tantarian battle during a speed run can be represented by these variableststardustrod tlamiastiara tbandanaetc to reflect the fact that each equipment is responsible for 17 levelups for the tantarian battle their stat bonuses are multiplied by 17 in the equipment bonus calculations thus daggers spr eq bonus formula would gain all these terms with coefficients that are multiples of 17 spr eq bonus  34 tstardustrod  17 tbandana  17 tlamiastiara  17 trobeoflords  34 tsurvivalvest  17 tmythrilarmlet  17 tleatherwrist  17 tbarette  17 tcachusha  17 textension  17 tanklet  34 tblackbelt  34 tglassbuckle  68 tpearlrouge

processes described above for ordered and combined approaches can be used for all the calculations that include forced experience including final equipment in the calculations is simple its only effect is to limit the theoretical max that a stat can reach for example with final equipment that raises spirit by 3 the calculator proceeds as if the theoretical max for spirit is 47 instead of 50 all other methods remain the same as before the calculator doesnt have the algorithm to directly calculate stats for balanced quina to do so manually see calculating balanced quina 7 miscellaneous71
