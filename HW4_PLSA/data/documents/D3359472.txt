extra details about the topics how much home can i afford and whats the biggest loan i can get« back how much home can you afford «my how much home can you afford page gave you a rough idea of the maximum price you can afford to pay for a home with an easytouse calculator the page youre reading now gives you more of the story behind those numbers and helps you better understand the factors influencing how much money the bank will loan you this wont necessarily help you compute your borrowing power any better thats what the calculator is for rather its just to help you understand the concepts behind those numbers better this discussion isnt absolutely essential for most homebuyers but its provided for those who want to know as much as possible  especially those having trouble affording a home who want to look for way to improve their housebuying chances of course if you havent already gone through the basics of how much home you can afford and havent used the calculator then you should go back there now before reading any further — the page youre on now is the advanced stuff okay on with the advanced stuff youll remember the simple formula from the previous page — since you pay for your house with a combination of a down payment and a bank loan the total of both is the cost of the home down payment  biggest loan you can get  how much home you can afford you know how much you can afford for a down payment so that parts easy at least you should know — if you dont then you should probably figure that out before going any further so that leaves us with finding the biggest loan we can get so really the rest of this page is really  how much loan can i get  and not how much home can i afford to find how much home you can afford just add the amount of down payment money you have saved up to the amount you can get for a loan weve left one thing out of our simple equation above closing costs youll need to either pay the closing costs from your savings lowering the amount you have available for a down payment or qualify for a loan thats a little larger than the house you want to buy and have the closing costs added to the loan but thats not important right now returning our focus to getting the biggest loan possible here are the things that can get us a bigger loan higher monthly income lower existing monthly debt payments bigger down payment30year mortgage vs 15a better credit score a lower property tax  insurance rate lets look at each of these in detail higher monthly income obviously the more you can afford to pay for a home the bigger the loan you can get the bank limits your monthly mortgage payment including taxes and insurance to no more than 28 to 36 of your monthly income what determines where you fall on that scale is the size of your down payment and your credit score in any event the higher monthly payment the bank allow s the bigger the loan theyll give you this 28 to 36 figure is called the housing ratio for example if you make 3000mo and the bank uses a housing ratio of 33 then the bank figures you can afford 990mo in mortgage payments 3000 x 28 they also limit how much you can borrow based on how much debt you have but well cover that later usually theres not much you can do in the shortterm about your income but in one case there is buy a duplex or a house with a separate garage apartment that you can rent out then you can count the amount youll collect in rent towards your income some lenders are finicky about counting the rental income but you can almost certainly find one who will your chances improve if the space is already rented and the renter has a longterm lease being able to count this extra rental income can help you buy a more expensive home—which will be a much better investment the chart shows how having a higher income means a bigger potential loan amount these are estimates of loan amounts available at various income levels assuming 10000 down 500mo in debt 7 interest 30year mortgage and 2 property taxes and insurance lower monthly debt payments the less money you already owe the bigger the loan you can get the bank limits your monthly mortgage payment including taxes and insurance to no more than 36 to 42 of your total monthly income including your mortgage payment this figure is called the debt ratio for example lets say you make 3000mo have 500mo in debt and the bank uses a debt ratio of 38 theyll limit your total monthly debt to 1140 3000 x 38 you already have 500mo in debt so that means you have only 640mo left over for your mortgage payment what determines where you fall on the 36 to 42 scale is the size of your down payment and your credit score in any event the higher monthly payment the bank allows the bigger the loan theyll give you note that the amount you can borrow is also limited by the housing ratio discussed above the bank figures your monthly limit using the housing ratio then they figure your limit using the debt ratio and they take the lower of the two here are some examples with your monthly limit in each case highlighted example 1example 2example 3example 4income30003000400010000debt017510004000housing ratio limit income x 3296096012802800debt ratio limit income x 38  debt1140965520 200notice some interesting things about this from the first two examples you can see that you can carry some free debt with a monthly income of 3000 it doesnt matter whether you have no debt or 175mo in debt youre limited to a 960mo mortgage payment either way because the housing ratio is the limiting factor now if you had more than 175mo in debt then your debt would be the limiting factor the next thing to see is that your net income is irrelevant you might think 1 and 3 are the same because in each case the borrower has 3000mo in free money after dealing with debt—either 3000 in income and no debt or 4000 in income less 1000 in debt but it doesnt work that way when you have debt t he bank thinks youre already stretched and they limit how much you can borrow in this case the person making 1000mo less than the other person can borrow nearly twice as muchthis point is illustrated rather dramatically in example 4 this person is making a ton of money—10000 a month and with only 4000 in debt her net is 6000mo way more than our 1 or 2 people make yet this person cant get a loan at all—the bank thinks shes overextended because her existing debt is too high in proportion to her income the chart shows estimates of the loan you could get at various debt levels assuming 10000 down 3500mo income 7 interest 30year mortgage and 2 property taxes and insurance bigger down payment the more money you can put down the more the bank will loan you remember our 28 to 36 housing ratio and our 36 to 42 debt ratio one thing that gets you towards the higher end of the scales is a bigger down payment the other main thing is your credit score here are typical ratios allowed depending on your down payment down payment housing ratio debt ratio less than 202833364020 or more30363642yes each value is still a range because the exact ratio is dependent on your credit score and how eager the bank is to loan money the point is the ratios are a little higher when you have a larger down payment theres another reason a bigger down payment gets you a bigger loan when you put less than 20 down youre required to get private mortgage insurance so the bank gets paid even if something happens to you by putting 20 or more down you avoid paying pmi the monthly cost for pmi costs about 12400th the price of the home on a 120000 home that would be about 50mo pmi is automatically canceled when youve made enough payments that your outstanding balance is 78 or less of the purchase price we have more about pmi on a separate page putting 20 down could mean the difference between getting a 117k loan vs a 135k loan considering that you get a higher housing ratio and debt ratio and that you dont have to pay for pmi the chart shows an estimate based on 3500mo income little to no debt 7 interest 30year mortgage and 2 property taxes and insurance and finally a bigger down payment lets you buy a more expensive home because youre adding a bigger chunk of money to whatever loan you get from the bank30year mortgage vs 15 the longer the mortgage term the more the bank will loan you for a given amount that you can pay per month you can borrow more money with a longer loan than with a shorter loan it works in reverse too for a given loan amount th e loan with the longer term has lower payments than the one with the shorter term this doesnt mean a 30year loan is always the best because you wind up paying a lot more interest on a 30year loan vs a 15year loan in short get a 15year loan if you can afford it but certainly take a 30year loan on your dream home if thats all the bank will give you and then try to pay the loan off in 15 years theres more about 15 vs 30 year loans on my loans page getting a 30year instead of a 15year term could mean the difference between getting a 94k loan vs a 120k loan the chart shows an estimate is based on 3500mo income little to no debt 7 interest 10000 down and 2 property taxes and insurance a better credit score the better your credit rating the more money the bank will loan you the bank uses your credit rating to help determine what housing ratio and debt ratio theyll allow you see above under lower monthy debt payments the amount of extra loan you can get is similar to what you can get for making a bigger down payment of course if you have both a better credit rating and you can put 20 down then you can borrow even more well cover how to raise your credit score later lower costs for property taxes and insurance the less you have to pay for property taxes and insurance the more the bank will loan you banks figure how much theyll loan you based on how much money you can pay each month the more money thats needed to pay for property taxes and insurance the less thats available to pay the bank for the loan and the less money theyll loan you taxes are generally charged as a percentage of the value of a home for example if your rate is 12 on 100 of a 100000 home youll pay 1200 a year in taxes or 100 a month another county might charge 24 on 50 of the home value which works out to the same thing tax rates vary from county to county call your county tax assessor or look them up online to find the tax rate in your area taxes can vary a lot —04 in honolulu hi to 46 in bridgeport ct 1in addition to property taxes you also have to pay for property insurance there again rates vary according to what part of the country you live in how much of a risk the insurance company t hinks your home is wood houses burn better than brick houses and what kind of deal you can get from your insurance company call a couple of insurance companies to get estimates for insurance cost in the meantime you can use 06 as a rough estimate eg insurance could be 600yr on a 100000 home when you add both insurance and tax costs together you get the combined ti rate that we use on our calculator for example if your property tax rate is 14 and your insurance rate is 06 then your combined ti rate is 20 having a 15 ti rate vs a 35 ti rate could mean the difference between getting a 103 loan vs a 127k loan this estimate is based on 3500mo income little to no debt 7 interest 10000 down and a 30year term conclusion the point of this page was to show you factors that increase the size of the loan you can get from the bank higher monthly
