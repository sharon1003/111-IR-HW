reviews wow what can i say ive been waiting a year and a half for this movie and i can tell you that it was definitely worth the wait even though daniel rupert and emma are much older than 14 its pretty obvious they are so convincing as they learn about their feelings of maturity the selection ceremony for the triwizard tournament was humorous the look of shock on certain characters faces is unforgettable the tasks are fun and exciting even though i already knew what was going to happen i thought that the yule ball was absolutely spectacular and rons dress robes were awesome the movie was so well done id have to say that it is the best movie in the series so far the movie does the book justice424 of 807 people found this review helpful was this review helpful to you yes no report this
