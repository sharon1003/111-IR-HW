to scrub away those periods of time when you were out of work you may try to rationalize it by telling yourself that it was only a few months or that the recruiter will never find out but in reality recruiters can and often do find out — which burns a bridge for you immediately just play it safe and tell the truth remember youre interviewing for more than just a paycheck you’re interviewing for a lasting relationship with an employer a relationship that should be built on trust from both parties start out the relationship by lying and it probably won’t go much further than chatting with the recruiter besides if you tell the truth to your advantage you may be able to make those resume gaps work for you how gaps can work to your advantage your resume gaps arent the first ones employers have seen and they dont mean youre out of the running — unless you handle them poorly recruiters dont ask you about gaps because theyre terrible — they simply want to know what you were doing so they can get a more complete picture of who you are as a candidate so really whether your gaps are glaring blemishes or points of interest is really up to you so really whether your gaps are glaring

gaps so you can afford to be thoughtful about your sabbatical time instead of desperately job hunting and 2 actually use the time off for personal development — not a time to sit at home and relax you
