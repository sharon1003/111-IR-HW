tennis serena and venus williams are siblings forever but rivals for not much longer on tennis by christopher clarey july 6 201538serena williams left embraced her sister venus after defeating her 64 63 in wimbledon’s fourth round julian finneygetty images wimbledon england — “time” the chair umpire kept saying on monday the customary reminder to resume play after a changeover but the word had particular resonance given that the williams sisters were the ones exchanging blows on centre court serena williams a 64 63 winner in this rather anticlimactic fourthround match was certainly thinking plenty about it“it definitely doesn’t get easier” she said of facing her sibling “but today i was out there and i thought ‘wow i’m 33 and she just turned 35 i don’t know how many more moments like this we’ll have’ ”it had been a reaffirming 24 hours for enduring american female athletes with carli lloyd 32 leading the united states women’s soccer team to the world cup title and abby wambach 35

for years but acknowledged that it was never certain that she and venus would have the chance to play again on centre court where they each have — for now — won five wimbledon singles titles“i just wanted to take the moment in” serena said “i remember when we were 8 years old we dreamed of these moments it was kind of surreal there”surreal perhaps but in the end unsurprising venus williams was the role model and the ringleader when the sisters were very young — the one serena copied the one serena used for a measuring stick venus was the first to turn professional the first to create a buzz in the small world of professional tennis and the wider world beyond and also the first to win wimbledon and reach no 1 venus williams left and serena williams have faced each other 26 times in their careers serena holds the lead 1511 andy raineuropean pressphoto agency but serena has passed her by in terms of career achievements racking up 20 grand slam singles titles to her sister’s seven piling up the weeks at no 1 and the headtohead edges over her wouldbe rivals serena is 361 in 2015 all the more remarkable considering how excruciatingly difficult some of those victories have proved to be you could argue that this has been one of the shakiest great seasons in recent tennis history but there was no quibbling with her superiority or composure on monday in a matchup that remains emotionally challenging for both sisters and a matchup in which serena leads 1511 asked if they ever thought as youngsters that serena would reach 20 grand slam titles venus said “i don’t think we thought about any limits when you’re a kid you don’t think about limits you dream that’s how it’s happening now dreams are coming true”it was a touching comment considering the implication that some of venus’s dreams are not coming true in the process though venus won their last match — in montreal last year — they had not played each other in a grand slam tournament since the 2009 wimbledon final but serena set the tone and pace early on monday striking the ball with tremendous force and winning the first eight points venus pulled herself together to make it a contest but serena’s serve was again the more potent and consistent weapon she hit 10 aces and won 78 percent of the points when she put her first serve into play to venus’s two aces and 59 percent but the statistic that really showed the big sister’s vulnerability involved the second serve attacking it is a williams specialty and each can rob the other of time to get organized like few other opponents but serena won this battle within the battle decisively converting on 63 percent of her own secondserve points and also winning 67 percent on her sister’s second serve often returning from two big steps inside the baseline“venus did not serve that great” acknowledged david witt her hitting partner and coach “and serena stepping up to the second serve it was like the ball was on a tee”marc steins newsletter hes

“serena served great but you’ve got to play the percentages her strength is her backhand everybody knows that”serena closed out the first set on serve hitting three aces in the game she closed out the match by breaking her sister’s serve at love after venus had lost her previous service game on a double fault there would be no handshake afterward just a long embrace and a chat“sisterly words” venus said asked if she would be back next year venus answered “i think so”wimbledon 2015what it’s like to face a 150 m p h tennis serve july 10 2015tennis’s top women balance body image with ambition july

face victoria azarenka the former no 1 on centre court on tuesday azarenka defeated belinda bencic 18 from switzerland 62 63 in her fourthround match azarenka seeded no 23 at wimbledon has twice come close to defeating serena in the last two months failing to convert on three match points and losing in the round of 16 in madrid and then losing a 63 42 lead to serena in the third round of the french open overall serena leads azarenka 163 and has never lost to her in a grand slam event despite azarenka’s pushing her to three sets in the 2012 and 2013 united states open finals“close is not good enough” azarenka said “i need to go out there and prove myself to talk about it is pointless for me i need to go and do my work on the court and then maybe we can talk after”the other quarterfinal in the top half of the draw on tuesday will match maria sharapova against unseeded american co co vandeweghe in the bottom half garbiñe muguruza of spain will face timea bacsinszky of switzerland and madison keys of the united states will face agnieszka radwanska of poland“i feel like my tournament has finally begun” serena said “this is where i feel really comfortable in a grand slam”she has not been untouchable in grand slam quarterfinals 2713 and her ability to remain in a zone remains most uncertain she was two points from defeat against the unseeded heather watson in the third round with the centre court crowd and plucky watson rocking her world but calm was the byword against venus even as they generated the sort of trademark power that has allowed them to change the women’s game for good it was in the end a relatively straightforward affair even if it was an eerily muted one with the williamses keeping the grunts and in serena’s case the theatrical reactions and body language to a minimum is the way the williamses act as they play each other as close as they get to their essential selves or is it only convention generated by the need to compartmentalize it remains hard to be sure what is certain is that they are sisters first and foremost and rivals second and that is clearly for the best at this stage because the tennis gap — poignantly inexorably — continues to widen correction july 6 2015 an earlier version of this article misstated the percentage of points venus williams won when she put her first serve into play it is 59 percent not 65
