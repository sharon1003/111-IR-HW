turns out there are many reasons to recycle other than the good feeling you may get from doing it recycling saves landfill space conserves resource saves energy and saves water recycling is only the tip of the environmental ice burg reducing your waste and reusing what you have will always be better however you may be surprised how much of an impact recycling really has here is a quick run down on the impacts on the environment based on the materials these numbers were taken from a 2005 us senate report paper newsprint one ton of recycled newsprint saves 601 kwh of energy 17 barrels of oil 71 gallons102 million btus of energy 60 pounds of air pollutants from being released 7000 gallons of water and 46 cubic yards of landfill space office paper recycling one ton of office paper saves 17 trees 7000 gallons of water 463 gallons of oil 3 cubic yards of landfill space and enough energy to heat an average home for six months trees further manufacturing one ton of office paper using recycled paper stock can save 3000 to 4000 kilowatt hours versus making that amount using virgin materials plastic one ton of recycled plastic saves 5774 kwh of energy 163 barrels of oil 98 million btus of energy and 30 cubic yards of landfill space glass one ton of recycled glass saves 42 kwh of energy 012 barrels of oil 5 gallons 714000 btus of energy 75 pounds of air pollutants from being released and 2 cubic yards of landfill space over 30 of the raw material used in glass production now comes from recycled glass metal aluminum recycling of aluminum cans saves 95 of the energy required to make the same amount of aluminum from its virgin source one ton of recycled aluminum saves 14000 kilowatt hours kwh of energy 40 barrels of oil 238 million btus of energy and 10 cubic yards of landfill space steel one ton of recycled steel saves 642 kwh of energy 18 barrels of oil 109 million btus of energy and 4 cubic yards of landfill space how does recycling save landfill space this is the easiest to understand everything you throw in the trash will end up buried in a landfill in santa barbara county while different recyclables are separated from each other trash is not separated into different recyclable materials some examples how does recycling save resources paper and cardboard come from trees plastics from oil metals from rocks called ores and glass from sand recycling means that we dont have to chop down extract or mine to collect more raw materials for making the things we use every day the us epa and other sources give us these estimates for resource savings for one ton of these materials one ton of paper recycle saves 17 trees  epa  one ton of plastic saves 163 barrels of oil  stanford  one ton of aluminum saves 4 tons of bauxite ore  made howcom  one ton of glass saves one ton of mixed limestone soda ash and sand  epa stanford how does recycling save energy this is most clear from the resource question above take a look at aluminum it takes 4 tons of bauxite ore to make one ton of aluminum that bauxite has to be mined transported crushed mixed with caustic soda heated and separated from impurities after that the separated material is smelted which basically means being heated to extremely high temperatures to separate the aluminum recycling an aluminum can requires that the can be transported separated from commingled recyclables and melted not only does the melting take a lot less energy you arent dealing with all the other processes you needed to do to separate the aluminum from bauxite take a look at made howcom for more information about aluminum production this general rule applies to most materials manufacturing them out of raw resources takes more energy than using a recycled product one way to look at this is to see how far an object could be transported before the energy recouped from recycling is lost this information was taken from an article published in resource recycling in 2009 researchers used the epa warm model to calculate how far you can ship goods by truck rail and freighter ship before you dont have any energy savings from recycling them lets look at a few materials shipped by truck the least effiecient method of transportation glass  2000 miles by truck plastic 1 pet  10000 miles newspaper  21000 miles aluminum  103000 miles circumference of the earth  about 24900 miles what does it mean you can send aluminum around the world 4 times on a big rig truck and you will still save energy by recycling it you cant actually do that since your average big rig cant drive on water but if you switch to train or frieghter ship the effieciency gets even better still have questions contact us with your recycling questions and we will do our best to answer themwhere to go outside santa barbara county 2
