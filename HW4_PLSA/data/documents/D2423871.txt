by arianne cohen apr 20 2011 36k jason lee psssst you may be doing it wrong yes you with the dishwasher i know youre diligently prerinsing before loading in your own trademark style that no other human in your household can quite do correctly except…well read on we talked to two engineers who have spent decades testing dishwashers to tell you the errors of your ways what kind of dishwasher should i get first things first dont buy more than you need dishwasher design has been revolutionized in the past decade and prices have plummeted heres what else you need to know you dont need to spend a fortune costsaving secret the cleaning performance of very expensive machines equals the cleaning performance of cheaper namebrand dishwashers why because the cleaning systems are essentially the same on fancier models youre paying for three things appealing exterior design extras such as adjustable loading racks and precision sensors that choose the cycle for you and silence—pricier models are much quieter if clean dishes are all you need and you dont mind some noise midsize models from companies like ge start well under 300 consider ways to spend even less shop toward the end of the year when stores are making space for next years models if you dont mind a few cosmetic scuffs ask whether any floor models are available and confirm that they come with full warranties or go used dishwashers that are merely a year or two old are frequently traded in during kitchen renovations your local used appliance store probably stocks models for under 200 that originally sold for double or triple that amount simply look for a model you like and confirm that theres a 100day parts and labor warranty what about energy star models energy star models often retail for 50 to 100 more but use substantially less energy over time and can save you money on your utility bills as part of the energy star program the government has been offering rebates to offset the cost of energy star appliances some state rebate programs are now closed but others still offer substantial tax rebates to find out if your state is still offering rebates go to energy saversgovfinancial are dishwashers more efficient than handwashing short answer yes but this wasnt always the case dishwashers used to clean by using a ton of water and energy says john dries a kentucky engineer who designs dishwashers for major manufacturers in the 90s 13 gallons was typical now there are machines that can do a very good job on 4 gallons models with an energy star sticker use a maximum of 58 gallons per cycle and half the electricity of older models by comparison running your faucet for just one minute uses roughly 1 gallon of water plus the electricity to heat it so unless youre the type to painstakingly wash 30plus pieces of tableware with one tub of soapy water and one tub of clean water your dishwasher is more efficient a word about prerinsing dont do it yes you read that correctly—prerinsing is wrong dishes should be scraped to remove large chunks says dries but if youre rinsing youre really just wasting water and electricity so why is everyone in the habit of prerinsing because older dishwashers removed food soil by diluting the food in water and then hoping it went down the drain which it often didnt the vast majority of todays models have filtration systems designed to catch food and pump it down the drain so that very little dirty water carries over to the next cycle higherend models not only have selfcleaning filters but hard food disposers as well which grind food and send it down the drain in addition modern detergents are designed to attack food which can actually cause problems if there isnt any food on the dishware the detergent in the unit aggressively goes after something and if you dont have food soil in the unit it attacks the glasses which will get cloudy says mike edwards a dishwasher designer and senior engineer for bosch so ignore your friends when they tell you that you have to prerinse how to load the right way mike edwards knows a thing or two about how to load a dishwasher—hes been designing them for 22 years his suggestion read the manual we put a lot of effort into it each tub is a little different but even so there are two golden rules like items shall be loaded with like more items fit that way and all items should face the middle of the unit—thats where the jet spray comes from• avoid nesting water water vapor and heat need to touch every surface of the items being washed so leave space between dishes and dont overfill• place items facing down placing bowls pans and cups upright means theyll fill with dirty water and wont be able to drain• the lower rack put bigger dishes here close to the jet spray plates pots pans mixing bowls all go here platters go against an outside edge so they dont block other items durable mugs and thick glasses can also go on this rack• silverware load the silverware basket in the sink—knives handleup and forks and spoons handledown—making sure not to overfill many baskets are designed to sit in a variety of bottom rack locations after you load other items place the basket where your remaining empty space is advertisement  continue reading below• the top rack place glasses and cups along the edges next to the tines not on them if you put them on the tines the tines can break and youll fit fewer items load smaller plates and saucers in neat rows facing the middle long spatulas cooking spoons and knives lie flat in the long basket for this purpose if your unit has one dishware you shouldnt load as per the manual• pricey or delicate glass in many cases expensive stuff wont hold up says edwards• cast iron the iron can rust and the seasoning will be removed gold plated or rimmed flatware and dishes the gold can scratch off or the items may come out a color other than gold• tin pewter  sterling silver  anodized aluminum like cast iron these materials can rust when in doubt skip all metal products other than stainless steel and aluminum• disposable plastics skip anything thats not marked dishwasher safe particularly takeout containers• wood wooden bowls spoons and utensil handles can warp crack or discolor• nonstick pans and baking sheets read the labels that came with them and if youre not sure handwash so the nonstick coating doesnt come off• childrens dishes with designs otherwise winnie might lose his face and his honey• expensive dishes why risk it handwash anything you plan to leave to your relatives• twisty straws its just not going to end well youve got a typical stack of postmeal dishes dinner dishes from a couple of days ago plus some pots and pans bakedon dishes lots of food soilage barely dirty dishes greasy oily dishes setting light wash normal heavy wash quick wash hightemp wash why this is what your manual refers to as light food soil— and itll usually clean just fine on the light wash cycle test it for a few nights and see how your dishes come out designers know that reviewers will test the normal cycle so they build it to be rather powerful capable of handling fairly severe soilage this superlong cycle exposes dishes to moist heat for hours giving food plenty of time to swell and fall off this cycle is just like the light wash but with less time for dishes to soak the same as a normal cycle with a final rinse of 160°f water to decimate any remaining grease and speed up drying how longs the cycle 80 minutes 3 tub fills 1 12–2 hours 4 fills 2 hours 5 fills 40 minutes 3 fills 1 12–2 hours 4 fills a word about dishwasher soap when you use your dishwasher hot water pours into the dishwasher tub heating it to approximately 120°f to 140°f and then shoots through spray jets to rinse off loose or stuck food detergent is not released until the second or third fills after the prerinses when most of the heavy food soil is gone says dishwasher engineer john dries who knew but what remains is really tough stuckon food soil and the detergent is key to helping get that off the engineers interviewed have run thousands of test loads and they use regular old powder detergent sometimes the simple stuff works best but now that manufacturers are reformulating detergents to comply with phosphate bans detergent performance is far less reliable dries suggests experimenting with different products until you find one that works tablets are faring best at the moment and store boxes of powder detergent closed—exposure to air causes clumping6 ways to save money1 use the lightest cycle possible the heavier the cycle the more water and energy you use says edwards heavier cycles mean more tub fills and drains normal cycles typically fill four or five times light washes around three2 use less detergent how much you use should depend on how much food soil is in the machine not on how many dishes says dries experiment to determine the smallest amount that works and consult your manual which tells you precisely how much to use my dishes clean just fine with a teaspoon of powder detergent3 dont run the hot water beforehand some people run hot water in their sink for a minute before starting the dishwasher assuming that the water going into the dishwasher will then be warmer says dries but theres no need—modern dishwashers have their own waterheating element to heat water well above the 120°f of most household faucets4 skip heat drying unless you need dry dishes immediately the dishes will dry on their own especially if youre using a rinse aid a trick of the trade if you happen to be standing next to the dishwasher when it finishes open the door flash drying will happen the dishes are at their hottest point and when suddenly exposed to cool air theyll give up moisture at the fastest rate5 rinse and hold its absolutely fine to run your dishwasher once a week in the meantime just run the rinseandhold cycle to prevent smells6 always run it full you knew that already right
