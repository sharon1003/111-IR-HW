stakeholders and their moral stakes some typical science and technology stakeholders and their moral stakes individual scientist or technologist the individual scientist or technologist often has a major stake in moral issues in science and technology but what are the key moral stakes the core values virtues consequences rights and responsibilities of scientists and technologists one value that is agreed upon by all members of the scientific and technological community is the importance of proper use of the scientific method it was developed over the last five hundred years and was originated and improved and expanded upon through the efforts of sir francis bacon galileo isaac newton ernst mach albert einstein and many others values inherent in the scientific method include the reverence for the results achieved through ultimate appeal to verifiable testable empirical hypotheses and the direct or inferential support provided by actually putting the hypotheses to independent test newton referred to such tests as critical experiments where one hypothesis is shown to agree with the results of the experiment and the other hypothesis is shown lacking other values that are tied in with the scientific method include the general requirement that experiments be reproducible and the results of the experiments accurately recorded and published for all to evaluate test and reproduce in the event that an experiment cannot be reproduced or the results of an experiment cannot be successfully conducted by others then the claims of the original tests are diminished or disregarded the truthfulness of the original report of the experiment and the reproducibility and selfcorrecting nature of an experiment have become core values of scientific research those involved in scientific research and technological do not all agree on which consequences are important to consider while they may agree on the basic values of science and technology they might not agree about how the consequences of their work should be used when determining whether or not the research or development should be conducted some maintain that scientists are seekers after truth and that they are not to blame if others take their knowledge and use it to do great harms or if their research has no practical windfalls or rewards others claim that some scientific knowledge is so valuable that members of society and other species may be put at grave risk in order to achieve such knowledge at times it can be impossible to accurately determine the risks or rewards for a specific program of scientific research or technological development and this can make deciding on a safe course a very difficult decision to make the core rights and responsibilities of scientific research and technological development are codification of the actions that must be taken to insure respect for the core values of the science these rights include the rights to question any theory to be free to pursue knowledge wherever it may lead to examine the claims of others and to make public what one has discovered the responsibilities include accurately reporting the results of research permitting others to question and to test and to allow publication and discussion of legitimate scientific research stakeholder values virtues consequences rights and responsibilities may be manifested in different ways in a variety of contexts thereby creating a network of moral issues as a consequence of this moral background scientists and technologists may confront moral issues that may be uniquely related to their expertise and position one such special moral choice is the very selection of a research or development area for example research and technological development into the cloning technology for human beings challenges many moral and ethical concepts and traditions personally enabling humanity to be able to produce genetically identical human beings raises questions about the rights and responsibilities of all who may chose to clone humans and of those who are brought into the world through cloning there are ethicists who argue that human beings are devalued and lose dignity when science treats humans as just another scientific topic as a mere means to achieve their scientific goals they claim that the more humans are treated as objects the less likely they will be guaranteed fundamental human rights dignity and respect this argument implies that such an erosion of human sanctity would threaten the social institutions on which society is based furthermore institutions such as the family neighborhood organizations welfare and other assistance systems international human rights laws may receive lessened support as human beings are treated as just another part of nature individual scientists and technologists should consider the moral implications of their work when they pursue research and development interests especially in areas where there are risks of causing harm to others many scientists and technologists have formed strong positions regarding the ethics of working in nuclear or biological weapons programs researching and experimenting with fetal cell tissue or constructing dams and roadways in designated ecologically fragile areas recently concerned scientists and others have challenged decisions to send plutonium powered satellites into space because of the risks of mission failure and the harms that may ensue scientists and technologists often believe it is their duty to employ their knowledge for beneficial uses they believe that they have an obligation to society to voice their informed opinion regarding complex matters that they alone may understand some believe that society looks to them for moral leadership in the areas of their expertise other moral stakes are associated with the specific conduct of scientists and technologists themselves due to the possibilities of wealth fame tenure and prestige they may be tempted to be less than truthful in the representation of their research results or to exploit their colleagues their junior scientists research assistants or others there are those who have abused their power or misused their funding sometimes for personal gain scientific misconduct often includes plagiarism falsification of results and even the complete fabrication of evidence while some of the above are fairly obvious violations of ordinary duties to tell the truth and to be fair it is worth remembering that scientists or technologists are obligated as are we all to obey the general moral codes of society the pursuit of truth is not a justification for harming others or violating moral principles accountable managers project coordinators or departmental chairpersons since scientists and technologists are not the only stakeholder groups we will now begin to expand our consideration of moral complexities in science by considering the moral stakes of the accountable managers project coordinators or departmental chairpersons while they may face some of the same moral issues that confront those scientists or technologists who report to them their managers must consider additional values virtues important consequences and rights and responsibilities the values of efficiency economic transparency fairness along with their accompanying virtues apply to accountable managers everywhere as does insuring that no harm comes to those in their care and that rights are respected and protected managerial responsibilities to spend grant money in accordance with the contracts to be a good steward of the money and not illicitly permit money to flow into unauthorized hands and in some cases to create cash flow and profit for firms can motivate accountable managers to make poor ethical choices which affect many others scientists and technologists may confront moral choices because of inappropriate decisions or demands made by their accountable manager for example engineers responsible for the challenger space shuttle launch a topic discussed in the chapter on personal responsibility witnessed the general manager instruct their accountable manager in this case the vice president of engineering take off your engineering hat and put on your management hat with the end result being that he voted to launch in such a moment the general manager put the vice president of engineering in a position where he faced the conflict of his duties as an engineer and his duties as a manager in the challenger case the decision resulted in the loss of life of a billion dollar contract national prestige a major delay in the space program and the destruction of many careers as this case demonstrates it is important to be sensitive to the managerial aspects of science and technology ethical issues managing organization corporation university research agency or institutethe managing organization corporation university research agency or institute has a moral stake in many science and technology moral issues the moral stakes of managing organizations in science and technology may include many of those mentioned in connection with the individual scientists and technologists and their accountable mangers but in addition there is a significant increase in the power prestige influence and responsibilities due to the greater magnitude of the organization corporate social responsibility the obligations of governmental and nongovernmental agencies research and development organizations as well as educational institutions have large and varied constituencies which must be considered together with scientific and technological operations when a university accuses one of its faculty members of scientific misconduct it is more than a simple issue of scientific integrity it is also an issue of faculty rights tenure students’ responsibilities alumni obligations and relationships with philanthropic organizations because of the many competing obligations the duty to uphold scientific or technological values may have to be weighed against the competing realities of meeting the university’s responsibilities to the entire educational institution and justifying the expenses associated with holding an individual accountable dr bernard fisher director of an important breast cancer study conducted at the university of pittsburgh was accused by the national institutes of health’s office of research integrity of failure to report that dr roger poisson a researcher in his project had faked scientific data this allegation of scientific misconduct was enough for the university of pittsburgh to remove him from his prominent position at the university after much national publicity and three years of continuous discussion of the accusation the office of research integrity cleared dr fisher of all charges literally millions of dollars were spent and the university of pittsburgh subsequently settled a lawsuit brought by dr fisher in which he claims that he should not have been removed from his position after the fact the actions of the university of pittsburgh may be seen as a misuse of resources and a case where the university failed to support one of its faculty members when he was innocent of serious accusations professional organization professional organizations often have a moral stake in moral issues in science and technology just as individual scientists or technologists have moral stakes in particular issues so too do the professional organizations which advocate for and bind together groups of these professionals admitting an individual to membership in a professional organization often subjects the individual to additional duties and responsibilities and also ties the organization to that individual if individuals bring shame upon themselves they also bring shame upon the professional organization which admitted them as members most professional organizations have codes of ethics and membership requirements which may permit the organization certain enforcement options regarding policing such offending members citizens indeed many citizens unconnected to the scientific or technological projects may have a moral stake in the maze in a minimal fashion all citizens may be stakeholders because they have the potential to benefit from successful discoveries or be harmed by research or developments which have gone awry in selected circumstances science and technology may contribute to saving or ending the lives of citizens in more ordinary situations we find that most people’s lives are significantly even if less dramatically affected by the products of science and technology it is clearly unfair that 75000 united states citizens have contracted thyroid cancer because of above ground nuclear weapons tests undertaken between 1950 and 1958 the unfairness became particularly obvious when it was made known that the atomic energy commission knew that nuclear fallout would harm human thyroid glands and that the radiation was present in milk given to children while no warning was given to children or parents about the nuclear contamination of milk they did warn the kodak corporation kodak was warned about impending nuclear tests and the problems associated with fallout and the fogging of unexposed film thus enabling kodak to protect their photographic products from damage this appears to be a violation of citizens rights to be safe and a violation of the responsibilities of the aec to inform when they were about to expose people especially children to potential harms the consequences include pain and suffering and the loss of life in addition to important information derived from these tests that provided increased national security during the cold war to all us citizens funding regulatory and administrating agencies in many science and technology moral issues there are funding regulatory and administrating agencies nih nsf in the us the courts legislators and executive branch which may have a moral stake funding regulatory and administrative agencies and organizations may derive their rights and responsibilities through contractual relationships with scientists technologists and their organizations or through executive order legislative action or constitutional mandates in each case these systems oversee science and technology “at a distance” and normally directly intervene only in cases where there are violations of contractual based or legally derived obligations or risks of notable harms these organizations have the responsibility to sanction misconduct or malfeasance among scientists and technologists regulating organizations may withhold funding from scientists who have violated their contracts or take scientists and technologists to court to hold them accountable for their actions moral issues arise when the process of holding scientists and technologists accountable is flawed how the stakes of regulatory agencies might affect scientists and technologists is easily seen in the unfortunate experience of robert sprague professor of psychology at the university of illinois at urbana champaign he was the principle investigator of a grant awarded by the national institute of mental health nimh under which he set up a laboratory in cold water michigan and hired dr stephen bruning he independently discovered that dr bruning had falsified research and reported these violations to the nimh who had provided the grant and were an appropriate regulating agency the nimh did nothing the nimh did not sanction dr bruning at that time rather they investigated dr sprague and punished him by withholding grants for his research that ordinarily were awarded to him it seems that dr sprague was being punished because he was bringing attention to scientific misconduct which may harm the stature of the nimh and draw attention to possible other cases of scientific misconduct which could threaten the reputation and funding of a prestigious national institute it appeared that the regulatory agency was protecting its organizational interests rather than the integrity of the scientific and technological developments that it supports nations and their governments often there are national interests which are at issue in science and technology moral issues a nation may place great value on scientific and technological development doing so often contributes to economic and security goals the constant innovations derived from research and development projects fuel new industries and generate millions of dollars for society in addition advanced technologies and new research can produce new means to protect national interests most notably since the very dawn of science governments have sought scientists to provide new ways to achieve their military goals being the first to have stronger metals explosives rockets nuclear weapons or nerve gas served to advance the national goals of the nation that hosted the breakthrough science and technology while governments may have a moral responsibility to protect their borders and their citizens just how that responsibility is fulfilled can cause problems in the former soviet union it now seems apparent that ecological values and personal safety and security were harmed in the research and development of nuclear weapons together with the production of the means necessary to deploy them around the world the rights of people not to be exposed to hazardous materials were abridged in order to continue nuclear weapons research and development radiation mapping of the former soviet union shows large land masses rivers and streams polluted with radiation from nuclear weapon research and development science and technology moral issues often include aspects which give many other nations a moral stake nations that do not engage in particular scientific research or technological development are affected by the successful results achieved by the nations who do the discovery of radar radio satellite telephone technology new ways of growing food and new cures for illnesses may affect greatly the quality of life in all countries whether it is the free flow of oncerestricted information over the internet or the introduction of a river blindness medicine that promises to end the age old realities of all old people going blind in remotest africa the affects of scientific research and development know no borders during the cold war all the nations of the world were affected by the risk of global nuclear war made possible by scientific research and technology even though the weapons of mass destruction were in the control of only a few nations today we are more aware of the global environmental effects of highly technological societies and how decisions made to develop technology may have global and social implications when advanced nations send plutonium powered satellites into orbit the entire planet may have additional risk of exposure to one of the most deadly substances we know moral issues of who should have or who should control the latest scientific research or technology and how it should be distributed is a significant moral question of distributive justice copyright© 2009 philosophy lab corporation all rights reserved
