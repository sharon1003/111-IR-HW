how long to clear credit card debt by this is money updated 1543 edt 27 november 2009view comments i have a barclaycard platinum credit card on which i owe £2000 and a nat west gold credit card on which i owe £1800 i am making the minimum repayments on each card how long will it take to pay off these balances my guess is that it will be about four years but i have a horrible feeling my calculations are way out p g birmingham simon moon from this is money replies youre right to have a horrible feeling the reality of how long this debt could hang around your neck may come as a shock the typical interest rate on a barclaycard simplicity platinum credit card is 68 so repaying £48 a month would clear the present level of debt in four years the rate on your nat west gold card is 169 standard and at £40 a month this would take 50 longer to clear  six years rather than the four you estimate but  and this is a very big but – these figures will apply only if you carry on paying £48 to barclaycard and £40 to nat west because it is a percentage of the outstanding balance the minimum amount you have to repay falls as the debt shrinks this has the effect of hugely extending the repayment period if you continue to make only the minimum monthly repayment it will take 15 years and eight months to clear the barclaycard on the same basis clearing your nat west gold card will take an astonishing 26 and a half years i think youll agree thats a pretty sobering thought as christmas threatens to put plastic cards under ever greater pressure try this is moneys calculator share or
