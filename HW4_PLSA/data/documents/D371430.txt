mitochondrial diseases muscle biopsy gomori trichrome stain specialty medical genetics mitochondrial diseases are a group of disorders caused by dysfunctional mitochondria the organelles that generate energy for the cell mitochondria are found in every cell of the human body except red blood cells and convert the energy of food molecules into the atp that powers most cell functions mitochondrial diseases are sometimes about 15 of the time 1 caused by mutations in the mitochondrial dna that affect mitochondrial function other mitochondrial diseases are caused by mutations in genes of the nuclear dna whose gene products are imported into the mitochondria  mitochondrial proteins as well as acquired mitochondrial conditions mitochondrial diseases take on unique characteristics both because of the way the diseases are often inherited and because mitochondria are so critical to cell function the subclass of these diseases that have neuromuscular disease symptoms are often called a

kidney disease gastrointestinal disorders respiratory disorders neurological problems autonomic dysfunction and dementia 2 acquired conditions in which mitochondrial dysfunction has been involved are diabetes huntingtons disease cancer alzheimers disease parkinsons disease bipolar disorder 3 4 5 schizophrenia aging and senescence anxiety disorders cardiovascular disease sarcopenia and chronic fatigue syndrome 6the body and each mutation is modulated by other genome variants the mutation that in one individual may cause liver disease might in another person cause a brain disorder the severity of the specific defect may also be great or small some defects include  exercise intolerance  defects often affect the operation of the mitochondria and multiple tissues more severely leading to multisystem diseases 7as a rule mitochondrial diseases are worse when the defective mitochondria are present in the muscles cerebrum or nerves 8 because these cells use more energy than most other cells in the body although mitochondrial diseases vary greatly in presentation from person to person several major clinical categories of these conditions have been defined based on the most common phenotypic features symptoms and signs associated with the particular mutations that tend to cause them  citation neededan outstanding question and area of research is whether atp depletion or reactive oxygen species are in fact responsible for the observed phenotypic consequences  citation neededcerebellar atrophy or hypoplasia has sometimes been reported to be associated 9causes  editmitochondrial disorders may be caused by mutations acquired or inherited in mitochondrial dna  mt dna  or in nuclear genes that code for mitochondrial components they may also be the result of acquired mitochondrial dysfunction due to adverse effects of drugs infections or other environmental causes see me sh  nuclear dna has two copies per cell except for sperm and egg cells one copy being inherited from the father and the other from the mother mitochondrial dna however is strictly inherited from the mother and each mitochondrial organelle typically contains between 2 and 10 mt dna copies during cell division the mitochondria segregate randomly between the two new cells those mitochondria make more copies normally reaching 500 mitochondria per cell as mt dna is copied when mitochondria proliferate they can accumulate random mutations a phenomenon called heteroplasmy if only a few of the mt dna copies inherited from the mother are defective mitochondrial division may cause most of the defective copies to end up in just one of the new mitochondria for more detailed inheritance patterns see human mitochondrial genetics  mitochondrial disease may become clinically apparent once the number of affected mitochondria reaches a certain level this phenomenon is called  threshold expression  mitochondrial dna mutations occur frequently due to the lack of the error checking capability that nuclear dna has see mutation rate  this means that mitochondrial dna disorders may occur spontaneously and relatively often defects in enzymes that control mitochondrial dna replication all of which are encoded for by genes in the nuclear dna may also cause mitochondrial dna mutations most mitochondrial function and biogenesis is controlled by nuclear dna human mitochondrial dna encodes 13 proteins of the respiratory chain while most of the estimated 1500 proteins and components targeted to mitochondria are nuclearencoded defects in nuclearencoded mitochondrial genes are associated with hundreds of clinical disease phenotypes including anemia dementia hypertension lymphoma retinopathy seizures and neurodevelopmental disorders 10a study by yale university researchers published in the february 12 2004 issue of the new england journal of medicine explored the role of mitochondria in insulin resistance among the offspring of patients with type 2 diabetes 11 other studies have shown that the mechanism may involve the interruption of the mitochondrial signaling process in body cells  intramyocellular lipids  a study conducted at the pennington biomedical research center in baton rouge louisiana 12 showed that this in turn partially disables the genes that produce mitochondria examples  editexamples of mitochondrial diseases include mitochondrial myopathy diabetes mellitus and deafness dadthis combination at an early age can be due to mitochondrial disease diabetes mellitus and deafness can be found together for other

editthe effective overall energy unit for the available body energy is referred to as the daily glycogen generation capacity 13 14 15 and is used to compare the mitochondrial output of healthy individuals to that of afflicted or chronically glycogendepleted individuals this value is slow to change in a given individual as it takes between 18 and 24 months to complete a full cycle 14the glycogen generation capacity is entirely dependent on and determined by the operating levels of the mitochondria in all of the cells of the human body 16 however the relation between the energy generated by the mitochondria and the glycogen capacity is very loose and is mediated by many biochemical pathways 13 the energy output of full healthy mitochondrial function can be predicted exactly by a complicated theoretical argument but this argument is not straightforward as most energy is consumed by the brain and is not easily measurable diagnosis  editmitochondrial diseases are usually detected by analysing muscle samples where the presence of these organelles is higher the most common tests for the detection of these diseases are southern blot to detect big deletions or duplications pcr and specific mutation analysis sequencing treatments  editalthough research is ongoing treatment options are currently limited vitamins are frequently prescribed though the evidence for their effectiveness is limited 17 pyruvate has been proposed in 2007 as a treatment option 18nacetyl cysteine reverses many models of mitochondrial dysfunction 19 in the case of mood disorders specifically bipolar disorder it is hypothesized that nacetylcysteine nac acetyllcarnitine alcar sadenosylmethionine same coenzyme q10 co q10 alphalipoic acid ala creatine monohydrate cm and melatonin could be potential treatment options 20gene therapy prior to conception  editspindle transfer where the nuclear dna is transferred to another healthy egg cell leaving the defective mitochondrial dna behind is a potential treatment procedure that has been successfully carried out on monkeys 21 22 using a similar pronuclear transfer technique researchers at newcastle university led by douglass turnbull successfully transplanted healthy dna in human eggs from women with mitochondrial disease into the eggs of women donors who were unaffected 23 24 in such cases ethical questions have been raised regarding biological motherhood since the child receives genes and gene regulatory molecules from two different women using genetic engineering in attempts to produce babies free of mitochondrial disease is controversial in some circles and raises important ethical issues 25 26 a male baby was born in mexico in 2016 from a mother with leigh syndrome using spindle transfer 27in september 2012 a public consultation was launched in the uk to explore the ethical issues involved 28 human genetic engineering was used on a small scale to allow infertile women with genetic defects in their mitochondria to have children 29 in june 2013 the united kingdom government agreed to develop legislation that would legalize the threeperson ivf  procedure as a treatment to fix or eliminate mitochondrial diseases that are passed on from mother to child the procedure could be offered from 29 october 2015 once regulations had been established 30 31 32 embryonic mitochondrial transplant and protofection have been proposed as a possible treatment for inherited mitochondrial disease and allotopic expression of mitochondrial proteins as a radical treatment for mt dna mutation load currently human clinical trials are underway at gen sight biologics clinical trialsgov  nct02064569 and the university of miami clinical trialsgov  nct02161380 to examine the safety and efficacy of mitochondrial gene therapy in lebers hereditary optic neuropathy epidemiology  editabout 1 in 4000 children in the united states will develop mitochondrial disease by the age of 10 years up to 4000 children per year in the us are born with a type of mitochondrial disease 33 because mitochondrial disorders contain many variations and subsets some particular mitochondrial disorders are very rare the average number of births per year among women at risk for transmitting mt dna disease is estimated to approximately 150 in the united kingdom and 800 in the united states 34history  editthe first pathogenic mutation in mitochondrial dna was identified in 1988 from that time to 2016 around 275 other diseasecausing mutations were identified 35 37notable cases  editnotable people who suffered from mitochondrial disease include mattie stepanek a poet peace advocate and motivational speaker who suffered from dysautonomic mitochondrial myopathy and who died at age 13 rocco baldelli a coach and former center fielder in major league baseball who had to retire from active play at age 29 due to mitochondrial channelopathy charlie gard a british boy who suffered from mitochondrial dna
