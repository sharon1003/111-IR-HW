a question view user questions thrive weight loss patch overview the market for weight loss supplements and aids is huge almost everyone goes through at least a time in their life when they want to lose weight andor get in shape our cultural focus on body image certainly goes a long way toward causing this phenomena we can talk about that subject all day but the fact remains people want to lose weight and companies want to capitalize on their desire thrive weight loss patch is a product that comes from a company called level they make several health and lifestyle products which they sell through a network of distributors the use a multilevel marketing program where they enlist distributors to collect a network of distributors with the idea that eventually everyone is making money hand over fist you may have your opinion about these kinds of products and selling schemes but the main thing i’ve noticed over the years is that it makes it difficult to distinguish between selling the product and selling the money making program but we’re here to look into the product so we’ll get back to that thrive weight loss patch ingredients and how they work thrive weight loss patch uses what they call dft or derma fusion technology to deliver the fat fighting ingredients directly to your blood stream through your skin apply the patch like a band aid to an areal of clean and dry skin on your upper arm shoulder lower back or chest and leave it on for 24 hours the dft technology time release the ingredients to keep your weight loss program in check the ingredients include fors lean which may have benefits for weight loss though studies are inconclusive green coffee bean extract which contains components that increase metabolism garcinia cambogia which may shrink fat cells and help fat migrate for use as energy co q10 which is an antioxidant to protect cells against oxidative damage white willow bark which can help burn fat and increase metabolism cosmoperine which increases the absorption rate of the other ingredients where to buy as we stated earlier thrive weight loss patch is available with other thrive products through a network of distributors that you can find online and elsewhere in order to purchase it you’ll need to get in touch with a distributor they’ll start by telling you the price but they’ll move on pretty quickly to telling you why you should buy an entire program and heck start selling the stuff too that’s because if you sign up through them to sell thrive products they’ll get a commission off everything you sell and everything everyone you sign up sells too these distributors stand to make a lot of money by signing you up to sell products thrive weight loss patch pros and cons advantages of thrive weight loss patch a patch may be more convenient for some people than taking pills it’s got several of the same ingredients as many successful weight loss products disadvantages of thrive weight loss patch there are tons of negative thrive weight loss patch reviews on amazon they say it’s way too expensive it doesn’t work and it contains lots of hidden caffeine possible to a dangerous level but it’s tough to say because it’s hidden in other ingredients you can’t buy it or try it without getting a whole hardsell pitch about how you should sell it conclusion the idea of a patch to deliver herbal ingredients is a solid one but thrive weight loss patch isn’t where you should start it opens a whole can of worms that unless you’re looking for a new career using high pressure sales tactics you don’t want to open have you
