hsu vtf3 mk3 for several years and its been amazing so far ive owned this sub for about 5 or 6 years now it was a used purchase and quite frankly who knows how long the previous owner had it before he sold it to me but ive never had an ounce of problem from the sub the amp is running perfectly and its been a side table for my couch for the longest no one notices that it is anything but a table ive recently been gifted an old motorcycle from a friend and i was trying to figure out how to repay him i know that he is building his home theater on a tight budget and he currently doesnt have a sub he was thinking to build a dayton or get a bic america sub i offered him my mk3 sub at first he refused because he didnt want to accept payment for the motorcycle but i convinced him that it was because i would use it as an excuse to get a different sub i had lots of thoughts to replace the mk3 with something from svs but i kept coming back around to the vtf3 mk5 the mk3 worked beautifully in my 3000 cubic feet room so far and im sure that the mk5 will do even better i am not quite sure what to expect since i was so satisfied with the last sub this new one will have more tuning options im also curious as to what the q control would do for my room either way itll be here in a few days and ill let you guys know what i think be warned though my ears are not as sharp as some of your well honed

sharp as some of your well honed ears your acuity doesnt really matter though because in the end all that does is how you think it sounds so long as youre satisfied the rest is pretty much irrelevant that being said knowing first hand how the mk5 sounds means i can pretty much guess what your reaction will be something like this btw nice gesture on your part friends do for each other double bonus is you get a brand new sub out of the deal and a motorcycle to bootive sjtrance and chromejob like thisjim if you take yourself too seriously expect me to do the exact oppositethe jman is offline rules quote quick replypost 46 of 67old 041416 0522 pmsjtrance new member join date jul 2010location nycposts 3re hsu research vtf3 mk5 hp discussion thread so ive been using it for a couple of days now and i love it it seems to have the same amounts of thunder as the old one but the bass seems smoother maybe its less distortion the mk3 was still such a monster in my space that i cant say that i feel a huge difference do these subwoofers have a break in where they sound different with more use side note i tried to put in their test cd into my ps4 and it doesnt seem to support that format i have to find another way to play it sjtrance is offline rules quote quick replypost 47 of 67old 041416 0917 pm thread starterthe jman hts moderator reviewer jim join date mar 2012location new joisey

have a break in where they sound different with more use pretty much everything mechanical has some level of breakin period and a sub driver is no different but will it sound different probably nothing you would be able to detect without a microphone and measurement gear you may sense that it becomes a bit more refined but if you do notice anything it would be quite subtlejim if you take

research vtf3 mk5 hp discussion thread thanks jman i watched pacific rim on blu ray today and there is definitely a difference i can discern first off i keep forgetting how much better the video and
