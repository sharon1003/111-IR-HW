archived and not archived all your messages are in all mail messages you receive are in all mail and you can see them also thru inbox if you apply a label they are in all mail and you can see thru inbox and thru label if you archive a message you are removing the inbox tag and now you can see it only in all mail or thru a label if you have applied one before archiving re how do i retrieve archived emailtkb193681610 303 amall mail and archives are the same re how do i retrieve archived email theo goldin82110 750 pmit seems impossible that there is no simple way to view only archived messages but this appears to be the situation all mail is a virtually useless concept to me as it includes everything i want to find specifically the messages i have archived so i can delete most of them and free up storage space looking at all mail is impossible as i have 25 gb of mail help re how do i retrieve archived emailcarehart83110 1111 am yes ill 1 this request to be able to find only archived mail i understand how those with technical knowledge of things are answering accurately that all mail includes both archived and unarchived messages and yes if one knows the characteristics of the messages they have archived that they are now looking for then yes they can find them in all email but i think some here and i are asking something different what if one is trying to find a message they had mistakenly archived but what if they dont know the from subject or other fields are because they realized too late they had checked next to the wrong message before archiving yes you may say just browse by date but what they dont know the messages date because the inbox was ordered in other than date order when they mistakenly archived a message sure some may feel that a system ought not cater to people who make mistakes but its an easy one to make perhaps the answer is that clicking archive couldshould also add a label of archived rather than just remove the label of inbox that would solve the problem but i realize it may take years before its considered in the meantime is there perhaps any trick anyone may know to show only archived messages for those who may want to do this for whatever reason re how do i retrieve archived emailcarehart83110 1147 am i have found a trick that will work at least for some since what archiving does is remove the inbox label you can use the following search criteria at the top of any gmail mailbox page ininbox insent indraft the first part says effectively dont show me messages that have the inbox label the rest prevents it showing you things in sent and draft i find that you dont need to worry about things in spam or trash again the key is the first criteria not labelled as inbox if you have items in your inbox they do not show up with this search so its a nice shortcut to in effect search all mail for items that are archived the better thing still would be for google to mark archived items with an archived label and add a builtin button to show only those but until then this should help some people re how do i retrieve archived emailm4649839110 625 am regarding careharts question what if one is trying to find a message they had mistakenly archived but what if they dont know the from subject or other fields are because they realized too late they had checked next to the wrong message before archiving i searched email using  and select the emails i like to restore or simply select all then use the button called move to inbox in the search result page the move to button renmed to move to inbox if there are more than one pages of search results you have to go to next page to repeat selection and move actions re how do i retrieve archived emailcarehart9210 954 am  m464983 sorry but i dont see how thats a response to the problem i raised youre talking about how to select archived messages to restore them to the inbox thats not at all what i was discussing which was how to find only archived messages and since you quote my note i assume you really were intending to respond to me and not someone else earlier in the thread here so thanks but no im afraid thats not going to help me but did you see my subsequent note sent after my first but a day before yours there i offered what seems to be a solution to the problem how to find only archived messages would love to hear if anyone else tries it and points out any problems with the proposed solution re how do i retrieve archived email magnus m9510 1255 am hello having an issue with i phone activesync and found this thread activesync  gmail archives everything i delete so i used the above search string to find my archived email and it works very wellininbox insent indraft i delete 20 mails at a time and looked out for the few ones i wanted to keep i recommend anyone to switch to the imap settings at least on an i phone if they want deleted mail to be really deleted re how do i retrieve archived email mynhard91410 652 pmafter applying the ininbox insent indraft search you could also add a quick link while youre on the search results page and name it archived only say in future you would merely need to click on the new link in order to view only archived emails re how do i retrieve archived emaildarlinekonta91910 937 amfirst of all is it true that once you send your messages to trash they cannot be retrieved if so would a system restore recover them re how do i retrieve archived emailsvtross11810 849 pmperhaps they should use a different term  archive has meaning as is clear here it means to be kept safely for some future purpose so why mislead people just hire personnel who are trained in information science and fix your interface instead of forcing everyone to have to reorient to the whims of a couple of programmers re how do i retrieve archived emailwdurham11810 1024 pm darlinekonta  your query is quite different to the issue being dealt with  if you send messages to trash you can recover them easily go to trash select the messages you want to remove and move toinbox this assumes you have not already emptied the trash and also that the trashed messages have been trashed within the last 30 days if that is the case then the messages cannot be recovered if you access your mail using a web browser a system restore will not recover deleted messages as they are not stored on your computer but in the cloud on the gmail servers even if you have them stored in an email client they are unlikely to be retrieved by using a system restore as system restore does not alter data only programs and settings
