many photos from every imaginable view edit them choose the best ones and then store them on your computer descriptions look at ads other people have written about the same brand year and model as your coach and copy what the items that apply to yours keep the ad simple use lists rather than wordy descriptions make sure the ad is accurate and grammatically correct store it on a computer so that

nonrefundable down payment in the thousands of dollars you are taking your unit off the market which means you lose other potential buyers while you are waiting to close the current deal most people
