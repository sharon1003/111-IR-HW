posts  4 years 12 days ago as the title says i want to discuss the differences of digital and physical purchases of video games compare pros and cons and hear different opinions so i would to start with the digital purchases as i think is a trend which is here to stay purchasing a game digitally has many pros that really make our lives a lot easier first of all for all the hardcore gamers that count every second after a game is released untill they play it i think you will all agree that digital copies have a major advantage here as you can download the game the second its been released and if sony develops its new feature where the game will be already downloaded and ready to play the second that it is released then there will be no more discussion on that matter second of all you can purchase and download a game without going to a storelets say its really cold outside and rainning really hard how would you go to a store and buy the game that you want physical copies can be ruined if you are not very careful or sometimes it might not even be your fault my xbox 360 ruined a couple of cds for reasons that remain unknownwhile the only danger that you deal with when bying games digitally is forgetting your password or having it hacked both problems have a not so hard solution  one thing that i personally count as an advantage of having a digital library of games instead of a physical one is the fact you dont have to change the disc in order to change the gamewhenever i play on my ps4 i sit on my sofa which isnt very far from my console but still i have to stand up go wait for the disc to come out and put the other disc inwhy not just press the ps button and just pick another game to play of course i accept the fact that many of you wont see this as a pro or a conof course nothing is perfect and so digital downloads have some disadvantagesi think what im about to mention is considered a very rare occasion but lets say that you just bought a new game digitally and suddenly your internet goes down for some reasonyou are no longer able to play the game untill your internet is fixed some gamers prefer to be offline at all times not connecting their console or pc to the internet at all these games cant use the digital purchase feature another disadvantage which is only happening to last gen consoles is space requirmentdigitally downloading a game means you have to install is something which you have to do anyway in the next gen consoles but last gen dont require physical copies to be installed for you to play last thing to mention is the pricei dont know if this is a fact about every country but in my country digital copies of a game cost 1015 less euros than the physical copie eg infamous cost 6999 and i bought it at ps store for 5999something i want to add is the fact that releasing a game digitally is also more convinient for the developersmostly refering to indie industry which is offering more and more awesome games that are never released in physical copies now lets talk about the physical purchases and want proscon do they have starting off with pros i think every gamer is also in a way a collectorwe compare our libraries with othersour special edition items with others and our games are something we are proud ofbut when you buy a game digitally theres no box or cd to show to your friends many might not notice it but to us gamers the box holds a great value how many times have you been excited to have a game that you go over the manual 510 timesor look at the back of the box to see some pictures of ingame content and read the amazing phrases and quotes that you are going to meet in the gamebuying your games digitally also means you have to say goodbye to these thingssome gamers wont mind saying goodbye to boxes and manuals as digital download seem to be more convinient but others wont even consider leaving behind the physical copies second advantage of physical purchases is the fact you can share your games way easier than sharing digital games if its possible i havent looked into it at allyou just take your cd to a friend and you just shared your gamei have already mentioned the disadvantages of physical copies i will just summarize them real quick cds can be ruined you have to change the cd to play a different game sometimes physical copies can be more costy you will have to be more patient to play a game if you want to buy it physically all the things i mentioned in the previous paragraphs are things that i notice in my gaming hours all the pros and cons are my personal opinion i havent looked into forums about this subjectso theres a fair chance ive missed a lot of pros and cons about both digital and physical purchasesalso if some of the facts i present above are wrong please do tellalso id like to hear your opinion hrtrulz01member since december 2 2006posts 15399hrtrulz01follow forum posts 15399 followed by 0reviews 0 stacks 0 forum karma 02 posted by hrtrulz01 15399 posts

dvds and blu ray are just stupid why 1 you have to physically remove a disc to play or watch something different with a digital library you have access to everything everywhere at anytime at the push of a button 2 you have to have space in your living quarters to store a bunch of pointless waste of space boxes its nice to be able to use shelves for something more purposeful than storing a bunch of nerd boxes on 3 makes moving and travel easier no need to weigh yourself down with a bunch of cases discs etc 4 better for the environment no waste of resources to create plastic cases discs and paper inserts and covers 5 its modern im surprised technologies still ship with disc drives its a waste of space on the device that serves absolutely no purpose in the modern world its not 19956 waste of space for stores stores could sell something actually useful rather than devoting shelf space to an archaic media form you dont see vhs sections at walmart why the hell are there still dvds blu rays

play these games because the activation server will not be around anymore at least for console games they dont have this yet but its likely m and sony will make a backdoor deal and force it into their
