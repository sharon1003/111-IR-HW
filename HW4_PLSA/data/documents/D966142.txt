your guide andrew cunningham whether you’re replacing an existing solidstate drive or upgrading from a traditional hard drive to get better performance almost every ssd you can buy today is great but some are still better than others if you need to buy a sata ssd right now we think the 500 gb crucial mx500 is the best option for most people the mx500 isn’t the fastest sata ssd you can get but it comes close and it has the best combination of price performance and capacity of any drive you can buy our pick crucial mx500the best ssdthe crucial mx500 has an affordable price performs well boasts a fiveyear warranty and comes from an established company with a good track record125  from amazonat the time of publishing the price was 135 the crucial mx500 is just a little slower than samsung’s more expensive sata ssds in most benchmarks but most people wouldn’t notice the difference it’s as good as or better than the rest of the competition and it performs better when full or nearfull than its predecessor the mx300 it supports fulldisk encryption and crucial offers a fiveyear warranty on the drive for more peace of mind three years is typical a 25inch version is available now and an m2 sata version will be available soon and even though it’s a brandnew model it still sells for significantly less than samsung’s ssds runnerup samsung 860 evo a little better but more expensive the 860 evo is a little faster and should last longer than our main pick but unless you really need the durability or an m sata drive you should wait until the price drops144  from amazon150 from samsungat the time of publishing the price was 150 samsung’s 860 evo replaces the 850 evo which was our top ssd pick for nearly three years compared with both its predecessor and the crucial mx500 the 860 evo is a little faster and offers much better durability and in addition to the 25inch and m2 versions it’s available as an m sata drive unlike the mx500 and most other modern ssds it’s the drive to get if you can’t find the crucial and we expect the price to drop which will make this drive even more compelling for now however it’s more expensive than the mx500 especially for 1 tb and higher capacities and its advantages are things most people wouldn’t notice upgrade pick samsung 960 evo higher performance higher price the pcie samsung 960 evo is much faster than any sata drive but it costs more and will work only in newer higherend pcs so it’s overkill for most people234 from amazon200 from samsung any good sata ssd will help your pc boot quickly speed up app launches and load times for games and generally make your computer more responsive most people including gamers don’t need anything faster but serious video and photo editors server admins cad designers software developers and other people with workstationstyle demands—anyone who frequently loads and saves large files—may benefit from a faster drive if that describes you choose the pcie samsung 960 evo which can reach quadruple the read speeds of the fastest sata drives and more than double the write speeds it’s more expensive—typically 100 more than the crucial mx500 for 500 gb and almost 200 more for 1 tb—and you’ll need a desktop or an m2 pcie–equipped laptop to use it just remember that the difference between a sata ssd and a pcie ssd isn’t as noticeable as the difference between a sata ssd and a

spent more than six years writing about pcs and other gadgets for anand tech and ars technica and has been building and upgrading pcs for more than 15 years nathan edwards the senior editor on this guide tested dozens of ssds for maximum pc between 2008 and 2012 watching as they progressed from errorplagued extremely expensive and not much better than mechanical hard drives to reliable only moderately expensive and much better than mechanical drives since 2013 when we began recommending ssds we’ve been in contact with storage experts learning all there is to know about ssd technology and gathering insights from the professionals who benchmark these drives for a living there’s nothing we could learn by running our own benchmarks that we can’t get from the experts’ numbers—been there done that—so we usually don’t test these drives ourselves instead we consider experts’ benchmarks in the context of our knowledge of what most people actually need in an ssd and we recommend the best drives for each type of person who this is for buying an ssd is a great way to upgrade almost any one to fiveyearold computer that has a traditional hard drive ssds are much faster than hard drives at everything from booting to loading games to opening and switching between apps and today’s ssds are larger cheaper and faster than the ssds of yesteryear in general you should spend the money only if you plan on keeping your computer for at least another year or if you know you can move your new ssd to your next computer there’s no sense in upgrading a machine that you’re about to replace if your computer already has an ssd the only real reason to get a different ssd is if you’re running out of room on the first one if your drive is consistently more than 75 or 80 percent full upgrading to a larger ssd is worth considering since full ssds are slower and wear out faster than drives with plenty of free space most people wouldn’t notice a speed difference between two different ssds unless they’re writing huge files every single day—editing 4k video files working with huge spreadsheets and databases or designing in auto cad or other 3dmodeling software—and care about a few seconds’ worth of improvement regardless of which ssd you buy you’re not likely to notice any lag when you’re firing up most apps or launching games if you have a desktop pc with room for multiple drives and you need more than 500 gb of storage consider using our ssd pick for the operating system and programs and adding a traditional hard drive or two for media storage though ssds are much less expensive than they once were they’re still less economical than traditional hard drives for huge multiterabyte music and video libraries if your computer already has an ssd the only real reason to get a different ssd is if you run out of room on the first one upgrading to an ssd can make a huge difference if you’re coming from a mechanical hard drive and to maximize that advantage you should also upgrade your ram if your computer has 4 gb or less for most people 8 gb of ram is plenty and should provide a noticeable speed boost in daytoday use crucial has a handy page to help you find what memory your computer needs mac owners should think twice about an ssd upgrade though you can upgrade some older mostly pre2013 mac books with standard sata drives you can’t do the same with the newest mac books and mac book pros laptops from 2013 2014 or 2015 often support such upgrades but only with specialized expensive drives from just a couple of manufacturers for all the messy details skip down to the mac section  as such we’ve aimed this guide mostly at nonmac owners what you need to know about ssds from left to right a 25inch sata ssd an m sata ssd an m2 sata ssd and an m2 pcie ssd you can tell sata and pcie m2 drives apart by looking at their connectors photo andrew cunningham if you have a computer with a mechanical hard drive that drive is likely the slowest part of your system the rest of the computer has to wait around for information to be read from or written to the drive everything you do that requires accessing data on your hard drive—like booting up or shutting down saving and loading files launching an app or starting up a game or rendering a video—will be much faster on an ssd unlike traditional hard drives ssds don’t have any moving parts which means they’re much less prone to mechanical failure in fact they’re better than standard hard drives in almost every respect they use much less power put out much less heat and don’t vibrate sata ssds are three or four times faster than standard hard drives in sequential reads and writes pci express ssds are as much as seven times faster than sata models ssds are still more expensive than mechanical drives for the same amount of storage and the biggest hard drives can still hold more data than the most capacious ssds but the price gap is narrowing a decent ssd cost 3 per gigabyte in 2010 and 1 per gigabyte in 2012 in 2018 you can get a great ssd for between 25¢ and 30¢ per gigabyte a good mechanical hard drive meanwhile costs less than 5¢ per gigabyte and people are keeping more data in cloud storage and less on their computers—you may not need as much storage space as you did a few years ago if you have a computer with a mechanical hard drive that drive is likely the slowest part of your system before you buy it’s important to figure out what kind of ssd fits your computer at the moment you can find two different interfaces for data transfer sata and pcie two different transfer protocols ahci and nvme and four common physical connectors and form factors 25inch sata m sata m2 sata and m2 pcie yep it can get confusing here’s a quick breakdown of the terminology sata refers to both a physical connection type and the informationtransfer protocol that it carries you can find the physical connector on 35inch and 25inch hard drives as well as many ssds if you have a desktop or a larger laptop it can probably take a 25inch sata drive you’ll want to get a 25inch–to–35inch ssd mounting bracket if your desktop can fit only 35inch drives drives using the sata protocol also come with physically smaller m sata and m2 connectors the current sata iii standard can transfer data at a rate of around 600 mbs which most modern drives max out 1 unless your machine has an m2 pcie or fullsize pcie slot you can’t get an ssd that’s any faster pci express pcie is a faster interface that’s capable of datatransfer rates of up to 985 mbs per “lane” most pcie ssds use a two or fourlane interface which gives you between 1970 mbs of bandwidth for two lanes and 3940 mbs for four lanes that’s 33 and 65 times faster than sata respectively pcie drives for newer desktop motherboards and almost all ultrabooks are m2 cards though you can get fullsize pcie adapters for m2 drives that will fit in most recent desktops m2 pcie ssds tend to use more power than their sata counterparts which can slightly increase heat and reduce battery life in notebooks m2 is a type of physical connector for both sata and pcie ssds it’s present in most ultrabooks and highend desktops m2 drives come in a variety of sizes m2 2280 22 mm wide by 80 mm long is the most common but shorter m2 2242 22 mm wide by 42 mm long drives are easy to find too m2 pcie drives can also come in three different “keyings” which determine how many pcie lanes the drive uses when you’re buying an m2 drive it’s important to make sure you’re getting the right interface type size and keying for your machine but the process is not as scary as it might sound almost all current m2 drives are 2280 most sata ssds use bm keying and pcie drives usually use m keying nvme is an interface protocol for pcie drives taking the place of the earlier ahci protocol used with sata ssds and hard drives designed from the ground up to work with ssds and other flash memory it allows for much faster read and write speeds most pcie ssds now use nvmem sata drives were present in many ultrabooks before m2 became common most new laptops use m2 but many ultrabooks with m sata ports are still around and replacement m sata ssds are still available though they are becoming rare m sata drives generally perform just like their 25inch and m2 sata counterparts if you have a laptop check the manufacturer’s website or use crucial’s upgradeadvisor tools to figure out what drive type your computer uses and whether you can replace the drive be aware that some laptops—recent mac book air and pro models for example—use proprietary designs that may make it difficult or impossible to perform a diy upgrade how many gigabytes do you need right now most people should get a 500 gb ssd unless you know you need more 2 don’t get an ssd with less than 250 gb of storage if at all possible ssds with 128 gb or less capacity don’t leave enough room for an operating system plus most people’s stuff and both 128 gb and 250 gb drives are slower and significantly less costeffective than larger drives at the other extreme 1 tb and 2 tb drives run even with or a little cheaper than 500 gb drives in pergigabyte pricing and they’re often faster too but their 260andup price tags aren’t worth the investment unless you know you’ll need more than 500 gb of space if you’re buying a new computer from a company like dell hp or lenovo you can sometimes save money by ordering a computer with a smaller ssd or a mechanical hard drive and replacing that with a larger ssd yourself be careful though some laptop manufacturers make it very difficult to upgrade the drive either soldering it to the motherboard or requiring complicated warrantyvoiding disassembly to gain access to the ssd make sure your new laptop is easily upgradable before going this route right now most people should get a 500 gb ssd smaller drives are slower and more expensive per gigabyte while larger drives cost more than most people should spend on upgrading an old computer drives with larger capacities also tend to be faster that’s because much of an ssd’s speed advantage comes from parallelization writing for anand tech back in 2014 kristian vättö explained “a single nand die isn’t very fast but when you put a dozen or more of them in parallel the performance adds up” 3 if your drive has fewer modules than your controller can write to at once that is if it has a lower capacity it won’t be as fast as it could be although 500 gb ssds aren’t bad with today’s ssds you’ll get the best speeds from 1 tb or 2 tb drives how we picked photo andrew cunningham for the latest update to this guide we spent around four hours researching eight new drives released since our previous update in august 2017 from there we checked amazon listings and owner reviews for all of the drives weeding out some older models drives lacking 500 gb or higher capacities and models with particularly poor reviews we then read reviews from the sites that we know do great ssd testing—primarily anand tech but also cnet tom’s hardware the ssd review storage reviewcom the tech report and a few others—and pored over benchmarks for the 12 drives that made the cut we then used trusted thirdparty reviews and manufacturer product pages to compare the drives based on these criteria a good price moreexpensive ssds are often better ssds but you don’t want to overpay to get extra performance or other features you likely wouldn’t notice or use good performance speed is the main reason to buy an ssd after all we checked reviews to make sure that the drives hit their advertised performance figures and that they would continue to feel speedy over time a capacity at or near 500 gb which currently represents a good mix of value capacity and speed although 1 tb drives usually offer better performance and cost a little less per gigabyte than 500 gb drives they’re still overkill for most people in the era of pervasive cloud storage for sata drives both 25inch and m2 versions for maximum compatibility with different kinds of systems we preferred those versions because the older m sata is increasingly rare and thus wasn’t a top priority a decent warranty threeyear warranties are the standard but higherend drives sometimes come with five or even 10year warranties which help them stand out from the crowd durability you can write to flashmemory cells only so many times before they wear out while most people will never come anywhere near this limit during the normal lifetime of a drive higher endurance is a plus we also considered a few things that not everyone will need but that are nice to have if you can get them native support for driveencryption acceleration wasn’t a requirement for us but all of our picks ended up including it this feature is primarily important for businesses with specific dataprivacy requirements but it’s a nice bonus for the privacyminded drives with native encryption support can offload the work of encrypting and decrypting data from your cpu saving power and boosting speed many ssds include free datamigration software which is a great bonus if you’re upgrading a computer with a lot of files or settings you don’t want to transfer manually our pick crucial mx500photo andrew cunningham our pick crucial mx500the best ssdthe crucial mx500 has an affordable price performs well boasts a fiveyear warranty and comes from an established company with a good track record125  from amazonat the time of publishing the price was 135 if we were upgrading a laptop or buying the primary drive for a desktop we’d buy crucial’s 500 gb mx500 available in both 25inch and m2 sata versions it’s one of the cheapest bigname ssds you can buy it’s fast enough and capacious enough for most people and it offers useful features like hardware encryption support and a fiveyear warranty a handful of sata drives—including our runnerup pick samsung’s 860 evo—are a little faster and use a bit less power than the mx500 but no ssds currently offer such an excellent combination of speed and features for the price you wouldn’t notice a speed difference between the mx500 and much more expensive sata drives in use drive benchmarks from reviewers at anand tech and tom’s hardware show that the mx500 is occasionally 10 to 20 percent slower in some individual tests than samsung’s 860 evo drives but its overall performance is better than that of the rest of the competition and near the limits of the sata interface compared with the previousgeneration mx300 the mx500 improves performance when the drive is full or nearfull one of the mx300’s major shortcomings a handful of sata drives are a little faster and use a bit less power than the mx500 but no ssds currently offer such an excellent combination of speed and features for the price in a review of the 1 tb version of the mx500 anand tech’s billy tallis writes “it isn’t at the top of every benchmark … but for most users there’s no need to pay any extra for the performance of a samsung drive” in a review of the 500 gb version tallis says that while it is slower than the 1 tb version it still comes with no major shortcomings and is “easy to recommend”crucial offers the mx500 in a typical range of capacities the 25inch sata drive is available in 250 gb 500 gb 1 tb and 2 tb versions while the m2 sata drive comes in 250 gb 500 gb and 1 tb versions crucial doesn’t make an m sata version of the mx500 so if you’re using an older ultrabook that needs such a drive look at our runnerup pick instead the 500 gb mx500’s limited warranty lasts for five years or 180 terabytes written tbw whichever comes first 4 that coverage is not quite as good as samsung’s fiveyear 300 tbw warranty for the 500 gb version of the 860 evo but you would still need to completely fill up the mx500 once every 10 days to even come close to wearing that drive out in less than five years most people just don’t use their computers that way and the people who do would be better served by our upgrade pick’s speed boost anyway the mx500 supports native encryption acceleration—something not found in most ssds in its price range including the wd blue 3d nand the san disk ultra 3d and crucial’s own bx300 —and comes with a windowsonly license for the acronis true image datatransfer software if you need help moving your stuff over from your old drive the also windowsonly crucial storage executive software comes in handy if you want to monitor your drive’s health or install firmware updates and crucial includes a spacer 75 mm to 9 mm with the 25inch version of the mx500 so it can fit more snugly in older laptops designed to use thicker hard drives flaws but not dealbreakers anand tech’s testing shows that the mx500 uses a little more power than most drives it’s not a huge problem—your processor graphics card and screen have a bigger effect on power usage than your ssd does—but using the mx500 in a laptop may shave a few minutes off your system’s battery life runnerup samsung 860 evo photo andrew cunningham runnerup samsung 860 evo a little better but more expensive the 860 evo is a little faster and should last longer than our main pick but unless you really need the durability or an m sata drive you should wait until the price drops144  from amazon150 from samsungat the time of publishing the price was 150 samsung’s 860 evo is as good as or better than the crucial mx500 in almost every metric it’s a little faster it consumes less power it has much higher endurance it comes in 25inch m sata and m2 versions and it has the same fiveyear warranty and encryption support it’s also your best option if you need an m sata ssd but at this writing it’s more expensive than the mx500 at every capacity especially 1 tb and 2 tb most people wouldn’t notice the differences between the 860 evo and the mx500 and people who need something faster or with greater endurance should be looking at pci express ssds like our upgrade pick if the two drives were the same price or nearly so the 860 evo would be our pick but for now most people shouldn’t spend any more money than it takes to get the mx500 the 860 evo replaces the 850 evo which was our main ssd pick for three years that drive was already butting up against the limits of the sata interface and the 860 evo’s performance is similar overall—that is to say very good according to anand tech’s billy tallis “the improvements are measurable if otherwise usually imperceptible” the 860 evo is between 10 and 20 percent faster in some individual tests than the crucial mx500 and its power consumption is slightly lower but most people wouldn’t notice the difference between them in everyday use the m2 version of the samsung 860 evo it also comes in 25inch sata and m sata versions photo andrew cunningham you can find a version of the 860 evo for more computers than the mx500 since samsung sells an m sata version as well as 25inch sata and m2 sata versions the 25inch drive comes in 250 gb 500 gb 1 tb 2 tb and 4 tb capacities the m2 and m sata drives both include 250 gb 500 gb and 1 tb capacities but the m2 version stops at 2 tb and the m sata version tops out at 1 tb samsung’s limited warranty covers the drive for five years or 300 terabytes written tbw whichever comes first 5 that’s a step up from crucial’s fiveyear 180 tbw warranty for the mx500 most people will be just fine with crucial’s lower tbw rating but if you’re editing and saving huge video files or databases every single day and you can’t step up to a faster pci express drive the 860 evo’s higher endurance might be worth paying for like the mx500 the 860 evo supports driveencryption acceleration a useful security feature that cheaper ssds often lack samsung also offers some windowsonly software tools a datamigration app to help you copy stuff from old drives and the samsung magician software to handle everything from drive checkups to performance tweaks to firmware updates upgrade pick samsung 960 evo photo samsung upgrade pick samsung 960 evo higher performance higher price the pcie samsung 960 evo is much faster than any sata drive but it costs more and will work only in newer higherend pcs so it’s overkill for most people234 from amazon200 from samsung owners of newer laptops or desktop motherboards who truly need more speed should buy samsung’s 960 evo this model combines performance that’s significantly faster than sata with the great reputation of samsung’s ssd controllers and flash memory as well as the hardware encryption support that many other m2 pcie drives lack the biggest downside is its basic threeyear warranty two years less coverage than the 860 evo’s warranty offers the 960 evo manages to run somewhere between two and four times faster than any sata ssd in most tasks and to cost much less than the 960 pro our previous upgrade pick at the same capacities but it’s more expensive than our top pick the crucial mx500 as of this writing you’ll pay about 100 more for a 500 gb 960 evo and almost 200 more for a 1 tb version most people wouldn’t notice the difference between an m2 pcie drive and a sata drive for most tasks—the difference between any two decent ssds isn’t as noticeable as the gap between an ssd and a hard disk—but if you have a newer highend system and you edit video or photos the 960 evo could be worth the extra cost if you want to cut down load times reviewers like the 960 evo’s mix of price and performance but acknowledge that the 960 pro is the faster drive overall in a review billy tallis of anand tech praises the 1 tb version of the drive for its performance consistency over time and its speed relative to competing drives from toshiba intel and plextor techspot’s steven walton says that the 500 gb and 1 tb versions are “outstanding” and have an “unmatched price vs performance ratio” chris ramseyer of tom’s hardware is more measured in his praise of the drive and recommends staying away from the 250 gb version entirely because it doesn’t match the performance of highercapacity versions the 1 tb version still earned an editor recommended award however and ramseyer writes that the 500 gb version is “reliable and provides a fair warranty and acceptable price”installation if you want to copy your existing hard drive over to your ssd before you install it you’ll need cloning software and sometimes additional hardware all of our recommended ssds come with access to windowsonly cloning software mxclass crucial drives including the mx500 come with a license key for acronis true image hd software samsung’s ssds all ship with samsung’s datamigration software otherwise you can use the free mini tool partition wizard on a mac if you can install a new drive at all you can use carbon copy cloner or the builtin disk utility you’ll need a way to connect your new drive to your computer while you’re cloning the old one desktop owners need only to hook up the ssd to spare power and data cables in their pc but laptop owners with 25inch sata drives need a satatousb enclosure or adapter some ssds come with upgrade kits that include a satatousb adapter but getting the driveonly version and buying an enclosure separately is usually less expensive if you’re buying an m2 sata drive you should get an m2 sata–to–usb 30 adapter or enclosure like this one for m2 pcie the best option seems to be to clone your drive to a usb hard drive then replace and clone back after you’ve swapped drives you can put your old laptop drive in a usb enclosure like the one you may have used for the new ssd while cloning and use it for backup if you’d like just be careful about doing this with spinning hard drives that are more than a few years old—you won’t want to store your backups on a drive that might fail if you have a mac most people who own macs generally shouldn’t upgrade the ssds in their computers unless they absolutely need extra capacity many recent macs can’t support upgrades at all and post2013 macs that shipped with removable solidstate storage already use pci express drives that are faster than any thirdparty options owc’s aura pcie ssds while respectable enough are slower than apple’s own drives and like most thirdparty replacements they sell for way more than a normal ssd the owc 480 gb aura sells for just over 400 about 100 more than the pricey samsung 960 pro  if you can and must upgrade know that it’s difficult to install a new ssd in most macs either because it’s hard to open the computer or the solidstate drives in macs are proprietary and thus incompatible with regular pc connectors mac book pros up to and including some of the 2012 models are fairly easy to upgrade with our 25inch sata picks though there are some pitfalls we’ll discuss below this apple page can help you identify your mac book pro and i fixit has easytofollow guides that will walk you through the upgrade process here’s the breakdown at least for macs made after 2012 or so mac book air use this page to identify your mac book air the 11 and 13inch models use the same drives owners of mac book air machines made in 2012 can buy these replacement drives from owc for the 2013 2014 and 2015 mac book air models buy these owc aura replacement drives mac book pro use this page to identify your mac book pro owners of 2012 retina mac book pro models or early2013 mac book pro systems can buy the owc aura 6g made specifically for those models—these aura 6g drives are shaped a bit differently than the drives of the same name for the mac book air mac book pros made in late 2013 2014 or 2015 use this owc aura the same drive owc sells for newer mac book airs no thirdparty ssds are available for 2016 or 2017 mac book pros12inch mac book owners of apple’s lightest laptop will never be able to buy storage upgrades the ssds in these computers are soldered to the motherboard much like the flash storage in a smartphone or tableti mac all i macs aside from the i mac pro include space for a 35inch internal hard drive which means you could use any of our 25inch sata picks along with an adapter bracket if you really wanted to however these computers are extremely difficult to open and upgrade we recommend that most people consult with an apple authorized service provider to upgrade i mac storage mac mini this page can help you identify your mac mini you can upgrade the 2012 model with standard 25inch sata drives though as with the i mac you should probably use an apple authorized service provider to do the work to minimize the risk of damaging the computer owc also sells ssds specifically made to fit the 2014 mac mini the current model though “current” is a generous term apple doesn’t enable trim an operatingsystemlevel garbagecollection command on thirdparty ssds though in mac os 10104 and later you can forceenable trim via a commandline prompt however some linux users have reported lost data and other bugs as a result of forcing trim on samsung and other ssds in linux it’s unclear whether mac os would have the same bugs but we haven’t seen any widespread reports of trim issues with samsung drives if you force trim proceed with caution and keep good backups what to look forward to samsung currently sells a pcie ssd called the “ pm981 ” to pc manufacturers it uses a new drive controller and the same new flashmemory technology as the 860 evo and 860 pro and it generally performs somewhere in between those two drives samsung hasn’t officially announced anything yet but we expect the company to sell a version of this drive to regular shoppers at some point later this year just as the “pm961” became the 960 evo in 2016 toshiba announced its rc100 line of pcie ssds in january 2018 and those drives will be available sometime in the spring toshiba hasn’t said how much the drives will cost but has noted that it’s aiming for performance somewhere between that of today’s best pcie and sata ssds at a price closer to sata ssds the drive is also only 42 mm long instead of the more typical 80 mm this sizing may make it a good choice for smaller systems that leave less room for long m2 drives we’ll keep an eye out for reviews when the rc100 begins shipping anandtech praised the performance of plextor’s upcoming m8v sata ssd in its early review but this model is not available for sale yet so we don’t know what its price will be the m8v has only a threeyear warranty compared with five years for all of our picks and both the mx500 and 860 evo are a bit faster if the m8v is significantly cheaper than the mx500 it may be worth considering otherwise the mx500 will still be a better choice mushkin’s new source ssds are basic affordable sata drives aimed at people who want to replace an old hard drive without spending much money mushkin has priced the 500 gb model at 110 significantly less than the mx500 or 860 evo we expect our picks will still be worth the extra cost for their extra performance and other features but we’ll keep an eye out for reviews of the source ssds and adjust our picks if they perform surprisingly well intel and micron’s optane ssds promise to fundamentally shift the ssd landscape as the drives claim dramatic improvements in durability and latency compared with current ssds but even if they manage to deliver the revolution is at least a couple of years away because the only shipping versions of optane are expensive drives for servers and tiny 16 gb and 32 gb drives that are intended for use as cache for a slower hard drive intel is releasing highercapacity 58 gb and 118 gb versions later in 2018 but they’re still likely to be too expensive and too small for most people capacity will need to go up and prices will need to come way down before intel can deliver on its lofty promises here the competition sata and m2 sata ssds gobs and gobs of 25inch sata ssds are out there and since just a handful of companies make their own flash memory andor drive controllers namely samsung and micron crucial’s parent company most drives have a hard time standing out from the crowd most are fine and if you encounter a great deal on them you won’t be unhappy but at current prices there’s little reason to consider them over our main picks we’re listing a few highlights skipping over drives that appear to be out of stock or otherwise on their way out samsung’s 850 evo is still a great drive and if you can find it for less than 140 you should still buy it as of this writing the 25inch version is usually cheaper than the 860 evo that replaced it even though the two models’ speeds are mostly comparable and they have the same fiveyear warranty it also has a 150 tbw endurance rating that’s fairly close to the mx500’s plus hardware encryption support and all of samsung’s great ssd software but it’s getting harder to find especially at higher capacities or in its m2 and m sata versions and prices are becoming less predictable the 850 evo was our top pick for three years but it’s finally on its way out samsung’s 850 evo is still a great drive and if you can find it for less than 140 you should still buy it wd’s blue 3d nand and san disk’s ultra 3d are identical drives—the only difference is the label on the front and the fact that the wd blue includes an m2 version while the san disk comes in only a 25inch sata version both are wellreviewed goodenough sata ssds with solid performance and both are available for around the same price as the crucial mx500 but their lack of hardware encryption support and their shorter threeyear warranty ultimately make the mx500 the better buy intel’s 545s uses a controller and nand flash that are similar to the components in the crucial mx500 so overall it performs similarly to our top pick it includes a fiveyear warranty and encryption support too but as of this writing it usually costs 150 or 160 more than the mx500 and close to the superior 860 evo if you can get this model for less it’s a good drive but otherwise you have no reason to consider it over our main picks samsung’s 850 pro and the new 860 pro are both topoftheline sata drives with high endurance and good warranties though the 860 pro gets only a fiveyear warranty down from 10 years for the 850 pro but at this point people who want a faster better ssd than our main picks should be looking at pci express drives not sata models drives like the crucial mx500 and samsung 860 evo are significantly cheaper but not all that much slower also neither pro comes in an m2 or m sata version crucial’s bx300 is one of the company’s budget ssds it performs better than the older bx200 but doesn’t have hardware encryption support doesn’t come in 1 tb or m2 versions and confusingly sells for around the same price as the superior mx500 adata’s ultimate su800 and san disk’s ultra ii are good enough and readily available but they usually run slower than our main picks have shorter threeyear warranties and lack encryption support they could be worth considering if they come down in price or you find them at a significant discount toshiba’s ocz tr200 has 500 gb 480 gb and 1 tb 960 gb models listed on its product page but only the 240 gb version is available to purchase right now pcie nvme ssds most of the best pcie nvme drives perform at roughly the same level as or below samsung’s 960 evo most people interested in a drive of this type should stick with the 960 evo but a handful of alternatives could be worth considering if you have specific needs western digital’s new wd black pcie ssd with 3d nand also sold as the san disk extreme pro m2 nvme 3d ssd is usually as fast as or faster than samsung’s 960 evo and occasionally even competitive with the 960 pro both anand tech and tom’s hardware were impressed by its performance the wd black has a fiveyear warranty similar to samsung’s but it doesn’t support any kind of hardware encryption acceleration it’s usually about the same price as or a little more expensive than the 960 evo and it’s currently harder to buy intel’s 760p isn’t quite as fast as the 960 evo though it is significantly better than any sata ssd and a big improvement over the previousgeneration intel 600p intel offers a fiveyear warranty and driveencryption support and this model is one of the very few pcie drives that come in a 128 gb version for people who just want a fast cheap drive for their operating system and a few apps but the 760p tops out at 512 gb and samsung’s drive offers better performance for around the same price my digital ssd’s bpx costs about the same as the 960 evo and its write speeds are often lower but it’s still considerably faster than any sata drive it uses mlc flash and is rated at over three times the endurance of the 960 evo a number backed by a fiveyear warranty but tom’s hardware cites potential laptop battery life problems for the bpx and the drive tops out at 480 gb the capacity we recommend though a 1 tb option is nice to have and we think samsung will be able to keep its drive in stock more consistently samsung’s 960 pro our previous upgrade pick is expensive and overkill even for many pros but if you absolutely need the best fastest drive you can get it’s still at the top of the pile the 960 pro uses multilevel cell mlc flash and doesn’t rely on turbo write or dynamic write acceleration caches for speed so it can offer faster and more consistent performance if you’re always writing tons of data at a time but you’ll still pay a lot more for an mlc drive as of this writing a 512 gb 960 pro costs 70 more than the 512 gb 960 evo and a 1 tb pro is 160 more expensive than the corresponding evo but if the speed the extra endurance and a fiveyear warranty are worth the money to you the 960 pro is still an option other drives fall into the goodbutnotgreat category none of them are bad but there aren’t many reasons for most people to choose them over the 960 evo the patriot hellfire toshiba ocz rd400 and plextor m8pe are decent drives but they’re all around the same price as the 960 evo and offer similar performance but no drive encryption footnotes the theoretical maximum 6 gigabits per second actually translates to 750 mbs but because of encoding and other transfer overhead the practical maximum is a bit under 600 mbs jump back because different types of ssds use different amounts of overprovisioning the listed capacities for a drive in this class can vary between 480 gb 500 gb 512 gb and 525 gb jump back as of 2016 vättö works as a technical marketer for samsung ssds but his previous work at anand tech remains useful jump back you always get a fiveyear warranty regardless of which mx500 you buy but the tbw rating varies by capacity since nand cells can be written to only so many times before they wear out the 250 gb drive is rated for 100 tbw the 1 tb drive is rated for 360 tbw and the 2 tb drive is rated for 700 tbw jump back as with all ssds the tbw rating for the 860 evo is tied to the ssd’s capacity the 250 gb 860 evo is rated for 150 tbw the 1 tb version is rated for 600 tbw the 2 tb version is rated for 1200 tbw and the 4 tb version is rated for 2400 tbw

blocks were found so i stopped the process and returned the drive im very happy that i bought it through amazon prime so there was no question about returning it i purchased the crucial drive described in this article no bad blocks were found with a surface scan and the ssd has performed flawlessly since installing it i also believe this is a better purchase because crucial offers less

while ive had success with other samsung ssds this one could not clone the boot sector of the original drive tried using the samsung migration tool as well as several 3rd party disk cloning programs but without success eventually i just had to return the drive dan • 1 year ago you mean to say you bought a 1tb samsung evo 950 recently in the m2 2280 format the 1tb samsung evo 850 is a sata ssd not m2 tiexin guo • 1 year ago im not sure if the title fits yes regarding priceperformance ratio no doubt 850 evo is a great choice in fact it is what im using right now and even the same size while its a wise choice its definitely not the best ssd the performance is lightyears behind its big brother 960 pro dan • 1 year ago the samsung evo 850 is a sata ssd not m2 the 960 pro is m2 calling it the big bro is flawed the the samsung pro 850 is its big bro as theyre both sata ssd however the 960 pro is an entirely different monster and to use it you need a board with m2 and to get the most out of it you will need to use x4 pcie mode which means using 4 pcie lanes that will in some cases with some boards mean utilizing lanes that could be used for your graphics card so instead of using the graphics card in x16 mode you will be only using x8 mode if you only have 16 lanes or if you have two cards in slicrossfire you might not get x8x8 since you are using x4 for your m2 and the board does not have an additional 4 lanes specifically for m2 but if you switch to sata mode you loose your max 10gbps advantage of the m2 drive and you only get the max 6gbps you would with a standard sata iii ssd in conclusion the 960 pro is the big brother of the 960 evo both are m2 and the 850 pro is the big brother of the 850 evo both are sata iii joe bob • 10 months agoare you on some special kind of

models owc strongly recommends the use of a sata 20 3gbs ssd while a 6g sata 3 ssd does function it will only do so at sata revision 10 15gbs 150mbs speeds rather that the sata revision 20 30gbs 300mbs speed the computer can deliver this article should be updated with disclaimers concerning such older systems and ideally with recommendations for the best sata revision 20 drives currently availablebrucerb • 1 year ago this may be true for owc products and some others but is not true of all sata iii drives there is an issue where some sata iii drives installed in macs that use the nvidia mcp89 ahci sata interface some 20092010 i macs mac minis and mac book pros will only perform at sata i speeds although the interface should support sata ii however i have such a mac with a samsung 830 ssd sata iii and it is running correctly at sata ii speeds im not aware of a definitive list of which ssds will or will not work at sata ii speeds in these macs so it is something the user should be aware of also sata ii drives that are not sata iii have probably been out of production for years although owc appears to still have them farmar janne • 1 year agototally agree none of my apples are compatible dwrrxx • 1 year ago worst ssd line on the market cant for the life of me figure out why these 84850 drives receive great reviews and ratings we use samsung san disk and some crucial drives while weve experienced failures on the san disk and crucial drives the samsung products have by far had the largest number of failures additionally samsung is also the worst vendor for support due to the number of samsung ssds 840 and 850 series failures evo and pro we decided to start submitting warranty claims rather than simply discarding the faulty drives as we have in the past were almost better off discarding the faulty drives after dealing with samsung support or what they classify as support first when submitting warranty claims through the samsung support portal adjacent to the respective registered drives after completing the required ssd documentation sns models purchase datesinvoices etc etc the samsung system acknowledges accuracy and receipt of our data however when selecting the link to complete the claim for final submission we constantly receive an error message that samsung is unable to process the claims every time emphasis every time doesnt make any difference what time of the day samsung will not process the final claim submission we instead have to phone a toll free number more wasted irreplaceable valuable time every time again no matter what day what time of the day etc a support representative advises that the system is undergoing maintenance folks if samsungs system requires that much maintenance its time to upgrade from the 4341s ibm regarding ssd usage almost every one of these faulty samsung ssds had very low hours usage writing  on them they have mostly been sitting idle ironically the ones with heavy writes have experienced far fewer failures while ssds are far more fragile than hdds and they are all subject to failure weve converted to san disk x400 series  shorter 5year warranty than the 850 pro but warranty terms are factored into all ssds plus we receive volume discounts an ssd with a 10year warr looses its price advantage with multiple  more than one  warranty claims even when we do have the infrequent san disk failure san disks support is far more efficient responsive and virtually painless to deal with compared to samsung samsung clevel really needs to learn how to provide adequate proper customer support zac paul • 1 year ago if a potential buyer wants top reliability i strongly encourage purchasing either the samsung 850 pro intel 740 san disk extreme pro or transcend 370 these products use topgraded mlc while some tlc drives like the 850 evo or san disk ultra 2 are very good products going with superior mlc has reliability benefits additionally the transcend 370 is priced about the same as midlevel tlc drives but it uses top bin micron mlc nand which is much much much more desirable than tlc one option for those on a budget is to purchase two ssds for example a smaller 850 pro where you install the os and keep all important files and a larger tlc drive where you keep less important data clifford chan • 1 year agowhat about kingstonperejil • 1 year ago my

the main pick work on a macbook late 2011 13inch macbook pro you suggest owcs ssd for that model but it seems to me that the main pick will also be compatible is the issue with the enabling of trim just want to clarify what the top picks would be for an older non ssd macbook pro thanks in advancebrucerb • 1 year ago they recommended the owc for the 2013 mac book pro the article doesnt mention the 2011 any sata ssd should work fine in the 2011 sam wood • 1 year ago hithanks for all the great advice i am looking for a ssd for my acer aspire m5 i noticed that your previous pick was crucials mx200 but you have not yet updated your review to include the new mx300 which was just released this summer and is 30 cheaper than the samsung evo 850 what do you think of the mx300 does it match up to the evo 850 now that it has the 3d nand technology they seem similar in speed and quality so i am considering getting the mx300 instead since it is a bit cheaper thanks sam zac paul • 1 year ago the mx200 is an incredible drive that used topbinned micron mlc nand and a marvell controller the mx300 is an inferior product because it has dumped mlc nand in favor of tlc check out the transcend 370 this drive uses topbinned micron mlc for about the same price as midlevel tlc drives it will last longer and it is made from nand that is inherently more reliable if you want the absolute best performance the absolute best longevity and industry setting reliability  consistency then the 850 pro is arguably the best those things can write petabytes and petabytes of data and the realworld endurance of 10 pb is something the 850 pro is theoretically capable of doing i have one with over 1 pb and smart data suggests this has barely made a dent in the life level remaining performancewise the mx300 falls far short of the evo the evo is an odd drive in that it is faster than some mlc drives even for everyone else manymost tlc drives cannot deliver comparable realworld performance joice vidal • 1 year ago hello mac book pro 13inch mid 2009 253 ghz intel core 2 duo 8 gb 1067 mhz ddr3 i have upgraded the memory but now my mac is reaalllyyyyyyy slow i was reading that if i change my hdd to a ssd it is going to be faster id like to buy a 1tb because i need space for a database that i want to install on it whatd be my best option thanks in advance joice zac paul • 1 year ago what do you want most speed reliability longevity or value if you want the first three the samsung 850 pro is the industry standard the san disk extreme pro is the closest second to the 850 pro the transcend 370 is a drive that is fast very reliable priced very low relative to its quality and is seriously underrated and overlooked by many tech writers with the less expensive drives you will still get reasonably fast realworld performance but a sacrifice in endurance and reliability and those sacrifices can sometimes be significantd ct • 1 year ago so the pro or evo would work in macbook pro 15 mid 2010 macbook pro62 i7 266 8gb i have read different things i know it cant take advantage of the true power because it is sata ii but it is compatible correct i work a lot with adobe suite including captivate 9 which currently slows to a crawl and is almost unusable on my computer i am reluctantly willing to pay the money for a 1tb pro would it be worth it or am i simply asking too much of my machine should i just buy the 500 evo or buy the 1tb evo or pro in the belief that it will be worth it in terms of bringing it into a new machine in general would i really notice the difference between 500512 gb and 1 tb thanks for your advice zac paul • 1 year ago a sata 3 ssd will work with a computer that is sata 1 or sata 2it will just be capped by whatever sata revision you have in what is often called negotiated link speed the 850 pro is worth the money its perfection and it is so reliable and so longlasting that it is almost ridiculous the pro uses mlc flash where as the evo uses tlc mlc is usually faster more reliable and will last longer most tlc drives are nowhere near as good as the evo and the evo is an exception to the rule of the inferior tlc drives that have smashed the market the san disk extreme pro and the transcend 370 both use mlc nand as well and the transcend 370 is very competitively priced you will not notice any different between a 250 500gb drive and a 1tb drive because your sata 2 connection is going to cap your transfer speeds at around 300 mbs which is about half the speed of what modern mlc ssds are capable of if using a sata 3 connection apple laptops now use pcie connections for their ssds as this allows speeds far higher than sata 3 the most recent pcie ssds are writing at over 2500 mbs where as sata 3s limit is around 600 mbs so you cannot use this drive in new apple laptops and apple desktops are now also utilizing pcie nonetheless you can still use the drive by putting it into an external enclosure for a very fast portable hard drive as apple is now moving to thunder bolt 3 thunder bolt 3 enclosures will be able to max out multiple sata 3 ssds for very very fast data speeds mozef kaddas • 1 year ago thank you for sharing an awesome information im glad apple stepped up the game and started implementing the new pcie ssd in there which is based on nvme ssd yet the connector not m2freediverx • 1 year agoa sata 3 ssd will work with a computer that is sata 1 or sata 2it will just be capped by whatever sata revision you havenot necessarily as i posted out in a separate comment 2009 i macs only support sata 2 although in

particular 2009 i macs as i have not had that problem i have a crucial m4 in my 2009 i mac i believe a version 101 it is a sata3 ssd its read and write speeds are both around 300 mbs which is exactly

httpwwwanandtechcomshhttpforumssandiskcomt david paddock • 1 year ago i can understand not recommending the 950 nvme drives for nonprosthere are potential technical hurdles plugandplay users might not have the stomach forbut to recommend the 850 pro instead makes no sense the 850 pro is barely faster than the 850 evo in most scenarios the 950 pro by contrast is 3 to 4 times faster in sequential readwrite capability and markedly faster at a minimum doing everything else anyone who cares enough about performance enough to be considering something faster than an evo should be using nvme by the time the 10 year warranty on the 850 pro runs out you will have ditched it in favor of something bigger and faster twice over tornadotuan • 1 year ago hi hardware community i want your opinion on a special decission making especially now that enough time for longtimeendurance tests has passed anyway i can´t choose between the samsung evo 850 1tb v2 289€ and die san disk extreme 960gb 281€ so pricewise the pro is even cheaper right now compared to the samsung but there are some obvious differences tlc 3d vnand vs mlc planar  5 years vs 10 years warranty  150 tbw vs 80 tbw  higher peak vs consistency  samsung bugging vs sudden death drives my usage  client for everything gaming programming office multimedia  everything  gonna split it in system and datapartition  gonne be in laptop that´s used as desktop  battery is wasted so no concern about power consumption so usually i use hardware until it´s broken so meaning about 810 years still i want steady performance without sudden decline in speed like with the evo 840  ci´d be really glad if you could tell me your opinion on this  btw my system is a dell vostro 3450 i5 ivybridge ati m6650 greetingszac paul • 1 year ago if you want to use the drive for 10 years or more i think investing in the 850 pro is worth it the evo is a good drive but it does not have the errorcorrection abilities of the pro due to differences of the nand inside beyond being more reliable mlc nand lasts longer the 850 pro will last unusually long and an endurance of 510 petabytes with the pro is easily doable the san disk extreme pro uses mlc nand so it is a better drive than the evo even though there are some areas where the evo is slightly faster gary halpin • 1 year ago fyi the other world computing ssds m2 are absolutely horrible tried 3 of

you can even chat with csr while on their website they also have videos and written tutorials that show you step by step how to replace your ssd  ram they also explain which tools will be needed and
