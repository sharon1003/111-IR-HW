instructor nadine james nadine has taught nursing for 12 years and has a ph d in nursing research in this lesson you will learn what pulse pressure is how it is measured and the ranges of normal levels also included will be examples of variations in pulse pressure and how it is related to health definition and normal range pulse pressure is the difference between the systolic blood pressure and the diastolic blood pressure the systolic blood pressure is sometimes known to nonhealth professionals as the top number it represents the amount of pressure exerted on the blood vessels when the ventricle of the heart contracts systole so the diastolic blood pressure is the lower number and it represents the amount of pressure on the blood vessels when the heart is at rest a heart is at rest when it is between contractions normal ranges of blood pressure are less than 120 for systolic and less than 80 for diastolic according to the world health organization pulse pressure is measured by millimeters of mercury mm hg mercury is the only metal that is liquid at room temperature so it is used to determine measurement of thermometers and barometers the normal range for the pulse pressure is between 30 to 50 mm hg variation a few examples of pulse pressure variation in several processes in the body are low blood volume known as hypovolemia will increase pulse pressure decreased heart rate known as bradycardia will increase pulse pressure irregular heartbeat which may cause increased pulse pressure control of increased blood pressure which will usually lower high pulse pressures health concerns pulse pressure is thought to be the strongest predictor of heart disease in the elderly however this may not be true for other populations in lowerthannormal pulse pressures or below 40 mm hg a person may have poor heart function some causes of this include sustained increased heart rate above 100 pericardial effusion an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pericardial cavity and ascites the accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity pulse pressure is an important predictor of death in patients that use dialysis for endstage kidney disease higherthannormal range pulse pressure can help to predict heart disease especially in adults over 60 years old at a pulse pressure of 60 mm hg or greater the person would be considered at risk for heart disease to unlock this lesson you must be a studycom member create your account register for a free trial are you a student or a teacher i am a student i am a teacher
