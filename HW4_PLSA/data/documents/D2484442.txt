opened in 2003 and was most recently renovated in 2014 for a big chain brand the resort‘s laidback vibe is pleasantly tropical and has a decent amount of personality the breezy openair lobby features doublehigh ceilings and lots of wood accents including exposed beams woodpaneled pillars and a restored hawaiian outrigger canoe it’s also a great spot to sit and soak up beautiful ocean views from one the many plush couches or armchairs a sweeping staircase connects the lobby to the resort’s grounds which are dotted with koi ponds palm trees grassy fields and  a big perk  gas grills for hosting your own barbecue it’s worth noting that the marriott is also a timeshare property and the free gift doled out to arriving guests  shell necklaces  must be picked up at the timeshare sales desk sales
