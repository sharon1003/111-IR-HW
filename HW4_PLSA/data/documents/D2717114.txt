machines regardless  thats how the post office sorts letters seriously take the invitations to the post office the machine will stamp your invites which usually looks better than a couple stamps on the envelope and i guarantee that you will save money  they will charge you exactly what you owe also if you take the time to organize the invitations by zip code you will be charged the discounted bulk mailing rate which will save you even more money source s years of doing bulk mailings for my job boston · 1 decade ago4 0 comment askers rating postage stamps for wedding invitations source shttpsshrinkima04zmruggles · 1 year ago0 0 comment take one completely compiled set labeled outer envelope inner envelope all the cards and info that go along with the invite and have the post office weigh it for you many times they are okay with a 59 cent stamp but some invitation sets can be upwards of a dollar each they will weigh the same  have the same postage amount for each one plus this way you can pick the stamp you like best instead of having the ugly one the post office slaps on their i would suggest though bringing them all back to the post office after they are addressed compiled  stamped the day you are mailing them go in early and have the person there hand stamp them to be mailed  it looks nicer than having them go through the machine good luck and congratsbarbara · 2 years ago0 0 comment you can ask at the post office for your invites to be hand cancelled they wont appreciate it as its time consuming and much quicker to put the envelopes through the machine but theyll do it for you postal employees are used to doing it for wedding invites a hint though dont go on a saturday morning or during a weekday lunch hour and ask for thisdo it during the week during a slow time you may have to show up at work late one day or something and i like the idea of buying stamps online that are personalyou can buy them in the exact amount youll needbut theyll look so much better than the metered mail thingbasketcase88 · 1 decade ago2 1 comment they make stamps of different values usually the invitations take one stamp if they take more than one ask if they have that denomination in a stamp also you can ask to have your invitations hand cancelled you may not be the most popular person at the post office that day but it is an option that you can request and they will do it for you jan · 1 decade ago0 0 comment i think the post office has pretty stamps for use on most wedding invites i hear the cost of stamps are going up soon make sure your rsvp cards have the increased postage just in case you have late responders lisa j · 1 decade ago3 0 comment your invite is going to fall under one or two categories one ounce or two ounces they really arent going to be heavier than that they sell pretty stamps that are of a higher value they even have the wedding package with the 58 cent stamps for the invite and the normal stamps for the rsvp reply they dont have to run them through the stamp machine that looks ugly httpshopuspscomwebappwcsstoresshttpshopuspscomwebappwcsstoress just take note that the post office has said they are raising the postage of the first class stamp from 41 to 42 cents make sure you put the correct postage on for when the rsvps are returning to you it is likely that you will need the 42 cent stamps jm · 1 decade ago0 0 comment i would suggest taking one invite to the post office and have them weigh and price it they have a wedding hearts stamp that is for up to 2 oz 058 each but no matter what you do the envelopes will go through a machine and have the little red processing marks on themskydiva · 1 decade ago2 0 comment we were actually really worried about this too we ended up sending them fed ex cause they were too heavy but instead when we were going to send them through post we were considering doing those photo stamps where you upload your photo and it costs a little more you can choose the price of stamp you need to put on it it seems such a waste to ruin a nice envelope and invitation with an ugly stamp kat woman · 1 decade ago1 1 comment you can make your own stamps by going to the postal website uspscom that what a lot of people are doing own putting their own picture on wedding stamps be preparied if your invites are oddly shapedor have big ribbons on them they may cost more to send i would avoid the post office though because the employees and lines are just a hassel look up what you need on the website and mail them yourself kjersti g · 1 decade ago1 2 comment1 2 next maybe you
