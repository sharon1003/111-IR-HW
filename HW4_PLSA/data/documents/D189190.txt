print science hydrocarbons as fuels page1 2 3next several waste products are released when fuels burn these do not just disappear and they can harm the environment by contributing to global warming global dimming and acid rain combustion of fuels complete combustion fuels burn when they react with oxygen in the air if there is plenty of air complete combustion happens coal is mostly carbon during complete combustion carbon is oxidised to carbon dioxidecarbon  oxygen → carbon dioxide carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas increasing concentrations of it in the atmosphere contribute to global warming hydrocarbon fuels contain carbon and hydrogen during combustion hydrogen is oxidised to water remember that water h2o is an oxide of hydrogen in generalhydrocarbon  oxygen → carbon dioxide  water the combustion of a fuel may release several gases into the atmosphere including clouds of smoke and other combustion products are emitted from chimneys incomplete combustion if there is insufficient air for complete combustion incomplete combustion also called partial combustion happens hydrogen is still oxidised to water but carbon monoxide forms instead of carbon dioxide carbon monoxide is a toxic gas so adequate ventilation is important when burning fuels solid particles particulates are also released these contain carbon and are seen as soot or smoke particulates cause global dimming they reduce the amount of sunlight reaching the earth’s surface page1 2 3next back to crude oil and fuels index
