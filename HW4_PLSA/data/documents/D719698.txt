version introduction and subject theoretical perspective the theoretical perspective taken toward emotional development in childhood is a combination of functionalist theory and dynamical systems theory 1 a child’s encounters with an environment can be seen as dynamic transactions that involve multiple emotionrelated components eg expressive behaviour physiological patterning action tendencies goals and motives social and physical contexts appraisals and experiential feeling that change over time as the child matures and in response to changing environmental interactions emotional development reflects social experience including the cultural context elsewhere i have argued that emotional development should be considered from a bioecological framework that regards human beings as dynamic systems embedded within a community context 2 table 1 summarizes noteworthy descriptive markers of emotional development in relation to social interaction table 1 noteworthy markers of emotional development in relation to social interaction age period regulationcoping expressive behavior relationship building infancy 0  12 mos selfsoothing and learning to modulate reactivity regulation of attention in service of coordinated action reliance on caregivers for supportive “scaffolding” during stressful circumstances behavior synchrony with others in some expressive channels increasing discrimination of others’ expressions increasing expressive responsiveness to stimuli under contingent control increasing coordination of expressive behaviors with emotioneliciting circumstances social games and turntaking eg “peekaboo” social referencing socially instrumental signal use eg “fake” crying to get attention toddlerhood 12 mos2½ years emergence of selfawareness and consciousness of own emotional response irritability due to constraints and limits imposed on expanding autonomy and exploration needs selfevaluation and selfconsciousness evident in expressive behavior accompanying shame pride coyness increasing verbal comprehension and production of words for expressive behavior and affective states anticipation of different feelings toward different people increasing discrimination of others’ emotions and their meaningfulness early forms of empathy and prosocial action preschool 25 years symbolic access facilitates emotion regulation but symbols can also provoke distress communication with others extends child’s evaluation of and awareness of own feelings and of emotioneliciting events adoption of pretend expressive behavior in play and teasing pragmatic awareness that “false” facial expressions can mislead another about one’s feelings communication with others elaborates child’s understanding of social transactions and expectations for comportment sympathetic and prosocial behavior toward peers increasing insight into others’ emotions early elementary school 57 years selfconscious emotions eg embarrassment are targeted for regulation seeking support from caregivers still prominent coping strategy but increasing reliance on situational problemsolving evident adoption of “cool emotional front” with peers increasing coordination of social skills with one’s own and others’ emotions early understanding of consensually agreed upon emotion “scripts”middle childhood 710 years problemsolving preferred coping strategy if control is at least moderate distancing strategies used if control is appraised as minimal appreciation of norms for expressive behavior whether genuine or dissembled use of expressive behavior to modulate relationship dynamics eg smiling while reproaching a friend awareness of multiple emotions toward the same person use of multiple time frames and unique personal information about another as aids in the development of close friendships preadolescence 1013 years increasing accuracy in appraisal of realistic control in stressful circumstances capable of generating multiple solutions and differentiated strategies for dealing with stress distinction made between genuine emotional expression with close friends and managed displays with others increasing social sensitivity and awareness of emotion “scripts” in conjunction with social roles adolescence 13 years awareness of one’s own emotion cycles eg guilt about feeling angry facilitates insightful coping increasing integration of moral character and personal philosophy in dealing with stress and subsequent decisions skillful adoption of selfpresentation strategies for impression management awareness of mutual and reciprocal communication of emotions as affecting quality of relationship note from saarni 2000 pp 7475 copyright 2000 by josseybass reprinted by permission of the author recent research results the development of emotional competence a productive way to look at emotional functioning is the degree to which it serves the adaptive and selfefficacious goals of the individual the construct emotional competence 3 has been proposed as a set of affectoriented behavioural cognitive and regulatory skills that emerge over time as a person develops in a social context individual factors such as cognitive development and temperament do indeed influence the development of emotional competencies however the skills of emotional competence are also influenced by past social experience and learning including an individual’s relationship history as well as the system of beliefs and values in which the person lives thus we actively create our emotional experience through the combined influence of our cognitive developmental structures and our social exposure to emotion discourse through this process we learn what it means to feel something and to do something about it table 2 lists the 8 skills of emotional competence table 2 skills of emotional competence1 awareness of one’s emotional state including the possibility that one is experiencing multiple emotions and at even more mature levels awareness that one might also not be consciously aware of one’s feelings due to unconscious dynamics or selective inattention2 skills in discerning and understanding others’ emotions based on situational and expressive cues that have some degree of consensus as to their emotional meaning3 skill in using the vocabulary of emotion and expression in terms commonly available in one’s subculture and at more mature levels to acquire cultural scripts that link emotion with social roles4 capacity for empathic and sympathetic involvement in others’ emotional experiences5 skill in realizing that inner emotional state need not correspond to outer expression both in oneself and in others and at more mature levels the ability to understand that one’s emotionalexpressive behavior may impact on another and take this into account in one’s selfpresentation strategies6 capacity for adaptive coping with aversive or distressing emotions by using selfregulatory strategies that ameliorate the intensity or temporal duration of such emotional states eg “stress hardiness”7 awareness that the structure or nature of relationships is in part defined by both the degree of emotional immediacy or genuineness of expressive display and by the degree of reciprocity or symmetry within the relationship eg mature intimacy is in part defined by mutual or reciprocal sharing of genuine emotions whereas a parentchild relationship may have asymmetric sharing of genuine emotions8 capacity for emotional selfefficacy the individual views her or himself as feeling overall the way he or she wants to feel that is emotional selfefficacy means that one accepts ones emotional experience whether unique and eccentric or culturally conventional and this acceptance is in alignment with the individual’s beliefs about what constitutes desirable emotional “balance” in essence one is living in accord with ones personal theory of emotion when one demonstrates emotional selfefficacy that is integrated with ones moral sense note from saarni 2000 pp 7778 copyright 2000 by josseybass reprinted by permission of the author the attachment relationship with caregivers is the initial context in which a child’s emotional life unfolds if the caregivers typically meet the infant’s needs the infant comes to internalize the notion that the world is a safe place and that others are trustworthy and responsive the infant is then secure in his or her attachment to the caregiver the caregiverchild relationship establishes the foundation for the development of emotional skills and sets the stage for future social relationships a secure attachment leaves the child free to explore the world and engage with peers affirmation that the world is responsive predictable and reliable aids in the child’s developing ability to selfregulate in a study of preschoolers denham and her colleagues 4 found a positive association between security of attachment to mothers and security of attachment to teachers furthermore security of attachment to both mother and teacher related positively to emotion understanding and regulated anger in contrast a child who experiences the world as unpredictable unresponsive andor hostile must expend a tremendous amount of energy selfmanaging emotional arousal insecure attachment is associated with emotional and social incompetence particularly in the areas of emotion understanding and regulated anger 4 furthermore perceptions of an indifferent or unfriendly social world influence subsequent emotional responses and interpersonal behaviour for example a child who experiences maltreatment may develop primary emotional responses such as anxiety or fear 5 ever vigilant for signs of threat the child may display aggressive or submissive behaviours as a means of selfprotection and such behaviours may place the child at risk for future status as a bully or victim cognitiveaffective structures associated with maltreatment may promote emotional constriction or peculiar emotional responsiveness interfering with a child’s ability to engage successfully with peers 6the development of emotional competence skills is a developmental process such that a particular skill manifests differently at different ages with young children emotion knowledge is more concrete with heightened focus on observable factors young children’s emotion expression and emotion regulation are less welldeveloped requiring more support and reinforcement from the social environment elementary school children advance in their ability to offer selfreports of emotions and to use words to explain emotionrelated situations as children mature their inferences about what others are feeling integrate not only situational information but also information regarding prior experiences and history older children are also more able to understand and express complex emotions such as pride shame or embarrassment by adolescence issues of identity moral character and the combined effects of aspiration and opportunity are more explicitly acknowledged as significant by youth the skills of emotional competence do not develop in isolation from each other and their progression is intimately tied to cognitive development for example insight into others’ emotions grows in interaction with expanding awareness of one’s own emotional experience with one’s ability to empathize and with the capacity to understand causes of emotions and their behavioural consequences furthermore as children learn about how and why people act as they do they grow in their ability to infer what is going on for themselves emotionally positive development and emotional competence competent children and youth do not experience lives free of problems but they are equipped with both individual and environmental assets that help them cope with a variety of life events the skills of emotional competence are one set of resources that young people bring to life’s diverse challenges as with development in other domains mastery of early skills related to emotional development such as affective regulation impacts a child’s ability to navigate future developmental challenges conclusions strengths in the area of emotional competence may help children and adolescents cope effectively in particular circumstances while also promoting characteristics associated with positive developmental outcomes including feelings of selfefficacy prosocial behaviour and supportive relationships with family and peers furthermore emotional competence serves as a protective factor that diminishes the impact of a range of risk factors research has isolated individual attributes that may exert a protective influence several of which reflect core elements of emotional competence including skills related to reading interpersonal cues solving problems executing goaloriented behaviour in interpersonal situations and considering behavioural options from both an instrumental and an affective standpoint 7references saarni c campos j camras l  witherington d 2008 principles of emotion and emotional competence in w damon  r lerner eds  child and adolescent development an advanced course pp
