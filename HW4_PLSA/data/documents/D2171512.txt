kanwaljit singh dhunna kanwaljit on august 11th 2009 at 519 pm said hi bastienmay the couple live 1000 years it seems the error is appearing whenever i use the utility for the first time after starting the system i am lost………………as it again appeared on a worksheet i closed the file without saving the changes but after reopening the unsaved workbook when i used the utility on the same worksheet it worked fine… it is happening though i am not able to identify the situation precisely… regards ca kanwaljit singh dhunna bastien on august 12th 2009 at 839 am said hello kanwaljitim sorry but i cant reproduce that and i have never seen this reported before you can try to reinstall asap utilities just run the setup again and see if that solves the problem however weird problems such as these can often be solved by doing a repair of your office installation 1 close excel if it is open 2 in the control panel choose add or remove programs or programs and features in windows vista 3 select microsoft office in the list and click on the change button 4 choose repair can you tell me if that solves the problem kind regards bastien kanwaljit on august 12th 2009 at 900 am said hi bastienmay the couple live 1000 years till i try yours solutions just let me mention what precisely is happening whenever i use the utility for the first time after starting the excel not after starting the system as i said earlier the above error is occurring it is happening each and every time i restarts excel and use the utility for the first time after that everything seems to work fine and it is happening with each and every worksheet and not just some particular sheet also as an experiment i started one instance of excel and used the utility for the first time same error occurred and on 2nd use onwards everything was fine on all the sheets ie other than the original sheet which gave error message then i opened 2nd instance of excel without closing the 1st instance and same problem occurred similar is the case with excel 2007 i will get back to you after trying yours solutions but it is happening exactly like this regards ca kanwaljit singh dhunna kanwaljit on august 13th 2009 at 937 am said hi bastienmay the couple live 1000 years just downloaded and installed the new version it is fine now thanks a lot and sorry for the unnecessary botheration regards ca kanwaljit singh dhunna bastien on august 13th 2009 at 1108 am said hello kanwaljitim glad to read the problem is fixed kind regards bastien kanwaljit on august 14th 2009 at 1206 pm said hi bastienmay the couple live 1000 years the issue has resurfaced in the new version too i have sent you an email with files and screenshot and strangely enough the error is happening on the 1st use of utility only and that too on any file regards ca kanwaljit singh dhunna bastien on august 17th 2009 at 1139 am said hello kanwaljithave you received my email i sent earlier i am still unable to reproduce the problem and i have never ever heard it before from other users do you have colleagues that get the same error too can you do a repair of you office installation i think that should solve the problem because that often solves weird errors such as these 1 close excel if it is open 2 in the control panel choose add or remove programs” or programs and features in windows vista 3 select microsoft office in the list and click on the change button 4 choose repair” please let me know if that solves the problem kind regards bastien mensink kanwaljit on august 25th 2009 at 928 am said hi bastienmay the couple live 1000 years may appear strange but it seems the utlitiy remove unused empty ending rowscolumns has stopped working on worksheets containing pivot tables i have tested it on two systems with same results regards ca kanwaljit singh dhunna india bastien on august 25th 2009 at 929 am said hello kanwaljitim sorry but im still unable to reproduce the problem even with pivot tables i have tested it with pivot tables before and now again on a machine with excel 2002xp one with excel 2003 and one with excel 2007 all the times the utility works as expected furthermore i still havent heard anyone with the same problem which is why i think that it is something specific to your computerconfiguration do you have other addins installed on the computer s you can create a list with the following tool asap utilities » system » create a list of all addins httpwwwasaputilitiescomasaputilitiesexceltoolstipphptip161utilities147langenus kind regards bastien mensink kanwaljit on august 25th 2009 at 227 pm said hi bastienmay the couple live 1000 years i used detect and repair utility on the help menu the utlitiy remove unused empty ending rowscolumns” is not working on sheet on which pivot table is active or on which i have removed the pivot tables by pasting only the values i have sent you such a sheet strangely it is working fine on other sheets as an experiment i used the utility on a sheets by inserting some rows which have a continuous serial number but removed the serial number meaning that there are only blank rows with some formatting but no data at all but the utility was unable to delete those rows then i pasted the formatting from virgin rows and used the utility and it worked fine still a mystery to me the addin installed are installed since long and never caused such a behaviour in the past i will post further feedback when i notice something regards ca kanwaljit singh dhunna india kanwaljit on september 2nd 2009 at 633 am said hi bastienmay the
