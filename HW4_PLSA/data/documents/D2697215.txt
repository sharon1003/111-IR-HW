bioelectrical impedance analysis biawhat is body fat percentage body fat percentage is the proportion of fat in a individuals body excess body fat has previously been determined by measuring weight against height but body fat is not always visible and cannot be measured on an ordinary scale obesity which indicates a high degree of excess body fat has been linked to high blood pressure heart disease diabetes cancer and other disabling conditions body fat percentage measurement body fat scales use the bioelectrical impedance analysis bia technique this method measures body composition by sending a low safe electrical current through the body the current passes freely through the fluids contained in muscle tissue but encounters difficultyresistance when it passes through fat tissue this resistance of the fat tissue to the current is termed bioelectrical impedance and is accurately measured by body fat scales when set against a persons height gender and weight the scales can then compute their body fat percentage calculation of body fat lukaski  bolonchuks 1988 1 formula for total body water tbw is tbw  0372 s²÷r  305 sex  0142 w  0069 ages  height in centimetres r  resistance

65 x 100  185body fat percentage fluctuations our eating habits lifestyle and the amount of exercise we perform all affect our weight and levels of hydration since bia relies on the fluid levels of fat free mass such as muscle tissue certain factors can alter an individuals body fat reading for examplethe reading may be lower than normal if you measure your body fat just after a bath or exercisingthe reading may be higher than normal if you have just woken up or eaten a meal in general there is less fluctuation in a persons body weight and hydration levels between the late afternoon and the early evening two hours after eating lunch and before the evening meal the graph above shows the fluctuations of my body fat  through out a day however as everyones daily routine and eating habits are different you should determine the most suitable time to measure your own body fat why monitoring body fat is important body fat is vital to daily body functions it cushions the joints and protects the organs helps regulate body temperature stores vitamins and helps the body sustain itself when food is scarce everyone needs some body fat to be active and healthy most people think that body weight and not body fat is a direct indication of fitness yet during a diet and exercise regime whilst someones absolute weight may fluctuate their body fat will decline in a slow but steady rate to the desired level using body fat scales to measure changes in both body fat and weight gives a more dependable picture of fitness limitations the use of body fat scales only measure the resistance of the lower part of the body and therefore may not provide an accurate reading of your body fat references lukaski and bolonchuk 1988 formula for total body water aviation space and environmental
