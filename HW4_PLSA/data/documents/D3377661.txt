the edge annual question — 2010how is the internet changing the way you think read any newspaper or magazine and you will notice the many flavors of the one big question that everyone is asking today or you can just stay on the page and read recent editions of edge  playwright richard foreman asks about the replacement of complex inner density with a new kind of selfevolving under the pressure of information overload and the technology of the instantly available is it a new self are we becoming pancake people — spread wide and thin as we connect with that vast network of information accessed by the mere touch of a button technology analyst nicholas carr wrote the most notable of many magazine and newspaper pieces asking is google making us stupid has the use of the web made it impossible for us to read long pieces of writing social software guru clay shirky notes that people are reading more than ever but the return of reading has not brought about the return of the cultural icons wed been emptily praising all these years whats so great about war and peace  he wonders having lost its actual centrality some time ago the literary world is now losing its normative hold on culture as well is the enormity of the historical shift away from literary culture now finally becoming clear science historian george dyson asks what if the cost of machines that think is people who dont he wonders will books end up back where they started locked away in monasteries and read by a select few web 20 pioneer tim oreilly ponders if ideas themselves are the ultimate social software do they evolve via the conversations we have with each other the artifacts we create and the stories we tell to explain them frank schirrmacher feuilleton editor and copublisher of frankfurter allgemeine zeitung has noticed that we are apparently now in a situation where modern technology is changing the way people behave people talk people react people think and people remember are we turning into a new species — informavores — he asks w daniel hillis goes a step further by asking if the internet will in the long run arrive at a much richer infrastructure in which ideas can potentially evolve outside of human minds in other words can we change the way the internet thinks what do you think this years question is how is the internet changing the way you think not how is the internet changing the way we think we spent a lot of time going back on forth on you vs we and came to the conclusion to go with you the reason being that edge is a conversation we responses tend to come across like expert papers public pronouncements or talks delivered from stage we wanted people to think about the internet which includes but is a much bigger subject than the web an application on the internet or search browsing etc which are apps on the web back in 1996 computer scientist and visionary danny hillis pointed out that when it comes to the internet many people sense this but dont want to think about it because the change is too profound today on the internet the main event is the web a lot of people think that the web is the internet and theyre missing something the internet is a brandnew fertile ground where things can grow and the web is the first thing that grew there but the stuff growing there is in a very primitive form the web is the old media incorporated into the new medium it both adds something to the internet and takes something away this year i enlisted the aid of hans ulrich obrist curator of the serpentine gallery in london as well as the artist april gornik one of the early members of the reality club the precursor to the online edge to help broaden the edge conversation — or rather to bring it back to where it was in the late 80searly 90s when april gave a talk at a reality club meeting and discussed the influence of chaos theory on her work and when benoit mandelbrot showed up to discuss fractal theory and every artist in nyc wanted to be there what then happened was very interesting the reality club went online as edge in 1996 and the scientists were all on email the artists not thus did edge surprisingly become a science site when my own

past 13 years in this essay he explains what makes a question a good one to ask and shares some responses to this years question how is the internet changing the way you think its not easy coming up with a question as the artist james lee byars used to say i can answer the question but am i bright enough to ask it edge is a conversation we are looking for questions that inspire answers we cant possibly predict surprise me with an answer i never could have guessed my goal is to provoke people into thinking thoughts that they normally might not have the art of a good question is to find a balance between abstraction and the personal to ask a question that has many answers or at least one for which you dont know the answer its a question distant enough to encourage abstractions and not so specific that its about breakfast a good question encourages answers that are grounded in experience but bigger than that experience alone continueinternazionale 28 gennaioon the cover internet

continuethe times january 28 2010in 1953 when the internet was not even a technological twinkle in the eye the philosopher isaiah berlin famously divided thinkers into two categories the hedgehog and the fox the fox knows many things but the hedgehog knows one big thing”hedgehog writers argued berlin see the world through the prism of a single overriding idea whereas foxes dart hither and thither gathering inspiration from the widest variety of experiences and sources marx nietzsche and plato were hedgehogs aristotle shakespeare and berlin himself were foxes today feasting on the anarchic ubiquitous limitless and uncontrolled information cornucopia that is the web we are all foxes we browse and scavenge thoughts and influences picking up what we want discarding the rest collecting linking hunting and gathering our information social life and entertainment the new apple i pad is merely the latest step in the fusion of the human mind and the internet this way of thinking is a direct threat to ideology indeed perhaps the ultimate expression of hedgehogthinking is totalitarian and fundamentalist which explains why the regimes in china and iran are so terrified of the internet the hedgehogs rightly fear the foxes edge  wwwedgeorg  a website dedicated to ideas and technology recently asked scores of philosophers scientists and scholars a simple but fundamental question how is the internet changing the way you think” the responses were astonishingly varied yet most agreed that the web had profoundly affected the way we gather our thoughts if not the way we

discipline will prove no mean feat since mental focus must take place amid the unlimited distractions of the internet internet  edge the highminded ideas and tech site has posed its annual question for 2010 — how is the internet changing the way you think — and gotten some interesting responses from a slew of smart people they range from the technology analyst nicholas carr who wonders if the web made it impossible for us to read long pieces of writing to clay shirky social software guru who sees the web poised uncertainly between immature invisible high school and more laudable invisible college david dalrymple a researcher at the massachusetts institute of technology thinks human memory will no longer be the key repository of knowledge and focus will supersede erudition quote before the internet most professional occupations required a large body of knowledge accumulated over years or even decades of experience but now anyone with good critical thinking skills and the ability to focus on the important information can retrieve it on demand from the internet rather than her own memory on the other hand those with wandering minds who might once have been able to focus by isolating themselves with their work now often cannot work without the internet which simultaneously furnishes a panoply of unrelated information — whether about their friends’ doings celebrity news limericks or millions of other sources of distraction the bottom line is that how well an employee can focus might now be more important than how knowledgeable he is knowledge was once an internal property of a person and focus on the task at hand could be imposed externally but with the internet knowledge can be supplied externally but focus must be forced internally  atlantic wirejanuary 14

we havent changed declares harvard physician and sociologist nicholas christakis our brains likely evolved  in response to the demands of social rather than environmental complexity and would likely only continue to evolve as our social framework changes our social framework has not changed from our family units to our military units he points out our social structures remain fairly similar to what they were over 1000 years ago the internet itself is not changing the fundamental reality of my thinking any more than it is changing our fundamental proclivity to violence or our innate capacity for love bordering on mental illness barry c smith of the university of london writes of the new importance of wellpackaged information he says he is personally exhilarated by the dizzying effort to

debates the target in depth who is planning what where by what means if one takes the digital revolution seriously  one must ask to what degree the communication of the industrialized twentyfirst century will change our thinking the computer pioneer daniel hillis describes how even such a simple procedure such as the programming of the time on networked computers is now barely understood by many programmers and he concludes with regard to climate change and financial crisis our machines are embodiments of our reason and we entrust them with a large number of our decisions in this process we have created a world that is beyond our understanding experts no longer talk about data but about what computers predict with the data neurobiological effects of constant multitasking lead as nicholas carr writes about outsourcing for everincreasing dependence on computers what if not only decisions about loans and budgets were subject to the use of computers but also those regarding

can also be applied to in enterprises and workplaces as cataphoracom has shown been overtaken by reality some of those authors presented by brockman do not find that the net has changed their thinking
