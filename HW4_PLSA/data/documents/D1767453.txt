the worlds finest and most comprehensive online gmat preparation learn more the score report an official gmat score report consists of five parts verbal scaled score on a scale from 0 to 60quantitative scaled score on a scale from 0 to 60total scaled score on a scale from 200 to 800analytical writing assessment awa score on a scale from 0 to 6integrated reasoning score on a scale from 1 to 8the total score is a scaled combination of the verbal and quantitative scaled scores and thus reflects a students overall performance on the multiplechoice sections of the test the awa and the integrated reasoning sections are scored independently scores for these sections do not affect the 200800 scaled score the verbal and quantitative sections to compute the scaled score for the verbal and quantitative sections gmat uses an algorithm that takes the following factors into accountthe number of questions answered within the time permittedthe number of questions answered correctlythe statistical characteristics including level of difficulty of the questions answered at the beginning of each section the gmat presents a question in the middle range of difficulty if the question is answered correctly the next question will be harder and the testtakers score will adjust upwards if the question is answered incorrectly the next question will be easier and the testtakerâ€™s score will adjust downwards the test taker does not see this adjustment because the score is not revealed until the entire test has been completed thus the algorithm is constantly recalculating the scaled score as the student progresses through the section as a testtaker answers more questions the algorithm receives more information about his or her skills and is able to calculate an accurate score with greater and greater precision consequently the questions at the beginning of the section are weighted much more heavily than questions near the end of the section for example by the time question 36 appears the computer has had 35 questions from which to derive the proper score range so even if question 36 were answered correctly the increase in score would be minimal compared to the increase in score if question 2 had been answered correctly upon completing the gmat testtakers must decide whether or not to keep their scores those who choose to keep their scores are able to view the total scaled score along with the separate verbal and quantitative scaled scores those who choose to cancel cannot view any scores the real value of a gmat score is determined by its percentile ranking a percentile ranking indicates the percentage of testtakers who scored at or below a particular score the higher the percentile ranking the more competitive the score percentile rankings in the charts below reflect the most current data from the gmac through july 2015 the following table shows the 61 possible gmat total scaled scores and the percentile rankings assigned to each scaled score

receives two scores on a scale of 0 to 6 at least one of which comes from a human reader the other score however may come from a computerized evaluation program if the scores from the two readers are identical or differ by exactly one point they are averaged to obtain the final score for that essay if the scores differ by more than one point an expert human reader determines the final score the

testtakers receive a scaled score of 3 or higher on the awa since human readers are involved in the awa grading process students cannot view their awa scores on the same day that they take the test students who choose to keep their scores receive an official gmat score report via regular mail approximately two weeks later that includes their awa score integrated reasoning the integrated reasoning section is scored on a scale of 1 to 8 in onepoint increments this section is not computer adaptive testtakers will not be able to view their integrated reasoning scores on the same day that
