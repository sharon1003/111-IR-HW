shearing was carried out by shepherds assigned servants ticket of leave men and free labourers using blade shears as the sheep industry expanded more shearers were required although the demand had increased the conditions had not and shearers had to contend with terrible working conditions very long hours and low pay in 1888 australia became the first country in the world have a complete shearing at dunlop station finished using machines by 1915 most large australian sheep station shearing sheds had machines that were powered by steam engines later internal combustion engines powered machines until rural power supplies became available sheep shearing today  editin most countries like australia with large sheep flocks the shearer is one of a contractors team that go from property to property shearing sheep and preparing the wool for market a workday starts at 730 am and the day is divided into four “runs” of two hours each “smoko” breaks of a half hour each are at 930 am and again at 3 pm the lunch break is taken at 12 midday for one hour most shearers are paid on a piece rate ie per sheep the shearer collects a sheep from a catching pen positions it on his “stand” on the shearing board and operates the shearing handpiece a shearer begins by removing the wool over the sheeps belly which is separated from the main fleece by a rouseabout while the sheep is still being shorn the remainder of the fleece is taken off in one piece by following an efficient set of movements in the case of powered shears the movements used are those devised by godfrey bowen in approximately 1950 1 or the tallyhi method in 1963 the tallyhi shearing system was developed by kevin sarre and the australian wool corporation who promoted the technique using synchronised shearing demonstrations sheep struggle less using the tallyhi method reducing strain on the shearer and there is a saving of about 30 seconds shearing each sheep when finished the shorn sheep is removed from the board via a chute in the floor or wall to a counting out pen efficiently removing it from the shed the latest shearing patterns which are used by some of the most efficient shearers around the world world record holders world champions etc have fewer blows due to better sheep control and positioning these patterns ensure that there is less strain placed on the sheep and the shearers due to the advanced techniques used 2crutching a sheep that has been wigged eyewooled a professional or gun shearer typically removes a fleece without badly marking or cutting the sheep in two to three minutes depending on the size and condition of the sheep or less than two in elite competitive shearing shearers who “tally” more than 400 sheep per day when shearing crossbreds or around 200 for finer wool sheep such as merino are known as “gun shearers” gun shearers using blade shears are usually shearers that have shorn at least 200 sheep in a day a learner shearer is a shearer or intending shearer who has shorn less than a specified number of sheep 3in 1983 the australian shearing industry was torn apart by the wide comb dispute and the ensuing 10week strike that followed the offending
