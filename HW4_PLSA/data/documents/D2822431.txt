if you are being harassed by lasers if you are being harassed by obvious lasers …… where you see someone holding a pen or flashlightlike object and you can see the laser beam or laser dot contact local authorities or the police if necessary simple harassment  a beam on your skin or clothes  is probably not punishable unless it continues or unless it occurs during a critical situation such as driving deliberate aiming at your head or eyes is serious due to the unlikely but possible potential for causing eye damage for more on eye damage see this information on how much laser power it takes to cause eye injuries if you have had laser light in your eyes see the page if you are hit by a laser a partial list of laser harassment incidents is here if you feel youre being harassed by nonobvious lasers …… first consider all the nonlaser explanations for what you are experiencing for example plants can turn brown see letter 1 below due to many factors other than laser beams also if you feel heat spots consult your doctor or do an internet search since there can be medical conditions that cause localized andor intermittent feelings of being hot if you really want to pursue this get photographic andor video evidence if at all possible ideally this would be pictures of the beams or the laser dot and also pictures of any damage if the harassment is mysterious or wellorganized occasionally we get emails or calls from people who are sure they are being deliberately targeted over a long period of time by angry neighbors or agencies such as the cia they clearly feel effects but their symptoms are often inexplicable by normal means for example laser beams have gone through solid walls and they can feel heat on their skin at laser pointer safetycom we are not experts in any directed energy we are only experts in visible lasers the light from visible lasers can be seen with the eye and can be recorded by a camera a visible laser’s light can be blocked by anything that also blocks conventional light such as a solid curtain or a wall beyond that we do not have expertise about nonvisible lasers or directed energy devices mysterious attacks in cuba show directed harassment devices exist directed energy harassment devices do exist for example in august 2017 reports came out that at least 16 diplomats serving in cuba had been affected by mysterious “acoustic attacks” symptoms included hearing a buzzing sound having headaches hearing loss balance issues and nausea cbs news reported “mild traumatic brain injuries and possible damage to the central nervous system as a result of the attacks” a september 14 2017 followup associated press report said “at least some of the incidents were confined to specific rooms or even parts of rooms with laserlike specificity baffling u s officials who say the facts and the physics dont add up” the report went on to say “the cases vary deeply different symptoms different recollections of what happened thats what makes the puzzle so difficult to crack “in several episodes recounted by u s officials victims knew it was happening in real time and there were strong indications of a sonic attack “some felt vibrations and heard sounds — loud ringing or a highpitch chirping similar to crickets or cicadas others heard the grinding noise some victims awoke with ringing in their ears and fumbled for their alarm clocks only to discover the ringing stopped when they moved away from their beds “the attacks seemed to come at night several victims reported they came in minutelong bursts “yet others heard nothing felt nothing later their symptoms came“the scope keeps widening on tuesday september 12 2017 the state department disclosed that doctors had confirmed another two cases bringing the total american victims to 21 some have mild traumatic brain injury known as a concussion and others permanent hearing loss”why would ordinary citizens be targeted it is another question whether such devices would be available or affordable to ordinary persons who want to harass other persons or whether such devices would be used by the government against ordinary citizens who don’t have vital state secrets we cannot help with issues about nonvisible lasers or directed energy devices however we can give some resources which may be of interest to persons who feel they are deliberately targeted by mysterious devices links about covert harassment and directed energy weapons the first two resources have links to other websites organizations and videos of interest too many links to list here thanks to jeannie for her help with this list people against covert torture  surveillance international from their home page “pacts international is a support network for those targeted with organized stalking and remote electronic assaults also known as electronic harassment electronic harassment in this context refers to the use of radio frequencies and other methods to remotely access a persons mind andor body to gain control of the individual or group of persons” much of the information at their site is in links to their newsletter such as this newsletter page the 2015 covert harassment conference in berlin this contains videos and a list of the program the material is in english there was also a 2014 covert harassment conference a 2002 presentation by dr reinhard munzert “targeting the human with directed energy weapons” here and here among other places some cases and our response here is a case in 2018 of a visible green laser harassing homeowners at least five times over two weeks the laser can easily be seen coming from a known location but because it is the commonarea hallway of an apartment the perpetrator was not known below are some sample reports of mysterious use of lasers or suspected lasers along with our responses this information may help others in similar situations letter 1 laser harassment 247we live across the street from a neighbor who has her laser lights on 24 hrs7days a week she shines her laser lights in other neighbors faces heads at children family pets windows of houses plants and trees which are singed from being over exposedburned by laser lights aircraft on our parked vehicles  vehicles driving down the street when i have been in the front yard my eyes and face start burning from the lasering the police have been called several times but state that they cannot do anything here are pictures of the laser attacks do you have any suggestions on how to go about getting this individual to stop harassing  terrorizing us our response you described your eyes and face burning when in your front yard it would take a very powerful and expensive laser to do this a simple laser pointer would not be able to create heat on your skin at a long distance such as across a yard the most powerful handheld laser currently available summer 2010 is the 1watt wicked laser arctic it can burn skin but at a very close distance and the burn is very small such as the size of a pea or less you also stated that various surfaces were singed again it would take a very very powerful and very expensive laser to do this it is very hard to imagine any use outside of military or police riot control and even these are exceedingly rare one way to tell if a laser is being used against you is to see if it only happens when you are in line with a window or similar opening to the outdoors this is because walls will stop laser beams but windows can let light through of course windows also let through sunlight and heat infrared so just being warm next to a window can be caused by normal nonlaser reasons both photos that you sent have a vertical line that goes through a strong light in the photo this straight line is not a laser it is an artifact of how some digital cameras work if there is a light source that is too strong for the cameras digital chip then all pixels in the same vertical line will be overwhelmed this is called blooming you can read more about blooming here one question i have for you is whether you have seen laser beams with your own eyes not from a cameras video i am guessing the answer is no i do not want to say absolutely positively 100 that there is no laser activity from your neighbors house the world is very large and every now and then there are strange things however i am 99999 sure that there is no laser activity from your neighbors house certainly the photos you have sent depict the blooming effect that is very common on some digital camera chips there is no doubt that what is in the photos is not laser the other effects you state such as heating and singeing are highly extremely unlikely to be caused by any type of laser that a residential person would have access to or could afford letter 2 lasers cause pinpoint holes to whom it may concern i have been getting burned for now about a year i have been finding burn holes in my miniblinds my dog i have found burn holes on her skin also is there anything i can do  it is really painful and i think they did this so i had to sell my home because i felt that my life was in danger i would be walking in the house and then i would get this burning sensation in my eyes and then i would fell my arms would be burning didnt matter what side of the house i was at i would get burned i would tell people and they would say thats weird so i sold my home because i feel they chased me out by hurting me and my dog i think they even killed some kittens with this laser flashlight i am writing to you cause no one help me or those kitten that didnt make or had a chance i think there should be a law against this it is really scary and painful thank you for having this information on the internet and maybe it can help someone name withheldour response it is very difficult to use a laser to create holes at long range more than a few yards or meters it also requires a very expensive laser to have enough power to make holes at long range i would not know why someone would go to this trouble if what you are seeing is small pinpoint holes it is highly unlikely that these are from a laser aimed at a distance laser beams do spread out even a little bit for example the beam at the aperture output opening of a powerful laser might be very small this might be a few millimeters or up to 14 in diameters and the edge of the hole would be sharp at a housetohouse distance the hole might be the size of a quarter at least and the edges might be more ragged with burn or scorch marks around the hole if a person is walking around with a handheld laser laser pointer or batterypowered laser then they could get close enough to make small holes or burn marks for a laser pointer this takes a lot of power and is expensive i do not know why someone would do this if they wanted to cause trouble there are a lot of ways that are more effective much less expensive and also hardtotrace it is possible for the laser beam to be invisible to our eyes infrared lasers have beams which we cant normally see however you can use a camcorder to try to see these beams to try this point the camcorder at an infrared remote control which are very common for tvs etc when you press a button on the remote control you should see a light flash in the camcorder viewfinder but not with your eyes if your camcorder can see the infrared light then you should be able to see infrared laser beams using the camcorders viewfinder or foldout monitor if someone is using a laser in the way you describe this is illegal it is damaging your property cruelty to animals and assault  battery you could call the police  but you should be sure that you really do have evidence for your own sensations of burning you may also want to consult a doctor or do research on the internet there are some conditions where you may experience burning due to something internal in your body letter 3 some suggestions from a person saying they were harassed to whom it may concern when i read the two stories of people getting harassed by laser pointers i thought i was reading about my own story i was also getting harassed by our neighbor we complained to the police as well but we got no help both me and my husband saw the green dots still the authorities were not convinced its very difficult to film since he changed locations from the window and could see us if we try to film or take picture we finally moved from there and thought it would be over but to our dismay it continued in the second home we moved in the same area it was not far enough so i started to do the research about laser pointers and their health risks on people here are a couple of suggestions first go to your home depot or lowes and get a mirrored privacy film and stick it to your windows make sure your windows are completely covered this will at least give you day time privacy and if they point the laser pointer at it they will get twice as much effect on themselves second do not close your house completely leave your windows a crack open because depending on the type of laser and its strength all lasers emit radiation the radiation further dries skin and increase the burning and does not help in healing third use coconut oil to moisturize skin and last get as many humidifiers and run them until there is enough moisture in the house this will negate the effects of radiation plus it will provide you with a relief from burning i hope this helps good luckfinally thank you for printing those articles i thought i was alone it is helpful to read what other people are going through name withheld our response we have found a few people who even if they moved to a different state still said they had symptoms of being harassed by lasers it is more likely that there is something about the person  some medical or perhaps brain condition  which is causing the symptoms we urge such persons to get a medical exam and to stress to the doctor that you really are feeling these sensations heat etc we are printing the information above because it may help others the first point is good if a problem is being caused by visible light lasers then lightblocking curtains shades or films will eliminate the problem you can also simply go into a room without windows or other openings to the outside and see if the symptoms go away visiblelight lasers with a dot or beam that you can see will be blocked by walls or other lightblocking material it is theoretically possible that an infrared lasers energy might go through a lightweight material but even here putting a wall between you and a suspected laser source would block the infrared light the second point is not really accurate lasers do emit radiation  electromagnetic radiation such as visible infrared or ultraviolet light lasers available to the general public do not emit higherenergy nuclear radiation such as xrays or gamma rays leaving windows open will not have any effect on light or radiation for example even a beam of xrays will not somehow build up in a house the third and fourth points may help if you do feel burning sensations a cream or extra moisture in the air may well help
