as previously communicated in perspectives october 2009 effective july 15 2010 the joint commission will begin to accredit hospitals in accordance with their centers for medicare and medicaid services certification number ccn over the last several months joint commission staff has contacted organizations impacted by this change we have developed several key frequently asked questions faqs which should answer many of the questions you may have about this change if you have any additional questions or would like to clarify further concerns please submit them to ccnquestionsjointcommissionorg in accordance with the hospital deeming authority granted by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms effective july 15 2010 joint commission will be required to accredit hospitals in accordance with their cms’ certification number ccn formerly known as the medicare provider number this means that there must be a onetoone match between a joint commission accreditation award and a hospital ccn that is a single accreditation award cannot encompass more than one single ccn or one single ccn cannot encompass more than one accreditation decision historically almost all of the hospitals accredited by the joint commission have been accredited in accordance with their ccn however less than 100 hospitalsfor a variety of reasonshave not the joint commission has been working with the hospitals on a oneonone basis to help with the transition the following are relevant faqs and answers what is a hospital’s ccn a hospital’s cms’ certification number ccn is the hospital’s identification number and is linked to its medicare provider agreement the ccn is used for cms certification certain types of health care facilities including hospitals seeking to participate in the medicare program are required not only to satisfactorily complete the medicare enrollment application but also to be certified as meeting the medicare health and safety standards the ccn is also used for submitting and reviewing the hospital’s cost reports the ccn number used to be called the provider number but with the advent of the statutorily mandated national provider identifier npi number for claims processing the ccn now plays a different role within the medicare program how does a hospital get a ccn a hospital that seeks to participate in the medicare program must first submit form cms 855a medicare enrollment application for institutional providers to its regional medicare administrative contractor or legacy fiscal intermediary once the application is reviewed by the macfi and recommended for approval to the cms regional office the hospital must then demonstrate its compliance with the hospital conditions of participation through a survey and in the case of specialized hospitals with other federal requirements as well once it has demonstrated this the cms regional office will assign an effective date for the medicare provider agreement and issue the ccn even if the hospital changes ownership it will retain the same ccn so long as the new owners assume the medicare provider agreement however there are circumstances when an existing hospital that has participated in medicare must be treated as a new provider undergoing a new enrollment process and assignment of a new ccn the cms determines the requirements and process governing the enrollment of a hospital in medicare and assignment of a ccn additionally cms will change the ccn if the hospital changes its type of medicare hospital classification such as when a short term acute care hospital converts to a long term care hospital will the joint commission be required to determine if a hospital seeking accreditation for medicare certification matches the way in which that hospital is enrolled in medicare yes the joint commission changed its eligibility criteria to specifically require that only hospitals that match the way in which they are enrolled in the medicare program can be surveyed as one hospital using joint commission hospital standards the medicare program allows considerable flexibility to hospital systems to define the boundaries of a participating hospital as an example a system that owns four hospitals in a specified geographic area may choose to have each hospital separately enrolled in medicare or if it satisfies applicable medicare rules it can enroll them as one multicampus hospital in the first instance each of the four hospitals would have its own ccn and each would be required to comply separately with the co ps in the second instance the four facilities would each be campuses of one hospital with one ccn and together they would have to comply with the co ps as one hospital the hospital system not the cms makes the decision on the manner in which it enrolls the facilities but once it has done so it must be surveyed and accredited in the same manner is the requirement for the joint commission to accredit hospitals in accordance with their ccn a new requirement from cms in july 2008 a new law was passed which required joint commission to apply for continued deeming authority this continued deeming authority was awarded and published in the federal register on november 29 2009 as part of this award effective july 15 2010 joint commission will be required to accredit hospitals in accordance with their ccn why is cms requiring joint commission to accredit hospitals in accordance with their ccn the cms identifies the boundaries of a hospital in terms of what locations it has identified on its form cms 855a application including all subsequent 855as submitted with location updates all of these locations are covered under the same ccn associated with this application therefore the compliance of a hospital as measured by an accreditation award must be assessed in accordance with the ccn when there is not a onetoone match between an accreditation award and a ccn noncompliance with the co ps is likely for example when a hospital participates in medicare as a multicampus hospital with four inpatient locations it must have one governing body and one unified medical and nursing staff for all campuses medicare regulations do not permit independent compliance with the co ps at separate locations of a hospital further serious noncompliance at any one campus impacts the participation of all campuses in medicare since they participate as only one hospital if at the same time it is accredited as four separate hospitals then each campus would separately meet the accreditation standards which is inconsistent with the medicare requirements is cms requiring aoa and dnv to accredit hospitals in accordance with their ccn yes all hospital accreditors granted deeming authority by the cms are required to accredit hospitals in accordance with their ccn for the hospitals that have not been accredited in accordance with their ccn will this requirement impact them significantly it depends and each situation may be different in order for a hospital to be medicarecertified and assigned a ccn and also be accredited it must be able to demonstrate that it meets all of the conditions of participation co ps and joint commission standards in addition to the co ps at all locations covered by the ccn but independent of any other hospital facilities not covered by that ccn for hospitals that have participated separately in medicare but have been accredited as one multicampus facility the governing body and medical staff requirements may be problematic since in the past a single governing body and a single medical staff may have been responsible for multiple hospitals going forward each entity that has chosen to participate in medicare as one hospital must have a single governing body and a single medical staff conversely each hospital system that has chosen to have each hospital participate separately in medicare but has been accredited as one entity must have separate governing bodies medical staffs and nursing staffs even if this is duplicative within their multihospital system for the impacted hospitals joint commission will discuss their circumstances and share suggested approaches can the same individuals who make up the governing body andor the same individuals who make up the medical staff be responsible for more than one hospital yes as long as the responsibilities for each hospital’s governing body and medical staff are performed independent of carrying out responsibilities for another hospital and there is evidence of such for example the same set of individuals may function as the governing body or medical staff for more than one hospital but they must convene themselves separately as each hospital’s governing body or medical staff in order to carry out their responsibilities for each separately certified hospital the separation does not have to be by place but by time – in other words the same individuals can meet in one place convene themselves as the governing body of hospital a conclude their business and then convene themselves as the governing body of hospital b etc each meeting must have its own set of minutes etc further with respect to the medical staff there needs to be a separate privileging process for each hospital even though the same physicians may practice at both hospitals does a hospital or a hospital system need to do restructuring so that each hospital is accredited in accordance with their ccn to the degree possible we would hope not through the years hospitals have formed systems to standardize and integrate their services to improve their delivery of patient care we wouldn’t want to interfere with this positive effort nonetheless each facility in a system which has enrolled separately in medicare and has its own ccn must be able to demonstrate compliance with the co ps independent of other hospitals in the system joint commission staff will work with each affected hospitalsystem to help them understand the requirements and any actions they may wish to pursue to be in compliance hospital systems also have the option of changing the way in which their member facilities are enrolled in medicare in order to match they way in which they are accredited such decisions may have complex ramifications for example in terms of the number of medicare graduate medical education slots available to the system hospital systems therefore should carefully consider what arrangement best serves their needs for specific questions about changing enrollment in medicare it is recommended that the organization contact their cms regional office to discuss the potential ramifications of any such changes besides assuring that each hospital is in compliance with the co ps and joint commission standards independent of any other hospital are there any other relevant changes related to accrediting hospitals in accordance with their ccn yes all locations covered by a hospital’s ccn are subject to survey for compliance with the hospital standards  this is because the hospital has indicated in its form 855a filings to cms that all of these service locations are hospital departmentsservices and therefore they must be able to meet the hospital co ps thus if a hospital identifies ambulatory care services andor behavioral health care services on its form 855a as a providerbased hospital department regardless of whether these services are on the main hospital campus or offsite or as a remote ie inpatient location or satellite then these services must be surveyed as part of the one accredited hospital using hospital standards if joint commission policies specify another set of standards such as ambulatory or behavioral health care to survey these services then these standards will be used in addition to the hospital standards on the other hand if a serviceprogram eg home care or ambulatory has a separate ccn the serviceprogram cannot be surveyed as part of the hospital but would instead be surveyed using home care or ambulatory health care standards respectively will all providerbased departments satellites or remote locations under a hospital’s ccn be included in the hospital’s survey yes all providerbased departments providerbased remote locations and satellites of a provider covered under a hospital’s ccn will be subject to inclusion in the hospital’s survey the following definitions from the cms regulations may help to clarifydepartment of a provider means a facility or organization that is either created by or acquired by a main provider for the purpose of furnishing health care services of the same type as those furnished by the main provider under the name ownership and financial and administrative control of the main provider in accordance with the provisions of this section a department of a provider comprises both the specific physical facility that serves as the site of services of a type for which payment could be claimed under the medicare or medicaid program and the personnel and equipment needed to deliver the services at that facility a department of a provider may not by itself be qualified to participate in medicare as a provider under §4892 of this chapter and the medicare conditions of participation do not apply to a department as an independent entity for purposes of this part the term department of a provider does not include an rhc or except as specified in paragraph n of this section an fqhc providerbased departments do not include those that perform functions necessary for the successful operation of the providers but do not furnish services of a type for which separate payment could be claimed under medicare or medicaid remote location of a hospital means a facility or an organization that is either created by or acquired by a hospital that is a main provider for the purpose of furnishing inpatient hospital services under the name ownership and financial and administrative control of the main provider in accordance with the provisions of this section a remote location of a hospital comprises both the specific physical facility that serves as the site of services for which separate payment could be claimed under the medicare or medicaid program and the personnel and equipment needed to deliver the services at that facility the medicare conditions of participation do not apply to a remote location of a hospital as an independent entity for purposes of this part the term remote location of a hospital does not include a satellite facility   satellite facility is a part of a hospital that provides inpatient services in a building also used by another hospital or in one or more entire buildings located on the same campus as buildings used by another hospital or in one or more entire buildings located on the same campus as buildings used by another hospital satellites are part of an inpatient prospective payment system ippsexcluded hospital or part of an ippsexcluded unit of an ipps hospital and the satellite is always colocated with an unrelated hospital there are also providerbased entities defined as a provider of health care services or an rhc… that is either created by or acquired by a main provider for the purpose of furnishing health care services of a different emphasis added type from those of the main provider under the ownership and administrative and financial control of the main provider in accordance with the provisions of this section a providerbased entity comprises both the specific physical facility that serves as the site of services of a type for which payment could be claimed under the medicare or medicaid program and the personnel and equipment needed to deliver the services at that facility a providerbased entity may by itself be qualified to participate in medicare as a provider under §4892 of this chapter and the medicare conditions of participation do apply to a providerbased entity as an independent entity because providerbased entities have their own ccns and medicare health and safety standards they are not subject to survey as part of the hospital a hospital with four inpatient campuses is a hospital consisting of one main provider and three remote locations for hospitals that have not been accredited in accordance with their ccn will they be required to be surveyed in this manner before july 15 2010 beginning july 15 2010 when hospitals are due for a resurvey they will be required to be surveyed in accordance with their ccn also if after this date a hospital is required to have a survey such as due to a change in ownership new patient care site or followup to a complaint the hospital is surveyed in this manner prior to july 15 2010 if a hospital wishes to be surveyed in accordance with their ccn regardless of when they are due the joint commission will accommodate the hospital’s wishes  if a hospital is not surveyed in accordance with its ccn by july 15 2010 then how will it be accredited in accordance with its ccn by this date by july 15 2010 joint commission staff will establish an accreditation record for each hospital’s ccn based on the hospitals’ most recent accreditation survey thus each hospital ccn will have a separate joint commission accreditation record and decision and therefore will be in compliance with the cms’ requirement to be accredited in accordance with their ccn for a hospital that is not surveyed in accordance with their ccn by july 15 2010 what are the implications for the hospital after this date for all intracycle activities the hospital must be prepared to meet all joint commission standards and requirements and the co ps consistent with the manner in which it has chosen to participate in medicare as of july 15 2010 for example this means that the hospital must submit its own application and ppr and report performance measurement independent of any other hospital but including all providerbased remote locations satellites and departments for hospitals that have been surveyed as a single organization but participate in medicare separately how will they be surveyed in the future considering each hospital must be surveyed and accredited in accordance with their ccn these hospitals can be surveyed independently of each other at various times during the 1839month window or concurrently if the hospitals wish to be surveyed concurrently the unannounced survey will begin with an orientation to the system organizationstructure this will commence in the first hours of the surveys and then the survey teams all at the same time will be dispatched immediately to each of the hospitals being surveyed all joint commission standardsrequirements will be surveyed at each hospital independent of the other hospitals being surveyed and each hospital will receive an accreditation decision independent of other hospitals being surveyed if a site which is currently certified and accredited as part of another hospital wishes to seek a separate hospital provider agreement and ccn will the site continue to be considered accredited until the site receives its joint commission survey no if a site has been participating in medicare as part of a hospital but applies for a separate provider agreement and ccn it is considered by cms as an initial applicant and must undergo a separate joint commission survey and accreditation after it has legally separated from its parent hospital before cms will issue it a provider agreement and ccn if a site which is currently accredited as part of another organization wishes to seek a separate provider agreement and ccn will it continue to be able to bill cms under the prior ccn according to the cms once an organizationsite separates from the original hospital and is a hospital in its own right it may no longer bill cms under the ccn of the hospital it was once part of any patients in this new hospital are now patients of the new hospital not the previous hospital once the newly created hospital is certified for participation in medicare and is assigned its own ccn it may bill for and be paid for eligible services provided on or after its assigned effective date for specific questions about cms billing requirementspractices it is recommended that the organization contacts its medicare administrative contractor or legacy fiscal intermediary as applicable if a joint commission survey team surveys an affected hospital before july 15 2010 what will be the expectations for the survey team the joint commission survey team should survey the hospital in the usual manner if there are any questions the survey team should contact the field director oncall who will discuss the situation with ms gail weinberger director accreditation policy and administration
