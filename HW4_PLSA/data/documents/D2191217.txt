fireflies bioluminescence posted on may 1 2015 by lindgren by jennifer noonan widely known as fireflies members of the family lampyridae belong to the order coleoptera within the class insecta which in fact makes them members of the beetles rather than the flies pechenik 2010 although most beetles can and do produce “music” the lampyridae achieve recognition for their ability to generate light pechenik 2010 this light is produced by specialized organs located on the abdomen and primarily functions in species recognition during mating lloyd 1966 females interpret speciesspecific flash patterns given off by males and then respond with their own pattern so that two individuals of the same species can find one another these flashing patterns are so distinctive to each species that they can be used for classification lloyd 1966 the success of firefly reproduction is owed largely to the phenomenon of bioluminescence male photinus sp in flight emitting a light signal in hopes of attracting a female photo by terry priest used under the creative commons attributionshare alike 20 generic license bioluminescence itself is essentially chemiluminescence with the stipulation that it occurs within a living organism chemiluminescence is the result of a chemical reaction which produces a molecule in an excited state that then returns to the ground state by emitting energy as light sheehan 2009 molecules only release excess energy as light when they are incapable of dispersing it by nonradiative mechanisms such as vibration it is structureimposed constraints that are responsible for preventing these specific molecules from using nonradiative mechanisms and cause them to resort to radiative ones visible to humans as light in order to return to the ground state sheehan 2009 the molecule that meets this qualification and is used by all known species of firefly for bioluminescence is luciferin lewis  cratsley 2008 catalyzed by the enzyme luciferase in the presence of magnesium luciferin is adenylated and then undergoes a series of oxygendependent reactions which bring about the emittance of light variations in the timing and control of the oxygenrelated steps and amino acid substitutions in the luciferase enzyme enable species to emit light of different wavelengths resulting in different colours the exact mechanism by which the flashing pattern is actualized is not clear but nerve signals are implicated and the presence of nitric oxide may play an important role lewis and cratsley 2008 the bioluminescent flash or glow of a firefly is the product of a complicated set of organic chemical reactions light producing chemical reaction of firefly luciferin with the luciferase enzyme illustration by jennifer noonan using information from lewis  cratsley 2008 although fireflies primarily use their bioluminescent capacity for species recognition during mating some members of this family can have ulterior motives typically airborne males of the photuris photinus and pyractonema genera emit light signals while females remain stationary on vegetation below to watch and respond christy 1995 deception arises when female photuris impersonate female photinus and pyractomena by mimicking the signals that they use to respond to their males the unlucky males of these genera who fall for the mimicry approach the female photuris and become her prey she eats them this behaviour has been going on for so long that the mating rituals between males and females of photuris have become dysfunctional the males must mimic the light signals of photinus or pyractomena in hopes that a female of his species will attempt to make him her prey it is speculated that photuris no longer have their own unique pattern of light signals for mating and are forced to rely on this mimicrydeception mechanism in order to procreate christy 1995 female photuris may use bioluminescence to get a meal but she may make it more difficult for herself to find a mate humans have also found uses for firefly bioluminescence that differ from the natural and traditional in biochemistry firefly luciferin can be used to label biomolecules sheehan 2009 when the sample is treated with luciferase the luciferin will emit light which can be detected measured or quantified and yield important information about the sample luciferin is commonly used in biochemical assays and the staining of nucleic acid and protein blots sheehan 2009 one compelling example of luciferin’s proficiency in biochemical assays is its potential use in assessing cancerous tumor angiogenesis sun et al 2010 studies have been successful in mice but have yet to be tested in a human model fireflies have been using luciferase for a long time but it may hold even more value to humans than is yet known
