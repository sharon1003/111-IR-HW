riemann was the first rigorous definition of the integral of a function on an interval it was presented to the faculty at the university of göttingen in 1854 but not published in a journal until 1868 1 for many functions and practical applications the riemann integral can be evaluated by the fundamental theorem of calculus or approximated by numerical integration the riemann integral is unsuitable for many theoretical purposes some of the technical deficiencies in riemann integration can be remedied with the riemann–stieltjes integral and most disappear with the lebesgue integral contents  hide

external links overview  editlet f be a nonnegative real valued function on the interval  a b and letbe the region of the plane under the graph of the function f and above the interval  a b see the figure on the top right we are interested in measuring the area of s once we have measured it we will denote the area by the basic idea of the riemann integral is to use very simple approximations for the area of s by taking better and better approximations we can say that in the limit we get exactly the area of s under the curve note that where f can be both positive and negative the definition of s is modified so that the integral corresponds to the signed area under the graph of f that is the area above the x axis minus the area below the x axis definition  editpartitions of an interval  edita partition of an interval  a b is a finite sequence of numbers of the form each  x i x i  1 is called a subinterval of the partition the mesh or norm of a partition is defined to be the length of the longest subinterval that isa tagged partition p  x t of an interval  a b is a partition together with a finite sequence of numbers t 0  t n − 1 subject to the conditions that for each i t i∈  x i x i  1 in other words it is a partition together with a distinguished point of every subinterval the mesh of a tagged partition is the same as that of an ordinary partition suppose that two partitions p  x t and q  y s are both partitions of the interval  a b we say that q  y s is a refinement of p  x t if for each integer i with i ∈ 0 n there exists an integer r  i such that x i y r  i and such that t i s j for some j with j ∈  r  i  r  i  1 said more simply a refinement of a tagged partition breaks up some of the subintervals and adds tags to the partition where necessary thus it refines the accuracy of the partition we can define a partial order on the set of all tagged partitions by saying that one tagged partition is greater or equal to another if the former is a refinement of the latter riemann sums  editlet f be a realvalued function defined on the interval  a b the riemann sum of f with respect to the tagged partition x 0  x n together with t 0  t n − 1 is 2each term in the sum is the product of the value of the function at a given point and the length of an interval consequently each term represents the signed area of a rectangle with height f  t i and width x i  1− x i the riemann sum is the signed area of all the rectangles a closely related concept are the lower and upper darboux sums these are similar to riemann sums but the tags are replaced by the infimum and supremum respectively of f on each subinterval l f p f t u f p f t if f is continuous then the lower and upper darboux sums for an untagged partition are equal to the riemann sum for that partition where the tags are chosen to be the minimum or maximum respectively of f on each subinterval when f is discontinuous on a subinterval there may not be a tag that achieves the infimum or supremum on that subinterval the darboux integral which is similar to the riemann integral but based on darboux sums is equivalent to the riemann integral riemann integral  editloosely speaking the riemann integral is the limit of the riemann sums of a function as the partitions get finer if the limit exists then the function is said to be integrable or more specifically riemannintegrable  the riemann sum can be made as close as desired to the riemann integral by making the partition fine enough 3one important requirement is that the mesh of the partitions must become smaller and smaller so that in the limit it is zero if this were not so then we would not be getting a good approximation to the function on certain subintervals in fact this is enough to define an integral to be specific we say that the riemann integral of f equals s if the following condition holds for all ε  0 there exists δ  0 such that for any tagged partition x 0  x n and t 0  t n − 1 whose mesh is less than δ we have unfortunately this definition is very difficult to use it would help to develop an equivalent definition of the riemann integral which is easier to work with we develop this definition now with a proof of equivalence following our new definition says that the riemann integral of f equals s if the following condition holds for all ε  0 there exists a tagged partition y 0  y m and r 0  r m − 1 such that for any tagged partition x 0  x n and t 0  t n − 1 which is a refinement of y 0  y m and r 0  r m − 1 we have both of these mean that eventually the riemann sum of f with respect to any partition gets trapped close to s since this is true no matter how close we demand the sums be trapped we say that the riemann sums converge to s these definitions are actually a special case of a more general concept a net as we stated earlier these two definitions are equivalent in other words s works in the first definition if and only if s works in the second definition to show that the first definition implies the second start with an ε and choose a δ that satisfies the condition choose any tagged partition whose mesh is less than δ its riemann sum is within ε of s and any refinement of this partition will also have mesh less than δ so the riemann sum of the refinement will also be within ε of s to show that the second definition implies the first it is easiest to use the darboux integral first one shows that the second definition is equivalent to the definition of the darboux integral for this see the article on darboux integration now we will show that a darboux integrable function satisfies the first definition fix ε and choose a partition y 0  y m such that the lower and upper darboux sums with respect to this partition are within ε 2 of the value s of the darboux integral let if r  0 then f is the zero function which is clearly both darboux and riemann integrable with integral zero therefore we will assume that r  0 if m  1 then we choose δ such that if m  1 then we choose δ to be less than one choose a tagged partition x 0  x n and t 0  t n − 1 with mesh smaller than δ we must show that the riemann sum is within ε of s to see this choose an interval  x i x i  1 if this interval is contained within some  y j y j  1 thenwhere m j and m j are respectively the infimum and the supremum of f on  y j y j  1 if all intervals had this property then this would conclude the proof because each term in the riemann sum would be bounded by a corresponding term in the darboux sums and we chose the darboux sums to be near s this is the case when m  1 so the proof is finished in that case therefore we may assume that m  1 in this case it is possible that one of the  x i x i  1 is not contained in any  y j y j  1 instead it may stretch across two of the intervals determined by y 0  y m it cannot meet three intervals because δ is assumed to be smaller than the length of any one interval in symbols it may happen that we may assume that all the inequalities are strict because otherwise we are in the previous case by our assumption on the length of δ  this can happen at most m − 1 times to handle this case we will estimate the difference between the riemann sum and the darboux sum by subdividing the partition x 0  x n at y j  1 the term f  t i  x i  1− x i in the riemann sum splits into two terms suppose without loss of generality that t i∈  y j y j  1 thenso this term is bounded by the corresponding term in the darboux sum for y j to bound the other term notice that it follows that for some indeed any t i∈  y j  1 x i  1since this happens at most m − 1 times the distance between the riemann sum and a darboux sum is at most ε 2 therefore the distance between the riemann sum and s is at most ε examples  editlet f  0 1 → r be the function which takes the value 1 at every point any riemann sum of f on 0 1 will have the value 1 therefore the riemann integral of f on 0 1 is 1 let i q 0 1 → r be the indicator function of the rational numbers in 0 1 that is i q takes the value 1 on rational numbers and 0 on irrational numbers this function does not have a riemann integral to prove this we will show how to construct tagged partitions whose riemann sums get arbitrarily close to both zero and one to start let x 0  x n and t 0  t n − 1 be a tagged partition each t i is between x i and x i  1  choose ε  0 the t i have already been chosen and we cant change the value of f at those points but if we cut the partition into tiny pieces around each t i we can minimize the effect of the t i then by carefully choosing the new tags we can make the value of the riemann sum turn out to be within ε of either zero or one our first step is to cut up the partition there are n of the t i and we want their total effect to be less than ε if we confine each of them to an interval of length less than ε  n then the contribution of each t i to the riemann sum will be at least 0 · ε  n and at most 1 · ε  n this makes the total sum at least zero and at most ε so let δ be a positive number less than ε  n if it happens that two of the t i are within δ of each other choose δ smaller if it happens that some t i is within δ of some x j and t i is not equal to x j choose δ smaller since there are only finitely many t i and x j we can always choose δ sufficiently small now we add two cuts to the partition for each t i one of the cuts will be at t i− δ 2 and the other will be at t i δ 2 if one of these leaves the interval 0 1 then we leave it out t i will be the tag corresponding to the subinterval if t i is directly on top of one of the x j then we let t i be the tag for both intervals we still have to choose tags for the other subintervals we will choose them in two different ways the first way is to always choose a rational point so that the riemann sum is as large as possible this will make the value of the riemann sum at least 1 − ε the second way is to always choose an irrational point so that the riemann sum is as small as possible this will make the value of the riemann sum at most ε since we started from an arbitrary partition and ended up as close as we wanted to either zero or one it is false to say that we are eventually trapped near some number s so this function is not riemann integrable however it is lebesgue integrable in the lebesgue sense its integral is zero since the function is zero almost everywhere but this is a fact that is beyond the reach of the riemann integral there are even worse examples i q is equivalent that is equal almost everywhere to a riemann integrable function but there are nonriemann integrable bounded functions which are not equivalent to any riemann integrable function for example let c be the smith–volterra–cantor set and let i c be its indicator function because c is not jordan measurable i c is not riemann integrable moreover no function g equivalent to i c is riemann integrable g like i c must be zero on a dense set so as in the previous example any riemann sum of g has a refinement which is within ε of 0 for any positive number ε but if the riemann integral of g exists then it must equal the lebesgue integral of i c which is 12 therefore g is not riemann integrable similar concepts  editit is popular to define the riemann integral as the darboux integral this is because the darboux integral is technically simpler and because a function is riemannintegrable if and only if it is darbouxintegrable some calculus books do not use general tagged partitions but limit themselves to specific types of tagged partitions if the type of partition is limited too much some nonintegrable functions may appear to be integrable one popular restriction is the use of lefthand and righthand riemann sums in a lefthand riemann sum t i x i for all i and in a righthand riemann sum t i x i  1 for all i alone this restriction does not impose a problem we can refine any partition in a way that makes it a lefthand or righthand sum by subdividing it at each t i in more formal language the set of all lefthand riemann sums and the set of all righthand riemann sums is cofinal in the set of all tagged partitions another popular restriction is the use of regular subdivisions of an interval for example the n th regular subdivision of 0 1 consists of the intervals again alone this restriction does not impose a problem but the reasoning required to see this fact is more difficult than in the case of lefthand and righthand riemann sums however combining these restrictions so that one uses only lefthand or righthand riemann sums on regularly divided intervals is dangerous if a function is known in advance to be riemann integrable then this technique will give the correct value of the integral but under these conditions the indicator function i q will appear to be integrable on 0 1 with integral equal to one every endpoint of every subinterval will be a rational number so the function will always be evaluated at rational numbers and hence it will appear to always equal one the problem with this definition becomes apparent when we try to split the integral into two pieces the following equation ought to hold if we use regular subdivisions and lefthand or righthand riemann sums then the two terms on the left are equal to zero since every endpoint except 0 and 1 will be irrational but as we have seen the term on the right will equal 1 as defined above the riemann integral avoids this problem by refusing to integrate i q the lebesgue integral is defined in such a way that all these integrals are 0 properties  editlinearity  editthe riemann integral is a linear transformation that is if f and g are riemannintegrable on  a b and α and β are constants then∫  ∫ ∫because the riemann integral of a function is a number this makes the riemann integral a linear functional on the vector space of riemannintegrable functions integrability  edita bounded function on a compact interval  a b is riemann integrable if and only if it is continuous almost everywhere the set of its points of discontinuity has measure zero in the sense of lebesgue measure  this is known as the lebesgues integrability condition or lebesgues criterion for riemann integrability or the riemann–lebesgue theorem 4 the criterion has nothing to do with the lebesgue integral it is due to lebesgue and uses his measure zero but makes use of neither lebesgues general measure or integral the integrability condition can be proven in various ways 4 5 6 7 one of which is sketched below  show proof in particular any set that is at most countable has lebesgue measure zero and thus a bounded function on a compact interval with only finitely or countably many discontinuities is riemann integrable an indicator function of a bounded set is riemannintegrable if and only if the set is jordan measurable 10 the riemann integral can be interpreted measuretheoretically as the integral with respect to the jordan measure if a realvalued function is monotone on the interval  a b it is riemannintegrable since its set of discontinuities is at most countable and therefore of lebesgue measure zero if a realvalued function on  a b is riemannintegrable it is lebesgueintegrable that is riemannintegrability is a stronger meaning more difficult to satisfy condition than lebesgueintegrability if f n is a uniformly convergent sequence on  a b with limit f then riemann integrability of all f n implies riemann integrability of f and however the lebesgue monotone convergence theorem on a monotone pointwise limit does not hold in riemann integration taking limits under the integral sign is far more difficult to logically justify than in lebesgue integration 11generalizations  editit is easy to extend the riemann integral to functions with values in the euclidean vector space r n for any n the integral is defined componentwise in other words if f   f 1  f n then in particular since the complex numbers are a real vector space this allows the integration of complex valued functions the riemann integral is only defined on bounded intervals and it does not extend well to unbounded intervals the simplest possible extension is to define such an integral as a limit in other words as an improper integral this definition carries with it some subtleties such as the fact that it is not always equivalent to compute the cauchy principal value for example consider the function f  x which is 0 at x  0 1 for x  0 and −1 for x  0 by symmetryalways regardless of a but there are many ways for the interval of integration to expand to fill the real line and other ways can produce different results in other words the multivariate limit does not always exist we can computef x dxaf x dxa in general this improper riemann integral is undefined even standardizing a way for the interval to approach the real line does not work because it leads to disturbingly counterintuitive results if we agree for instance that the improper integral should always bethen the integral of the translation f  x − 1 is −2 so this definition is not invariant under shifts a highly undesirable property in fact not only does this function not have an improper riemann integral its lebesgue integral is also undefined it equals ∞ − ∞  unfortunately the improper riemann integral is not powerful enough the most severe problem is that there are no widely applicable theorems for commuting improper riemann integrals with limits of functions in applications such as fourier series it is important to be able to approximate the integral of a function using integrals of approximations to the function for proper riemann integrals a standard theorem states that if f n is a sequence of functions that converge uniformly to f on a compact set  a b then on noncompact intervals such as the real line this is false for example take f n  x to be n −1 on 0 n and zero elsewhere for all n we have the sequence  f n converges uniformly to the zero function and clearly the integral of the zero function is zero consequentlythis demonstrates that for integrals on unbounded intervals uniform convergence of a function is not strong enough to allow passing a limit through an integral sign this makes the riemann integral unworkable in applications even though the riemann integral assigns both sides the correct value because there is no other general criterion for exchanging a limit and a riemann integral and without such a criterion it is difficult to approximate integrals by approximating their integrands a better route is to abandon the riemann integral for the lebesgue integral the definition of the lebesgue integral is not obviously a generalization of the riemann integral but it is not hard to prove that every riemannintegrable function is lebesgueintegrable and that the values of the two integrals agree whenever they are both defined moreover a function f defined on a bounded interval is riemannintegrable if and only if it is bounded and the set of points where f is discontinuous has lebesgue measure zero an integral which is in fact a direct generalization of the riemann integral is the henstock–kurzweil integral another way of generalizing the riemann integral is to replace the factors x k  1− x k in the definition of a riemann sum by something else roughly speaking this gives the interval of integration a different notion of length this is the approach taken by the riemann–stieltjes integral in multivariable calculus the riemann integrals for functions from r n→ r are multiple integrals see also  editarea antiderivative lebesgue integration notes  edit the riemann integral was introduced in bernhard riemanns paper über die darstellbarkeit einer function durch eine
