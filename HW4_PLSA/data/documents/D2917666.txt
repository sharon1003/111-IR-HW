substitutions09302011substitutions flexibility within limitations all manufacturers wish that their product or products are used on construction projects otherwise they would not be in the business but on the design side not every product is suitable for a given project nor is there sufficient fee to research every product that could potentially be used on a project therefore with few exceptions most design professionals focus on one or two potential products for design purposes which leave other possible products waiting in the wings how these other possible products make it into the project depends on what the construction documents provide in the form of substitution procedures substitution of specified or indicated products has probably been around as long as building construction has been in existence however throughout the history of construction there was no formalized substitution process developed for construction professionals to implement until the 1960’s at the beginning of the 1960’s an innovative arizona architect by the name of fred m guirey faia developed the “prior approval” system which allows specifications to be concise by using brand names but allows bidders to submit “equal” products guirey’s goal was to achieve the lowest price for the owner at minimal risk for the contractor while at the same time conforming to governmental requirements for competitive bidding in 1962 guirey hired maynard blumer faia fcsi and tasked him to further define the prior approval process as a result blumer developed a process that consisted of eleven rules twelve years later blumer’s prior approval process was integrated into standard aia documents thus the formalized substitution procedure was born 1the substitution process is beneficial for all parties owners contractors and subcontractors design professionals and construction product manufacturers however the process needs to be regulated with clear and concise provisions in the procurement and contract documents specifications before a discussion of how substitutions should be handled in the procurement and contract documents a discussion on the more basic topic of how products should be specified is necessary in order for the manufacturer to prepare a meaningful substitution request and for the design professional to make a fair comparison the specifications should state the essential characteristics of an acceptable product specifications for privately funded construction projects can be proprietary but if the owner wants to keep its options open to maximize performance minimize cost or both then substitutions are a means to achieve that for publicly funded projects procurement regulations at all levels of government federal state county and local require some form of open competition for example the federal acquisition regulation far 6101 which references the united states code u s c states that government contracts shall “promote and provide full and open competition”however this does not preclude the use of proprietary specifications as long as the specifications are “open” which means the submission of proposed substitutions is available to bidders for example the far states the following in section 63021 c brandname or equal descriptions and other purchase descriptions that permit prospective contractors to offer products other than those specifically referenced by brand name provide for full and open competition and do not require justifications and approvals to support their use many government agencies take the quote above literally and require that the specifications when listing a brand name must follow it with “or equal” when listing specific manufacturers and products some agencies have established policies that require at least three products or manufacturers be listed—some going as far as requiring the minimum three plus the “or equal” the problem with using “or equal” in a specification is the conundrum of what is considered “equal” there are many products out on the market but very few would be considered “equal” to other like products a specification that lists just a brandname product sometimes referred to as a “basisofdesign” product and “or equal” or its equivalent does not provide the essential information to make a comparison for proposed substitutions many manufacturers provide product sheets with a long list of characteristics and performance data for specified brandname products using these lengthy lists of information is a poor basis for reviewing substitutions since no two products are exactly alike  ie equal leaving reviewers to ask the question which features are most important therefore when using a brandname product the specifications should additionally identify the minimum characteristics and performance data that are required for the project limiting product requirements to essential characteristics and performance data can simplify the substitution review process and allow broader competition manufacturers seeking substitution approval need only to meet or exceed the minimum specified requirements thus if “or equal” is required then it would be advisable that division 01 define the term as a comparable product that meets or exceeds specified requirements procurement documents if substitutions are permitted during the procurement of a construction project the procurement documents 2 should establish the requirements in the “instructions to bidders” or similar document aia document a7011997 instructions to bidders provides basic requirements for submitting substitutions in section 33 aia document a701 essentially allows substitution requests to be submitted up to ten days before the date established for the receipt of bids any approved substitutions are to be issued in an addendum since the latest an addendum can be issued is four days prior to date of receipt of bids aia document a701 section 343 the length of time that the architect and its consultants have to review substitution requests is six days—this does not allow much time for review therefore some ground rules should be established in the procurement documents to make sure the architect and its consultants have the data and time to make intelligent decisions when reviewing substitution requests for design professionals making an intelligent decision is vital since the approval of a substitution carries the same liability as if the design professional directly specified the substituted product in the original documents if aia document a701 is not used then the document used to instruct bidders on the bidding process needs to include the provisions in the following paragraphs plus the provisions similarly covered in the aia document if aia document a701 is used then the following provisions need to be included as supplementary instructions or annotated revisions to electronic documents one provision that should be in the procurement documents is the format in which substitution requests must be submitted it should not be the design professional’s responsibility to research a proposed substitution to determine its acceptability the burden of proof lies with the submitter to standardize the submission format a form such as the construction specifications institute’s csi form 15c substitution request during the biddingnegotiation stage may be used the submitter should also provide sufficient documentation such as product data drawings test results or performance data to substantiate the substitution’s compliance with specified requirements other provisions should include the specific date time and location for submitting substitution requests and possibly who is authorized to submit a substitution request regarding the latter some jurisdictions and ae firms will only allow substitutions to be submitted by a prime bidder—not from a subbidder or a manufacturer the benefit of this requirement is that it helps to filter out those products that a prime bidder has no interest in using thereby eliminating unnecessary review time contract documents to comply with competition requirements in public procurement regulations allowance of substitution submissions is only necessary during the procurement phase once a contract is executed substitutions may or may not be allowed according to the contract documents aia document a701 states in section 334 that “no substitutions will be considered after the contract award unless specifically provided for in the contract documents” therefore if substitutions will be permitted after contract award the specifications need to establish substitution procedures since the procurement requirements are not a part of the contract documents requirements for substitutions may be specified in section 01 25 00 “substitution procedures” included in those requirements should be the conditions upon which a substitution request may be permitted these conditions can be divided into two main categories substitutions for cause and substitutions for convenience“cause” refers to conditions that are beyond the contractor’s control these may include situations where the specified product is no longer manufactured is unsuitable for the intended use or is unavailable due to circumstances unforeseen by the contractor such as a labor strike or a natural disaster or event that delays production thereby affecting the project schedule the contractor’s failure to obtain in a timely manner the specified product  eg a contractorcaused submittal delay contractor did not take into consideration for longlead time etc is not considered a justifiable substitution request for cause“convenience” refers to conditions that benefit the contractor the owner or both if permitted the contractor may submit a substitution request if there is a significant advantage such as lower cost in labor material or both quicker delivery time or other benefit to the owner unless shared savings is a part of the contract any cost savings should go to the owner owners may also initiate a substitution for a number of reasons when requested by the owner the design professional should prepare a request for proposal and issue it to the contractor for determination of cost and schedule impacts design professionals should also review proposed ownerinitiated substitutions for possible impacts on the performance of the building such as compatibility with other specified products and systems if the design professional determines there is a cause for concern then it should be brought to the owner’s attention if whether for cause convenience or initiated by the owner a substitution request is a change to the contract documents and should be treated as such aia document a2012007 general conditions of the contract for construction requires that substitutions be made through a change order or construction change directive unless the substitution qualifies as a minor change a minor change applies when there is no change in contract cost or time and the substitution is consistent with the intent of the contract documents as to the latter if the substitution is a completely different type of material or product it may be considered inconsistent with the intent of the contract documents thereby requiring the use of a change order even if there is no change in contract cost or time if the substitution qualifies as a minor change and was not initiated by the owner it is recommended that the owner be informed of any proposed substitutions as with procurement documents the requirements for submitting substitution requests should also address time and format for submission substitutions for cause should be allowed at any time during the construction period however substitutions for convenience should be limited to the initial weeks of the project whether this period begins following the award of the contract after the notice to proceed or after the start of construction is up to the owner and design team the format should be similar to that for substitutions during the procurement stage for the construction phase csi has form 131a substitution request after the biddingnegotiation phase which is available for use the design professional’s review as previously mentioned when the design professional approves a substitution it carries the same liability as if it was specified in the construction documents therefore design professionals need to treat substitutions with the same care and attention they gave the products they specified in the construction documents csi’s construction contract administration practice guide identifies six areas in which the substitution request should be reviewed these areas and some of the questions that should be asked are as follows product does the substitution’s characteristics meet or exceed the minimum specified requirements manufacturer how long have they been in business how do they respond to problems what is their delivery track record product representative is the person knowledgeable about the product and does she or he respond quickly to questions and problems installationinstaller are there unique installation requirements are installers available in the area does the substitution require a certified installer operation and maintenance costs will the product cost more to maintain than the specified product warranty does the warranty for the substitution provide protection similar to that of the specified product during bidding if aia document a701 is used on a project the last sentence of section 332 states “the architects decision of approval or disapproval of a proposed substitution shall be final” thus if a substitution request is not approved then bidders must base their bids on the specified product or products during construction approval is based on the issuance of a change order change directive or minor change as previously mentioned if a substitution is not approved by the architect using one of these methods then the contractor must use the specified product or products substitutions need not have the negative image that they typically carry if all parties understand and comply with the requirements the substitution process will go smoothly contractors subcontractors suppliers and manufacturers should not submit substitutions solely on the hope of increasing a profit margin but to provide equal or better performance than the specified product design professionals should review substitutions with impartiality but with their liability in mind and should use the same impartiality when informing and advising the owner of any substitution requests finally owners should not be swayed by a quick sales job and a promise of reduced cost to approve a substitution request—careful analysis should always be applied1 “prior approval a specification system” h maynard blumer the construction specifier pp 8084 april 19862 although commonly referred to as “bidding documents” this article uses the csi term “procurement documents” since not all construction documents are bid due to the variety of available project delivery methods however this article uses the terms “bid” and “bidder” regardless if the entity is submitting a bid or proposal posted at 1105 am in construction
