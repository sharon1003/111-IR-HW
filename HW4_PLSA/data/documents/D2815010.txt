how long does it take to brew your own beer this entry was posted on june 30 2010 by quality wine  ale supply for the beer lover who’s really serious about their suds there are few things more exciting than getting into the hobby of home brewing one of the questions every beginning and would be home brewer wants the answer to when they first pick up a beer brewing kit is this how long is it going to take to go from getting your ingredients prepared to finally uncapping a bottle of your first home brewed beer it’s hard not to look forward to opening that first bottle of your own homemade beer but of course it’s not quite as simple as all that while it is indeed easy to make your own beer using the kits available at your local home brew and wine making shop there is of course some patience required as in you’ll probably end up paying for some beer from your local liquor store before your home brew is ready to drink like anything truly great though your first batch of homemade beer is one of those things that is well worth waiting for from brewing to drinking the time it takes for your beer to go from raw materials to finished ready to drink beer depends on a number of different factors generally the process takes between four and eight weeks one to two months four weeks is pretty much the least amount of time you’ll have to wait the actual process of preparing the ingredients takes only a few hours but your beertobe will need to ferment in your beer brewing kit for at least two weeks or longer depending on the type of beer you’re brewing followed by two weeks of bottle conditioning after you’ve bottled your home brew the temperature and the quality of the yeast you’re using to prepare your home brew will also have an impact on the amount of time your beer will take to ferment while you shouldn’t have to worry about the integrity of your ingredients when you use a beer brewing kit and ready to use packaged ingredients it’s important to remember that brewing is both an art and a science your beer will be ready when it’s ready and no sooner –patience is all part of being a home brewer once you’ve bottled your first batch you can always start on the next one so that you’re always stocked with a supply of great tasting home brewed beer this will make waiting for the next batch to be finished a little easier to bear first things first sanitize your equipment there is one very important thing you need to do first – even assuming that you have an all in one kit which includes all of the beer brewing ingredients you need to get your first brew going before you do anything else you need to thoroughly wash and sanitize all of your brewing equipment it may be brand new but even the smallest amount of contamination can mean ruined beer – and that’s the last thing you want to happen with your very first foray into the exciting world of home brewing beer fermentation after preparing your ingredients for brewing which will only take an hour or two it goes into your fermentation vessel where it will be very active for the next couple of days followed by another ten days or so of slower fermentation total fermentation time is about two weeks so factor this into the total wait after your beer has completed its first fermentation you’ll need to bottle your brew after adding priming sugar or if you want to save a little time and trouble carbonation tablets once the bottles are capped you’ll need to store them somewhere dark at room temperature for at least two weeks and perhaps as long as a month for bottle conditioning during this time a small amount of secondary fermentation occurs as the remaining yeast in your brew converts the sugars from your priming sugar into carbon dioxide if you don’t wait long enough during this step you could end up with flat beer ales vs lagers different styles of beer may take slightly more or less time to ferment and do better with longer or shorter periods of bottle conditioning for instance ales generally do not take more than two weeks to be ready to drink after leaving your beer brewing kit for bottles lagers do best with four to six weeks of conditioning after being bottled if you simply can’t wait it’s ok to try them after two weeks but many beers do benefit from a longer conditioning admittedly home brewing does include a lot of waiting but once you take your first sip you’ll agree that it was worth it once you taste your handiwork you’ll no doubt want to start on your next batch right away so that you’ll never be without fresh home brewed beer ever again if you want to stay on top of quality wine  ale supplys newest content then this entry was posted in beer brewing information and tagged beer brewing on june 30 2010 by quality wine  ale supply ← previous post next post →leave a reply sorry you must be logged in to post a comment login
