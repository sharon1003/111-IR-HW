edible wild mushroomsby filip tkaczyk do you want to learn how to find and identify edible wild mushrooms learning about edible mushrooms can seem like an overwhelming process but dont get discouraged lets take it a step at a time for starters it can help if you read our article that introduces the process of how to identify mushrooms which can be found here identifying wild mushrooms introductions to some common edible wild mushrooms as mentioned before there is a great diversity of mushroom species given limited space and time we will only cover some of the most common and best to know here in this article for starters mushrooms are the reproductive bodies or fruits a fungus the main body of the fungus is in the form of white threadlike structures called mycelium the structures of a typical gilled mushroom consist of a cap gills and a stalk the gills are the reproductive portions of the mushroom and the produce the spores spores are reproductive units in the form of single cells boletus one of the most common and wellknown groups of edible wild mushrooms are the boletes or boletus species  boletaceae  these mushrooms have fleshy caps and central stalk and the reproductive parts underneath the cap are made of tubes these tubes open up into pores at the bottom many species in this group are edible with only a handful being poisonous the poisonous boletus species have red or deep orange pores outside of the few toxic species some species of boletus are bitter or inedible one method for testing the edibility of a boletus species is the taste test you can break off a tiny piece of the cap and putting it in your mouth it is still strongly recommend that you identify all boletus mushrooms as close to the exact species as possible before trying them this technique is not recommend for testing the edibility of any other group of species species king boletus porcini cep  boletus eduliscap a mediumtolarge sized cap with a tan brown or brownishred top pores are whitish in younger specimens and mature to yellowolive stalk thick often bulbous near the ground and tapering towards the underside of the cap stalk surface finely netted at least near the top location often grows with firs spruces and pines also oaks and birches in some locations when early fall at lower elevations summer in high elevations occasional springtime growth ediblity one of the best nutty and mild fresh should not taste bitter or chalky comments can grow to several pounds in weight can be stored sliced and dried for a years species smiths boletus  boletus smithiicap a medium sized cap with a brownishred to reddish top pores bright yellow stalk thick generally fatter at base tapering at least slightly underneath cap stalk pink or pinkishyellow might show some erratic bluing when cut location found in mixed woodsconiferous forests often at middle to high elevations when fruits in the fall ediblity good taste mild raw comments several similar looking species some bitter and inedible also dries and stores well as do many edible wild mushrooms belonging to the boletus group species zellers boletus  boletus zellericap smalltomedium cap with a brown to blackish gray top pores pale yellowish can bruise bluish stalk short thick yellow background color with a reddish color over it often yellow at base location often found with douglas firs and redwoods when early fall to early winter edibility good better after drying taste is mild raw comments these edible wild mushrooms can grow in extensive groups where you see one there are often many hidden out of sight nearby species cracked cap boletus redcracked boletus  boletus chrysenteroncap smalltomedium cap with a tan to darkbrown often cracks at maturity exposing pale pinkish flesh stalk relatively narrow to medium thickness with a yellowish base color and reddish color over it often with reddish base sometimes bleached to yellow overall location coniferous and mixed woods wide spread often in groups when early fall to early winter ediblity good better after drying has a acidic earthy taste raw comments one of the most numerous boletus species in many locations unfortunately they are also one of the quickest to be infected and consumed by a white mold if they look moldy do not collect them chanterelles another group of edible wild mushrooms are the chanterelles  cantharellaceae  this group is familiar to many and is now available in many grocery stores this group has fairly thick blunt and often forking gills that run down the stalk the caps are often wavy and concave or even trumpetshaped species chanterelle yellow chanterelle golden chanterelle  cantharellus cibariuscap smalltomedium cap yellow to goldenyellow center often concave edges of cap wavy andor upturned the gills are blunt ridgelike growing down the stalk the gills fork like lightning bolts towards the edge of the cap gills have interconnecting veins stalk tapers to a narrow base thickest where it joins the cap paler than cap location found under a variety of conifer and hardwood trees often on relatively open forest floors when fall to early springtime may show up in late summer in areas of high consistent moisture edibility good to great smell is faintly fruity sometimes peachlike taste mild raw comments grows often in groups or even fairy rings sometimes extended over many meters similar looking white chanterelle  cantharellus subalbidus is paler often whitish and can grow much larger also tends to be found in fewer numbers species yellow foot funnel chanterelle winter chanterelle  cantharellus tubaeformiscap small cap with yellowish tan to brownish top gills are blunt form raised ridges like previous species and fork into lightning bolt like pattern towards edge of cap stalk often slender yellowish hollow at maturity and often when young as well location on the ground often on rotting wood andor moss in moist coniferous forests when late fall to winter edibility good best after more extended cooking can be dried but often more chewy afterwards comments often in clusters or large groups maybe be very numerous with hundreds in one location inky caps another group of mushrooms that is unique and worth identifying and collecting are members of the inky cap family  coprinaceae  specifically the one were most interested in here is the shaggy mane species shag shaggy mane lawyers wig  coprinus comatuscap tall columnlike attached to stalk at top and hangs down like skirt white with brownish shinglelike scales gills underneath cap bladelike and numerous stalk straight hollow long and whitish location surprisingly most common in suburban and urban areas when early spring fall and onto early winter prefers cool wet weather edibility very good delicate easily perishable mush be eaten same day or can be pickled comments despite its apparent fragility often pushed through asphalt do not pick those growing near busy roads as they are often contaminated with car exhaust puffballs puffballs  lycoperdales are odd at times otherworldly fungi which include in their ranks many edible wild mushrooms they produce spores inside round or oblong sacs many of them lack a stalk some have a sterile base and a few have a long stem as they mature puffballs interior turns brown and fills with spores then they become dry and powdery and a small hole forms through which wind or rain puff out the spores species gemmed puffball common puffball  lycoperdon perlatumcap shaped like a globe and colored whitish to pale tan covered in minute and densely packed spines spines soft to touch and brush off easily leave behind round scars stalk thick and short same color as cap also covered in spines but often more sparsely location on the ground widespread in many habitats especially along trails and woodland edges when fall and winter edibility edible and good texture similar to tofu can only be eaten when pure white inside comments sometimes growing alone or can be in tight groupings it is very important to cut these edible wild mushrooms in half and check that they are pure white inside if you wish to consume them if any yellow or brown is visible inside discard them species pearshaped puffball  lycoperdon pyriformecap shaped just like the previous species only smooth to a few spines color is yellowish to brown stalk same as previous species location on rotting wood stumps logs sawdust and woodrich soils widespread when fall and winter edibility edible and with nice texture only eat when pure white inside comments common and can be found in tight groups or singly lobster mushrooms the last species of edible wild mushroom we will look at here is probably also the strangest this group might be called the body snatchers mushrooms members of this group the hypomyces take over the fruiting bodies of other fungi and transform them into something completely different they reproduce by turning other mushrooms into reproductive organs for their own needs through this process they also turn inedible wild mushrooms into edible wild mushroomsspecies lobster mushroom  hypomyces lactifluorum  cap grows on and engulfs gilled mushrooms this species grows mainly on members of the russula and lactarius groups brilliant orange gills of host reduced to folds reproductive parts are tiny little red dots stalk whole fungus tends to transform its host into an upside down coneshape location in moist woods common in some places rare in others often just sticking out of the forest debris despite bright color may be hard to spot initially when fall edibility edible and tasty has a strong odor of seafood and also a seafood taste comments though this species is generally a parasite on the shortstemmed russula  russula brevipes  it may use other species as hosts occasional allergic reactions have been reported as with any mushroom species try it cautiously the first time edibility of wild mushrooms edible wild mushrooms should be approached with respect and with the same cautious you would show whenever you try a new food source edible wild mushrooms are a culinary treasure however they need to be approached carefully some species are deadly poisonous it is very important that you accurately identify a wild mushroom before consuming it by crossreferencing several field guides or more preferably working with someone with experience everybody is different and everybodys response to different foods is different it is the same for eating edible wild mushrooms try each new species cautiously at first also even if you are experience with certain species and wish to consume a vast quantity it may not be a good idea some people have experienced uncomfortable symptoms from overindulging when eating mushrooms this is in no way meant to discourage your enjoy and exploration of edible wild mushrooms there are many wonderful colors flavors and textures to be experienced among the mushrooms not to mention the process of finding them in the outdoors can be very exciting and rewarding in and of itself additional resources common edible mushrooms  epicurious to learn more check out our wild mushroom identification class special
