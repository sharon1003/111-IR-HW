natural resources  wildlife the port of san diego is actively involved with protecting san diego bays natural resources some of these resources include salt marsh and tidal flats bird nesting and foraging sites essential fish habitats such as eelgrass beds and nine federal and state listed endangered or threatened species our participation involves the promotion of ecologically minded development decisions furthering public awareness the management of sensitive habitats and invasive species and support of related scientific research print natural resources management plan in 2007 the port and the u s navy embarked on updating the 2002 integrated natural resources management plan the management plan was revised and edited by a technical advisory committed the committee consisted of different agencies and nongovernmental organizations including the regional water quality control board fish and wildlife services national marine fisheries service army corps of engineers u s national park service fish and game audubon society state lands commission and california coastal commission the management plan was recently updated and the final document is available here september 2013  final integrated natural resources management plan  1598 mbin september of 2000 the port and the us navy southwest division prepared a natural resource management plan for san diego bay the plan is a guide to assist the users of the bay to make better more costeffective decisions about the development conservation restoration and management of san diego bay the management plan also catalogues the plant and animal species around the bay and identifies habitat types the plan was awarded the 2001 partnership award by coastal america and an updated version of the plan is in development continue reading tweet print invasive species the invasion of nonnative or invasive species poses a serious threat to san diego bays ecosystem invasive species are those that evolved elsewhere and whose introduction has or is likely to cause harm to the environment the economy or human health invasive species have arrived in san diego bay from all over the world by intentional and accidental means they are transported in the ballast water of international ships arrive attached to boat hulls introduced intentionally for fishery or mariculture released as unwanted organisms by aquarists or spread naturally through dispersal the first introduction of invasive marine species into san diego bay may have come from the ships used by the early spanish explorers some invasive species have been in their current ecosystem for so long that they were assumed to be natives until recent genetic analyses proved otherwise invasive organisms can significantly change the structure and function of an ecosystem once introduced they often grow and spread rapidly because they lack local predators and usually affect native species by competing for food and habitat space according to a 1999 study the following invasive species are present in san diego bay one species of marine algae one marine protozoan 47 marine invertebrates and five marine fish there are also 28 species of invasive coastal plants in total at least 82 nonnative species are found in the bay this number is not as alarming when compared san francisco bay which is often thought of as the most invaded ecosystem in the world with at least 234 nonnatives and a new species arriving every 12 weeks for a complete listing of the invasive species found in and around san diego bay please see table 226 of the san diego bay integrated natural resources management plan caulerpa taxifolia although not yet found in the san diego bay caulerpa taxifolia has a devastating potential the marine seaweed caulerpa taxifolia also known as killer algae poses no threat to human health but it could have devastating ecological and economic consequences for california if it is allowed to become permanently established this nonnative seaweed threatens californias coastal marine life by overgrowing and eliminating native seaweeds seagrasses reefs and other communities an overgrowth of this species in the mediterranean is reported to have harmed tourism devastated recreational diving and had a costly impact on commercial fishing by altering the distribution of fish and inhibiting the establishment of juveniles historically this species has been used as a popular aquarium plant in peoples homes and biologists believe that the mediterranean outbreak may have been the result of irresponsible aquarium cleaning practices caulerpa taxifolia has a brilliant almost fluorescent green color and grows in the form of flat leafy fernlike fronds that extend upward from each main stem each stem can grow to nine feet in length and have up to 200 fronds this algae can be found as individual plants or in dense blankets that may cover many acres do not be deceived by its attractive appearance if youre an aquarium enthusist here are some tips for preventing a caulerpa taxifolia invasion if you see this seaweed for sale for your aquarium in a pet store do not use itdo not release any water plants or animals from a saltwater aquarium into a street storm drain creek bay lagoon or the ocean tweet print natural resources surveys show port progress the port and u s navy have been working cooperatively to fund studies of the natural resources of san diego bay in 2014 a baywide eelgrass survey  1487 mb and a baywide fish survey were completed during 2009 vantuna research group completed a baywide fisheries inventory and utilization survey and in 2012 vantuna research group completed a new baywide fisheries inventory and utilitzation survey a followup fisheries inventory and utilization study was completed in 2016 to determine what if any impacts there were as a result of el nino in 200607 the first baywide avian species survey was conducted a second baywide avian species survey was completed in december 2010 a new 12month baywide avian species survey began in july 2016 and the final report will be available third quarter 2017 tweet print endangered eastern pacific green sea turtles the eastern pacific green sea turtle is a resident of the san diego bay the sea turtles migrate from nesting sites in mexico in order to forage in the eelgrass beds in the bay a small group of 30 to 60 sea turtles are estimated to reside generally in south san diego bay years of intensive poaching and harvesting of the turtle have attributed to the sharp decline in the population san diego bay provides a protected foraging habitat for the sea turtles and offers a prime study area for researchers continue reading tweet print california least tern updates and photos the ports endangered species management program provides enhanced nesting and foraging opportunities for the federally listed endangered california least tern clt this ongoing program includes the implementation of controlling access to nesting sites site preparation and vegetation control predator control ant predator control public information programs and monitoring programs nesting sites on port tidelands include the d street fill chula vista wildlife reserve and the south bay salt works the san diego county regional airport authority manages san diego international airport and the chula vista wildlife reserve port clt report 2015 final  254 mbport clt report 2014 final2013 california least tern update2012 california least tern draft final report2012 california least tern final update2012 california

of least tern chicks were taken at the san diego international airport by mayela padilla the hands belong to robert patton a biologist employed by the zoological society of san diego he is the only one allowed to handle the chicks in its role as environmental steward of the tidelands around san diego bay and a swath of oceanfront in imperial beach the port oversees a number of species and wildlife preservation programs one of the most successful programs is the protection of the endangered california least tern  sterna antillarum browni  historically the nesting site at the port’s wildlife reserve areas in chula vista has had one of the highest percentages of surviving fledglings in san diego county“we attribute the higher productivity to the enhanced habitat quality on the east side of san diego bay” said robert patton consulting biologist with the san diego zoological society the port has contracted with the zoological society since 1997 to monitor and provide protection for the endangered california least tern around april every year the birds arrive at their ancestral nesting areas in southern california which includes the port’s wildlife reserve areas in chula vista favored tidelands nesting sites for these migrating birds include the chula vista wildlife reserve and the sweetwater marsh national wildlife refuge nests are small depressions scraped in the beach sand the females lay one to three wellcamouflaged eggs robert patton and his team of biologists visit these nesting sites twice a week to count eggs and band hatched chicks newborn chicks fledge quickly and are able to fly in a few weeks to boost the survival rates of the vulnerable chicks until they fledge staff from wildlife services and uc riverside keep a close eye on predators in the area many environmental projects that have been funded by the port such as restoration of eelgrass and storm water runoff controls have boosted the survival rate of the young terns by providing cleaner bay water and abundant fish species for feeding the chicks“the least tern nest numbers and pair numbers have generally increased on port tidelands over the years” said patton “we consider the port’s least tern program a success”tweet print birds of san diego bay welcome to bird watching pdfbirding hot spots of san diego pdfbird watching quick tips pdffull birding hot spots brochure
