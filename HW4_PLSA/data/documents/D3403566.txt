javadian alireza master of engineering teng susanto associate prof tan teng hooi associate prof nanyang technological university singapore abstract the effect of temperature on the flexural tensile strength of plain and fibre reinforced concrete is reported tensile strength of concrete is one of the primary factors affecting the vulnerability to spalling but information on tensile strength at elevated temperature is limited owing to the difficulty in performing the test this paper describes a study on tensile strength of high strength concrete with or without steel fibres at elevated temperatures using prisms made from concrete with compressive strength of 50 mpa and 100 mpa to ensure uniform temperature the specimens were heated first in an electric furnace for a sufficient period to reach an equilibrium state the test temperatures were 300 o c 450 o c and 650 o c the residual strengths of the specimens upon cooling to room temperature were also determined it was found that the “hot” test results and the “residual” ones were not the same this is unlike what has been assumed by many researchers keywords flexural strength hot test residual test 1 introduction concrete material is very commonly used in building construction all over the world however structural performance of concrete deteriorates at elevated temperatures elevated temperatures can exist in various forms from extreme heat in a nuclear reactor to industrial fire generally concrete structures have very good behaviour during fire when compared to structures made of other materials however severe fire with heavy fire loads and specific environmental conditions can lead to critical destruction of concrete structures structural elements should remain stable for a period to allow the occupants to evacuate and to allow the fire fighters to fight the fire safely and to carry out rescues effectively if the building is well designed fire damage will be small and the cost of repair will be reduced one of the main damages due to rapid heating of concrete during fire and subsequent cooling by water is spalling spalling of concrete is a phenomenon whereby pieces of concrete break off from the surface of a concrete element there are many concerns with the integrity of reinforced concrete elements as a result of spalling in addition to spalling phenomenon there is a flagrant loss in mechanical properties of concrete at high temperature and upon cooling compressive strength tensile strength and modulus of elasticity are the main mechanical properties of concrete which are of high interests during and after fire tensile strength of concrete seems to have an important roll in spalling behaviour of concrete the effects of high temperature on the mechanical properties of concrete have been investigated by many researchers 16 unfortunately there is not a distinct method to verify flexural strength 1160 the 3rd acf international conference acfvca 2008 of concrete at high temperatures owing to the difficulty in perform tensile test at high temperature many works have been done on measuring residual tensile strength of concrete rather than “hot” tensile strength of concrete 711 however a study by sullivan and poucher mentioned that there was no significant difference in the flexural strength between those tested in hot state and those specimens tested after cooling 12 adding steel fibre increases the tensile strength of concrete and it has been proposed as a way to mitigate the spalling of concrete at elevated temperature but there is limited data to understand the mechanism in this study an experimental program was undertaken to investigate the flexural strength of normal and high strength concrete at hot state and upon cooling steel fibres of 02 were also added to determine their effects 2 experimental programme 21 sample preparation to find out the effect of high temperatures on tensile properties of heated concrete four sets of mixtures have been produced the mix proportions are shown in table 1 table 1 mix proportions nsc1 nsc2 hsc1 hsc2 3 cement kgm  450 450 540 540 3 sand kgm  625 625 820 820 silica fume   60 60 kgm3 aggregate 940

primatic specimens a slump test was done to determine the concrete workability and the mean slump of the freshly mixed concrete was found to be more than 220 mm all normal strength nsc specimens were water cured for 7 days and then airdried until the time of test the high strength hsc specimens were water cured for a longer time of 28 days cubes of 100x100 mm were tested at 28 days and the average compressive strengths were 50mpa and 100 mpa for nsc and hsc respectively 22 properties of steel fibres the steel fibres had enlarged end anchorage which can provide an efficient mechanical bond and optimum interlock between the fibres and concrete the properties are shown in table 2 1161 the 3rd acf international conference acfvca 2008 table 2 properties of steel fibres tensile elastic diameter

controlled heating is required before the specimen reaches the thermal equilibrium the duration of the heating is dependent on the rate of heating thermal conductivity specific heat capacity and size of specimen specimens with thermal gradient during testing would make quantification of thermal effects on material behaviour difficult hence thermal equilibrium was considered throughout the study since our main purpose is to evaluate flexural strength of concrete at high temperatures the specimens must be heated uniformly it means that we need to heat them in such a way that ensures us the inside and outside equilibrium for the entire heated specimen for our purpose the heating rate was selected as low as 25 οc  min  in addition to reach a state of equilibrium the holding period for each target temperature was selected around 1 hour the target test temperatures are 30 οc  300 οc  450 οc and 650 οc  in addition to prevent explosive spalling all the specimens were first dried at 105 οc in order to decrease moisture content of the concrete 3 24 furnace design all specimens were first heated in the nabertherm electric furnace after reaching thermal equilibrium each specimen was transferred to another furnace at the flexural test equipment to maintain the temperature of the specimen during loading the second furnace was specially designed to maintain the temperature in the middle onethird of the specimen during the test the purposedmade furnace is illustrated in fig 1 fig 1 chamber furnace sketch 25 test procedure the test was performed in accordance with astm c7807 standard test method for flexural strength of concrete using simple beam with thirdpoint loading specimens of 100 mm ×100 mm×500 mm were used and the span length was 300 mm the specimens were first heated in a furnace after reaching the uniform target temperature each specimen was immediately 1162 the 3rd acf international conference acfvca 2008 transferred to the other furnace for the load test purposed made devices were used to ensure a speedy transfer and setting up the test setup and the furnace is shown in fig 2 fig 2 end view of specimen showing the furnace under the actuator 3 results

between the results obtained from hot tests and residual tests is shown in fig 7 to 10 many works have been done on measuring “residual” tensile strength of concrete rather than “hot” tensile strength of concrete 911 13 the tensile strengths of concrete at heated and residual state were assumed the same from experimental investigations on the heated and residual compressive strength of concrete researchers generally observed that the cracks formed during cooling lowers the residual compressive strength hence they deduced that the residual tensile strength of concrete is lower than hot tensile strength however from the results obtained in this research it is obvious that the flexural strength of concrete during residual test is slightly 1164 the 3rd acf international conference acfvca 2008 different from the hot one therefore it is not reasonable to assume the same result for hot and residual flexural strength of concrete for all nscs residual strength is slightly higher than hot strength the first columns in following figures show the room temperature result for better comparison at room temperature two columns were depicted to show hot and residual test which have the same height the decrease in flexural strength is considerable when temperature increases from room temperature to 300 o c the difference between residual and hot strength decreased as the temperature increases in addition the difference between results of nsc with and without steel fibres during hot test is negligible nevertheless residual results seem to differ slightly this fact can be relegated to behaviour of steel fibres which are able to resist the load after cooling down the trends for nsc1 and also nsc2 during residual and hot test proximately follow the same trends the trend for residual test is more linear compares to the hot test trend 6 nsc1hot 5 modulus of rupture mpa nsc1residual 4 3 2 1 0 28 300 450 650 temperature c fig 7 comparison the hot and residual

c hot strength is lower than residual strength nevertheless at 650o c for both hscs residual strength is slightly lower than hot strength this phenomenon was not appeared in nscs at this temperature also by comparison the trends of hscs during residual test with nscs it is found that sharp decrease in flexural strength happens at 450oc for hscs compare to 300o c for nscs also unlike the tends for residual strength of nscs which are more prone to be linear the trends for hscs are more prone to be nonlinear 1165 the 3rd acf international conference acfvca 2008 although the flexural strength for all hscs is higher than nscs but the difference between residual and hot strength for hscs is more considerable than nscs both residual and hot flexural strength of hsc2 with steel fibres are higher than hsc1 without fibres 8 hsc1hot 7 modulus of rupture mpa hsc1residual 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 28 300 450 650 temperature c fig 9 comparison the hot and residual flexural strength for hsc1 10 9 hsc2hot

by measuring hot flexural strength of concrete the following conclusions can be drawn 1 experimental tests on flexural strength of normal strength concrete has shown that the hot test result and residual tests results up to 650 o c will differ and should not be taken to be the same especially in heat and mass transfer programs to investigate the spalling behaviour of high strength concrete 2 it is found that the flexural strength at high temperatures under hot test is lower than residual test this resolution indicates the importance of hot test to evaluate the mechanical properties of concrete under fire or elevated temperatures 3 the mixture with steel fibres shows higher flexural strength than the mixture without any fibres at high temperatures the differences between the results are not significant this may be due to the fact that steel will be soft at high temperatures so the effect of steel on flexural strength and prevention of crack opening is not significant 1166 the 3rd
