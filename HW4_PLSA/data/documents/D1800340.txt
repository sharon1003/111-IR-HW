the bus is not handy to the terminal and you cant take a bunch of luggage on it from the terminal to hnl another 25  30 for a cab bus is not an option with luggage  and isnt handy anyway ncl may have transfer service to hnl but i bet it is more expensive than a cab  as ncl would charge you per person report inappropriate content569vergara sydney australia level contributor16 posts save reply3 re

at the time they had less complaints on the net about the service they provided i booked by phone for a shuttle prior to arriving for a shuttle from airport to ilikai and then from ilikai a few days later to the port it was 1500 per person total for the 2 shuttles they did it as a combo deal they met us at the baggage claim area with our name on a large sign we did not have to look for them with all the people around the fellow also had a luggage cart and was waiting to retrieve our luggage it was excellent service upon departure of the cruise ship we left carring our own luggage around 725 am and we were off the ship in minutes no long waits for the one elevator and we took a shuttle from the departure point when you exit there will be alot of shuttle vans and taxis just waiting to fill their vehicle and leave for the airport the cost of taxi last year was 3000 and we only paid 800 each for the shuttle to the airport it took about 20 minutes to reach airport as there was very little traffic at 730 on the saturday moning report inappropriate content110 of 12 replies sorted by « 1 2 »browse forums all oahu forums honolulu forum watch this topic honolulu forums get answers to your
