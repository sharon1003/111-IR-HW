biological psychological or social systems sarafino 2012 there are many ways of coping with stress their effectiveness depends on the type of stressor the particular individual and the circumstances for example if you think about the way your friends deal with stressors like exams you will see a range of different coping responses some people will pace around or tell you how worried they are others will revise or pester their teachers for clues lazarus and folkman 1984 suggested there are two types of coping responses emotion focused and problem focused emotionfocused coping emotionfocused coping involves trying to reduce the negative emotional responses associated with stress such as embarrassment fear anxiety depression excitement and frustration this may be the only realistic option when the source of stress is outside the person’s control drug therapy can be seen as emotion focused coping as it focuses on the arousal caused by stress not the problem other emotion focused coping techniques include distraction eg keeping yourself busy to take your mind off the issue emotional disclosure this involves expressing strong emotions by talking or writing about negative events which precipitated those emotions pennebaker 1995 this is an important part of psychotherapy  praying for guidance and strength meditation eg mindfulness eating more eg comfort food drinking alcohol using drugs journaling eg writing a gratitude diary cheng tsui  lam 2015 cognitive reappraisal this is a form of cognitive change that involves construing a potentially

of time compromises immune competence and leads to poor physical health petrie k j booth r j  pennebaker 1988 critical evaluation a metaanalysis revealed emotionfocused strategies are often less effective than using problemfocused methods in relation to health outcomes penley tomaka  weibe 2012 in general people who used emotionfocused strategies such as eating drinking and taking drugs reported poorer health outcomes such strategies are ineffective as they ignore the root cause of the stress the type of stressor and wether the impact was on physical or psychological health explained the strategies between coping strategies and health outcomes in addition eppingjordan et al 1994 found that patients with cancer who used avoidance strategies eg denying they were very ill deteriorated more quickly then those who faced up to their problems the same pattern exists in relation to dental health and financial problems emotionfocused coping does not provide a long term solution and may have negative side effects as it delays the person dealing with the problem however they can be a good choice if the source of stress is outside the person’s control eg a dental procedure gender differences have also been reported women tend to use more emotionfocused strategies than men billings  moos 1981 problemfocused coping problemfocused coping targets the causes of stress in practical ways which tackles the problem or stressful situation that is causing stress consequently directly reducing the stress problem focused strategies aim to remove or reduce the cause of the stressor including problemsolving timemanagement obtaining instrumental social support critical evaluation in general problemfocused coping is best as it removes the stressor so deals with the root cause of the problem providing a long term solution problemfocused strategies are successful in dealing with stressors such as discrimination pascoe  richman 2009 hiv infections moskowitz hult bussolari  acree 2009 and diabettes duangdao  roesch 2008 however it is not always possible to use problemfocused strategies for example when someone dies problemfocused strategies may not be very helpful for the bereaved dealing with the feeling of loss requires emotionfocused coping problem focused approached will not work in any situation where it is beyond the individual’s control to remove the source of stress they work best when the person can control the source of stress eg exams work based stressors etc it is not a productive method for all individuals for example not all people are able to take control of a situation or perceived a situation as controllable for example optimistic people who tend to have positive expectations of the future are more likely to use problemfocused strategies whereas pessimistic individual are more inclined to use emotionfocused strategies nes  segerstrom 2006 references billings a g  moos r h 1981 the role of coping responses and social
