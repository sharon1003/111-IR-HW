they cant be seen by the naked eye and you cant feel them as they pass through the body the energy from xrays is absorbed at different rates by different parts of the body a detector on the other side of the body picks up the xrays after theyve passed through and turns them into an image dense parts of your body that xrays find it more difficult to pass through such as bone show up as clear white areas on the image softer parts that xrays can pass through more easily such as your heart and lungs show up as darker areas when xrays are used xrays can be used to examine most areas of the body theyre mainly used to look at the bones and joints although theyre sometimes used to detect problems affecting soft tissue such as internal organs problems that may be detected during an xray

and lung cancerdysphagia swallowing problemsheart problems such as heart failurebreast cancer xrays can also be used to guide doctors or surgeons during certain procedures for example during a

on a table or stand against a flat surface so that the part of your body being examined can be positioned in the right place the xray machine which looks like a tube containing a large light bulb will be carefully aimed at the part of the body being examined by the radiographer they will operate the machine from behind a screen or from the next room the xray will last for a fraction of a second you wont feel anything while its carried out while the xray is being taken youll need to keep still so the image produced isnt blurred more than one xray may be taken from different angles to provide as much information as possible the procedure will usually only take a few minutes contrast xrays in some cases a substance called a contrast agent may be given before an xray is carried out this can help show soft tissues more clearly on the xray types of xrays involving a contrast agent includebarium swallow – a substance called barium is swallowed to help highlight the upper digestive systembarium enema – barium is passed into your bowel through your bottomangiography – iodine is injected into a blood vessel to highlight the heart and blood vesselsintravenous urogram ivu – iodine is injected into a blood vessel to highlight the kidneys and bladder these types of xrays may need special preparation beforehand and will usually take longer to carry out your appointment letter will

and an injection given to relax your stomach before the xray may cause your eyesight to be blurry for a few hours some people develop a rash or feel sick after having an iodine injection the xray

the doctor who requested the xray who can discuss the results with you a few days later are xrays safe people are often concerned about being exposed to radiation during an xray however the part of your body being examined will only be exposed to a low level of radiation for a fraction of a second generally the amount of radiation youre exposed to during an xray is the equivalent to between a few days and a few years of exposure to natural radiation from the environment being exposed to xrays does carry a risk of causing cancer many years or decades later but this risk is thought to be very small for example an xray of your chest limbs or teeth is equivalent to a few days worth of background radiation and has less than a 1 in 1000000 chance of causing cancer for more information see
