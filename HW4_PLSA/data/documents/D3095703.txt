halvorson deputy editor june 28 2016likes sleek hatchback styling wellbalanced ride and handling smooth powertrain great fuel economy excellent cargo space dislikes no hourglass curves inside automatic shortshifts powerband threemode steering just adds heft less rearseat leg room not quite a hot hatch the 2016 hyundai elantra gt gives up some rearseat space in the name of cargo room and european style the hyundai elantra sedan has risen from the hohum ranks to become one of our more wellliked compacts in part due to its grownup styling and improved feature set its handsome economical traits combined with a solid safety record help it outshine stalwarts like the honda civic and toyota corolla in some measures all the while surpassing most of the field when it comes to value the elantra is also offered in fivedoor gt hatchback guise which is covered separately for two model years in this generation hyundai also offered a twodoor elantra but slow sales of that model prompted its end last year in a relatively mild rework to the elantra sedan lineup in 2014 the accomplished styling of the current car received new front and rear end treatments with led fillips around the headlamps on sport and limited sedan models the elantra wears a complex set of curves that collect in a swoop toward the rear end where the boomerang door cuts give the look a shove forward its an energetic exterior backed up with a daring cockpit with an hourglass center console defining the space and doubling as a comfy knee rest review continues below base elantras are lean and efficient with a 18liter inline4 standard rated at 148 horsepower and 131 poundfeet of torque this powertrain is fairly smooth and accelerates respectably through a 6speed automatic or a 6speed manual theres also a 20liter inline4 in the elantra sport with 173 hp and 154 lbft of torque it is also available with either a manual or automatic generally the elantra doesnt feel as energetic or engaging as the best drivers in the class—the mazda 3 for example its powertrains are slow to respond to throttle inputs and the steering could be quicker and more responsive while it has been improved with better oncenter feel its feedback is still not especially natural ride quality is fine however and the elantra soaks up road noise as well as or better than its competitors with sound levels about as low as in some midsize sedans thats an important metric for the elantra since its interior space spills over into midsize territory the elantra is an excellent value on many fronts by its spec sheet its a midsize vehicle and it shows the sedans front seats could use a little more bolstering and lateral support as in the coupe but on either theyre surrounded by ample space in all directions in back the leg room is fine for adults but head room can be tight even for mediumheight passengers the elantras interior has lots of useful cubbies and storage bins including a covered one that sits ahead of the shift lever it also contains the aux jack a power point and the usb port in an easy to reach module perfect for connecting smartphones all elantra sedans are rated at five stars overall by the nhtsa the iihs called it a top safety pick in prior years with an acceptable rating in the new smalloverlap test and good scores in all other categories the elantra sedan lineup now includes the se value edition limited and sport models all elantras come with power windows locks and mirrors keyless entry and on automatic models air conditioning cruise control bluetooth with audio streaming and telescopic steering all versions can stream audio via the pandora app and a usb connection a 43inch touchscreen radio with a rearview camera is now standard on the sport and limited sedans and an option on the se for 2016 hyundai has made several pricefocused packaging changes a new elantra value edition does exactly what the name implies saving buyers a cool grand with packaged content for just 550 more than the price of an elantra se the value edition includes different 16inch alloy wheels a power tiltandslide sunroof leather coverings for the steering wheel and shift knob proximity key with keyless ignition heated front seats chrome beltline molding aluminum sill plates turn signals integrated into the side mirrors and a tiltandtelescope steering wheel the elantra limited now comes with proximity key and dualzone auto climate control as standard which represents a 600 savings and the elantra sport does away with its previously standard leather seats and power sunroof to get a lower starting price elantra sedan fuel economy tops out at 28 mpg city 38 highway 32 combined for the automatic 18liter the leastefficient variant carries a 243428 mpg rating92016 hyundai elantra styling the 2016 hyundai elantra is one of the more captivating designs in its class on the outside although its interior is no longer at the leading edge when it first launched the current hyundai elantra marked a styling sea change for the automaker it took themes established on the the bigger sonata sedan and recrafted them into a flawless compact profile in the process flipping the hyundai compact range out of the design doldrums and into the fashionforward set from front to back its an effort that brims with confidence from almost every angle the elantra sedan looks like its already in motion which tends to be a sign of good car design it is here anyway the rear door cuts are particularly effective cues that seem to pull the shape taut for release like a bow pulled back waiting to release an arrow the whole car looks to have been detailed with an expert eye from the way the marker lights extend over the front wheel centers to the steep cant of the windshield to the crease that runs down the body softening at the cpillar we also admire the rising shoulder line that emerges from smooth sheet metal just inches behind the lipped wheelwells and flows into the taillights theres nothing particularly sporty about the lines as much as they are sophisticated a theme that is not common among youthoriented cars of its size and very much welcomed here theres a lot to like here given the sonatas recent retreat into conservative territory the elantra is now one of hyundais most daring pieces of work right there with the funky veloster hatchback its our hope that the next elantra keeps the distinctive look that helps it stand out from the veritable sea of compact sedans available now the exteriors design triumphs are matched by some great execution in the cabin albeit in a more subdued manner the unfettered swoops of the exterior are toned down in the right way inside the curves are there just pulled in more compelling and cohesive ways the pinch point where the center console meets the rest of the dash is brilliant the hourglass shape isnt just fresh and distinctive its a perfect area for resting knees that usually get a hard ridge and no apologies thats just one cue in a design from a brand thats had few visuals all to itself in the past review continues below72016 hyundai elantra performance acceleration is just adequate for the 2016 elantra and performance overall is capable and confident but not exciting the hyundai elantra is a pleasant vehicle to pilot in traffic but it falls a little short of the performance offered by rivals from volkswagen mazda and ford that said its an aboveaverage effort that drives at least as well as the latest toyota corolla the elantra remains lean and efficient with a 18liter inline4 standard in the base se sedan and in the limited rated at 148 horsepower and 131 poundfeet of torque this powertrains fairly smooth and accelerates respectably through a 6speed automatic or a 6speed manual generally the elantra doesnt feel as energetic or engaging as the ford focus though because its throttle is slow to respond to inputs even so the elantra has a smooth idle and stays calm throughout most of the rev range an achievement that eludes larger fourcylinders and wasnt particularly a hyundai strength in the past in the elantra the fours right at home in the 2500 to 4500rpm range where itll be pretty much whenever youre increasing speed with the responsive 6speed automatic transmission which will be far more popular than the perfectly fine 6speed manual manuals get an eco shift light while automatics have an active eco mode that slows down shifts and throttle to boost fuel economy up to 7 percent to add some luster to the specsheet numbers a sport trim for the sedan comes with a 20liter inline4 shared with the kia forte in the elantra sedan its good for 173 hp and 154 lbft of torque up 23 hp and 25 lbft from the smaller inline4 we still havent been able to drive an elantra fourdoor with the new 4cylinder engine though in the elantra gt hatchback its more notable for extra engine noise than an improvement in acceleration the sport model comes with a round of handling changes that include stiffer shocks and springs and a bigger stabilizer bar the finer inputs are what separates the elantra from those other compacts its steering isnt especially natural in its feedback though the wandering common to first and secondyear elantra sedans has mostly been filtered out ride quality is sporty without feeling overly firm and the elantra comes with standard fourwheel disc brakes and a firm pedal feel—better than the costcut reardrum setup thats now so common in this class for 2015 all elantra sedan models received selectable threemode steering and revised steering feel the modes provide different levels of heft for the wheel but none of them really sharpen up the feedback on this electric rack review continues below82016 hyundai elantra comfort  quality interior finishes are impressive—and in general a bit better than what budgetminded shoppers might expect although the hyundai elantra is marketed as a compact car its interior volume actually puts it in the epas midsize class that can be an important factor to consider for those looking for a roomy compact or even a less expensive alternative to the typical family sedan sizewise in the compact class the elantra is up there with the vw jetta—and a world away from the very tight accommodations youll find in a ford focus or a mazda 3 throughout the interior youll find plastics that are about par for the class—a mix of hard scuffresistant and softtouch surfaces—and there are lots of useful cubbies and storage bins including a covered one that sits ahead of the shift lever it also contains the aux jack a power point and the usb port in an easy to reach module perfect for connecting smartphones the leather thats available on sedans is perforated in a wave pattern and wont be mistaken for luxury hide but it feels supple enough the elantra soaks up road noise better than most small cars in part because of its soft suspension calibration and at 70 mph its not much different than in a 4cylinder midsize sedan the elantras generous proportions are put to good use in the front seats leg room and head room are fine for even large adults we would like to see better support baked into the front buckets though in the form of more bolstering and more bottomcushion support as well as some more length on the bottom cushion for longdistance touring comfort the leaner head room in the back seat is where the elantras compact positioning is most obvious its no worse than with most in the class in this respect—volkswagens jetta is the standout here with its outsized rear accommodations legroom in back is good and its easy to slide into the fourdoors back bench the elantra gets kudos for offering rearseat heaters but it lacks air vents to provide warm air from the cars climate control system in back—common with most vehicles in the class and some larger vehicles like the vw passat the rear seats fold forward easily on either version and that allows longer objects to be loaded into the relatively large wide trunk we like how the two easyrelease pulls are within easy reach the seats dont quite fold flat but theres enough of an opening for fitting gear or tools for a trip across town review continues below82016 hyundai elantra safety the elantra is still missing automaticbraking hardware although its safety scores are mostly good since its introduction for the 2011 model year the current generation of the elantra has been engineered to perform better in crash testing that said some testing requirements were tightened in recent years leading to a slight decrease in the elantras overall standing at this point it is not the top performer in its segment but still turns in respectable ratings the elantra comes with standard stability control antilock brakes with brake assist a new steering effort assist system that helps steer you back toward stability and control in a skid front seatmounted side airbags and front and rear sidecurtain bags a rearview camera system is also available although outward visibility is quite good in the sedan even without it federal safety officials give the elantra sedan five stars overall with a fourstar rating for frontal impacts and rollover resistance and five stars for side impacts in testing over at the iihs the elantra sedan has earned the top safety pick accolade in previous years including top good ratings in all categories of testing—including the new roofstrength test—except for an acceptable rating in the new smalloverlap test review continues below92016 hyundai elantra features the 2016 hyundai elantra limited remains a deal if you must have leather and the works but a new value edition and the basic models are tops for the costconscious thanks to tweaks made for the 2016 model the elantra improves on its already great value with a list of standard features that can make the more expensive models seem unnecessary for 2016 changes include new elantra value edition trim added content for the limited model and a couple of items removed from the sports standard list to bring the price down on the base hyundai elantra se sedan youll find standard cruise control an amfmcd player a usb port bluetooth with streaming audio keyless entry power windows locks and mirrors and on automatic transmission cars air conditioning and telescoping steering next up is a new value edition trim which does exactly what the name implies saving buyers a cool grand with packaged content for just 550 more than the price of an elantra se the value edition includes different 16inch alloy wheels a power tiltandslide sunroof leather coverings for the steering wheel and shift knob proximity key with keyless ignition heated front seats chrome beltline molding aluminum sill plates turn signals integrated into the side mirrors and a tiltandtelescope steering wheel the sport model with its 20liter engine is available with a manual or an automatic for an extra 1000 it is equipped similarly to the value edition package but with slightly more content for 2016 the elantra sport does away with its previously standard leather seats and power sunroof to get a lower starting price on the top trim level the limited the elantra comes with heated front and rear seats trimmed in leather 17inch wheels fog lamps a sunroof and turn signals mounted in the mirrors from that equipment level an optional premium package brings keyless ignition with a proximity key an upgraded audio system and a navigation system for 2016 the limited now comes with proximity key and dualzone auto climate control as standard which represents a 600 savings if youre in need of directions frequently the elantras navigation system has one of the largest lcd touchscreens in the class and its beautiful to look at and to use with voice recognition for phone audio and and destinations plus realtime traffic and weather a rearview camera comes with the navigation system too and it also builds in xm nav traffic nav weather sports and stocks integration 16 gb of memory audio streaming and satellite radio capability and the capability to play jpeg or bmp slideshows from thumb drives to help make the assembly and ordering process simpler the elantra sedan is offered in a limited number of build combinations the downside of this strategy is that there are holes in availability of popular features you cant get the navigation system if you want a manual transmission for instance the telescopic adjustment is optional on manualtransmission cars bundled in as part of a popular equipment package review continues below72016 hyundai elantra fuel economy fuel efficiency isnt one of the strong points for the 2016 elantra—either absolutely or within its class the hyundai elantra sedan posts solid fueleconomy ratings although its not at the head of this constantly evolving class one reason is that it lacks a specific model with aero improvements to reach the 40mpg bogey its competition offers special versions with aerodynamic tweaks even different powertrains to hit the magic marketing number while others are newer and simply more fuel efficient in all trims the 20liter inline4 in the sport returns the worst ratings of all elantras the automatic earns epa ratings of 24 mpg city 35 highway 28 combined while the manual loses just one mpg in the highway test for ratings of 243428 mpg the elantra se sedans 18liter engine is rated at 283832 mpg when teamed with the automatic transmission weve observed close to the combined rating in test drives on the limited model the 18liter inline4 and auto combination fares slightly worse with ratings of 273731 mpg with the manual transmission the elantra with the standard 18liter engine is also rated at 273731 mpg review continues below the car
