method1 preparing to make the cast1 purchase plaster bandages that are approved to use on skin plaster bandages can be purchased from art stores or in large quantities from a hospital supply store 1 plaster bandages are made to be used in body casting 2 unlike traditional plaster of paris powder or similar materials which can be extremely dangerous 3dont assume anything is skin safe check the packaging and read any instructions thoroughly you can buy plaster casting kits that include lubricant and sometimes a drop cloth many are marketed toward pregnant women to cast their bellies but it will work fine for your purposes 4trim the bandages to about 8 inches 200 mm in length so they will be easier to work with 5if the bandages are wide 6 inches or more fold them in half lengthwise youll have an 8x3 inch double layer of bandage to work with 62 set up your workspace youll want a hard surface like a tile floor or sturdy table for your model to stretch out and hold a stable position avoid rooms with carpetingthe plaster will ruin the carpet if there are any spills or drips place a waterproof dropcloth over the area where you will be working if your model is going to be on a table you may want to spread a tarp on the table and the floor beneath this will protect your furniture and make cleanup a snap 7make sure you have access to a shower or bath so the model can rinse off after you have removed the caste 8check the temperature of the room if you can control the heat you will want the room to be very warm so your model doesnt get cold when she disrobes if you dont have access to the temperature controls bring in a space heater to create a suitable environment 9if you use a tarp to cover your workspace look for one with some texture it can become very slippery when wet and may make it difficult for your model to hold her pose 103 help your model feel comfortable she might feel nervous or embarrassed at first so its important to run through the process with her beforehand knowing what to expect may ease her mind and increase her confidence let her know you will halt the process at any time if she begins to feel uncomfortable 11 your models comfort and safety should be your first concern keep things professional but dont be cold you will be spending a lot of time with her and she will be in a vulnerable position so it is essential you develop a good rapport 12have the model try out the pose you want to for the cast she can decide if its a pose she can hold for 30 minutes and you can see if its really the pose you want or if you need to make any adjustments 134 ask the model to undress when shes ready it is very difficult to remove dried plaster from fabric so she may want to disrobe entirely 14 otherwise she may want to wear an old bra or bikini top or an old tshirt she can roll up so it doesnt interfere with the cast but still keeps her chest and shoulders covered and warm if your model is still concerned about getting cold she can wear socks leg warmers or a knit hat too since these areas are nowhere near the area you will be casting your clothes will likely get covered with plaster so make sure youre wearing something you plan to throw out or dont mind ruining
