around the globe josh harris coowner of worldwide trophy adventures with his alaskan moose worldwide trophy adventures isn’t just another booking agency that functions like every other booking agency though i find myself not being able to write or talk about our business without touching on why that is such an important point to make if you didn’t already know wta has hunted and or fished with every single outfitter that we book for that’s right not only have we hunted and fished with them we did so as fullpaying clients i cannot stress enough how important that fact is many of the booking agencies out there are in the business just as we are the only catch is that a lot of them not all of them but a lot of them owe their outfitters something in return for hunts or trips that outfitters have given them when this unfortunate circumstance arises and you happen to be the next client to call that booking agent or agency guess which outfitter just became the best outfitter in the world of course they are going to push the one that they now owe something to that is not the case with us and never will be the wta team has hunted and fished as fullpaying clients with over 250 outfitters of which only the select few made it through our extensive outfitter certification process the remaining outfitters are making improvements to their operations to hopefully become one of our certified wta outfitters outfitters are shocked when we send them the information required to become one of our certified wta outfitters they are used to dealing with a booking agency that will book for them no matter what their operation is like so no matter when you call or contact us we are going to book you with an outfitter that we have been in the field with and would happily return and hunt or fish with again when we do receive your call we will discover your perceived future biggame hunting and or fishing aspirations and then we will recommend guides or outfitters application strategies and or

have personally put “boots on the ground” with as “full paying clients” the normal routine you have to go through in order to find a good hunting or fishing trip is eliminated you don’t have to call endless amounts of references spend hours on the internet make endless calls to potential outfitters or lose any more sleep wondering if you have made the right decision you know when you book a trip with wta that we have already done all of that for you that is a huge advantage to you so in other words we have shed all of the blood sweat and tears necessary and have compiled and are continuously compiling the premium group of outfitters that exists in today’s hunting and fishing world all of our outfitters are now your outfitters and they are only one click of a mouse or phone call away jason campbell coowner of worldwide trophy adventures with his tanzanian lesser kudu i can’t forget to also mention a simple point that a lot of people seem to misunderstand about wta when it comes to booking a hunt or fishing trip with us a lot of people that i converse with every day on the phone ask me… “josh so what if i booked directly with the outfitter would i get a better deal” the answer is no we are not a middle man the trip that you book with us is priced the same whether you book directly with the outfitter or with wta our payment comes from the outfitter and the hunt or trip price will always be the same a lot of outfitters choose not to pay for expensive advertising and travel expenses to shows etc that is where we come in we bring clients to our outfitters and they are always glad to take our calls and book our clients so why would you book with wta well just as i mentioned above we have been there and done that we’ve paid the ultimate price and we have the best of the best when it comes to outfitters in the hunting and fishing world we also offer a lot more than just bookings as well we have a fully functional application service and manager landowner tags members only access thousands of awesome hunting and fishing pictures hours of action packed videos free trip and gear giveaways onthehoof pictures and video tons of hunting and fishing tools and a team of seasoned hunters and fisherman at the helm of the ship now that’s not everything either i would also like to touch on another great reason for using wta something called last minutelast chance opportunitiesevery year it is guaranteed that some people will have to cancel their hunts or trips many things such as job loss divorce physical health and military service are a few of the common reasons why some trips get cancelled most of these trips that are cancelled have already had substantial deposits that have been paid and the results are giant discounts this turns into a last minute – last chance opportunity this is your opportunity to take advantage of someone else’s loss and make it your gain as a member of wta you will have 24 hour access to these opportunities savings
