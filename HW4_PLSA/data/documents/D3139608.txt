g3txq 6 band hexbeam components1 the centrepost other eu and uk manufacturers now use this design but have no real understanding of how it works we designed this method so we do the air coaxial centrepost is a mw0jze unique design that has been in production since the 1st of aug 2012 to the presant day with zero failures the mw0jze  g3txq hexbeam air coaxial centre post is 99cm in height and material used is 35mm od 35mm wall aluminium tubing as the outer conductor with a solid rod as the centre conductor centre conductor is suspended on nylon spacers to hold it central to the inside of the centre conductor no coax is used in the construction of the centre post top of post is plugged with 5cm nylon rod which is a machined for a tight fit this gives the post 100 water tightness optional ice support cord eyelets or the xtream wx supports can be fitted upon request a stainless steel machine screw is fitted to which the support cords attach to stubmast is fitted to the base of the post and is 28cm long with 35mm od to match the same diameter as the centre post this is isolated from the centre post by a nylon insulator which is machined on site for a perfect fit feed is a so239 or ntype if reqested this is placed to the rear of the post behind the 20m feed studs at the very top of the centre post all hardware used is stainless steel and a ll machining is done in shop to ensure a perfect fit everytime2 the base platehub the mw0jze  g3txq baseplate is fitted to the bottom of the mw0jze  g3txq hexbeam centrepost this is also where the fiberglass spreaders are fitted plate is formed from high strength and lightweight t6 aluminium plate plate is 6mm thick and professionally cut on a cnc machine for 100 accurately cut mw0jze  g3txq hexbeam baseplates every time plate is finished with a blue anodised finish to protect it against corrosion for life and engraved with our logo all ubolts are m6 zinc and come with stainless steel washers spring washers and nylock nuts a maximum spreader diameter of 35mm can be fitted to the baseplate top and bottom flanges are large diameter and will take a maximum of 483mm tube not 2 inch flanges are formed from magnesium alloy very light and very strong the mw0jze  g3txq centrepost is fitted into the top flange you can fit the bottom flange directly into a 483mm tube or using the supplied collar it can be fitted directly into a rotator3 fibreglass armsspreaders the mw0jze  g3txq hexbeam spreaders form the shape and the framework of the hexbeam each mw0jze  g3txq hexbeam spreader comes in three 3 sections of pullwound fibreglass tubing for high strength and durability1 x 15m with 1 254mm od1 x 15m with 34 19mm od1 x 1m with 12 127mm odtotal assembled length of 353cm no cutting or measuring requiredelement clips are fitted to the spreaders to hold the wire elements in place there is one for each band these are made from uv resistant non conductive materials they are held in place with a stainless steel machine screw and nut the end of each spreader section is sleeved with aluminium ferrules to prevent them splitting when pressure is placed on them when they are bent to form the shape of the g3txq hexbeam by mw0jze two 2 cords are fitted to the ends of each spreader be means of an eyelet or similar non ferrous fixing one 1 is to be attached to the top of the mw0jze  g3txq hexbeam centrepost to form the bend in the spreader the second 2nd cord is attached to the tip of the next spreader this forms the radius support for each tip the cords are uv resistant polyester and each have a stainless steel hook or loop attached to the ends4 wire elements the g3txq hexbeam by mw0jze can be monoband or multi band normally due to size the hexbeam comes in five 5 or six 6 bands from 6m to 20m each element is a separate entity and in no way reliant to any other bands adding or removing any element has little or no effect on the other bands high power insulators as from january 2013 all g3txq hexbeams by mw0jze will have custom made insulators fitted as standard the insulators are bespoke design produced just for g3txq hexbeams specifically for high power cw and data users these insulators will eradicate the possible arcing of the driven elements where high power is used on full duty modes over prelonged periods such as contests and dxpeditions element format is driver  spacer cord  reflector  spacer cord  driver with polyester cords being used as the spacer cord each g3txq hexbeam element from mw0jze is made from seven 7 strand copper wire with a pvc coating with polyester spacer cords all joints are sealed with heat shrink wrapping note all elements come complete no measuring or cutting is required configuration a g3txq hexbeam is a full size 2 element yagi beam with bent wire elements from above the driven element resembles the shape of a letter m and the reflector resembles the shape of a letter u the hexbeam can come in mono band or multi band versions with little or no loss of performance in any configuration each band acts as a monoband 2 element yagi with no coils or traps so no loss the whole antenna is fed with one 50ohm feedline and will require some sort of 11 balunchoke as close to the feedpoint as physically possible this is normally 20m and is close to the top of the centrepost size if you have a small area and want a monoband performance antenna then the hexbeam will suit your needs at only 65 meters across it will fit inside most gardens the turning radius is only 325 meters compare this to a 20m yagi with a span of 1075 meters and a turning radius of 575 meters height from the base of the antenna to the tip of the centre post the whole antenna is 107cm tall this accommodates all 6 bands from 6m to 20m as shown in the image below 6m is the lowest band and all other bands are stacked above it comparison how does the g3txq hexbeam compare with other 2 element multiband non trapped antennas there are not many popular multiband antennas available that are not trapped or that include the warc bands the first two that came to mind were the 2 element step ir this is a pure yagi antenna with straight elements and no traps mounted on a single boom the second is the optibeam obw 10510 which is more of a moxon configuration with 2 elements for each band wire elements and no traps it does however use 2 elements for 12m and 10m not sure what this means but i guess it uses more than 2 elements on these bands in a parasitic format i think the two comparison antennas are fair comparisons as the step ir is a pure 2 element yagi the optibeam obw10510 is a wire antenna and the hexbeam is a good mix of both forward gain comparison chart in dbd  215 for dbi band 2 element step ir opti beam obw10 5 10 6 band g3txq hex beam20
