camps are springing up across the u s like a disease californian governor arnold schwarzenegger sought 106 billion to build more concentration camps in california alone the californian legislature gave him 74 billionsome of these sprawling concentration camps such as the facility outside lancaster in the desert above los angeles california include all the workshops and facilities behind massive

that the barbed wire fences are designed not to keep people out they face inwards while there is no use or need for the facility the government has been spending millions of dollars converting this facility into an ideal concentration camp along with gassing equipment most people by now know that george w bushs grand father funded hitler see bushes  most are not aware that the primary share holders of our federal reserve bank the rothschilds also funded both stalin and hitler their goals and methodologies have not changed fascists socialist nations terrified by unseen terrorists make
