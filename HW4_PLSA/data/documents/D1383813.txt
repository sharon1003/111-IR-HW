configuration commands clientdynamics ax 40configuration commands set the options that are used when a microsoft dynamics ax client starts configuration commands can be run directly from the following locations in a configuration file in the configuration command to run at kernel startup field in either the client configuration utility or server configuration utility from a command prompt when starting a client or an application object server aos instance configuration commands require that you use different syntax if you are setting them in a configuration file or executing them in the configuration command to run at kernel startup field or from a command prompt the syntax variations are provided in the following sections for information about executing configuration commands see executing configuration commands at startup  general options this table describes the options you can use to work with configurations and files as well as general startup options such as company log file and startup commands and messages command in configuration file command in command line configuration utility option descriptioncompanytext string  company  string company specify the company

it this command cannot be set in a file language  string no corresponding user interface value change the language that a microsoft dynamics ax client uses when starting in most instances you should use the user management options to change a users language see set a users default language for details use this option only if a user has changed to a new language and the microsoft dynamics ax

previous versions that are not in use other configuration options remain in both the client or server configuration files although they only apply to client or server because in previous product versions the utilities were combined we recommend that you do not change values for these options unexpected results may occur value in configuration file applies
