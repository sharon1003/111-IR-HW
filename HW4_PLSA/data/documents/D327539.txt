author here hypertrophyspecific training hst is a not a specific routine but a training idea its been tested by many weightlifters especially bodybuilders what is hst hypertrophyspecific training or simply hst is a method of training designed to quickly and effectively induce whole body muscle growth it is based on physiological principles of muscular hypertrophy these principles were first discovered in the laboratory and then organized into a method of training that would produce predictable and repeatable hypertrophic effects hypertrophyspecific training arose out of the research looking at both the stimuli and mechanisms for muscle cell hypertrophy of course translating these principles into applicable methods sets and reps and schedules brings in some possibility of error as the science continues to explore the exact mechanisms of muscle hypertrophy this error will be whittled away  wwwhypertrophyspecificcomrelated articlesome minor principles of hypertrophyspecific training herein were going to take a closer look at some of these minor principles while only briefly discussing the wellknown major principles of hst  click here to learn more 1 mechanical load mechanical load is necessary to induce muscle hypertrophy this mechanism involves but isnt limited to mapkerk satellite cells growth factors calcium and number of other fairly understood factors it is incorrect to say we dont know how muscle grows in response to training the whole point of the hst book is not to discuss hst but to present the body of research explaining how hypertrophy occurs then hst becomes a relatively obvious conclusion if your goal is hypertrophy2 acute vs chronic stimuli in order for the loading to result in significant hypertrophy the stimulus must be applied with sufficient frequency to create a new environment as opposed to seemingly random and acute assaults on the mechanical integrity of the tissue the downside of taking a week of rest every time you load a muscle is that many of the acute responses to training like increased protein synthesis prostaglandins igf1 levels and m rna levels all return to normal in about 36 hours so you spend 2 days growing and half a week in a semianticatabolic state returning to normal some people call this recovery when research shows us that recovery can take place unabated even if the muscle is loaded again in 48 hours so true anabolism from loading only lasts two days at best once the load is removed the rest of the time you are simply balancing nitrogen retention without adding to it3 progressive load over time the tissue adapts and becomes resistant to the damaging effects of mechanical load this adaptation resistance to the stimulus can happen in as little as 48 hours repeated bout effect or rapid training effect as this happens hypertrophy will stop though neural and metabolic adaptations can and may continue as opposed to hypertrophy the foundation for the development of strength is neuromuscular in nature increases in strength from resistance exercise have been attributed to several neural adaptations including altered recruitment patterns rate coding motor unit synchronization reflex potentiation prime mover antagonist activity and prime mover agonist activity so aside from incremental changes in the number of contractile filaments hypertrophy voluntary force production ie strength is largely a matter of activating motor units4 strategic deconditioning at this point it is necessary to either increase the load progressive load or decrease the degree of conditioning to the load strategic deconditioning the muscle is sensitive not only to the absolute load but also to the change in load up or down therefore you can get a hypertrophic effect from increasing the load from a previous load even if the absolute load is not maximum assuming conditioning resistance to exercise induced microdamage is not to extensive there is a limit to the number of increments you can add to increase the load you simply reach your maximum voluntary strength eventually this is why strategic deconditioning is required for continued growth once growth has stopped all things remaining equal related articlestrategic deconditioning priming muscles for growth while utilizing hypertrophyspecific training techniques our goal is to present the muscle with a growth promoting stimulus at the moment the muscle is physically susceptible to microtrauma  click here to learn more utilizing lactic acid as a stimulus for tendon repairhealth now hst incorporates a few other things such as higher reps for lactic acid to prepare the muscles and tendons for future heavy loads this serves as regular maintenance without it you increase your risk of chronic injuries and pain the metabolicallytaxing reps enhance healing of strained tendons compound exercises hst also suggests using compound exercises to maximize the effects of loading on as much muscle as possible per exercise progressively adjusting reps to accommodate progressive load hst suggests that you use 2week blocks for each rep range why it has nothing to do with adaptation it is simply a way to accommodate the ever increasing load of course you could adjust your reps every week eg 15 12 10 8 5 etc  but this is more complicated and people might not understand often times in order to communicate an idea you must simplify things even at the expense of perfection if people cant understand it they wont do it what good would that do or anybody then over time people figure out for themselves the other possibilities that exist within the principles of hypertrophy low volume per exercise average volume per week hst suggests that you limit the number of sets per exercise per workout to 1 or 2 this is based on some evidence that sets beyond the first effective set do little more than burn calories there is nothing wrong with burning calories but when you get to be my age you just dont have the exercise tolerance that you once did using hormone replacement hrt therapy would of course increase the number of sets you could do without undue stress some may question the validity of hst not utilizing more than 1 or 2 sets per exercise the number of sets is set low to accommodate the frequency necessary to create an effective and consistent environment to stimulate hypertrophy over the course of a week the volume isnt that different from standard splits eg chest should tri back bi legs  wwwhypertrophyspecificcomhst is a training idea based on numerous scientific principles and data that has been rendered to be effective by many trainees even including a few professional bodybuilders it is an idea that has direct scientific evidence to support itself it is based on training each body part three times per week so as to constantly induce growth the idea is that constant tension on the muscles will lead to more hypertrophy than a conventional split in which a muscle is subject to stress once or twice per week and the other 56 days of the week are spent training other body parts and not stimulating each muscle group however over the course of an entire week the total number of sets for each body part will be similar to a conventional body part split related articlesix hypertrophy hints here i will share with you six hints that can lead to more hypertrophy serious bodybuilding is hard work and you deserve to get the most out of the time you spend in the gym  click here to learn more workout what is the best hst workout be specific and make sure to list exercises reps sets etc the principles of hst are based on progressive load and on training each muscle group 3 times per week the program is based around 2week cycles in specific rep ranges also the goal of the workouts is intensity and stimulation not annihilation of the muscle group this routine is not suggested for a beginner trainee but for an intermediate or advanced lifter with at least 12 years of solid training experience you must first establish your 15rep max your 10rep max and your 5rep max for each of the lifts in the program here is an 8week cycle weeks 12 monday full squats  12

rest weekweeks 10from here you can start the cycle over again it would also be a good idea to change some of the exercises for example switch dumbbell curls with reverse curls who would an hst workout appeal to an hst workout would appeal to almost anyone looking to put on muscle and increase strength the entire concept of hst is based on real science and it looks like a solid training idea it is much better than trying some workout you read in a magazine that promises 10 pounds of muscle in a week hst is a proven training idea that will pack on muscle on a consistent basis related articlehst for dummies if you are looking for mainly size with some strength on the side hst is the way to go continue here for an explanation on hst and how often it should be done  click here to learn more bodybuilders would benefit well by switching from a conventional split routine to an hst routine for eight weeks someone going from a conventional routine to an hst routine would be pleasantly surprised by the results this is because homeostasis would be disrupted as each body part would be trained three times per week but with a lower volume each session keeping almost constant stimulation for each muscle group to grow who wouldnt an hst workout appeal to an hst workout would probably not appeal to someone looking to maintain their weight or someone that is in a cutting phase hst is meant for people looking to gain mass and best results are achieved when there is a caloric surplus also powerlifters wrestlers or boxers that must stay in a specific weight class would probably not be inclined to start an hst routine for the simple reason that a considerable amount of weight will most likely be gained when partaking in such a routine lastly an hst workout would not appeal to beginners because of the difficulty presented by the workouts bonus question have you tried an hst program if so how well did it work if not do you think its a routine worth trying i have not tried an hst program in the past but i plan on doing so in the near future it looks like a solid routine with sound principles and i simply want to see how well it actually works i will follow the routine for eight weeks while following a diet with a large caloric surplus in hopes of gaining as much muscle as possible i think the hst program is worth it because there seem to be no gimmicks just proven and consistent results hst is also known to create fast strength gains so this is an added bonus related pollhave you ever tried an hst program yes no no but i will review of other articles or why wasnt
