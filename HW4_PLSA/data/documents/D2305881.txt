cracking the cost of lobster by joanna prisco aug 22 2013lucas jacksonretuers live lobsters swim in a holding tank inside redhook lobster pound in new york email a new yorker article on the cost of lobster caused a stir among seafood lovers and skeptical diners this week positing that restaurant prices do not reflect the current glut of crustaceans  now selling for as low as 220 off the boat in maine  but the implied prestige of eating them several vocal chefs have defended their prices however saying there are myriad reasons for the markups whether the cost of transport cooking labor or the type of lobster the combined price of what appears on your plate is more complicated than boat hauls and psychological associations said new york city chef marco canora hearth terroir wine bar who fired off a fuming tweet earlier this week in response to the media flurry here we go again annual cheap lobster article is out and once again no talk of hard vs soft shell lobsters makesnosense he wrote during the late summer maine lobsters molt their hard shells by dropping some weight and wiggling out the creatures then begin to create a new shell in a much larger size filling the gap between their bodies and their softshell exterior with water as they continue to grow this can be misleading when it comes time to purchase the weight is there because of the water but you yield less meat from it said canora every year this kind of article comes out and every year no one talks about it the reduced meat per shell means restaurants have to order just as much if not more to continue preparing dishes like lobster rolls lobster bisque or lobster mac n cheese some chefs have attested alternatively however buyers can still source lobsters from further north where they arent shedding their shells yet the media try to make it sound like restaurants are ripping people off said canora the fact of the matter is when i call my guy for lobster i make sure im getting a hard shell because im not going to charge 38 for a whole lobster entree and then have you crack open a claw for a piece of meat the size of your thumb susan povich founder of red hook lobster pound in brooklyn n y and the supplier for its washington d c offshoot told abc news that in contrast to the reports of a glut her own costs have gone up over the last few years i have freshpicked meat sent down to me from maine said povich who uses the prepicked flesh in her popular rolls i only use the claw and knuckle because i personally feel its the best part of the lobster in the past it was subsidized because the cost of tails was so expensive but over the last few years it has become more popular and the cost has increased by 30 percent povich also transports whole lobsters down from maine which carries its own financial risk i lose 20 percent of my softshell lobsters when they travel because they die theyre too fragile for all of them to make the trip she said povich is currently selling whole softshell lobsters for 6 to 7 per pound and hardshell lobsters for 11 to 12 per pound in addition to the price differences many attest that the type of lobster shell influences the taste of the meat softshell lobsters tend to be a little more tender and a little sweeter than their hardshell cousins according to most chefs meanwhile hardshell lobsters are often lauded for their brininess salinity and oceanic flavor both have their attributes but the hardshells are not as forgiving of novice home cooks to determine whether an unlabeled lobster is a hardshell or a softshell ask your local seafood purveyor to take it out of the case to feel for yourself a squeeze will give you a sense of how much meat is inside and the toughness of the shell said canora sam talbot a native of north carolina and a top chef alum offered other visual cues for choosing a choice crustacean the tail should be strong and naturally curl under the belly when you pick it up they should also look alert if its half dead it will taste half dead he said that is unless you buy into the argument that a lobsters taste depends upon its price you know people want to say that lobster is a luxury item  but look at red lobster said povich thats a fast food place like applebees and they sell more lobster than anybody comments add interests customize your news feed by choosing the topics that interest you previous donald
