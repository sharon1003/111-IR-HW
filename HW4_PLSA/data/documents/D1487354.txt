the united states senate in missouri held on august 7 2012 was one of the three most anticipated of summer 2012 this was due to the projected closeness of the federal races in the  showme state  in november 2012 and the potential to change the control of the senate in january 2013 7 democrats believed that todd akin would be the weakest among the likely challengers for the senate seat and ads

transcript at cspan second debate october 18 2012rape and pregnancy controversy  editmain article rape and pregnancy controversies in the 2012 united states elections see also pregnancy from rape while making remarks on rape and abortion on august 19 2012 akin made the claim that women victims of what he described as legitimate rape rarely experience pregnancy from rape in an interview aired on st louis television station ktvitv aiken was asked his views on whether women who became pregnant due to rape should have the option of abortion he replied well you know people always want to try to make that as one of those things well how do you how do you slice this particularly tough sort of ethical question first of all from what i understand from doctors thats really rare if its a legitimate rape the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down but lets assume that maybe that didn’t work or something i think there should be some punishment but the punishment ought to be on the rapist and not attacking the child 36the comments from akin almost immediately led to uproar with the term legitimate rape being taken to imply belief in a view that some kinds of rape are legitimate or alternatively that the many victims who do become pregnant from rape are likely to be lying about their claim his claims about the likelihood of pregnancy resulting from rape were widely seen as being based on longdiscredited pseudoscience with experts seeing the claims as lacking any basis of medical validity 37 38 39 akin was not the first to make such claims but was perhaps one of the most prominent 40 while some voices such as iowa congressman steve king supported akin 41 senior figures in both parties condemned his remarks and some republicans called for him to resign 42 43 44 in the resulting furor akin received widespread calls to drop out of his senate race from both republicans and democrats 45 akin apologized after making the comment saying he misspoke and he stated he planned to remain in the senate race this response was itself attacked by many commentators who saw the initial comments as representative of his longheld views rather than an accidental gaffe the comment was widely characterized as misogynistic and recklessly inaccurate with many commentators remarking on the use of the words legitimate rape 46 47 48 related news articles cited a 1996 article in an obstetrics and gynecology journal which found that 5 of women who were raped became pregnant which equaled about 32000 pregnancies each year in the us alone 49 a separate 2003 article in the journal human nature estimated that rapes are twice as likely to result in pregnancies as consensual sex 50 see also pregnancy from rape  the incident was seen as having an impact on akins senate race and the republicans chances of gaining a majority in the u s senate 51 by making news in the week before the 2012 republican national convention and by shift ing the national discussion to divisive social issues that could repel swing voters rather than economic issues that could attract them 52 akin along with other republican candidates with controversial positions on rape lost due to backlash from women voters 53other controversies  editon october 20 at a fundraiser akin compared mc caskill to a dog after being criticized akins campaign aide wrote on his official twitter page that if claire mc caskill were a dog she’d be a ‘bullshitsu’ the aide later said that he was joking 54 akin was caught on tape commenting that sen claire mc caskill goes to washington d c
