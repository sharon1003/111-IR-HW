advanceknowledge conspiracy theory is the argument that u s government had advance knowledge of japan s december 7 1941 attack on pearl harbor ever since the japanese attack there has been debate as to how and why the united states had been caught off guard and how much and when american officials knew of japanese plans for an attack 1 2 in september 1944 john t flynn 3 a cofounder of the noninterventionist america first committee 4 launched a pearl harbor counternarrative when he published a fortysix page booklet entitled the truth about pearl harbor 3several writers including journalist robert stinnett 5 retired u s navy rear admiral robert alfred theobald 6 and harry elmer barnes 7 have argued various parties high in the u s and british governments knew of the attack in advance and may even have let it happen or encouraged it in order to force america into the european theatre of world war ii via a japanese–american war started at the back door 8 9 evidence supporting this view is taken from quotations and source documents from the time 10 and the release of newer materials however the pearl harbor advanceknowledge conspiracy is considered to be a fringe

inquiries into the attack between 1941 and 1946 and a tenth in 1995 they included an inquiry by secretary of the navy frank knox 1941 the roberts commission 1941–42 the hart inquiry 1944 the army pearl harbor board 1944 the naval court of inquiry 1944 the hewitt investigation the clarke investigation the congressional inquiry pearl harbor committee 1945–46 a topsecret inquiry by secretary of war henry l stimson authorized by congress and carried out by henry clausen the clausen inquiry 1946 and the thurmondspence hearing in april 1995 which produced the dorn report 14 the inquiries reported incompetence underestimation and misapprehension of japanese capabilities and intentions problems resulting from excessive secrecy about cryptography division of responsibility between army and navy and lack of consultation between them and lack of adequate manpower for intelligence analysis collection processing 15  page neededinvestigators prior to clausen did not have the security clearance necessary to receive the most sensitive information as brigadier general henry d russell had been appointed guardian of the prewar decrypts and he alone held the combination to the storage safe 16 clausen claimed in spite of secretary stimson having given him a letter informing witnesses he had the necessary clearances to require their cooperation he was repeatedly lied to until he produced copies of top secret decrypts thus proving he indeed had the proper clearance stimsons report to congress based on clausens work was limited due to secrecy concerns largely about cryptography a more complete account was not made publicly available until the mid1980s and not published until 1992 as pearl harbor final judgement reaction to the 1992 publication has varied some regard it as a valuable addition to understanding the events 17 while one historian noted clausen did not speak to general walter short army commander at pearl harbor during the attack and called clausens investigation notoriously unreliable in several aspects 18assertions that japanese codes had already been broken  editu s signals intelligence in 1941 was both impressively advanced and uneven in the past the u s mi8 cryptographic operation in new york city had been shut down by henry stimson hoovers newly appointed secretary of state citing ethical considerations which inspired its now broke former director herbert yardley to write a 1931 book the american black chamber about its successes in breaking other nations crypto traffic most countries responded promptly by changing and generally improving their ciphers and codes forcing other nations to start over in reading their signals the japanese were no exception nevertheless u s cryptanalytic work continued after stimsons action in two separate efforts the armys signal intelligence service sis and the navys office of naval intelligence oni crypto group op20g cryptanalytic work was kept secret to such an extent however commands such as the 14th naval district at pearl harbor were prohibited from working on codebreaking by admiral kelly turner as a consequence of the bureaucratic infighting in washington by late 1941 those organizations had broken several japanese ciphers such as j19 and pak2 called tsu and oite respectively by the japanese 19 the highest security diplomatic code dubbed purple by the u s had been broken but american cryptanalysts had made little progress against the ijns current kaigun ango sho d 20 naval code d called an1 by the u s 21 jn25 after march 1942 in addition there was a perennial shortage of manpower thanks to penury on one hand and the perception of intelligence as a lowvalue career path on the other translators were overworked cryptanalysts were in short supply and staffs were generally stressed furthermore there were difficulties retaining good intelligence officers and trained linguists most did not remain on the job for the extended periods necessary to become truly professional for career reasons nearly all wanted to return to more standard assignments however concerning the manning levels  just prior to world war ii the us had some 700 people engaged in the effort and was in fact obviously having some successes 22 of these 85 were tasked to decryption and 50 to translation efforts against ijn codes 23 the nature and degree of these successes has led to great confusion among nonspecialists furthermore op20gy analysts relied as much on summary reports as on the actual intercepted messages 24the u s was also given decrypted messages by dutch nei intelligence who like the others in the british–dutch–u s agreement to share the cryptographic load shared information with allies however the u s refused to do likewise 25 this was at least in part due to fears of compromise sharing even between the us navy and army was restricted  citation needed the eventual flow of intercepted and decrypted information was tightly and capriciously controlled at times even president roosevelt did not receive all information from codebreaking activities  citation needed there were fears of compromise as a result of poor security after a memo dealing with magic was found in the desk of brigadier general edwin m pa watson the presidents military aide 26purple  editthe japanese code dubbed purple which was used by the foreign office and only for diplomatic but not for military messages was broken by army cryptographers in 1940 a 14part message using this code sent from japan to its embassy in washington was decoded in washington on 6 and 7 december the message which made plain the japanese intention to break off diplomatic relations with the united states was to be delivered by the japanese ambassador at 1 pm washington time dawn in the pacific colonel rufus s bratton then serving as an aide to marshall took this to mean that the japanese intended to attack at dawn somewhere in the pacific marshall ordered a warning message sent to american bases in the area including hawaii due to atmospheric transmission conditions the message was sent out via western union rather than the usual signal channels and was not received until the attack was already underway 27jn25  editthe jn25 superencrypted code and its cryptanalysis by the us is one of the most debated portions of pearl harbor lore jn25 is the u s navys last of several names for the cryptosystem of the imperial japanese navy sometimes referred to as naval code d 28 other names used for it include fivenumeral 5num fivedigit fivefigure an jn25 able and an1 jn25 baker and so on 29superenciphered codes of this sort were widely used and were the state of the art in practical cryptography at the time jn25 was very similar in principle to the british naval cypher no 3 known to have been broken by germany during world war ii 30once it was realized what sort of cryptosystem jn25 was how to attempt breaking into it was known stinnett in fact notes the existence of a usn handbook for attacks on such a system produced by op20g even so breaking any such code was not easy in actual practice it took much effort and time not least in accumulating sufficient cryptanalytic depth in intercepted messages prior to the outbreak of hostilities when ijn radio traffic increased abruptly and substantially prior to 7 december 1941 ijn radio traffic was limited since the ijn played only a minor role in the war against china and therefore was only rarely required to send radio messages whatever the highest level crypto system might have been as well interception of ijn traffic off china would have been at best spotty rather oddly however the official history of gyp1 shows nearly 45000 ijn messages intercepted during the period from 1 june 1941 until 4 december 1941 thus most japanese encrypted broadcast military radio traffic was army traffic associated with the land operations in china none of which used ijn cryptography 31breaking a superencrypted cipher like jn25 was a threestep process a determining the indicator method to establish the starting point within the additive cipher b stripping away the superencryption to expose the bare code and then c breaking the code itself when jn25 was first detected and recognized such intercepted messages as were interceptable were collected at assorted intercept stations around the pacific by the navy in an attempt to accumulate sufficient depth to attempt to strip away the superencryption success at doing so was termed by the cryptographers a break into the system such a break did not always produce a cleartext version of the intercepted message only a break in third phase could do so only after breaking the underlying code another difficult process would the message be available and even then its meaning—in an intelligence sense—might be less than fully clear when a new edition was released the cryptographers were forced to start again the original jn25a system replaced the blue code as americans called it and used fivedigit numbers each divisible by three and so usable as a quick and somewhat reliable error check as well as something of a crib to cryptanalysts giving a total of 33334 legal code values to make it harder to crack a code value meaningless additives from a large table or book of fivedigit numbers were added arithmetically to each fivedigit cipher element jn25b superseded the first release of jn25 at the start of december 1940 jn25b had 55000 valid words and while it initially used the same additive list this was soon changed and the cryptanalysts found themselves entirely locked out again over the years various claims have been made as to the progress made decrypting this system and arguments made over when it was readable in whole or part lt honest john leitwiler 32 commander of station cast the philippines stated in november 1941 that his staff could “walk right across” the number columns of the coded messages he is frequently quoted in support of claims jn25 was then mostly readable this comment however refers not to the message itself but to the superenciphering additives and referred to the ease of attacking the code using a new method for discovery of additive values the 16 november 1941 letter 33 to l w parks op20gy sent by leitwiler states we have stopped work on the period 1 february to 31 july as we have all we can do to keep up with the current period we are reading enough current traffic to keep two translators very busy another document exhibit no 151 memoranda from captain l f safford from the hewitt inquiry 34 has a copy of the u s navy message opnav242239 evaluation of messages of 26 november 1941 which has in part 1 reference a advised that com 16 intercepts were considered most reliable and requested com 16 to evaluate reports on japanese naval movements and send dispatch to opnav info cincpac com 16s estimates were more reliable than com 14s not only because of better radio interception but because com 16 was currently reading messages in the japanese fleet cryptographic system 5number code or jn25 and was exchanging technical information and japanesetoenglish translations 35 with the british c i unit at singapore lt cdr arthur h mc collum was aware of this and it may have been part of his thinking when he drafted the mc collum memo duane l whitlock traffic analyst at cast 36 was not aware before the attack ijn movement traffic code was being read reading in this context means being able to see the underlying code groups not breaking out the messages into usable plaintext 37 the hewitt inquiry document also states the 5 numeral system jn25b yielded no information which would arouse even a suspicion of the pearl harbor raid either before or afterward the claim no preattack ijn message expressly mentioned pearl harbor is perhaps true the claims that no purple traffic pointed to pearl harbor may also be true as the foreign office was not well thought of by the military and during this period was routinely excluded from sensitive or secret material including war planning it is also possible any such intercepts were not translated until after the attack or indeed after the war ended 38  verification needed in both instances all traffic from these preattack intercepts has not yet been declassified and released to the public domain hence any such claims are now indeterminate pending a fuller accounting additionally no decrypts have come to light of jn25b traffic with any intelligence value prior to pearl harbor and certainly no such has been identified such breaks as recorded by authors w j holmes and clay blair jr were into the additive tables which was a required second step of three see above the first 100 jn25 decrypts from all sources in datetime order of translation have been released and are available in the national archives the first jn25b decrypt was in fact by hypo hawaii on 8 january 1942 numbered 1 up jn25b rg38 cnsg library box 22 322282 na cp the first 25 decrypts were very short messages or partial decrypts of marginal intelligence value as whitlock stated the reason that not one single jn25 decrypt made prior to pearl harbor has ever been found or declassified is not due to any insidious coverup it is due quite simply to the fact that no such decrypt ever existed it simply was not within the realm of our combined cryptologic capability to produce a usable decrypt at that particular juncture 39detailed month by month progress reports have shown no reason to believe any jn25b messages were fully decrypted before the start of the war tallied results for september october and november reveal roughly 3800 code groups out of 55000 about 7 had been recovered by the time of the attack on pearl harbor detection of japanese transmissions  editthere are claims that as the kido butai the striking force steamed toward hawaii radio signals were detected that alerted u s intelligence to the imminent attack for instance the matson liner ss lurline heading from san francisco to hawaii on its regular route is said to have heard and plotted via  relative bearings  unusual radio traffic in a telegraphic code very different from international morse 40 which persisted for several days and came from signal source s moving in an easterly direction not from shore stations—possibly the approaching japanese fleet there are numerous morse code standards including those for japanese korean arabic hebrew russian and greek to the experienced radio operator each has a unique and identifiable pattern for example kana international morse and continental morse all have a specific rhythmic sound to the dit and dah combinations this is how lurline  s radiomen leslie grogan a u s navy reserve officer in naval communications and with decades of maritime service in the pacific 41 identified the mooted signal source as japanese and not say russian there are several problems with this analysis surviving officers from the japanese ships state there was no radio traffic to have been overheard by anyone their radio operators had been left in japan to send fake traffic and all radio transmitters aboard the ships even those in the airplanes  citation needed were physically disabled to prevent any inadvertent or unauthorized broadcast 42the kido butai was constantly receiving intelligence and diplomatic updates 43 regardless of whether the kido butai broke radio silence and transmitted there was a great deal of radio traffic picked up by its antennas in that time period it was known for a radio signal to reflect from the ionosphere an atmospheric layer ionospheric skip could result in its reception hundreds or even thousands of miles away receiving antennas were sometimes detected passively rebroadcasting signals that reached them at much lower amplitudes sufficiently low that the phenomenon was not of practical importance nor even of much significance some have argued that since the kido butai contained a large number of possible receiving antennas it is conceivable the task force did not break radio silence but was detected anyway  citation neededsuch detection would not have helped the americans track the japanese fleet a radio direction finder df or rdf from that time period reported compass direction without reference to distance moreover it was common for the receiving stations to report erroneous reciprocal bearings 44  page needed to locate the source a plotter needed two such detections taken from two separate stations to triangulate and find the target if the target was moving the detections must be close to one another in time to plot the task forces course with certainty at least four such detections must have been made in proper timepairs and the information analyzed in light of further information received by other means this complex set of requirements did not occur if the kido butai was detected it was not tracked  citation neededaccording to a 1942 japanese after action report 45 in order to keep strict radio silence steps such as taking off fuses in the circuit and holding and sealing the keys were taken during the operation the strict radio silence was perfectly carried out the kido butai used the radio instruments for the first time on the day of the attack since they had been fixed at the base approximately twenty days before and proved they worked well paper flaps had been inserted between key points of some transmitters on board akagi to keep the strictest radio silence commander genda who helped plan the attack stated we kept absolute radio silence for two weeks before the attack the ships of kido butai used flag and light signals  semaphore and blinker which were sufficient since task force members remained in line of sight for the entire transit time kazuiyoshi koichi the communications officer for hiei dismantled vital transmitter parts and kept them in a box that he used as a pillow to prevent hiei from making any radio transmissions until the attack commenced 46 lieutenant commander chuichi yoshoka communications officer of the flagship akagi said he did not recall any ship sending a radio message before the attack 47 furthermore captain kijiro in charge of the kido butai  s three screening submarines stated nothing of interest happened on the way to hawaii presumably including signals received from the supposedly radio silent kido butai 48 vice admiral ryūnosuke kusaka stated it is needless to say that the strictest radio silence was ordered to be maintained in every ship of the task force to keep radio silence was easy to say but not so easy to maintain there is nothing in the japanese logs or after action report indicating that radio silence was broken until after the attack kusaka worried about this when it was briefly broken on the way home 49the appendix to the warinitiating operational order is also often debated the message of 25 november 1941 from cin c combined fleet yamamoto to all flagships stated ships of the combined fleet will observe radio communications procedure as follows 1 except in extreme emergency the main force and its attached force will cease communicating 2 other forces are at the discretion of their respective commanders 3 supply ships repair ships hospital ships etc will report directly to parties concerned furthermore in accordance with this imperial operational order the cin c of the combined fleet issued his operational order  the task force then drew up its own operational order which was given for the first time to the whole force at hitokappu bay in paragraph four of the appendix to that document the especially secret strike force was specifically directed to maintain strict radio silence from the time of their departure from the inland sea their communications will be handled entirely on the general broadcast communications net 50 51 in addition genda recalled in a 1947 interview kido butai  s communications officer issuing this order with the task force to rely as might be expected on flag and blinker 52the original records of lurline surrendered to lt cmdr george w pease 14th naval district in honolulu have disappeared neither lurline  s log nor the reports to the navy or coast guard by grogan in hawaii have been found thus no contemporaneously written evidence of what was recorded aboard lurline is now available grogan commented on a signal source moving eastward in the north pacific over several days as shown via relative bearings which then bunched up and stopped moving 53 54 however the directions given by grogan in a recreation of the logbook for the matson line were 18 and 44° off from known strike force positions and instead pointed towards japan according to author jacobsen japanese commercial shipping vessels are the likely source a recently  when discovered missing personal report written by grogan after the radio log had been passed to the 13th naval district dated 10 december 1941 and titled record for posterity also does not support claims of kido butai broadcasting  citation neededthe japanese practiced radio deception susumu ishiguru intelligence and communications officer for carrier division two stated every day false communications emanated from kyushu ie the japanese home islands at the same time and same wavelength as during the training period because of this commander joseph rochefort of hawaii signals intelligence concluded that the first air fleet remained in home waters for routine training the ships left their own regular wireless operators behind to carry on routine radio traffic captain sadatoshi tomioka stated the main force in the inland sea and the landbased air units carried out deceptive communications to indicate the carriers were training in the kyushu area the main japanese naval bases yokosuka kure and sasebo all engaged in considerable radio deception analysis of the bearings from navy df stations account for claimed breaks of radio silence and when plotted the bearings point to japanese naval bases not where those kido butai ships actually were 55rochefort 56 with huckins and williams 57 states there were no dummy messages used at any time throughout 1941 and no effort by the japanese to use serious deception when asked after the attack just how he knew where akagi was rochefort 58 who commanded hypo at the time said he recognized her same hamfisted radio operators the japanese contend that radio operators were left behind as part of the deception operation the critical dftracked radio transmissions show bearings that could have not come from the strike force emissions monitored from cast 59 or cast s report akagi was off okinawa on 8 december 1941 are examples though some transmissions continue to be debated 60 the contention that lowpowered radio such as vhf or what the u s navy called tbs or talk between ships might have been used and detected is contradicted as impossible due to the tremendous distances involved 61 and when contact was lost it was routinely presumed it was because lowpowered radio and land line were being used 62freedom of information act foia requests for specific rdf reports remain wanting 63 a more critical analysis of the source documentation shows that not one single radio direction finder bearing much less any locating fix was obtained on any kido butai unit or command during its transit from saeki bay kyushu to hitokappu bay and thence on to hawaii by removing this fallacious lynchpin propping up such claims of kido butai radio transmissions the attendant suspected conspiracy tumbles down like a house of cards 64one suggested example of a kido butai transmission is the november 30 1941 comsum14 report in which rochefort mentioned a tactical circuit heard calling  maru s 65 a term often used for commercial vessels or noncombat units further the perspective of u s naval intelligence at the time was  the significance of the term tactical circuit is that the vessel itself that is akagi was using its own radio to call up the other vessels directly rather than work them through shore stations via the broadcast method which was the common practice in japanese communications the working of the akagi with the marus indicated that she was making arrangements for fuel or some administrative function since a carrier would rarely address a maru 66also from a u s navy radiomen on duty at station ae station able easy sitka alaska 67 at the time of pearl harbor elmer h frantz states it is inconceivable to me that a force represented by the kido butai with 33 ships involved of all different types  and no radio communications communication black out on orders – i just dont believe it 68one story from author constantine fitzgibbon claimed that a letter received from v f w cavendishbentinck stated britains jic met and discussed at length the impending japanese attack on pearl harbor from a joint intelligence subcommittee session of 5 december 1941 69 it was stated we knew that they changed course i remember presiding over a j i c meeting and being told that a japanese fleet was sailing in the direction of hawaii asking have we informed our transatlantic brethren and receiving an affirmative reply however the author was incorrect there was no session on 5 december nor was pearl harbor discussed when they did meet on 3 december 70 71 72statements by highranking officials  editone perspective is given by rear admiral frank e beatty who at the time of the pearl harbor attack was an aide to the secretary of the navy frank knox and was very close to president franklin d roosevelt s inner circle remarked that prior to december 7 it was evident even to me that we were pushing japan into a corner i believed that it was the desire of president roosevelt and prime minister churchill that we get into the war as they felt the allies could not win without us and all our efforts to cause the germans to declare war on us failed the conditions we imposed upon japan—to get out of china for example—were so severe that we knew that nation could not accept them we were forcing her so severely that we could have known that she would react toward the united states all her preparations in a military way — and we knew their overall import — pointed that way 73another eye witness viewpoint akin to beattys is provided by roosevelts administrative assistant at the time of pearl harbor jonathan daniels it is a telling comment about fdrs reaction to the attack – the blow was heavier than he had hoped it would necessarily be  but the risks paid off even the loss was worth the price  74ten days before the attack on pearl harbor  henry l stimson united states secretary of war at the time entered in his diary the famous and muchargued statement – that he had met with president roosevelt to discuss the evidence of impending hostilities with japan and the question was how we should maneuver them the japanese into the position of firing the first shot without allowing too much danger to ourselves 75 however stimson in reviewing his diary after the war recalled that the commanders at pearl harbor had been warned of the possibility of attack and that the poor state of readiness that the attack had revealed was a surprise to him yet general short had been told the two essential facts 1 a war with japan is threatening 2 hostile action by japan is possible at any moment given these two facts both of which were stated without equivocation in the message of nov 27 the outpost commander should be on the alert to make his fight  to cluster his airplanes in such groups and positions that in an emergency they could not take the air for several hours and to keep his antiaircraft ammunition so stored that it could not be promptly and immediately available and to use his best reconnaissance system radar only for a very small fraction of the day and night in my opinion betrayed a misconception of his real duty which was almost beyond belief  76stimson omits to mention the war warning message expressly told short not to alarm the civilian population and to be alert for sabotage which was widely expected to be a precursor to attack robert stinnetts day of deceit suggests a memorandum prepared by commander mc collum was central to u s policy in the immediate prewar period stinnett claims the memo suggests only a direct attack on u s interests would sway the american public or congress to favor direct involvement in the european war specifically in support of the british an attack by japan would not could not aid britain although the memo was passed to captains walter anderson and dudley knox two of roosevelts military advisors on october 7 1940 there is no evidence to suggest roosevelt ever saw it while stinnetts claims of evidence he did is nonexistent 77 moreover although anderson and knox offered eight specific plans to aggrieve the japanese empire and added if by these means japan could be led to commit an overt act of war so much the better of the eight plans actions to be taken offered in the memo many if not all were implemented but there is considerable doubt the mc collom memo was the inspiration nonetheless in day of deceit stinnett claims all action items were implemented 78 yet there were numerous instances of members of the roosevelt administration insisting on not provoking japan mark parillo in his essay the united states in the pacific wrote  these theories tend to founder on the logic of the situation had roosevelt and other members of his administration known of the attack in advance they would have been foolish to sacrifice one of the major instruments needed to win the war just to get the united states into it 79 furthermore on 5 november 1941 in a joint memo stark cno and marshall army chief of staff warned if japan be defeated and germany remain undefeated decision will still not have been reached war between the united states and japan should be avoided 80 additionally in a 21 november 1941 memo brigadier leonard t gerow head of army war plans stated one of our present major objectives is the avoidance of war with japan and to insure continuance of material assistance to the british 81 he concluded  it is of grave importance to our war effort in europe 81 furthermore churchill himself in a 15 may 1940 telegram said he hoped a u s commitment to aid britain would quiet japan following with a 4 october message requesting a usn courtesy visit to singapore aimed at preventing the spreading of the war 82 and starks own plan dog expressly stated any strength that we might send to the far east wouldreduce the force of our blows against germany 83 roosevelt could scarcely have been ignorant of starks views and war with japan was clearly contrary to roosevelts express wish to aid britain and with churchills to quiet japan one quote is often used to add legitimacy to the notion the british government knew in advance of the attack oliver lyttelton the british minister of war production said  japan was provoked into attacking the americans at pearl harbor it is a travesty of history ever to say that america was forced into the war everyone knows where american sympathies were it is incorrect to say that america was truly neutral even before america came into the war on an allout basis 84 how this demonstrates anything with regard to japan is unclear rather it refers to other aid to britain lendlease enacted in march 1941 informally declared the end of american neutrality in favor of the allies by agreeing to supply allied nations with war materials in addition roosevelt authorized a socalled neutrality patrol which would protect the merchantmen of one nation namely britain from attack by another germany this made shipping legitimate target of attack by submarine 85 furthermore roosevelt ordered u s destroyers to report uboats then later authorized them to shoot on sight this made the u s a de facto belligerent none was the act of a disinterested neutral while all are unquestionably of assistance to britain when considering information like this as a point for or against the reader must keep in mind questions such as was this official privy to information about the u s government did he have communications with highlevel administration figures such as president roosevelt or ambassador joseph grew is this just a strongly held personal opinion or were there measures justifying this view if britain did indeed know and chose to conceal withholding this vital intelligence only ran the risk of losing american trust 86 and with it any further american aid which would be reduced after the attack in any event there is also a claim first asserted in tolands infamy that oni knew about japanese carrier movements toland cited entries from the diary of rear admiral j e meijer ranneft of the dutch navy for 2 december and 6 december ranneft attended briefings at oni on these dates according to toland ranneft wrote that he was told by oni that two japanese carriers were northwest of honolulu however the diary uses the dutch abbreviation be w meaning westerly contradicting tolands claim nor did any other persons present at the briefings report hearing tolands version in their reviews of infamy david kahn 87 and john c zimmerman 88 suggested rannefts reference was to carriers near the marshall islands toland has made other conflicting and incorrect claims about the diary during lectures at the holocaust denial organization the institute for historical review 89the diary states at 0200 61241 turner fears a sudden japanese attack on manila at 1400 the diary states everyone present on o n i i speak to director admiral wilkinson captain mac collum lt cdr kramer  they show me – on my request – the place of the 2 carriers see 2–12–41 west of honolulu i ask what the idea is of these carriers on that place the answer was perhaps in connection with japanese rapports sic on eventual american actions there is not one of ours who speaks about a possible air attack on honolulu i myself did not think of it because i believed everyone on honolulu to be 100 on the alert as everyone here on o n i there prevails a tense state of mind at o n i these diary entries are provided in dutch in the photo section in george victors the pearl harbor myth rethinking the unthinkable 90cbs correspondent edward r murrow had a dinner appointment at the white house on 7 december because of the attack he and his wife only ate with mrs roosevelt but the president asked murrow to stay afterwards as he waited outside the oval office murrow observed government and military officials entering and leaving he wrote after the war 91there was ample opportunity to observe at close range the bearing and expression of mr stimson colonel knox and secretary hull if they were not surprised by the news from pearl harbor then that group of elderly men were putting on a performance which would have excited the admiration of any experienced actor … it may be that the degree of the disaster had appalled them and that they had known for some time… but i could not believe it then and i cannot do so now there was amazement and anger written large on most of the faces 91one historian has written however that when murrow met roosevelt with william j donovan of the oss that night while the magnitude of the destruction at pearl harbor horrified the president roosevelt seemed slightly less surprised by the attack than the other men according to murrow the president told him maybe you think the attack didnt surprise us he said later i believed him and thought that he might have been asked to stay as a witness when allegations of roosevelts foreknowledge appeared after the war john gunther asked murrow about the meeting he reportedly responded that the full story would pay for his sons college education and if you think im going to give it to you youre out of your mind murrow did not write the story however before his death 91the mc collum memo  editthe mc collum memo main article mc collum memo on october 7 1940 lieutenant commander arthur h mc collum of the office of naval intelligence submitted a memo to navy captains walter s anderson and dudley knox which details eight actions which might have the effect of provoking japan into attacking the united states the memo remained classified until 1994 and contains the notable line if by these means japan could be led to commit an overt act of war so much the better sections 9 and 10 of the memo are said by gore vidal to be the smoking gun revealed in stinnetts book suggesting it was central to the high level plan to lure the japanese into an attack evidence the memo or derivative works actually reached president roosevelt senior administration officials or the highest levels of u s navy command is circumstantial at best regardless the us government followed all the recommendations of the mc collum memo and the japanese attacked the us as the mc collum memo indicated they might and no evidence has been presented that indicates roosevelt did not see it japanese intelligence  editjapanese espionage against pearl harbor involved at least two abwehr agents one of them otto kuhn was a sleeper agent living in hawaii with his family kuhn was incompetent and there is no evidence he provided information of value the other yugoslavian businessman duško popov was a double agent working for the xx committee of mi5 in august 1941 he was sent by the abwehr to the u s with an assignment list that included specific questions about military facilities in oahu including pearl harbor 92 although british security coordination introduced popov to the fbi the americans seem to have paid little attention it is possible that previous propaganda and forged or unreliable intelligence from the british contributed to j edgar hoover s dismissing popovs interest in pearl harbor as unimportant 93 there is nothing to show his assignment list was passed on to military intelligence nor was he allowed to visit hawaii popov later asserted his list was a clear warning of the attack ignored by the bungling fbi the questions in his list were rambling and general and in no way pointed to air attack on pearl harbor prange considered popovs claim overblown and argued the notorious questionnaire was a product of abwehr thoroughness another intended agent was the highly decorated former raf squadronleader frederick joseph rutland who helped the japanese navy develop aircraft carriers in the 1920s and in the 1930s was deployed as a secret agent in the us but for problems with establishing his cover in hawaii as a whisky importer rutland might have been the key japanese naval intelligence spy supporting the attack on pearl harbor in december 1941 94 furthermore the japanese did not need abwehr assistance having a consulate in hawaii which had on its staff an undercover ijn intelligence officer takeo yoshikawa 95 the consulate had reported to ijn intelligence for years and yoshikawa increased the rate of reports after his arrival sometimes called a master spy he was in fact quite young and his reports not infrequently contained errors pearl harbor base security was so lax yoshikawa had no difficulty obtaining access even taking the navys own harbor tourboat even had he not hills overlooking the harbor were perfect for observation or photography and were freely accessible gossip with taxi drivers is supposed to have been one of his sources as well some of his information and presumably other material from the consulate was handdelivered to ijn intelligence officers aboard japanese commercial vessels calling at hawaii prior to the war at least one is known to have been deliberately routed to hawaii for this purpose during the summer most however seem to have been transmitted to tokyo almost certainly via cable the usual communication method with tokyo many of those messages were intercepted and decrypted by the u s most were evaluated as routine intelligence gathering all nations do about potential opponents rather than evidence of an active attack plan none of those currently known including those decrypted after the attack when there was finally time to return to those remaining undecrypted explicitly stated anything about an attack on pearl harbor the only exception was a message sent from the hawaiian consulate on 6 december which was not decrypted until after the 7th thus making it moot with respect to u s foreknowledge no cable traffic was intercepted in hawaii until after david sarnoff of rca agreed to assist during a visit to hawaii immediately before the 7th such interception was illegal under u s law though it had been going on sub rosa in new york for some time faragos postscript 96 offers a viewpoint from rca personnel in the final analysis illegal cooperation of american cable companies changed little or nothing since radio intercept stations were picking up some of the consular traffic anyway and american intelligence failed to make optimum use of the information in any case allied intelligence  editlocally naval intelligence in hawaii had been tapping telephones at the japanese consulate before the 7th among much routine traffic was overheard a most peculiar discussion of flowers in a call to tokyo the significance of which is still publicly opaque and which was discounted in hawaii at the time but the navys tap was discovered and removed in the first week of december the local fbi field office was informed of neither the tap nor its removal the local fbi agent in charge later claimed he would have had installed one of his own had he known the navys had been disconnected throughout 1941 the u s britain and the netherlands collected considerable evidence suggesting japan was planning some new military adventure the japanese attack on the u s in december was essentially a side operation to the main japanese thrust to the south against malaya and the philippines —many more resources especially imperial army resources were devoted to these attacks as compared to pearl harbor many in the japanese military both army and navy had disagreed with admiral isoroku yamamoto s idea of attacking the u s fleet at pearl harbor when it was first proposed in early 1941 and remained reluctant after the navy approved planning and training for an attack beginning in spring 1941 and through the highest level imperial conferences in september and november which first approved it as policy allocation of resources preparation for execution and then authorized the attack the japanese focus on southeast asia was quite accurately reflected in u s intelligence assessments there were warnings of attacks against thailand the kra peninsula malaya french indochina the dutch east indies davaoweigo line the philippines even russia pearl harbor was not mentioned in fact when the final part of the 14part message also called the one oclock message crossed kramers desk he crossreferenced the time  per usual practice not the brainwave often portrayed and tried to connect the timing to a japanese convoy the thai invasion force recently detected by admiral hart in the philippines 97the u s navy was aware of the traditional planning of the imperial japanese navy for war with the u s as maintained throughout the 1930s and into the 1940s the japanese made no secret of it and in the 1930s american radio intelligence gave u s war planners considerable insight in japanese naval exercises 98 these plans presumed there would be a large decisive battle between japanese and u s battleships but this would be fought near japan after the numerical superiority of the u s pacific fleet assured by the washington naval treaty and still taken as given was whittled down by primarily night attacks by light forces such as destroyers and submarines 99 this strategy expected the japanese fleet to take a defensive posture awaiting u s attack and it was confirmed by the japanese navy staff only three weeks before pearl harbor 100 in the 1920s the decisive battle was supposed to happen near the ryukyu islands in 1940 it was expected to occur in the central pacific near the marshall islands war plan orange reflected this in its own planning for an advance across the pacific 101 yamamotos decision to shift the focus of the confrontation with the u s as far east as pearl harbor and to use his aircraft carriers to cripple the american battleships was a radical enough departure from previous doctrine to leave analysts in the dark there had been a specific claim of a plan for an attack on pearl harbor from the peruvian ambassador to japan in early 1941 the source of this intelligence was traced to the ambassadors japanese cook 102 it was treated with skepticism and properly so given the nascent state of planning for the attack at the time and the unreliability of the source since yamamoto had not yet decided to even argue for an attack on pearl harbor discounting ambassador grews report to washington in early 1941 was quite sensible later reports from a korean labor organization also seem to have been regarded as unlikely though they may have had better grounding in actual ijn actions in august 1941 british intelligence mi6 dispatched its agent duško popov code name tricycle to washington to alert the fbi about german requests for detailed intelligence about defenses at pearl harbor indicating that the request had come from japan popov 103 further revealed that the japanese had requested detailed information about the british attack on the italian fleet at taranto for whatever reason the fbi took no action notices to japanese foreign stations – the winds code message  editthis section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed september 2009  learn how and when to remove this template messagethe  winds code  announcing the direction of new hostilities via a broadcast weather forecast remains a curious and confusing episode demonstrating the uncertain meaning inherent in most raw intelligence information and its handlingmishandling – and in this case even uncertainty about the existence of some intelligence information or of its active removal from official records especially some years after the event at most however the winds system was to be implemented only if the communications between japan and washington were cut and since this had not happened prior to the attack there was no need for it given this any talk of intercepted winds messages would appear to be specious note however in saffords testimony on this topic he states very clearly london not washington was the addressee of this message there are two problems with this evaluation first there is admiral kings endorsement of the navy court of inquiry page 344 reading in part   3 admiral kimmel was not informed of the implementation of the winds message admiral stark says he never got this information himself but it is clear that it did reach admiral starks office this together with the handling of other matters of information indicates some lack of efficiency in admiral starks organization  second there exists more documentation for the  winds execute  104 which relates an account of interception of the winds execute passing the message to oni and later his direct order from captain harper 105 not to testify in support of safford at one of the pearl harbor hearings also see rg457 srh255 archives ii college park md where oggs statements during an interview by captain irwin g newman were considerably different from tolands attributions and amplified by authors stinnett and wilford and where neither ogg or newman ever mention the winds code topic official u s war warnings  editin late november 1941 both the u s navy and army sent explicit warnings of war with japan to all pacific commands although these plainly stated the high probability of imminent war with japan and instructed recipients to be accordingly on alert for war they did not mention the likelihood of an attack on pearl harbor itself instead focusing on the far east washington forwarded none of the raw intelligence it had and little of its intelligence estimates after analysis to hawaiian commanders admiral husband e kimmel and general walter c short washington did not solicit their views about likelihood of war or hawaiian special concerns washingtons war warning messages have also been criticised by some eg the u s army pearl harbor board – dodont messages as containing conflicting and imprecise language since the army was officially responsible for the security of the pearl harbor facilities and hawaiian defense generally and so of the navys ships while in port army actions are of particular interest short reported to washington he had increased his alert level but his earlier change in meaning for those levels was not understood in washington and led to misunderstanding there about what he was really doing in addition shorts main concern was sabotage from fifth columnists expected to precede the outbreak of war for decades preceding the attack 106 which accounts for his orders that army air corps planes be parked close together near the center of the airfields there seems to have been no increased army urgency about getting its existing radar equipment properly integrated with the local command and control in the year it had been available and operational in hawaii before the attack leisurely radar training continued and the recently organized early warning center was left minimally staffed antiaircraft guns remained in a state of low readiness with ammunition in secured lockers neither army longrange bombers nor navy pbys were used effectively remaining on a peacetime maintenance and use schedule short evidently failed to understand he had the responsibility to defend the fleet 107 in shorts defense it should be noted he had training responsibilities to meet and the best patrol aircraft b17s and b24s were in demand in the philippines and britain both of which had higher priority little was done to prepare for air attack interservice rivalries between kimmel and short did not improve the situation particularly most intelligence information was sent to kimmel assuming he would relay it to short and vice versa this assumption was honored mostly in the breach hawaii did not have a purple cipher machine although by agreement at the highest levels between u s and uk cryptographic establishments four had been delivered to the british by october 1941 so hawaii remained dependent on washington for intelligence from that militarily limited source however since short had no liaison with kimmels intelligence staff he was usually left out of the loop henry clausen reported the war warnings could not be more precise because washington could not risk japan guessing the u s was reading important parts of their traffic most importantly purple as well as because neither was cleared to receive purple clausen does not answer why washington could not have said an exceptionally reliable source was involved with very strong instructions to pay attention additionally clausen claims military men of kimmel and shorts seniority and background should have understood the significance of the warnings and should have been more vigilant than they were as for instance in scouting plane flights from hawaii which were partial at best in the period just before the attack all other pacific commands took appropriate measures  citation needed for their situations like most commentators clausen ignores what the war warnings and their context explicitly warn though indistinctly against washington with more complete intelligence than any field command expected an attack anywhere on a list of possible locations pearl harbor not among them and since the japanese were already committed to thailand it seems to have been expected another major operation by them was impossible clausen like most also ignores what actions kimmel short and admiral claude c bloch commander fourteenth naval district responsible for naval facilities in hawaii actually took they took precautions against sabotage widely expected as a precursor to war and reported their preparations the hawaii commanders did not anticipate an air attack no one did so explicitly indeed the prevailing view at the time was japan could not execute two major naval operations at once so with the thailand invasion convoy known to be at sea the hawaii commanders had good reason to feel safe one major point often omitted from the debate though costello covers it thoroughly is the philippines where mac arthur unlike kimmel or short had complete access to all decrypted purple and jn25 traffic cast could provide indeed stinnet quotes whitlock to that effect 108 and was nonetheless caught unprepared and with all planes on the ground nevertheless nine hours after the pearl harbor attack caidin and blair also raise the issue although it has been argued that there was sufficient intelligence at the time to give commanders at pearl harbor a greater level of alert some factors may take on unambiguous meaning not clear at the time lost in what roberta wohlstetter in her masterful examination of the situation called noise 109 scattered amid the dross of many thousands of other intelligence bits some of which just as convincingly pointed to a japanese attack on the panama canal 86perceived threat to pearl harbor  editin 1925 gen billy mitchell published a report called winged defense revealing the vulnerability of pearl harbor to a surprise air attack mitchell predicted that such an attack would effectively neutralize the pacific fleet as part of a japanese invasion of the philippines 110two mock air attacks on pearl harbor during war games in the 1930s were judged to have been a success 111 shortly after taking office navy secretary knox wrote an overview memo which specifically noted the possibility of an attack at pearl harbor however neither observation led to formal policy recommendations to forestall such an attack admiral james o richardson who was fired by president roosevelt for complaining about the presidents order to station the pacific fleet in pearl harbor instead of its normal berthing on the u s west coast 112 blamed the president for the initial defeats in the pacific as direct real and personal 113 richardson believed stationing the fleet in pearl harbor made the ships extremely vulnerable against attack and provided a poor and unstrategic defense 114taranto attack  editthe british proved that torpedoes could be effective in their attack on the regia marina at taranto on november 11 1940 the u s navy discussed this new development as can be seen in a june 1941 memo the british attack method was not considered relevant to a torpedo attack at pearl as taranto was about 75 ft 23 m deep and pearl less than 40 ft 12 m the royal navy had used swordfish torpedo planes and their low speed was part of the reason the taranto attack succeeded the imperial japanese navy no longer had any similar planes so they had to develop other methods both hardware and delivery technique they independently developed shallow water torpedo modifications called thunder fish during the planning and training for the attack in 1941 wooden fins were added to the tail and antiroll flippers kept the torpedo upright once in the water the fins kept the torpedos nose level in the air and broke off on entering the water the flatter flight trajectory helped keep them from diving so deeply as to encounter bottom mud despite these modifications some japanese torpedoes did indeed reach the bottom and several remain unaccounted for these simple modifications were not anticipated by the usn and admiral bloch commander of the pearl harbor naval district did not push to install torpedo nets or baffles at pearl nor it seems did anyone else practical considerations also were an influence due to the shallow anchorage which continues to require regular dredging installation of torpedo nets would have severely restricted the mobility of vessels in the harbor kimmel and his staff testified regarding torpedo nets and booms  m fact xv  the decision not to install baffles appears to have been made by the navy department 115 that is in washington dc rather than in hawaii role of american carriers  editnone of the three u s pacific fleet aircraft carriers were in pearl harbor when the attack came this has been alleged by some to be evidence of advance knowledge of the attack by those in charge of their disposition the carriers were supposedly away so as to save them the most valuable ships from attack in fact the two carriers then operating with the pacific fleet enterprise and lexington were on missions to deliver fighters to wake and midway islands which were intended in part to protect the route used by planes including b17s bound for the philippines the third saratoga was in routine refit in puget sound at the bremerton shipyard at the time of the attack enterprise was about 200 mi 170 nmi 320 km west of pearl harbor heading back in fact enterprise had been scheduled to be back on december 6 but was delayed by weather a new arrival estimate put her arrival at pearl around 0700 almost an hour before the attack but she was also unable to make that schedule furthermore at the time aircraft carriers were classified as fleet scouting elements and hence relatively expendable 116 they were not capital ships the most important vessels in naval planning even as late as pearl harbor were battleships  per the mahan doctrine followed by both the u s and japanese navies at the time 117 carriers became the navys most important ships only following the attack at the time naval establishments all over the world regarded battleships not carriers as the most powerful and significant elements of naval power had the u s wanted to preserve its key assets from attack it would almost certainly have focused on protecting battleships it was the attack on pearl harbor itself that first helped vault the carrier ahead of the battleship in importance the attack demonstrated the carriers unprecedented ability to attack the enemy at a great distance with great force and surprise the u s would turn this ability against japan elimination of battleships from the pacific fleet forced the americans to rely on carriers for offensive operations american response to attack  editcloser to the moment of the attack the attacking planes were detected and tracked as they approached by an army radar installation being operated that morning as a mostly unofficial training exercise the opana point radar station operated by two enlisted men pvts lockard and elliot plotted the approaching force and their relief team plotted them returning to the carriers elliott called in the reading to the information center the call was received by pvt joseph mc donald mc donald found lt kermit a tyler the officer in charge at the barely operational warning information center at pearl harbor he informed tyler a large number of planes were coming in from the north and he had never received a call like this before tyler told mc donald it was nothing 118mc donald called back the opana radar when he reached pvt joseph lockard lockard told mc donald that the radar return was the largest that he had ever seen mc donald insisted that tyler speak directly to lockard lockard was told well dont worry about it 118 mc donald asked tyler if he should call back the plotters and warn wheeler field tyler indicated it was not necessary 118the initial radar returns were thought by the inexperienced tyler to be a flight of american bombers expected from the mainland in fact those bombers did arrive on a slightly different bearing in the middle of the attack lockard and elliot never passed on the very large size of the contact 118 additionally japanese submarines were sighted and attacked by the destroyer ward outside the harbor entrance a few hours before the attack commenced and at least one was sunk—all before the planes began launching this might have provided enough notice to disperse aircraft and fly off reconnaissance except yet again reactions of the duty officers were tardy it has been argued that failure to follow up on df bearings saved enterprise if she had been correctly directed she might have run into the six carrier japanese strike force after the attack the search for the attack force was concentrated south of pearl harbor continuing the confusion and ineffectiveness of the american response roosevelts desire for war with germany  editu s propaganda poster calling for revenge for the pearl harbor attack theorists challenging the traditional view that pearl harbor was a surprise repeatedly note that roosevelt wanted though he did not say so officially the u s to intervene in the war against germany a basic understanding of the political situation of 1941 precludes any possibility the public wanted war military historian and novelist thomas fleming argues that president roosevelt himself had wished for germany or japan to strike the first blow but did not expect the united states to be hit as severely as it was in the attack on pearl harbor 113an attack by japan on the u s could not guarantee the u s would declare war on germany 119  page needed after such an attack american public anger would be directed at japan not germany just as happened the tripartite pact germany italy japan called for each to aid another in defense japan could not reasonably claim america had attacked japan if she struck first 120 for instance germany had been at war with the uk since 1939 and with the ussr since june 1941 without japanese assistance there had been a serious if lowlevel naval war going on in the atlantic between germany and the u s since summer of 1941 as well 121 nevertheless it was only hitlers declaration of war on 11 december unforced by treaty that brought the u s into the european war clausen and lees pearl harbor final judgement reproduces a purple message dated 29 november 1941 from the japanese ambassador in berlin to tokyo a closing paragraph reads  he ribbentrop also said that if japan were to go to war with america germany would of course join in immediately and hitlers intention was that there should be absolutely no question of germany making a separate peace with england  122 according to david irving churchill having full access to purple traffic was well aware of this message noting it in red ink 123 while theorists challenging the conventional view that the attack was a surprise treat this as a guarantee to join after japans attack it can as easily be taken as a guarantee to come to japans aid as germany had done for italy in libya release of information – delays and problems with declassification  editconflicting stories regarding foia  freedom of information act requests for the source materials used eg sheet number 94644 or materials available at the national archives are also common among the debate however much information has been said to have been automatically destroyed under a destruction of classified information policy during the war itself various authors have nevertheless continued to bring classified pearl harbor materials to light via foia for instance sheet no 94644 derives from its reference in the foiareleased japanese navy movement reports of station h in november 1941 entries for 28 november 1941 have several more items of interest each being a movement code message indicating ship movements or movement orders with specific details given by associated sheet numbers examples are sheet no 94069 has information on kasuga maru – this being handwritten  kasuga maru was later converted to cve taiyo  sheet no 94630 is associated with ijn oiler shiriya detailed to the midway neutralization force with destroyers ushio and sazanami not the kido butai  124 and finally for sheet no 94644 there is another handwritten remark faf using akagi xtmr first air fleet using akagi s transmitter it is known that the movement reports were largely readable at the time 125these three documents sheet numbers 94069 94630 and 94644 are examples of materials which yet even after decades and numerous specific foia requests have not been declassified fully and made available to the public sheet number 94644 for example noted as coming from akagi s transmitter and as being a movement code report would have likely contained a reported position 126another issue in the debate is the fact neither admiral kimmel nor general short ever faced court martial it is alleged this was to avoid disclosing information showing the u s had advanced knowledge of the attack when asked will historians know more later  kimmel replied   ill tell you what i believe i think that most of the incriminating records have been destroyed  i doubt if the truth will ever emerge  127 from vice admiral libby i will go to my grave convinced that fdr ordered pearl harbor to let happen he must have known 128 it is equally likely this was done to avoid disclosing the fact that japanese codes were being read given that there was a war on unreleased classified information  editpart of the controversy of the debate centers on the state of documents pertaining to the attack there are some related to pearl harbor which have not been made public some may no longer exist as many documents were destroyed early during the war due to fears of an impending japanese invasion of hawaii still others are partial and mutilated 129 a purported transcript of a conversation between roosevelt and churchill in late november 1941 was analyzed and determined to be fake 130 there are claims about these conversations much of this is based on fictional documents often cited as roll t175 at the national archives there is no roll t175 nara does not use that terminology 131 other information that is still currently classified includes key reports in churchills records including the prem 3 file in the uks public records office which contains churchills most secret wartime intelligence briefs in it the 252 group dealing with the japanese situation in 1941 is open save for the omission of section 5 dealing with events from november 1941 through march 1942 and is marked with official finality
