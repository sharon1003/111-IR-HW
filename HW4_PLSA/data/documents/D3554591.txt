overview asthma is a chronic lung disorder that causes swelling and inflammation in the lungs according to the national heart lung and blood institute asthma affects more than 25 million people in the united states or about 8 percent of the population seven million of them are children asthma is common in childhood but you can develop it at any point in your life it’s not uncommon for people over the age of 50 to be diagnosed with this lung disorder childhood asthma and adultonset asthma have the same symptoms and both have similar treatments however children with asthma face different challenges many cases of adultonset asthma are triggered by allergies allergens are substances that can cause an immune reaction in people who are sensitive to them children with allergies may not experience asthma from exposure to allergens when they are younger yet over time their bodies can change and react differently this can lead to adultonset asthma according to the american lung association of the estimated 7 million children in the united states with asthma more than 4 million experience an asthma attack each year asthma is the third leading cause of hospitalizations of american children age 15 and younger fortunately asthmarelated deaths in children are quite rare symptoms symptoms of childhood and adultonset asthma asthma causes inflammation and narrowing in the airways narrowed airways cause chest tightness and difficulty breathing symptoms of childhood and adultonset asthma are the same and includewheezingcoughingcongestionchest painincreased mucus secretion in the airwayspressure in the chestshortness of breath after physical activitydifficulty sleepingdelayed recovery from a respiratory infection such as a flu or cold if you suspect your child’s symptoms are the result of asthma make an appointment with their doctor untreated childhood asthma may have lasting impacts for example children with untreated asthma may have increased shortness of breath during exercise which may discourage them from being physically active people with asthma can and should be active and many athletes with asthma are able to have successful careers similarities what do the two types have in common exact causes of asthma can be difficult to pinpoint allergies and triggers in the environment can cause asthma symptoms and an asthma flareup and genetics can also play a role but the exact reasons why people develop asthma remain unclear childhood asthma and adultonset asthma share many of the same triggers for all people with asthma exposure to one of the following triggers may cause an asthma attack though different people have different triggerssmokemold and mildewair pollutionfeather beddingdust mitescockroachesanimal dander or salivarespiratory infections or coldscold temperaturesdry airemotional stress or excitementexercise differences what are the differences children children diagnosed with asthma are more likely to have intermittent symptoms though some children have daily symptoms allergens can set off an asthma attack children are typically more sensitive to allergens and more prone to an asthma attack because their bodies are still developing children diagnosed with asthma may find that their asthma symptoms almost completely disappear or are less severe during puberty but they may recur later in life the american lung association also states that secondhand smoke is particularly dangerous for children an estimated 400000 to 1 million children with asthma have their condition worsened by secondhand smoke the centers for disease control and prevention cdc state that children with asthma are more likely to have routine office emergency and urgent care visits than adults with asthma adults with adults symptoms are typically persistent daily treatment is often required in order to keep asthma symptoms and flareups under control according to the asthma and allergy foundation of america at least 30 percent of adult asthma cases are triggered by allergies among adults who develop asthma women are more likely than men to develop it after age 20 and obesity increases the risk of developing it death resulting from an asthma attack is rare and mainly occurs in adults over the age of 65 according to the cdc treatment and prevention treatments and prevention there are quickrelief and longterm control medications for both children and adults with asthma quickrelief medications are designed to ease symptoms caused by an asthma attack or flareup longterm control medications are designed to ease inflammation and swelling for longer periods of time in order to prevent both an asthma attack and the longterm airway damage caused by uncontrolled asthma longterm control medications are typically taken daily for months or even years most children and adults with asthma use a combination of these medicines to treat their asthma create an asthma action plan both adults and children need to create an asthma action plan to outline what type of medicine they should take and when it will also provide details for what to do when a person’s asthma is dangerously out of control these instructions will help you your child friends and relatives know when it’s time to change treatments or seek emergency care to make this plan discuss your treatment options with your
