perinatal health status indicators  low birth weight low birth weightcurrent tab narrative graphs data narrative infants born at low birth weight less than 2500 grams or 55 pounds and especially very low birth weight less than 1500 grams or 325 pounds are more likely than infants of normal birth weight to die in the first year of life and to experience longrange physical and developmental health problems the majority of very low birth weight infants are born prematurely whereas those born at moderately low birth weight include a mix of prematurity as well as fetal growth restriction which may be related to factors such as maternal hypertension tobacco smoke exposure or inadequate weight gain during pregnancy 1according to preliminary data for 2012 799 percent of infants were born at low birth weight including 142 percent who were born at very low birth weight after steady increases rates of low and very low birth weight peaked in 2006 at 826 and 149 percent respectively and have declined only slightly since then reasons for the increase in low birth weight may mirror those behind increases in prematurity including increases in obstetric interventions maternal age and fertility treatments 2 a rise in multiple births which increase with maternal age and fertility treatments and are at high risk of low birth weight has strongly influenced the rise in low birth weight however rates of low birth weight have also increased for singleton births 3infants born to nonhispanic black women have the highest rates of low and very low birth weight 1318 and 294 percent respectively levels that are about two or more times greater than for infants born to women of other race and ethnic groups for example low and very low birth weight rates among nonhispanic whites were 697 and 113 percent respectively given their heightened risk of death the large disparity in very low birth weight is a major contributor to the mortality gap between nonhispanic black and white infants 4 in 2009 231 percent of very low birth weight infants died in the first year of life compared to 53 percent of all low birth weight infants and 02 percent of normal birth weight infants 51 march of dimes low birth weight accessed 040813 ↑2 martin ja hamilton be sutton pd ventura sj et al births final data for 2006 national vital statistics reports vol 57 no 7 hyattsville md national center for health statistics 2009 ↑3 martin ja hamilton be sutton pd ventura sj et al births final data for 2006 national vital statistics reports vol 57 no 7 hyattsville md national center for health statistics 2009 ↑4 wise ph the anatomy of a disparity in infant mortality annu rev public health 20032434162 ↑5 mathews tj mac dorman mf infant mortality statistics from the 2009 period linked birthinfant death data set national vital statistics reports vol 61 no 8 hyattsville md national center for health statistics 2013 ↑back to top graphs data
