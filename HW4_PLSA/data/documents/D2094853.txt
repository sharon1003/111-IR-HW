who also sits on the board of the theodore roosevelt association which honors theodore’s life and works and educates the public about him“theodore roosevelt’s wellknown exuberance for morality and righteousness was no doubt helped by the temperance he received through legal training” simon said as he accepted the award franklin d roosevelt attended columbia law school from the fall of 1904 to the spring 1907 he chose to take the new york state bar examination which he passed and began practicing the law without finishing his degree michael who received his degree 35 years before his
