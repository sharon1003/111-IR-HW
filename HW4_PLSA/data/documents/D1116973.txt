picked this book because it was about a duke and who doesnt love a book about a duke i think its the power they held in previous centuries that captivates us well this duke was just sad and disappointing he was irrational and ridiculous and lacked the largerthan life persona that one expects from dukes of historical novels in fact there was not a rational character in the whole book it
