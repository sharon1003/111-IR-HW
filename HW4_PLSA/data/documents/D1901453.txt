budget this necessitates improvements suggested by operational excellence consultants like yourselves must be simple and low cost to implement so they can be done as financing becomes available kind regardsdavid first what is operational excellence our operational excellence definition is when your operation runs brilliantly and maximum operating profits are always generated this means your company is operating optimally it’s in its most efficient and effective zone with everything going smoothly without disruption that is what you see in an operational excellence company an outstandingly well run and properly supported operation consistently generating best profits for the industry its in behind a world class business is the business process excellence that make those outcomes happen that is where lrs consultants works and does its magic—inside your business processes all companies and organisations are constructed using what their directors and managers knew about business management from the resources they had available and could afford at the time no one can say if it was the most optimal solution or even an effective solution it was a suitable approach for their purpose but it’s highly unlikely to have been the best solution overtime your business evolved and changed into what it is today still today your business design is probably not ideal and it is not optimally delivering the best productivity it is possible to do because operations and maintenance processes suffer greatly from system failures caused elsewhere in a business we do operational excellence consulting based on businesswide lifecyclelong operating risk elimination we bring benefits to companies through redesigning and rebuild their processes holistically to get the maximum possible business success for their entire operating life if you were to ask us to optimise your company’s operations and maintenance processes we would apply a holistic operational excellence design methodology out of the analysis would come the optimal business system solution for your operation we start by looking at what your operation now does and analyse its current processes and their resulting performance next we look at how the processes can be made most efficient and effective after that we review the options and redesign the processes for best business results finally we give you the new process designs containing those improvements that make the company most successful we use a robust methodology and our knowledge of iso 9001 quality systems and business management system redesigning to do all the above but we can’t do a great job for you without you and your people being involved in the work we do we need access to you your staff employees documents and records in
