this could not satisfy my requirement completely the code presented by you works like this m y t e x twithin a labelbut what i require is mytext which is now horizantally written should be rotated by 180 degrees starting from from the bottom of the label i dont know whether iam able to represent my requirement properly or not anyways if you are able to figure it out please suggest on this with regards anjan report abuse reply12 years ago by webjose if you want a label capable of vertical text or any other angle than 0 degrees then you must either create it or get it somewhere else if you are planning on creating one i recommend you start by reading about create font create font indirect create font indirect ex and draw text  basically what you need to do is create a font whose escapement angle equals the angle you want to achive then output text using that font over a device context report abuse reply12 years ago by hadireloaded hi im hadi from iran maybe this code help you to do something about this problem if you dont give good reson give me you mail then i send you a component to do this jobgood luck dear anjanintroduction this article describes how to create a custom vertical label user control in vb net working create a new windows user control change the inherited class from system windows forms user control to system windows forms control add an icon file in the project to associate with the control and set its property to embedded resource and add a class attribute toolbox bitmap get type name of class name of icon file deletecomponents  new system component model container line in the windows designer generated code and add the default size of the label for example me size  new system drawing size 24 100 override the on paint method and the text property of the control build the control and add it to your toolbox source code imports system component modeltoolbox bitmap get type vertical label varticallabelico  public class vertical

sallushan there three types of alignment you can do veritcally ie top centre bottom as in horizontal  left centre rightvbs builtin label control has a default top alignment you can use a little maths to perform vertical alignment eg  there is a text box text1 and you have placed your label1 at the left side of text box now you want to align the it with text box for vertical centre alignment label1 top  text1 top   text1 height  label1 height  2for vertical bottom alignment label1 top  text1 top  text1 height  label1 height report abuse post a reply enter your message below sign in or join us
