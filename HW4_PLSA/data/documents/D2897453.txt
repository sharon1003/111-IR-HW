canals  waterways locks uphill and downhill on a boat lock free sections heavily locked sections deepest locks tuel lane sowerby bridge w yorks rochdale canal  apx 20 ft deep opened 1996 replacing two older locks bath deep lock bath ka  apx 185 ft deep replaced two older locks for a more extensive and detailed list see martin clarks deepest canal locks in england locks  how they work sketches courtesy of tel monks dave davefhbsdemoncouk has converted them into a nice animation 68k i suggest you take a look at the animation then come back and read this page please note that the sketches and animation are incorrect in one respect in a real lock the gates open the other way toward the high water side referring to the picture and sketches visualize two bodies of water one whose surface is say 8 feet above the other visualize a tank the lock between the two bodies of water the tank extends a few feet above the higher water surface now suppose we are cruising along in our boat on the upper body of water suppose also that the water level in the tank is at the same level as we are then there is no problem in opening the door gate on our side of the tank and driving ourselves in we close the door behind us we are now floating in the closed tank now what well using an interesting contrivance a paddle one of our crew starts to let water flow out of the tank into the lower body of water sort of like emptying a bathtub as the water level in the tank goes down our boat naturally descends with it when the tank is finally drained to the same level as the lower body of water we can open the door on that side another gate and steer our boat out for going up we steer our boat into the drained lock close the gate allow water from the upper body of water to flow in when the levels match we open the upper gate and drive out now that youve gone through the explanation you can try to do it yourself using an interactive lock animation  by james pascoe just replace his word door with gate and his word sluice with paddle as long as you have not disabled java on your browser you should be able to use the animation note that this animation has the same problem as the previous animation and sketches  the gates open in the wrong direction but the basic principles are still intact a relative rarity on the canals is a set of staircase locks the upper gate of one lock is the lower gate of another a lock is filled using water from the lock immediately above it or from the other point of view a lock is drained into the lock immediately below it these locks are ordinarily manned by lockkeepers since everyone else gets hopelessly confused you can see if you get totally confused too by trying the staircase lock interactive animation from terraorg this one should work for you provided you have not disabled java script on your browser for this one the labelling is even more confusing for those used to uk canals once again the lock gates are called doors but this time the paddles are called gates once youre flummoxed by the staircase locks the same site also has a single lock simulation available another relative rarity on the canals are side ponds associated with locks the side ponds allow a full lock cycle from full to empty to full again to be done without using a whole lockfull of water this seven minute video on using lock side ponds shows how this works  photo believe to be the second lock from the bottom of the atherstone flight on the coventry canal read about how joan and pete payzant first learned how to operate a lock  nigel bromley has a detailed page on canal locks  collected thoughts on their theory very thorough coverage of locks in all their variations may be found on the wikipedia page lock water transport  locks  who does the work on the u k canal systems your crew will operate the locks yourselves perhaps with the help of crews from other boats it can be a nice social occasion youll need to drop one or two crew members on shore prior to each lock and pick them up again after passing through on river navigations in the u k eg the thames and on many european canals the locks are operated by lock keepers lockkeepers in france only require a very small tip for their services they are well known to offer items for sale homemade goats cheese eggs fruit and vegetables for another way to get boats up and down hill see lifts for an example of lock repair see photographs of stenson locks bottom gates being replaced link to main canals page send questions and comments to georgecanalscom  text and photos copyright Â© 19952012 by george pearson page last modified saturday 17oct15 530 pm edt
