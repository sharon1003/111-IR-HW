relationships with one another fall in and out of love and participate in sexual intercourse before the age of 20 adult sexuality —adult sexual behaviors are extremely varied and in most cases remain part of an adults life until death at around age 50 women experience menopause which affects their sexuality in that their ovaries no longer release eggs and their bodies no longer produce estrogen they may experience several physical changes vaginal walls become thinner and vaginal intercourse may be painful as there is less vaginal lubrication and the entrance to the vagina becomes smaller many women use estrogen replacement therapy to relieve physical and emotional side effects of menopause use of vaginal lubricants can also make vaginal intercourse easier most women are able to have pleasurable sexual intercourse and to experience orgasm for their entire lives adult men also experience some changes in their sexuality but not at such a predictable time as with menopause in women mens testicles slow testosterone production after age 25 or so erections may occur more slowly once testosterone production slows men also become less able to have another erection after an orgasm and may take up to 24 hours to achieve and sustain another erection the amount of semen released during ejaculation also decreases but men are capable of fathering a baby even when they are in their 80s and 90s some older men develop an enlarged or cancerous prostate gland if the doctors deem it necessary to remove the prostate gland a mans ability to have an erection or an orgasm is normally unaffected recently there are medications to help older men achieve and maintain erections although adult men and women go through some sexual changes as they age they do not lose their desire or their ability for sexual expression even among the very old the need for touch and intimacy remains although the desire and ability to have sexual intercourse may lessen adapted from life planning
