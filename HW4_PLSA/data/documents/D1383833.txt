spooky quark senior members1143 posts location australia posted may 29 2007were learning about cns central nerve system and the pns peripheral nerve system the other day when i was in class and we were discussing the involuntary reactions such as the knee bending when a large enough hit goes to your knee does anyone know why we have these reactions or is it some strange left over from evolution like goosebumps glider c psychol senior members3062384 posts location ukposted may 29 2007reflexes that persist to adulthood exist to prevent or limit injury other infantile reflexes like the grasping reflex seen in the feet of infants eg the babinski reflex are left over from our evolutionary history we no longer grasp with our feet and dissapear within two years if present after 2 years its considered abnormal the kneejerk and related reflexes are deep tendon reflexes essentially they protect the joints they are a way for the body to detect sudden passive extensionflexion of a joint and to engage oposing motor muscles quickly to compensate and prevent injury due to over extensionflexion the speed is due to the reflex arc which a functional unit on its own and exists at the spinal level so signals dont have to travel to the brain to elicit a reaction this saves time and also means that reflexes are entirely automatic and require no conscious inputspooky quark senior members1143 posts location australia posted may 29 2007thanks for your help glider so what part of the brain actually controls these involuntary reactions glider c psychol senior members3062384 posts location ukposted may 29 2007none the reflex arc exists at the spinal level althoough the spinal cord is still part of the cns basically the reflex arc consists of an interneuron which connects an afferent sensory nerve fibre to an efferent motor nerve fibre when an incoming afferent signal of sufficient intensity passes into the dorsal horn of the spinal cord it triggers the interneuron which passes the signal to the efferent neurons in the ventral horn of the spinal cord and down to the appropriate muscle although the afferent signal will continue up the spinal cord to the brain so we sense the contact the motor impulse will have caused the muscle to contract by the time we feel it so as far as the reflex goes the afferent impulse continuing up to the brain is irrrelvant in short the reflex arc is an autonomous functional unit existing at the spinal level that requires no input from the brain conscious or otherwiseimmortal baryon senior members641300 posts location india bangalore posted may 29 2007how does the brain sense whether the external environment is stable or not i know it uses different systems such as proprioceptors the circular canals of ears eyes etc then how this complex system work together it is interesting to study these designs created by evolution revenged baryon senior members20150 posts location england posted may 29 2007spooky said thanks for your help glider so what part of the brain actually controls these involuntary reactions the brain does control reflex activity whoever thought that it the brain doesnt have a control on reflexes is mistaken there is a vitally important golgi tendon reflex that was not mentioned this neural pathway runs to the brain and inhibits reflexes to ensure that the tensions in tendons does not become extremely high so that the tendons would snap with an upper motoneurone lesion you lose this golgi tendon reflex and it causes dramatically increased reflexes also one small point the sensoryinterneuronemotoneurone story is not quite true as it only applies for the antagnoistic muscles in a reflex the main muscle in the reflex only have a sensorymotoneurone pathway the reason that doctors test reflexes is to see whether a patient had a lower or upper motoneurone lesion basically a lower motoneurone lesion would affect the peripheral nervous system and would be shown by a weakness or loss of reflex functions in a certain part eg loss of the knee jerk reflex on the left whereas an upper motoneurone lesion is shown by a central nervous system damage eg if you had cut the entire of your spinal cord your brain has no control over your reflexes if it were true that the brain had no control over reflexes you would expect no difference in reflexes but the fact that you get dramatically increased reflexes and reversed reflexes eg babinski sign is a reversed reflexes shows that the brain is very much in control of reflexes glider c psychol senior members3062384 posts location ukposted may 30 2007no the brain modulates simple reflex action input from the brain is not necessary for the action to occur i accept that there is a range of reflex types but the op asked about the patellar reflex which along with other reflexes such as the escape reflex is a simple ie spinal reflex spinal reflexes are those in which  the sensory stimuli arise from receptors in muscles joints and skin and in which the neural circuitry responsible for the motor response in entirely contained within the the spinal cord  bold added  kandel schwarts  jessell 1991 p565 i accept that descending influences from higher cns areas modulate the reflex response the basis of diagnostic reflex testing and can also use these simple spinal circuits to generate more complex behaviours but that is not what was asked the op asked why these reflexes exist and i felt that the best response to a relatively simple question was a relatively simple answer reference kandel e r schwarts j h and jessell t m 1991 principles of neural

you are saying anyway glider c psychol senior members3062384 posts location ukposted may 31 2007no i wasnt suggesting that at all just trying to keep things simple habit from teaching you were quite right to point out that higher cns areas modulate reflex
