have a patient walk in who had a history of a runny nose and sore throat and suddenly experienced voice loss physiology medical literature has documented that voice is produced when the vocal cords vibrate and their folds separate or come together in instances where the vocal cords are not healthy it is a distinct possibility that the cords or the folds do not vibrate as well or do not close completely in these situations the quality of voice is compromised and one may experience a rough and rasping voice the vocal cords are acutely inflamed or infected which may trigger a loss of voice the cause loss of voice is a common medical condition and could well be attributed to some or more of these causes acute laryngitis if loss of voice is sudden the diagnosis is acute laryngitis when the vocal cords get inflamed and swollen due to a virus infection it leads to a medical condition connoted as acute laryngitis the swelling of the cords leads to unusual vibration of the vocal cords and the outcome is hoarseness or even a total loss of voice here is our detailed article about swollen vocal cords remedies chronic laryngitis conversely a chronic laryngitis is diagnosed when laryngitis continues for a longer period of time and lasts for more than three weeks at any point of time thus logically the symptoms tend to surface gradually over a period of time some of the common triggers which could lead toa chronic laryngitis may include exposure to smoke and chemicals in addition to acid reflux acid reflux is best defined as a medical condition wherein the acid from the stomach regurgitates or reverses to the food pipe through an incompetent two way valve smoking and alcohol smoking is known to lead to the irritation of the larynx or the ‘voice box’ as it is more commonly known this would result in a lower pitched raspy voice this could well be considered as yet another reason as to why one should quit smoking concurrently alcohol overuse is one of the causes and can lead to an abrupt loss of voice the mechanics are similar to smoking alcohol can also irritate the voice box and lead to hoarseness or loss of voice voice abuse speaking is a complex physical activity unique to humans which is an outcome of some very finely synchronized muscle groups coming together to deliver the desired outcome prolonged shouting or excessive talking at a high pitch can damage the vocal cords and hence lead to voice loss it could well be concluded that if you want your voice back after an episode of voice abuse all that you would need to do is to rest your voice and avoid talking loudly dust and chemicals one of the major occupational hazards of working in an environment wherein one is chronically exposed to dust or chemicals is loss of voice the u s department of labor closely monitors the level of exposure and issues guidelines for safe limits and handling of chemicals under the agencies of occupational health and safety administration hemorrhage hemorrhage of the vocal cords is essentially a condition best characterized by rupture of blood vessels present on the surface of the vocal cords the condition is typically triggered by voice abuse or episodes of shouting or talking in a loud voice treatment is simple and all that would be required is complete voice rest so that the hemorrhage resolves nervous system loss of voice or aphonia as it is often connoted in medical parlance can be triggered by some diverse nervous system diseases like cva cva or stroke are not uncommon and with changing lifestyle and diet patterns the issue is becoming increasingly common this is best characterized by sudden loss of blood supply to one part of the brain to further elaborate the case in point when the blood supply to the left side of the brain is cut off due to stroke the outcome is loss of speech this is because the center for speech is located in the left hemisphere of the brain concurrently studies in recent times have concluded that in nervous system conditions like stroke and myasthenia gravis the impulses and signals from the brain to the voice box are interrupted thus leading to a loss of voice paralysis the term is suggestive considering the fact that if one or both vocal cords are paralyzed the outcome is either total loss or a hoarse voice the condition is common and could be an outcome of viral infection or even due to the growth of a tumor in the region cancer larynx cancer of the larynx can be fatal if not diagnosed and treated early thus any change or loss of voice that does not respond to treatment must be evaluated for this potentially life threatening condition how to get your voice back fast and overnight although the medical fraternity advocates antibiotics and symptomatic use of anti inflammatory drugs to control and even reverse the cause home remedies continue to be the pick of options the choice could well be attributed to the fact that home remedies are relatively safer with fewer adverse effects and more importantly easier to access some of the more effective home cures for voice loss may include rest predictably the first line of treatment for voice rest would depend on reversing the cause thus considering the fact that inflammation or swelling of the vocal cords is the root cause resting the voice box would help a quicker recovery this is best ensured by resting the voice contrary to popular belief whispering can be even more harmful and the medical fraternity advocates that whispering must be avoided at all costs fluids drinking plenty of fluids is yet another
