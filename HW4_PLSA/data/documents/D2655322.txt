first country that comes to mind when people set out to identify the ethnic influences on texas food however any central texan who has ever slurped a bowl of homemade noodles in rich chicken broth or sunk their teeth into the soft yeasty cloud of a fruit kolache knows that czechs bring a delicious contribution to the texas culinary table czech immigrants began arriving in texas during the midto late nineteenth century entering through the busy port of galveston and spreading out though the rich blackland prairie that runs from just north of the houston area to just north of dallas they settled in rural areas and became farmers and craftsmen whose society revolved mostly around family life and the catholic church the czechs rich cuisine was based on roasted meats with noodles and dumplings homemade sausages potatoes and sauerkraut and baked goods such as fruit strudels and kolaches continues to be a valued part of czech family life today the kolache is the most prominent edible symbol of texas czech culture and probably the most tested pastry in all of texas kolaches are made with sweetened yeast dough formed into rolls and filled with fruit cheese or sausage before baking classic czech fillings are prune poppyseed cottage cheese and sausage though fruit fillings such as cherry peach apple and apricot have become popular as well some family recipes call for a crumb topping and others do not some germaninfluenced bakers add mashed potatoes to assure a moist dough while others swear by lard instead of vegetable shortening no true czech wedding feast would be complete without a bountiful supply of kolaches on the dessert table and the homemade variety are always a fixture at czech church functions and heritage society gatherings now that kolaches are also available in local bakeries they can be a delightful everyday treat texas monthly we gotcha kolache when groups of texas czechs around the state began to look for ways to preserve and celebrate their
