sort role of epithelial cells as an important body boundary layer separates outside of body from inside of body invagination pouchesinternal environment having interstitial fluid external environment epithelial cells face the outside of the body intracellular fluid a substance that is inside a cell extracellular fluid all the stuff that is inside the body but outside of the cells names for boundaries between intracellular compartment from extracellular compartment 2 cell membranes plasma membranes cytosol intracellular fluid interstitial fluid the extracellular fluid in the interstitial spaces plasma the liquid portion of blood lymph interstitial fluid in a lymph capillary transcellular fluid extracellular pockets of fluid found in transcellular spaces how are interstitial fluid plasma lymph  transcellular fluid related to extracellular fluid interstitial fluid is 34 of ecf plasma is 14 of ecf lymph is normally a small volume transcellular fluid is normally a very small volume extracellular fluid makes up 13 of total body fluidthe relationship between interstitial fluid  the bodys internal environment interstitial fluid is referred to as the bodys internal environment body cells live in an environment of interstitial fluid distinguish between intracellular fluid  the bodys internal environment the cardiovascular endothelium separates the blood from the interstitial fluid why is the chemical composition of interstitial fluid so critical to the normal functioning of the bodys cells it is critically important to normal cell functioning major constituents of interstitial fluid 7 na k ca cl hco3 proteins mostly negative hcompare  contrast the composition of interstitial fluid with intracellular fluid interstitial fluid has more na ca cl hco3 intracellular fluid has more k proteins hp h of interstitial fluid 740p h of intracellular fluid 720barrier that confines blood within the cardiovascular system endothelial cells why is it false to say that blood is an extracellular fluid blood is separated from interstitial fluid by a boundary layer of endothelial cells the cellular components of blood 3 red blood cells erythrocytes white blood cells leukocytes platelets thrombocytesthe noncellular components of blood plasma plasma proteins electrolytes dissolved gases nutrientswastehormonesprimary function of leukocytes immune and allergic responses of the body relative number of leukocytes  erythrocytes in normal blood there are normally 1000 times more rbc than wbcorigin of platelets thrombocytes fragments of the membranes of megakaryocytes their precursor cellsfunction of platelets coagulation and clotting of blood platelet aggregation location of hemoglobin rbcprimary roles of hemoglobin 2 carrier of o2  co2steps involved in getting o2 from alveolar air into the blood  bound to hemoglobin the high concentration of o2 in the alveolar air allow o2 g to become o2 d and cross the alveolar epithelium once in blood it can cross the plasma and cell membrane of rbc to join with the hemoglobin molecule chemical reaction for the reversible binding of o2 to hb hco3  hhb  o2 ⇋ hb o2  h2co3 ⇋ hb o2  h2o  co2list fluid spaces and boundaries that an o2 molecular would have to transverse to get from rbc to air hb molecule → intracellular fluid of rbc → cell membrane of rbc → plasma → endothelial cell layer of capillary → interstitial fluid layer betwween capillary  muscle cell → muscle cell membrane → cytosol intracellular fluid of muscle cell to metabolize hematocrit the fraction or percentage of cells in relation to plasma in blood typical values of hematocrit for men  women men 4050 women 3545how is hematocrit determined in clinic whole blood is centrifuged in a tube higher relative weight of cells cause them to separate from plasma are packed together at bottom of tube packed cell volume percentage of cells compared to plasma above is measured which components of blood can easily cross the vascular endothelium o2 co2 electrolytes k na cl hco3 which components of blood cannot easily cross the vascular endothelium larger molecules plasma proteins rbcwhy cant plasma proteins  blood cells easily cross the vascular endothelium tiny pores between vascular endothelium cells only allow very small molecules to pass thru difference between composition of plasma and interstitial fluid much higher concentration of plasma proteins in the plasma why is blood red plasma yellow interstitial fluid clear hemoglobin is bright red when oxygenated darker bluishred when deoxygenated plasma is yellow due to 57 composition of large proteins interstitial fluid is like plasma without the big proteins what are the large proteins in plasma albumin globulin fibrinogen how does fluid get into the lymph system pressure  concentration excess interstitial fluid drains into lymphatic capillaries thru large pores why is lymph  interstitial fluid essentially identical in composition lymph is simply excess interstitial fluid that sometimes also contains larger protein molecules which can pass thru the larger pores in the lymphatic capillary endothelium4 fluid compartments add up to bodys extracellular volume with fractions interstitial fluid 34 plasma 14 lymph transcellular fluid total body water composition with fractions tbw  icf 23  ecf 13examples of transcellular fluid vitreous humors of eyeball synovial fluid of joint spaces cerebrospinal fluid within cnshow would a lab obtain a sample of blood plasma draw whole blood centrifuge cells rbc wbc plaelets pack down plasma sits above how does a lab get serum whole blood is allowed to coagulate before centrifuge fibrin  clotting factors get spun down with cells serum fluid sits above difference between blood serum  blood plasma serum is plasma without fibrinogen  other clotting factors given plasma volume  hematocrit calculate blood volume remember that plasma  hematocrit  blood volume concentration amount  volume
