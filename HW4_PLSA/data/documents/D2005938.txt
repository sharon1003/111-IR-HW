century when the first norse explorers were thought to have arrived from scandinavia in 1497 italian explorer giovanni caboto john cabot discovered the rich fishing grounds in the area cabot planted the english flag on the northern cape breton shore in june of that year despite the fact that there were already 25000 native micmac indians in nova scotia at the time it was the french however who established the first permanent european settlement at port royal in 1605 under the leadership of french explorer pierre de monts french settlements throughout nova scotia as well as parts of québec new brunswick and maine together known by the micmac name acadia continued to develop throughout the 1600s in the early 1700s though the english challenged french ownership of the province england claimed that king james i had granted the province to sir william alexander back in 1621 king james named nova scotia the royal province and granted it a royal coatofarms control of the region passed back and forth between the british and french until 1713 when all of acadia was given up to the british under the treaty of utrecht for a century the frenchspeaking acadians in nova scotia prospered in their trade with the new england states while england and france continued their battle for the territory britain was outraged when some acadians refused to swear their allegiance to the british

province was a leader in international shipbuilding the lumber industry and fishing the building of a railroad to québec city opened the province to the interior of the continent economically the region was doing very well business was booming and consumers were confident but a series of accidents—some of which were related to the unpredictable weather in the nova scotia area—struck the province in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries bringing economic advancement to a screeching halt it began on 25 august 1873 when a hurricane—then called the great nova scotia cyclone—swept across cape breton island killing 500 people and destroying 1200 sailing vessels and more than 900 buildings the tragic consequences of the hurricane resulted in the implementation of a better storm warning system in nova scotia on 21 february 1891 a coal mine explosion at springhill in cumberland county killed at least 125 miners just seven years later nova scotia was hit by the great november 1898 gale the steamer portland sank off the coast of yarmouth making it one of about 3000 vessels lost between nova scotia and new jersey that day all passengers onboard were lost and

such congestion the resulting explosion completely destroyed the north end of halifax economic ups and downs canada experienced losses of over 68000 soldiers in world war i and when the war was over nova scotians faced a bleak future jobs were scarce and lowpaying and tariffs taxes on imports kept prices for consumer goods high over the course of the 1920s though canada as a whole experienced a period of rapid industrialization improvements to railways and roads enabled commercial opportunities to flourish automobiles telephones electrical appliances and other consumer goods became widely

rate in the 1920s the leaders in the field at that time were stivers falls hydroelectric plant paradise west electric light company limited and western nova scotia electric company but the good times were cut short with the onset of the great depression a period of severe economic slowdown that began in 1929 the interior of canada was hit particularly hard because the country relied so heavily on agriculture low grain prices droughts and frequent crop failures further devastated the national economy social welfare programs were rapidly expanded during the 1930s to help the poor and the unemployed throughout canada world war ii 1939–45 brought both the united states and canada out of the depression halifax became a major military port and saw heavy convoy traffic the city was also a
