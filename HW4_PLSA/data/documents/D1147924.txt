wedding planning process wedding venues are typically booked 12 years in advance while some only need a few months notice it all depends on the type of venue and your personal criteria not only does the venue determine your wedding date it also sets the scene of your special day anything can be a venue from backyards to banquet halls so be creative some questions to ask yourself before searching are you looking for venues that can accommodate a large event or a more intimate affair do you see yourself saying i do in your place of worship or with sand between your toes is your dream wedding set in a local park or museum other venue options include hotels farms restaurants mansions government buildings and inns you dont even have to have your wedding reception and wedding ceremony in the same place have the ceremony indoors with an outdoor wedding reception location or vice versa allow yourself the creativity to make your wedding as unique as you are however there are things to consider when choosing a venue set up a visit before you book pictures and reviews can only tell you so much outdoor wedding venue spaces when choosing an outdoor venue be aware of the weather at that specific time of year getting married on the beach prepare a backup plan for summer storms remind your guests to wear sandals or forego shoes altogether and wear light clothes to stay cool on the other hand if you plan on getting married in the fall or winter layers and warmer clothes are a must many states have four seasons in an hour weather which can be hard to predict especially if youre getting married away from home do proper research before making the choice to finalize a venue and keep track of the weather in the weeks leading up to your big day know that the weather will not make or break the day so dont let it stress you too much if its an outdoor wedding venue find out what isnt provided and what you will need to bring from the outside some parks have pavilions and bathrooms but nowhere to store food for the reception find out if youll need to bring chairs or tables and what will be needed for additional decorations think about the time of day that you want to be married and how that may affect lighting for photography indoor wedding spaces there are also things to consider when choosing an indoor wedding location in addition to finding out if the venue location is available on your desired date you should also look into whether or not it is a convenient location for your guests does it have the capacity to hold all of your guests is there enough parking for all guests are there enough bathrooms is it climate controlled these are all important things to note before making the final decision to book a venue taking the next step deciding on a wedding location
