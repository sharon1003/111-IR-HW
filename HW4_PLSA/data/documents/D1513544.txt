frequently asked questions â€“ licensing isnt open vpn open source and thus free the open vpn open source project is free to use if you keep to the software license agreement but the commercial open vpn access server product sold by open vpn inc is not free there are some vast differences between the two programs and while access server does use at its core the open vpn open source program it is much more than just that program what does the software license entitle me to with a license for the open vpn access server program you can unlock a certain amount of simultaneous vpn tunnel connections to your open vpn access server installation you also get access to our professional support via the support ticket system you are expected to provide your own server with the open vpn access server program installed on it or to hire a server or a cloud based virtual system like amazon aws or such with the open vpn access server program installed on it if your access server is not licensed it will only function in a sort of demonstration mode where only 2 simultaneous vpn connections are allowed to allow more a license is required please also note that having a license does not mean you can connect to one of our servers a license key is meant for an open vpn access server installation on a server you provide and manage purchasing and having a license key does not mean that you can connect to openvpnnet with your open vpn client program that is not a service we offer on openvpnnet however if you are looking for a vpn termination service where you can connect your computer to an already existing vpn server for the purposes of securing your internet traffic take a look at our offering called private tunnel instead but if you want to set up your own open vpn server based on our open vpn access server product and need more than 2 simultaneous connections then purchasing a license for open vpn access server is the way to go which licensing models are available for access server currently there are two different licensing models available there is the byol or bring your own license licensing model and the amazon aws tiered instances licensing model these are explained below byol bring your own license licensing model the byol model works on any open vpn access server except the amazon aws tiered instance type that comes with a specification of the amount of connected devices allowed with the byol model you can purchase a license key through our main website and activate it on your access server these license keys are singleactivation and lock to the system you activate it on and unlock a certain amount of simultaneous vpn connections for the duration of the license key when the license key expires the license key disappears off the server as explained below this licensing model is also available on amazon aws if you choose the byol type open vpn access server instance from the aws marketplace the instances that specifically mention the amount of connected devices do not work with the byol licensing model but are instead billed directly through amazon amazon aws tiered instances licensing model on amazon aws marketplace you can look for open vpn access server youll see a number of results one of these will simply be titled open vpn access server this marketplace image is suitable for the byol licensing system as long as you do not use autoscaling and do not change the instance type after activating a license key if you do then the virtual hardware that the license key has locked to will change and the license key may become invalid in such a case you will have to contact us through the support ticket system to request a license key reissue with this licensing model you pay for the aws instance itself and any license keys that you purchase through us and activate on your access server installation if no license key is installed the access server goes into a demonstration mode where all functions work without time limitations but it will only allow 2 simultaneous vpn connections to be established a license key unlocks more connections the other images for open vpn access server listed on aws marketplace will have an amount of connected devices specified these function using the amazon aws tiered instance licensing model and these are billed directly through the amazon systems per the stated hourly charges the costs are separated into software licensing costs and aws instance costs these are billed hourly if you launch an open vpn access server  connected devices type instance on amazon aws you will incur charges for the use of the software and charges for the use of the instance youve launched while the instance is actively running if you stop the instance you will stop incurring additional costs it is therefore possible to use such a system on demand or in other words to have an instance on cold standby ready to be launched when needed is there a trial version available yes the open vpn access server can be downloaded from our website and installed on any compatible linux operating system and during installation you may be asked for a license key but if you do not provide one it will automatically go into a sort of demonstration mode in this demonstration mode all functions are available and there is no time limit however you are limited to only 2 simultaneous active vpn tunnels to the access server this allows for testing all the functions of the access server without having to pay a license key so if you want to try out the access server install access server on your linux os and you can start testing upon request we will also grant free temporary trial license keys for a larger number of connections if you require this for your testing purposes open vpn access server is also available on amazon aws as a readytodeploy system from the aws marketplace in 3 different types one type is the byol licensing type open vpn access server instance which is known on the aws marketplace simply as open vpn access server and if installed without a license key will go into a demonstration mode with full functionality and no time limit but allows only 2 simultaneous vpn connections to be establish with the byol type no software licensing costs are added on amazon aws but you only pay for the amazon aws costs for the running instance another type are the amazon aws open vpn access server tiered instance licensing type instances which aside from amazon aws costs for running an instance also have licensing software costs which are clearly shown on the right hand side on the aws marketplace when you click on a tiered instance on the aws marketplace the third type is the open vpn access server for 5 connected devices this one is different from the others because it comes with a 7 day free trial for the licensing costs this means that for the first 7 days of running this instance type you pay only the amazon aws costs for having the instance up and running but no software licensing costs are added if after 7 days you continue using the instance software licensing costs are added amazon aws in most cases charges for the use of running an instance on their systems and this is separate from any software licensing costs so please be aware of this and understand that that component of the costs you pay on amazon aws or for that matter any cloud provider are not caused or billed by us its also important to note that if you launch a tiered instance of open vpn access server that is licensed for a number of connected devices and leave it running even if youre not using it will mean you are still incurring costs on amazon aws how are licenses counted by users devices or connections you may notice that different wording is used here and there in documentation and on the website here we aim to provide some clarification what the licensing system really counts is the amount of active vpn tunnels this means various scenarios are possible for example you can configure 1 user account on your open vpn access server and set it up so that with that same user name and password you can establish a vpn connection from multiple different devices at the same time you could set up an account andrew and a password for it and use that account on an i pad a windows computer and two macintosh computers all at the same time in such a situation if all those devices are connected at the same time youre using 4 connections on the license if your server says it is licensed for 10 then that leaves 6 connections free it also works the other way around you can have 500 user accounts on your access server but only license it for 100 connections and if 25 of those 500 users are connected then you can still connect 75 vpn tunnels with any of the 500 accounts so in other words the licensing system does not look at how many user accounts you have but how many vpn tunnel are connected at the same time so if you have 500 user accounts but you anticipate that only about 90 of them will ever be online at the same time then a license key for 100 is perfectly fine and if for example you have 10 vpn tunnel connections active on a server that is licensed for 10 then anyone trying to establish the 11th connection will be denied access and receive a message that the licensed amount has been exceeded when one of the currently connected tunnels is stopped then that opens up 1 license and the user can then log in how much does a software license cost depends on the choices you make on where to deploy and how many simultaneous connections you need and for how long you want to purchase the license key there is clear pricing information available on our software license pricing page i have a license already how to increase the amount this is possible but with some caveats if you are using the byol licensing system and have an existing license key active on your access server it is not possible to change the licensed amount on the existing license key but what you can do is purchase an additional license key and activate it on the same access server the licensing system will then simply add them up for example if you have a license key that unlocks 10 connections installed on your access server and find that you need 30 in total you can purchase a license key for 20 connections and activate it on that same access server the license key for 10 connections and the license key for 20 connections then are both active and are added up to a total of 30 connections the caveat here is that the license start date and end date of the newly purchased license key will be different for these two license keys however when you renew license keys on our website you do have the option to select both license keys and set a single future date for both of them the renewal system calculates and adjusts the costs automatically in such a case if you are using the amazon aws tiered instances licensing system then things are unfortunately not quite so easy but still possible due to the way the licensing system works on amazon aws the instance properties are very firmly tied to the amount of licensed connections at this time you cannot click a button to switch from a 10 connected devices instance to a 25 connected devices instance the solution here is to make a backup of the your existing aws instances open vpn access server configuration databases and bring up a new instance with the desired amount of connected devices and restore the backup of the configuration to that system there are some caveats if the old system was configured to function on ip basis instead of an fqdn dns address then clients that were installed on the old access server instance will continue to attempt to reach the old ip address if possible move the ip address to the new instance so that clients can find the server again but the best option is always to set up an fqdn dns address which we recommend for any access server installation with that you can simply update the dns record to point it to the ip address of the new instance and clients will then automatically find the correct instance and finally of course the old instance should be stopped to avoid continuing to incur costs on the old instance we have a migration guide that will help you to move the existing server configuration from one installation of access server to another with the configuration of the access server moved in this manner the clients will not need to be reinstalled or adjusted they will just be able to connect to the new server installation automatically where can i find the free 2 user license key that system has been cancelled in the past years ago access server would not allow any connections at all if you didnt have a license key we would then issue free 2 user license keys for trial purposes upon request we have cancelled that system and instead when you install the open vpn access server product now and do not provide a license key it will automatically allow 2 simultaneous vpn tunnel connections therefore you do not need to contact us anymore to try the product out you will very easily be able to confirm that your access server allows 2 simultaneous connections by logging in to the admin ui and looking on the right hand side at how many connections your server is licensed for it will say 2 unless you have activated a license key to change that amount why can i only make 2 connections with my aws tiered instance if you encounter the problem where an open vpn access server with x amount of connected devices is showing you that your server is only licensed for 2 connections while you launched an instance for 10 connected devices or any of the instances that should come licensed for the chosen amount but it wont allow more than 2 connections then the most likely explanation here is that you are using a security group on this instance that is blocking access to the licensing servers if that happens the open vpn access server cannot check to see if you are licensed and will fall back to its automatic builtin demonstration mode which allows all functionality without time limit but allows only 2 simultaneous vpn connections for more information see the troubleshooting page regarding amazon aws tiered instance software licensing how long do license keys last do they ever expire yes they do expire when you purchase a license key for the byol licensing system you purchase it for a certain amount of time the choices are 1 2 3 4 or 5 years at the end of that time when the license key reaches it end date and expires it will disappear off your server automatically if the last license key on your access server expires it reverts back to its demonstration mode where only 2 simultaneous connections are allowed a few weeks before the license key expires you will receive emails from our automated licensing system on the email address of your account on our main website where license keys can be purchased to remind you that the key is about to expire and to ask that you renew it if you have in the past purchased a perpetual license key then read the section below if you are having a problem with such a license key my perpetual license key does not work anymore years ago with access server version 184 and older we sold what were labeled perpetual license keys the conditions with these keys were the same as they are now with one exception when the expiration date was reached the license key would not disappear off the server by itself it would instead remain activated as long as the server was not altered when access server 185 was released we have introduced a new licensing system and stopped selling these type of license keys license keys sold now will disappear off the server when the expiration date is reached but we still honor the old perpetual license keys under the conditions they were sold under if you have upgraded your older open vpn access server program to a modern version and your perpetual license key has disappeared then downgrade your open vpn access server program back to 184 or older that type of license key only works on the older versions of open vpn access server if during your upgrade you didnt only upgrade the open vpn access server installation package but instead did an installation on a new operating system or new server or otherwise changed the hardwaresoftware properties of the system that the license key was originally activated on and your license key is expired then your license key is lost and we point out the paragraph below which applied in the past just as it does now all license keys sold for open vpn access server are singleactivation and lock to the hardware and software properties that you installed the license key on if you want to move your license key to another installation this is only ever possible when the license key is not expired we only provide support on license keys if the license key is not expired this was the case in the past and still is the case now so if you come to us with a request to move a license key from one access server to another and the license key is expired we cannot help you if the license key is not expired we will gladly help you to move the license key my license key suddenly stopped working why if youre using the amazon aws tiered instances instead of using separately purchased and activated license keys then check the troubleshooting page regarding amazon aws tiered instance software licensing in short if this licensing model doesnt work the problem is likely caused by a security group blocking access to the licensing systems if you are using license keys that you have purchased from our openvpnnet website and they have suddenly stopped functioning then check the troubleshooting page regarding open vpn access server license key issues in short if your license key used to work before but now suddenly doesnt the license key is either expired or something has altered the hardwaresoftware significantly enough to make the licensing system believe it is now running on a different system and the license key is not valid for the new configuration is less than 10 connections on a license key possible yes and no to clarify 10 connections on a license key is the minimum for the byol licensing system its important to note here that any value higher is possible but lower is not for example you can buy a license key licensed for 11 connections or 35 or 524 and so on but a value lower than 10 on an open vpn access server byol type license key is never possible so if you intend to buy a license key for 10 connections and then ask us to split it up into 2 license keys of 5 connections each that is not possible however on amazon aws it is possible to use the amazon aws tiered instances licensing system and one of the instances we offer on the aws marketplace is available for 5 connections it also comes with a 7 day free trial giving you the option to try the product out before paying software licensing costs please note that on amazon aws costs do apply for running an aws instance if i buy one license can i use it on multiple servers no a license key is a singleactivation key that locks to just one system you cant share it between servers so if you want to run 3 servers each server will need its own license key if however you have just purchased a license key and its still unactivated and youve just now realized you need separate keys and need too split this license key up so each server can have its own license key then this is possible under certain conditions the minimum size of a single license key must contain 10 licenses so if you purchase a single license key for 30 connections and you want to have it split up you can create a maximum of 3 license keys of 10 connections each we normally only consider requests to split license keys up if the license key has not already been used for activating an access server to request your license key to be split up contact us on the support ticket system can i split up my license key into smaller ones if you need to split a license key up into smaller license keys this is possible under certain conditions the minimum size of a single license key must contain 10 licenses so if you purchase a single license key for 30 connections and you want to have it split up you can create a maximum of 3 license keys of 10 connections each we normally only consider requests to split license keys up if the license key has not already been used for activating an access server to request your license key to be split up contact us on the support ticket system what is a license key reissue this is where we take an existing already activated license key and remove it from our system revoke it and replace it with a new license key that can be activated on an open vpn access server installation we call this a license key reissue and it is to help people move a license from one server to another or to resolve a problem that can occur when the hardwaresoftware combination a license key has been activated on has been altered for example when you reinstall your server or when you replace hardware on a server new mainboard new network card that sort of thing if you are using license keys that you have purchased from our openvpnnet website and they have suddenly stopped functioning then check the troubleshooting page regarding open vpn access server license key issues in short if your license key used to work before but now suddenly doesnt the license key is either expired or something has altered the hardwaresoftware significantly enough to make the licensing system believe it is now running on a different system and the license key is not valid for the new configuration we are only able to process license key reissue requests for the license keys that are valid and not expired when a license key reissue is requested we revoke the old key and issue a new one the old key will function for up to 2 weeks giving you time to migrate your settings and test your setup if you are currently working on migrating your installation from an old server to a new server if after that 2 week period the old key is left on the old server installation and is still functioning you could eventually get the problem where either the old or the new key ceases to function abruptly so ensure that at the end of that 2 week period you have either decommissioned the old server or removed the license key file from the file system of the old server if you wish to keep the old server on what is the license replacement program it refers to the same thing as the license key reissue mentioned in the section just above may i resell license keys there is currently no restriction on this although the customer is of course easily able to see the pricing information on our website just as well as you can so there may not be much of an advantage to reselling we do not have a special reselling program anyone is welcome to purchase license keys for the open vpn access server product either for themselves or another party as long as payment is done and the license agreement terms for purchasing a license key are agreed to i bought a key for my customer but he didnt pay me refund me were sorry but we are unable to offer refunds or assistance with recovery of assets based on personal or civil matters for this reason if you choose to resell license keys you are encouraged to secure payment before purchasing the product on your own personal funds if however the license key is still unactivated you can simply apply for a license key refund if it is activated then it is considered used and not eligible for refunds what is your refund policy on license keys we offer refunds on any purchased license key that has not been activated on a server and is still valid not expired to do so please contact us on our support ticket system and mention that you want to request a refund and mention the unused license key the primary holders email address and primary holders contact name as well as the order number associated with the license key upon validation of your information we will then proceed with making a refund to the original method of purchase and revoke the license key in question refunds are not given for used licenses or licenses already activated on a server this is because we assume that you are fully satisfied with the product before purchasing and applying the license key to the server for this reason you are highly encouraged to thoroughly test out the software using the fully functional demonstration mode that it automatically goes into when you do not install a license key and which allows 2 simultaneous open vpn tunnel connections before deciding to permanently purchase and activate a license key on your servers if the 2 connections in the demonstration mode are not enough you can put in a request for a temporary trial key for more connections can i cloneimagecopy my access server installation without affecting the activation state of my license key no license keys are single activation keys that lock to the hardwaresoftware combination and cannot be moved to another system if this action has already occurred and your license key is now not working anymore then your only recourse is to contact us for a license key reissue assuming that your license key is valid and not expired we can then provide you with a new key that you can use to use your license again we would like to point out however that if you are deploying your system on amazon aws and you are looking to use autoscaling or you wish to rebuild your instance regularly for security regulatory purposes then you can instead make use of the amazon tiered instances on the amazon marketplace these are launched through amazons systems and are billed directly through amazons systems as well and these can be moved copied and reinstalled just fine as they will just pick up their licensed state from amazons systems and you will be billed for each instance that you actively have running does license activation require internet access yes our activation system relies on being able to contact licensingopenvpnnet at port tcp 443 in order to complete activation however if your system is installed somewhere where internet access is not possible or not allowed then it is possible to do an offline activation this can be done by us when you contact us and request an offline activation and provide us with the necessary hardware activation file or you can do it yourself using a second access server installation that does have access to the internet and which can be provided with the necessary hardware activation file after which the resulting activated key file can be stored on the file system of the access server we intend to provide a guide on how to do this here on the website unfinished markeri cannot do an online purchase can i do it offline yes we currently accept bank transferswires for license key orders of a minimum of 100 connections we cannot accept orders smaller than this amount at this time due to the heavy transactional costs associated with an offline order for more information about offline license purchasing options please contact salesopenvpnnet directly common errors during activation and their meaning fault 9000 twistedinterneterror timeout error user timeout caused connection failure in most cases this problem is caused by an inability of the open vpn access server installation to reach the internet for an online activation please verify that internet access is possible from this access server and that the dns settings are correct verify on the command line that you can ping and reach internet addresses from the operating system that the open vpn access server is installed on check that any firewalls or security groups are not blocking access if your system is intentionally cut off from the internet or if it is not possible to resolve this problem request or perform an offline activation in rare cases this error can also show up if the license key has already been used before for activation  all license keys are singleactivation keys only in such a case request a license key reissue fault 9000 twistedinterneterror dnslookup error dns lookup failed address licensingopenvpnnet not found errno 2 name or service not known whats wrong this error is almost always due to a dns resolver misconfiguration or a countryrelated block on your dns servers please verify that internet access is possible from this access server and that the dns settings are correct verify on the command line that you can ping and reach internet addresses from the operating system that the open vpn access server is installed on check that any firewalls or security groups are not blocking access if your system is intentionally cut off from the internet or if it is not possible to resolve this problem request or perform an offline activation do you offer discounts on large purchases of license keys we currently do not have any discount program available to the general public for bulk discounts however feel free to discuss your needs with some detail as to how many licenses you need with our sales team at salesopenvpnnet and someone will get in touch with you regarding your request do you offer discounts at all yes on amazon aws for example with the amazon licensing model its possible to choose an annual payment model which offers 20 discount compared to hourly payment and with the byol licensing system if you purchase for longer than a year you get a discount as well there are different discounts for 2 3 4 and 5 years can i submit tickets even i am not the holder of a license key if for example you work for a company that does have license keys but you have your own account and do not have a license key on your account then you still have the right to support if you provide the following information when you contact us on the support ticket system then well give you support as if you were the holder of the license key we require the following information from nonprimary license holders to ensure that these individuals are in fact authorized to make changes to the account as well as to protect the privacy of our valued customers the valid license key order id  for the license key license holder name or email address if you do not have a license key at all and you do not work for an organization that has a license key then you can still contact us we do want to help prospective customers to get things configured while they are trialing the software of course but we do reserve the right to withhold certain support to users that are not actually paying customers of our open vpn access server product my colleague left i need to transfer keys to my account when this happens you should do the following register a new free account on openvpnnet contact us with the details of the license key  order idrequest to have the keys transferred to your account we will then verify the information you have given us and transfer the keys a transfer of a license key from one account to another does not affect your currently installed and activated access server installation at all this is purely an administrative change here in our licensing system and does not in any way touch the activation state of your access server i purchased some licenses on your website and would like instructions on how to connect to your vpn service can you provide me with these instructions open vpn access server is a piece of software that you install on your own server which then provides vpn services to your clients the licenses you have bought are designed to lift the restrictions on the concurrent connection counts for users connecting to your server if you do not already own a server in which you can install access server on the licenses themselves will not grant you access to any vpn services if this was not your intention and you have not yet activated the licenses you have bought please submit a refund request on our ticketing system and look at our private tunnel offering instead q24 i would like to run a failover setup for my access server do i have to pay extra for a failover license key a24 no a failover license key is issued free of charge upon request for users using our integrated failover functionality third party failover solutions are not covered under this provision and license keys will have to be purchased on our website to cover these solutions to request a failover license key please submit a ticket on our ticketing system note that existing keys cannot be applied to failover servers q25 i would like to have a load balanced setup does my current license key cover all of these servers a25 no because load balanced servers allow more concurrent users to be connected at the same time each load balanced server is licensed individually for example if you want each load balanced server in your pool to handle 25 concurrent connections and you have 4 of these servers in the pool then you would need 4 x 25  100 concurrent licenses total q26 what is the process of migrating licenses from one machine to another or for os reinstallation  hardware reconfigurations a26 in order to transfer licenses from one system configuration to another your license keys must have an active supportupgrade period this period is listed under your license area on our website then prior to your system reconfiguration submit a ticket on our ticketing system requesting that your old license key to be deactivated and a new one be reissued to you you will have approximately 1 week to complete the system reconfiguration before the old license key will stop working on your system for license keys outside of their supportupgrade periods new license keys will have to be purchased for such reconfigurations as you are no longer entitled to our license replacement program
