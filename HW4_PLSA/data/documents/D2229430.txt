american academy of pediatrics now says child passengers should stay in rearfacing seats until age 2 many parents facing their children forward too soon ann arbor mich – the american academy of pediatrics updated their guidelines for child passenger safety in april 2011 recommending children stay in rearfacing car seats until the age of two but a new report from the c s mott children’s hospital national poll on children’s health shows that many parents turn their child’s seat to face forward before their second birthday in may 2011 the c s mott children’s hospital national poll on children’s health asked parents of children 7 to 48 months old about their use of rearfacing car seats the study found that 73 percent of parents switched their child from a rearfacing car seat to a forwardfacing car seat before the age of two thirty percent of parents turned their child’s seat to face forward before their child reached one year of age“research has shown that riding in a rearfacing car seat is up to five times safer for toddlers than riding in a forwardfacing car seat” says michelle macy m d m s a clinical lecturer of emergency medicine at the university of michigan medical school “parents want to keep their children safe but they may not be aware of the safety benefits of keeping their child rearfacing beyond their child’s first birthday”rearfacing car seats can prevent serious injury to children involved in front end motor vehicle collisions macy says“when a child is sitting in a rearfacing car seat the stopping forces are spread out over their entire back the back of the car seat is a cushion for the child” macy says “however in the forwardfacing position all of the crash forces are focused on the points of the body that come into contact with the car seat straps the child’s head and limbs keep moving forward pulling against the seat”the national poll on children’s health also asked parents what sources they look to for information about when to turn their child forwardfacing most parents 72 percent refer to the car seat packaging for this information and twothirds 68 percent get this information from a doctor or nurse macy offers these tips for parents about car seats for infants and toddlers car seat instructions often say that the seat can be used forwardfacing when the child is 20 pounds however this does not mean the car seat should be used in the forwardfacing position if the child is still under the height and weight limits to continue riding rearfacing most children will outgrow a rearfacing infant carrier style seat well before their first birthday but that doesn’t mean it is time to turn the baby to face forward the next step is to get a larger convertible car seat that can be used both rearfacing and forwardfacing• newborns who weigh at least five pounds can start out using a convertible car seat in the rearfacing position if money is tight parents should consider forgoing an infant carrier for a convertible car seat that their child can use from birth into the preschool years contact a local car seat inspection station to make sure your child safety seat is being used properly visit seatcheckorg and enter
