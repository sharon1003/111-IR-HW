emerald city winter preview get the scoop on all your favorite returning shows getting it made was a feat of magic the road to getting to see the yellow brick road was packed with more obstacles than dorothy couldve ever imagined way back in 2014 nbc was ready to put 10 episodes of the series on air in 2015 but after a dispute with its leaders matthew arnold  siberia and josh freidman  terminator the sarah connor chronicles things fell apart and the entire project was scrapped before it even went into production nbc brought it back in 2015 though bringing on a new team including executive producer shaun cassidy showrunner david schulner  desperate housewives and tarsem singh  t he cell the fall as director singh mandated he shoot all the episodes as opposed to being split among multiple directors as most shows are like a 10hour movie and that all 10 episode scripts be done in advance even after that scripts were rewritten as actors and locations were chosen with so much invested there may be many fingers crossed at nbc in hopes that this supernatural story could perhaps be its next grimm which is concluding this season vincent donofrio as the wizard roxy sternberg as elizabeth susanli ong as isabel emerald city its breathtakingly beautiful calling emerald city ambitious is a bit like calling a tornado a rain storm singh aimed to use as little cgi as possible to capture the original magic in part through the use of soaring fanciful scenery that meant shooting on locations that required going to half of europe — including a remote national park in croatia 15th century castles in hungary and the park güell in barcelona it looks as grand and cinematic as it sounds singh is known for his elaborate gorgeous visuals and emerald city continues that reputation landscape shots make the series feel otherworldly interior shots inside castles and temples sing with vibrancy and ruthless attention to detail all the main players  and their motives  are different than you remember for starters dorothy  adria arjona is hispanic  and shes no sweet canaryvoiced lady shes an ass kicker part of the fun in watching the series is meeting the new iterations of the characters you know so i wont spoil it all here but suffice it to say toto isnt a harmless little lap dog the scarecrow is a rugged handsome man left for dead without any recollection of who he is and the tin man is fully human when we meet him all these people are in the beginning at least mortals who become helped by and victim to the magic that rules oz  magic that the wizard  vincent donofrio  is working to eradicate and thereby starting a war forget the old notion of everyone skipping merrily down the yellow brick road which here is lined with saffroncolored opium poppy pollen by the way these people are out for revenge and theyre willing to kill to get their way oliver jackson cohen as lucas adria arjona as dorothy emerald city its not for kids emerald city is about as close to an hbo epic saga as youve seen on network tv with sensual sex scenes and occasionally gory violence were talking throats being slit shootings yes there are guns in oz  more on that later and quite a bit of blood that aside emerald city might be so adult  not in the boom chicka wow wow sense but in the difficult emotions and contrasting philosophical theories sense  that the action and motivations of the characters could be a snooze to youngsters dont hold your breath for slippers cause they aint there they werent in the original story either by the way the silver shoes dorothy coopts were changed to red in the film to better highlight the new color technology at the time dorothy does get a fabulous pair of gloves from the witch she accidentally kills though and those give her powers modern themes including political commentary are everapparent schulner the producer has noted how baums books bear the feminist influences of his mother  one of the first suffragettes baums second book in fact has an army of women marching on emerald city in protest of being ruled by men and you can certainly see a theme of female empowerment present in this adaptation the centuriesold tugofwar between science and religion couldnt be more overt its a commentary as loud as the suffering of the poor and working class while people in power play puppet master with their fates then theres tip  jordan loughran  a character not very well known to casual wizard of oz fans wholl come to play a big role and be a moving meditation on the complexities of gender identity and compassion for transgender individuals guns work their way into the story too illustrating how they upset the natural order and cause untold destruction and its hard not to see the battle initiated by the portly wizard as anything but the result of his own insecurities fear and actual powerlessness  a damning and timely rebuke of ahem some modernday leaders it ends with a big twist by the middle of the 10 episodes so much has happened youll surely be wondering if the wicked witch will melt into a puddle if her and her crew ever get what they wanted from the wizard or if dorothy ever makes it home very little of what you think youll expect to see becomes relevant by the end of the first episodes although yes dorothy does land back in kansas only when she does she has unknowingly unearthed way more trouble than she ever could have imagined — and shell be haunted by someone who presents a very compelling reason for her to go back emerald city debuts friday jan 6 at 98 c on nbc tags winter tv nbc
