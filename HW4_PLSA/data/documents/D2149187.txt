have gotten engaged and as she and hiro are the last remaining members of their family she wants him to give her away at the wedding which he accepts ando learning of this reminds hiro that hiro is dying and may not be alive for the wedding which is over a year away and pushes him to tell kimiko the truth about his illness hiro gets a call from a former yamagato accountant named tadashi on the dial a hero line and learns the man is about to jump off the roof and commit suicide on the roof tadashi explains why hes about to kill himself and although hiro offers to fix things tadashi commits suicide hiro time travels to the past and apparently fixes things but tadashi jumps again having made the same mistake at another time after 47 tries hiro visits tadashi on the roof one last time and simply talks to him this time he realizes tadashi hated his job and purposely got himself fired and tells him too use the opportunity to find a job he likes hiro tells tadashi to cherish the life he has and admits to him his own terminal illness and says not to keep his unhappiness a secret from his family promising to always be tadashis friend hiro successfully talks him off the roof and prevents him from jumping after leaving the roof hiro decides to take his own advice and tells kimiko the truth about his illness kimiko starts crying and embraces him when one of his headaches hits and he seemingly freezes in time for a moment hiro unfreezes and suddenly teleports away to peter petrelli s apartment where he collapses  hysterical blindness  in  tabula rasa  once in the hospital he reveals he is suffering from a brain tumor while peter tracks down healer jeremy greer in order to save his life hiro helps emma coolidge to come to terms with her own ability following this he is reminded of charlie and resolves to try and save her again he later teleports three years back in time to the burnt toast diner seeing charlie through the window in  once upon a time in texas  hiro teleports to the day of charlies death and resolves to save her he first steals some clothes as he teleported to midland in just his hospital gown he encounters a young boy and tells him about his love for charlie and the brain man sylar the two encounter sylar outside the diner and inside hiro witnesses sylar interact with charlie detecting her blood clot and claiming he can fix it hiro then encounters samuel teleported from the future by his dying friend arnold who possessed the same powers as hiro who warns him that unlike him fixing ando and kimikos relationship meddling with things at this point in time is dangerous due to how many peoples fates converged here hiro realizing sylar is about to attack charlie freezes time and stops sylar just in time he removes sylar on a dolly as he still cant control his teleportation and puts him in a bus compartment hiro then realizes that if he never goes back in time he will never fall in love with charlie so he sends his past self back in time telling him that his job is to save the waitress and that the cheerleader will be fine his past self teleports away and is in the picture of charlies birthday party keeping that part of history on track upon a reminder by samuel hiro introducing himself as future hiro informs past ando of what past hiro has done and convinces him to stay as his past self never informed ando of where he was disappearing of to this time hiro then visits charlie who remembers him and he tries to get her to start on the world tour she always wanted to go on and she agrees however her blood clot starts to rupture into a fatal aneurism and hiro becomes desperate to save her again he remembers sylar said he could fix the clot and rushes to the bus station in odessa where he encounters a free and angry sylar he evades him by repeatedly stopping time and moving around but due to his condition this tires him out and gives him a headache however he succeeds in convincing sylar by promising to reveal his personal future at the diner sylar telekinetically removes charlies blood clot through her eye and saves her hiro keeps up his end of the deal telling sylar he will become a powerful villain who many people will gather to kill and he will die alone and unmissed hiro then freezes time and returns sylar to the odessa bus station via motor scooter at the diner charlie is angry with hiro for saving her and not everyone who sylar kills and runs off hiro later chats with noah bennet about love and is relieved when charlie returns and apologizes for her actions and admits she loves him he follows her outside and finds her gone and samuel waiting for him samuel tells him that charlie is at his carnival in the present and if hiro wants to see her again he has to take control of his powers and transport them there hiro realizes samuel is evil and grabs him in anger before managing to teleport them to samuels carnival in the present this causes samuel to remark that hiro is finally regaining control over his powers hiro searches for charlie and finds her nametag outside a dead arnolds trailer and samuel reveals he had arnold trap her somewhere in time and the only way hell tell hiro where to look is if he does what samuel wants hiro reluctantly agrees and samuel tells him he made a mistake eight weeks before in  brothers keeper  samuel tells hiro he needs to go back in time eight weeks and retrieve a film from mohinder suresh hiro offers to find him in the present as hes not sure about his ability to time travel but samuel tells him it has to be eight weeks before and that if he wants to see charlie again hell do it hiro exercising control over his time travel and teleportation powers for the first time since got them back teleports to mohinder sureshs hotel room eight weeks in the past but his control is not perfect and he arrives ten minutes too late and finds mohinder dead he tries again and gets it right on the second try arriving as mohinder drops a lit match into a wastebasket with the film although doing so gives him a minor nosebleed hiro freezes time exchanges the film for another one and puts a kevlar vest on mohinder to protect him from samuel after the fake film is burned and samuel believes he killed mohinder hiro reveals himself to mohinder and tells him hes from the future and explains how he knew what was going to happen to mohinder hiro tells mohinder to disappear for eight weeks so samuel will believe him dead and he can get charlie back mohinder refuses so hiro freezes time and teleports him away displaying control of teleportation outside of time travel for the first time he traps him in a mental institution in florida so hell be out of the way and then returns to the present where he gives samuel the film and demands charlie samuel says he will give her to him later before walking away in  thanksgiving  hiro still demands charlie back but samuel refuses to give up the only leverage he has over hiro lydia offers to help and after reading hiro and seeing his desires she has him take her back in time eight weeks to witness josephs death hiro is reluctant but does so although he indicates lydia was responsible for the time travel the two witness samuel murder joseph and desperately try to teleport back before samuel finds them with lydias help hiro manages to return the two to the present but a suspicious samuel figures out the truth he tries to claim edgar killed joseph but hiro refuses to back up edgars claim that samuel did it due to charlie samuel goes to kill edgar but hiro freezes time and helps edgar get away instead later in retaliation and in order to keep hiro in the carnival samuel has damien try to erase hiros mind but instead it just addles his brains causing him to start to think he is fictional characters and teleport away to save watson in  upon this rock  hiro teleports to japan where he stops a purse snatcher but uses various fictional references in regards to himself and everyone around him looking for his sidekick sancho ponza he is arrested and taken to ando at yamagato as the police found andos business card on him ando reveals hiro has been missing for six weeks and has the cops let him go although he is confused by hiros repeated calling him of sancho and insisting that they must save watson at arkham in the land of the swamp dragons ando thinks that hiros brain tumor is causing this but uses hiros comics to decipher that hiro is referring to him as his sidekick and when he mentions curt connors that the land of the swamp dragons alligators is florida and that arkham refers to an asylum although ando is unable to figure out what he means by watson ando learns that in florida there is an asylum on arkham road and realizes hiro must want to go there hiro confirms this and claims ando is the best sidekick he knows ando gives an ect to fix hiros mind in  close to you  hiro has ando check him into the asylum in order to infiltrate it as hes led down a hallway hiro points out watsons room to ando who checks and realizes who hes talking about ando later visits hiro and when hiro reveals that the drugs that are being used on mohinder are preventing his use of superstrength ando switches mohinders pills with aspirin but accidentally swallows mohinders pills and falls into a druginduced stupor hiro hides ando in a closet and later that night wakes up mohinder who now no longer under the influence of the hospitals drugs easily breaks free of his straitjacket and cell hiro then leads the confused and angry mohinder to ando who they wheel to an outside door but are confronted by orderlies who hiro refers to as stormtroopers ando snaps out of his daze and blasts the door open allowing the three to escape into a swamp while the orderlies are distracted mohinder realizes that they cant outrun the orderlies and their dogs and wants hiro to teleport them to safety but in hiros addled state he is unable to mohinder suggests a reluctant ando use his power like electroshock therapy and try to shock hiro back to normal and ando tries andos attempt works and hiro is restored to normal hiro immediately teleports himself mohinder and ando away to noah bennets apartment getting away seconds before the dogs and orderlies find the spot the three had been hiding in hiro teleporting into the apartment interrupts noah and lauren gilmore kissing and hiro asks for their help in passfail hiro is starting to feel worse and collapses in noah bennets apartment hiro is rushed to the hospital where he is now dying from his brain tumor the doctors start to operate on him to attempt to remove the tumor and save him while hiro ends up in a hallucination where he is on trial for his acts of tampering with time during redemption adam monroe is the prosecutor kaito is the judge and ando is the defense attorney young ando kimiko and sylar are brought in as witnesses for the prosecution and used against him and hiro testifies for himself and is found guilty while being led toward the light he asks kaito for a chance to redeem himself and is given it hiro swordfights adam and kills him with the real andos encouragement while in the real world he crashes on the operating table hiros mother ishi appears to him and in his mind heals him of his tumor reviving him in the real world where the doctors successfully remove the tumor later hiro chats with ando now cured in  brave new world  while testing out his renewed powers a nurse comes in and gives him a battered origami swan hiro realizes its from charlie and goes to her room to find her an old dying woman charlie explains that arnold teleported her to milwaukee on january 26 1944 and she started a new life and a family there hiro initially wants to travel to that date and return her to her own time but charlie convinces him not to as she has lived a good life which will never exist if he interferes with charlie safe hiro finds himself purposeless until ando reminds him of samuel sullivan and hiro teleports the two to the carnival in central park after saying a final goodbye to charlie there claire asks hiro to teleport dozens of specials away from the carnival to strip samuel of his powers hiro agrees to try telling everyone to hold hands but is unsure he can do it until ando offers to supercharge him with ando supercharging him hiro successfully teleports everyone away stripping samuel of his immense powers and allowing peter to defeat him hiro and ando later return to the carnival and witness claire jumping from the ferris wheel and exposing her powers to the world heroes reborn  editin brave new world tommy owns a copy of 9th wonders issue 31 the cover of which features ando and hiro at sams comics in under the mask in the lobby of yamagato tower harris disarms miko and recognizes that her sword belongs to hiro nakamura when noah forces norris to show him security footage of himself at the hospital on june 13 he sees that time keeps skipping back and forth in one room he was in he assumes that the temporal anomaly was caused by hiro when noah tells quentin what he saw in the footage quentin comes to the same conclusion in the lions den noah bennet asks erica kravid about the true status of hiro nakamura erica claims that he died at the odessa peace summit on june 13 2014 noah however does not believe her in game over noah eventually gets harris to lead him to a facility where hiro is trapped in a video game noah and ren learn that miko otomo can only release hiro by sacrificing herself hiro is eventually rescued by miko using the kensei sword as a key hiro emerges from the video game in time to freeze time around noah and save his life as hes about to be shot hiro greets noah who asks hiro to take him back to june 13 2014 to change history hiro is reluctant but decides that erica kravid used him to bend time to her own purposes when she imprisoned him so he agrees hiro teleports away with noah asking him not to step on any butterflies at the odessa summit hiro and noah appear and walk towards the building in june 13  part 1 hiros past self is seen as ceo of yamagato industries having not time traveled in years hiro refuses to aid erica kravids effort to send supplies to the future and the man sent to convince him traps him in evernow which allows erica to channel hiros power for her own purposes hiro is reported dead in the bombing to the mans shock after the future hiro brings them back to the summit noah explains the bombing to him after noah learns from angela petrelli that claire is in the hospital hiro sends noah to save claire while he stops the bomb hiro tells noah that this time you will save the cheerleader while he stops the bomb referring to his future selfs save the cheerleader save the world message hiro rescues mohinder suresh from harris and takes on two harris who are armed with bomb vests while mohinder chases another one armed with two swords hiro faces off with the clones who tell him he cant defeat them on his own stating that he can but he needs to know what will happen if he does hiro freezes time and teleports away appearing several times just feet away from the one before finally hiro sadly states too many butterflies and teleports away unfreezing time returning to noah just after he says goodbye to a dead claire hiro informs him that its impossible to change the bombing as there are too many variables and any attempt to change the future will result in a worse one as he discovered when he tried hiro and noah attempt to return to their time but are stopped when phoebe frady unleashes a massive cloud of darkness that drains hiros powers shortly afterwards harris bombs the summit and hiro and noah stare at the rising smoke cloud in the distance in horror returning to angela and claires children hiro insists that they cant change claires death or the bombing as its fate and even he cant change fate angela concurs with this and tells them about the future apocalypse she foresaw and that one or both of claires children hold the key to saving the world noah realizes that the safest place for them is in the past where they can grow up and gain their powers while erica will be looking for toddlers in the future not teenagers hiro reluctantly agrees to take the children nathan and malina back to 1999 with angela and tells noah he will return shortly and not to change anything else its shown that hiro left nathan with the nurse who helped him feed the baby anne clark and nathan would grow up to be teleporter tommy clark in june 13  part 2 hiro takes angela nathan and malina back to 1999 but they land in odessa rather than geneva as planned when hiro attempts to transport them to geneva he discovers his power is gone and angela realizes that nathan has power absorption abilities similar to arthur and peter he took claires power resulting in her death and has now taken hiros power angela realizes they need to keep the children apart and takes malina with her leaving hiro to raise nathan himself in the present noah tries to track down hiro with the help of molly walker so he can return noah to his own time molly is able to locate hiros power but not hiro himself arriving at a house in odessa noah finds an older hiro to his shock hiro has married nurse anne clark from the hospital and raised nathan as his own son hiro explains that nathan has his powers now and can only keep one ability at a time hiro is angry that noah tried to kill erica kravid and harris shows up to attack nathan teleports harris across the room allowing noah to kill him and noah has nathan take him to see angela after noahs return hiro guides nathan through returning noah to the future and spots more harris arriving hiro orders nathan to take anne and caspar to safety while he holds off harris he says goodbye to anne and gives nathan the 9th wonders comic that set hiro on his path to his destiny hoping it can help nathan do the same one day after nathan teleports away hiro draws two swords and charges the three harris for a final stand nathan attempts to return to aid hiro forcing caspar to erase his memory of all but anne to protect him leading to nathan becoming tommy clark in sundae bloody sundae tommy is finally told the truth about everything including that he has hiros powers and hiro was his stepfather without his memories tommy shows that he thinks himself a simple teleporter and is unaware of his being able to time travel or freeze time however he is able to relearn how to use these parts of his ability after its revealed to be hiros in company woman tommy takes anne to the future and she reminds him that hiro trained him all of his life to save the world even though tommy doesnt remember it anne tells tommy that hiro was always amazed by tommys powers and had stated that tommy could do much more with them than hiro ever could however anne doesnt know what hiro meant by that she also reminds tommy that according to hiro what theyre seeing is only one possible future which means he can still change it when tommy later considers going back in time to find malina anne warns him against that as hiro had always told her going into the past and changing history was a dangerous game in project reborn tommy sees several memories of his life with hiro including hiro introducing himself to baby nathan and his goodbye to tommy before apparently sacrificing himself to save tommy tommy is left emotional at seeing himself with hiro and after his escape from the eternal fortress realizes he can split himself in two with hiros powers erica kravid tells tommy that not even hiro could do that but tommy tells her hiro trained him for his whole life in using his powers and he had an eternity in the eternal fortress to practice tommy later rescues noah from being killed and shows him how seven years in the past angela petrelli determined that the only way for tommy and malina to save the world was to have a human conduit for their powers however such an action would be fatal for the conduit tommy explains that he tried to stop the h e l e a thousand times but couldnt so instead of he followed some advice hiro once gave him about time travel and changing time to follow the tinniest thread the smallest butterfly while trying to locate the key to changing events in tommys case that had led him to noah who agreed to sacrifice himself to allow his grandchildren to save the world while explaining this tommy paraphrases future hiros message of save the cheerleader save the world by telling noah save you save the world alternate futures  editanother hiro nakamura this one claiming to be from the future first appears in  collision  when he appears to peter petrelli in a subway he freezes time in order to speak with peter privately he urges peter to save the cheerleader save the world and to be the one we need but doesnt elaborate for fear of causing a rift in the spacetime continuum he also mentions that peter looks different without the scar the future hiro appears to be much more fit confident and experienced than his present self he sports a soul patch and ponytail no longer wears glasses wears a black overcoat carries a katana on his back and speaks fluent idiomaticallycorrect english future hiros fluent accent is in fact masi okas real voice deepened for dramatic effect he is also much more serious focused and calm than the currentday hiro and his sense of humor appears to be diminished the future peter petrelli speculates that it was andos death in the explosion that changed hiro he appears again in the episode  07  when he meets with present hiro and  five years gone  which tells a side story about himself future hiro also appears in the graphic novel heroes 30 – string theory in which he acts as a nightwatcher who watches over people with powers getting hunted down by normal human police officers in this issue hiro rescues a girl named sparrow and the two seem to know each other he also explains a bit what happened in the future after the bomb went off the issue ends with the final scene of 07 before  five years gone  takes place in the graphic novel series walls parts 1 and 2 hiro and peter break other people with special abilities out of a prison though hiro and peter arent able to stop time because one of the others block the ability though hiro does draw his sword in  five years gone  the scene starts again with hiro and ando meeting hiros future self he tells them how they arent supposed to be there and asks why the future hasnt changed future hiro learns that present day hiro has not had the chance to kill sylar yet he decides that he must get present hiro back to the past so that he can stop sylar but before future hiro can do so matt parkman his homeland security squad and the haitian raid the loft future hiro and ando are able to escape but present day hiro is captured future hiro begins recruiting people so that he can free present day hiro and goes off to las vegas to seek peters help ando and future hiro encounter niki who is in a relationship with peter niki tells them nothing about peter but when prompted tells them that she knows that mr bennet is in texas helping those with abilities to establish new identities and hide from the government once there future hiro asks bennet for help specifically requesting d l hawkins candice wilmer and molly walker while at first bennet doesnt want to help he agrees when he hears that they know claire is alive future hiro and ando then begin talking about what happened to ando in the future right when hiro is about to tell ando something important he is shot with a taser by matt before they are about to be captured peter comes and by utilizing hiros power is able to help them escape with peters help future hiro and ando are able to enter the building where present day hiro is being held and make it to him right after they free present day hiro future hiro tells them he will take them back to their time since present day hiro still doesnt have full control of his powers but before he can do it he is shot and killed by matt parkman before future hiro dies he gives ando isaacs incomplete comic book in an alternate future shown in  the second coming  a future version of hiro while dressed the same as the aforementioned future version has the same hairstyle as his presentday self and still wears glasses the older hiro argues with ando who attacks hiro with an energy manipulation ability in tokyo just before an unknown force destroys the city powers and abilities  edithiro possessed the power to control the spacetime continuum giving him the power to manipulate the flow of time travel through time and teleport to any location at will until arthur petrelli took it away when he traveled back to 1991 specific examples of temporal manipulation include slowing time relative to himself and rewinding time specific to certain objects a clock a train and a gun in various episodes as demonstrated by his encounters with daphne a woman with the power of enhanced speed hiro does not stop time completely hiro has shown the ability to teleport both himself and others in physical contact with himself both through space and time although stressful events and practice have helped hiro to develop his abilities hiro initially has trouble with the more complicated teleportation and time travel abilities for example when he teleported to new york city he inadvertently traveled five weeks into the future as well although he was able to travel back to the same time and place from which he left he was only able to do so when his life was in danger from a nuclear explosion later when he attempted to save charlie s life by traveling to the day before her death hiro accidentally traveled six months into the past he also inadvertently teleported to present day japan from texas just as he and charlie were about to kiss and then could not teleport back no matter how hard he tried after the incident with charlie hiros powers began weakening eventually becoming completely unusable though he is able to inadvertently reverse time for a bullet by one second saving himself and ando but unaware he did it he seeks out takezo kenseis sword in the hope that it will focus his failing powers after obtaining the sword hiro exhibits the ability to teleport other people along with himself which he uses to rescue himself and ando from an impending attack by casino guards in  parasite  though this too resulted in an inadvertent trip five years into the future after the explosion had occurred the episode  five years gone  marks his first successful use of teleportation and time travel by  the hard part  hiro has improved his skill in teleportation as he uses it twice without traveling any discernible distance through time his father attributes this to a matter of confidence rather than any effect caused by the sword in addition to his power over time hiro is skilled with a katana having been trained by his father in  its coming  and  the eclipse  hiro is mentally reverted into a tenyearold but still possesses his powers after ando teaches him how to use them again hiro shows great control over them even in his young mental state being able to stop time with ease and using it to play tricks teleport himself and others and timetravel 16 years into the past with claire bennett in  our father  hiros abilities are stolen by arthur petrelli rendering him a normal human in the episode  cold snap  hiro regains some of his ability when the son of matt parkman whom he dubs toddler touch and go touches him and turns his ability on at the moment hiro has regained the ability to stop and restart time but is still unable to teleport or travel through time in  i am sylar  hiro manages to regain more of his abilities from parkmans son allowing him to make ando unaffected by his timefreezing however problems have now arisen when hiro and ando prepare to infiltrate building 26 hiros powers falter and he instead receives a blistering headache and a nosebleed after the two rescue all of the evolved humans mohinder states that for some reason hiros body is now rejecting his powers and he cant risk freezing time again hiro does it one more time to save noah bennet from danko but it proves to be too much of a strain on him and causes him to pass out hiro appears to regain the full extent of his abilities in the fourthseason episode  orientation  after focusing on a photograph of himself ando and his sister kimiko taken at the sullivan bros carnival 14 years ago he inadvertently travels there by doing so he used both his timetraveling and teleportation abilities he seems to have little control over his power he seems to travel through time when hes thinking of something from the past as of hysterical blindness hiro has the ability to teleport back however like his ability to time travel his first teleportation seemed accidental and instinctual it took him from yamagato to peter petrellis apartment he then collapsed from presumably the strain the teleport put on him in his condition his timestopping ability if he uses it too much exhausts hiro and causes him pain as of  tabula rasa  hiro is beginning to have more control over his power an unfortunate side effect of this ability is the strain it puts on the body can cause inoperable tumors as of  once upon a time in texas  and  brothers keeper  hiro is regaining control over the other aspects of his ability but he lacks perfect control when samuel provoked him hiro managed to teleport them both to samuels carnival but later he was unsure if he could time travel eight weeks hiro managed to perform this task but it took him two tries to get it right as he said the first time took him ten minutes too late the time travel caused him to have a minor nosebleed but besides that he seemed to suffer no ill effects he later displays just teleportation teleporting mohinder to florida where he checks him into a mental hospital under a fake name in order to keep him out of sight for eight weeks in order to preserve the timeline in  thanksgiving  lydia has him take her back eight weeks into the past to see joseph sullivans death he teleports them easily but he indicates lydia was responsible for it not him but this is unclear in the past he has trouble teleporting them back due to his lack of full control and probably the stress of the situation however with lydias help he manages to bring them both back to the present in  close to you  hiro lacks the ability to properly use his powers due to his mind being messed up but once ando restores his mind hiro is instantly able to teleport at will with mohinder suresh and ando taking them both to noah bennets apartment hiro shows no trouble teleporting at will this time and takes more than one person with him something he hasnt done since before he lost his powers in  brave new world  hiro tests his powers out after his brain tumor is removed and learns that removing the brain tumor has restored full control over his powers to hiro hiro is easily able to teleport himself and ando to central park where the carnival is with no issues there hiro is asked to teleport over a dozen people away from the carnival hiro has everyone hold hands and manages to succeed in teleporting everyone thanks to ando supercharging his powers which give him the boost to his powers he needs to teleport such a large group of people in  heroes reborn  hiros powers have evolved as has his understanding of them hiro repeatedly states that he cant change fated events and attempts to do so could result in worse futures when hiro is trapped in evernow erica kravid is able to harness hiros powers to send supplies to the future when even hiro is not there to personally use the power before being trapped in the game hiro states that he hasnt time traveled in years after being rescued from evernow hiro is able to freeze time around noah bennet without even being fully out of the game he is also able to keep noah out of the freeze without touching him as he previously needed after traveling back to the odessa peace summit hiro is apparently able to change the future and then reverse the changes as he indicates that he saw what would come of his attempts to change things in project reborn erica kravid stated that hiro was unable to split himself in two though tommy clark displayed this ability while using hiros powers in the same episode tommy revealed some advice hiro gave him about changing time that the best way to do it is to search for the tinniest thread the smallest butterfly and doing so will lead to the key to changing events something hiro presumably learned on his own time travels time alterations  edithiros trips have given hiro his own unique time line which is reflected in some of isaac mendez s paintings of hiro along with the existence of an alternate future version of himself hiro has come across or induced a few time paradoxes or alterations in the series in  one giant leap  hiro travels with ando to the united states even though ando was still in japan when he had previously traveled to the future new york city when directly questioned about this by ando hiro says they are changing the future between the episodes  seven minutes to midnight  and  six months ago  hiro traveled six months into the past in texas  there he changed history again by forming a close relationship with charlie in the past this change was most noted by a picture which had originally shown only charlie at her birthday party now showing both her and hiro at one point hiro accidentally gave himself a phone call from texas to japan while trying to contact ando though he immediately hangs up after he realizes it was the hiro in japan who had answered afraid of coming into contact with his past self in seven minutes to midnight charlie said that someone had given her a japanese phrase book on her birthday in six months ago it is hiro who gives her the phrase book ironically in general the future shown in  dont look back  seems to be even more certain as changes that have been or intended to have been made futile in six months ago hiro accidentally jumps back in time six months to prevent charlie from dying only to find out that she has a blood clot in her brain and will die anyway in  unexpected  isaac received a gun from mr bennet – the same gun hiro found in isaacs apartment when he traveled forward five weeks as of  07  sylar has killed isaac in a similar manner to his original death in  string theory  it is revealed that future hiro tells peter to save the cheerleader so that the failed attempt to stop sylar from exploding might prove successful however the future has proven itself to not be entirely certain as the characters were able to stop the explosion from destroying new york city in  how to stop an exploding man  starting at the end of season 1 and through much of season 2 hiro was in 1671 feudal japan there he becomes personally entwined in the history and events surrounding the warrior takezo kensei recognizing the man is not as history portrays him hiro works to help takezo fulfill his destiny this results in hiro personally influencing many major events in  lizards  hiro impersonates takezo and uses his powers to disarm 11 bandits the battle of twelve swords and gains the gratitude and admiration of yaeko the swordsmiths daughter in  kindred  hiro forces takezo to face 90 angry ronin in order to retrieve the fire scroll fulfilling another part of takezos legend in  the line  hiro helps takezo rescue yaekos father and discovers how takezo will save japan destroying the illegal firearms that white beards army are planning to use to overthrow the emperor however hiro gives into his own desire for yaeko causing takezo to side with white beard hiro destroys the guns by himself yaeko later asserts that hiro is the person the takezo kensei legends are about and vows to spread the legends under that name to fulfill the final part of the legend cutting out his own heart he leaves yaeko behind and returns to the present in our father and dual hiro travels back in time with claire bennet sixteen years in an attempt to change the past there the two successfully change some things claire prevents her father from answering a call that would have led to her becoming the catalyst and hiro after his mother heals his mind has her transfer the catalyst to him to protect it unfortunately arthur petrelli still ends up with the catalyst as he travels back in time too and steals it and hiros powers from hiro before sending claire back to the present trapping hiro in the past hiro tries to destroy the formula in the past but only manages to rip it in half like it originally was in the present before daphne and ando rescue him before he does so and before kaito kills him in redemption hiro has regained the ability to time travel and has decided to use it to right mistakes this results in apparently minor changes to the timeline in  jump push fall  hiro after regaining his ability to time travel and accidentally 14 years stops ando from spilling a slushy on his sister kimiko returning to the present hiro discovers that instead of kimiko hating ando since that night theyve been madly in love and start to have wedding plans in acceptance in  acceptance  after a coworker commits suicide hiro goes back multiple times to change him getting fired but it just happens a different way each time hiro finally changes things by sitting down and talking to the man before he kills himself and convincing him that its not worth it in  once upon a time in texas  hiro travels back three years in order to save charlie from death at sylars hands he makes a deal with sylar to tell him about his future in exchange for sylars help in healing charlies aneurysm hiro was ready to begin a new life with charlie before samuel uses one of his family members powers to trap charlie somewhere in time which he uses in order to manipulate hiro into fixing a few of samuels indiscretions the information that hiro provides to sylar may alter the timeline further in future episodes although there was no sign of an alteration upon hiros return to the present at the end of the episode in order to keep history in line as much as possible as well hiro sends his own self back in time six months in order for him to fall in love with charlie and tell past ando to stay explaining what past hiro is doing the only change that seems to be displayed is that when sylar and matt talk at the diner he says he only tried to kill a waitress there sylar is also now worried about dying alone due to what hiro has told him and didnt kill samuel for his power and took lydias without killing later sylar also ends up repenting and turning good ultimately as a result charlie is kidnapped by samuel and arnold and sent to milwaukee on january 26 1944 where she ends up living a long life and meets up with hiro again as an old woman in the present hiro offers to head to that date and place and return her to her own time but she chooses not to as she lived a good life and has a family that would never exist if he did that in  brothers keeper  hiro manages to time travel back eight weeks to retrieve a film from mohinder suresh for samuel in order to get charlie back his attempt works on the second try he replaces the film with a fake so mohinder believes he burned the real one with the first try ten minutes too late showing him mohinders fate hiro uses the opportunity to change that as well putting a kevlar vest on mohinder protecting him from samuels attack and making it appear that he died when he really didnt he then requests mohinder disappear for eight weeks to keep the timeline on track as much as possible and allow hiro to get charlie back but mohinder refuses wanting to stop samuel so hiro teleports him to florida where he checks him into a mental hospital under a fake name so hes out of the way in the present samuel displays no knowledge of mohinders survival in the present hiro and ando rescue mohinder from the hospital after hiro even in a severely addled state remembers mohinder is there in  thanksgiving hiro and lydia teleport eight weeks into the past in order to witness josephs death they learn that samuel killed him but just observe and dont interfere in the event however lydia makes noise and while hiro and lydia manage to teleport away in the present it makes samuel suspicious of lydia leading to the expulsion of edgar from the carnival and edgar nearly being killed before hiro saves him in heroes reborn hiro had stopped using his time travel powers following the end of redemption but resumes use of them after being rescued from evernow in game over and june 13  part 1 hiro takes noah bennet back in time a year to the odessa peace summit on june 13 2014 in an attempt to stop the bombing of the summit and save claire bennet s life though hiro finds the bomber he experiments with what will happen if he tries to stop the bombing its indicated that he experienced multiple possible futures trying this as he tells noah that if he changes this event the futures that will result will be even worse hiro is unable to safely change the bombing and tells noah it is impossible to do as its fate and he cant change fate he is also unable to save claires life for the same reason instead at noahs request hiro takes claires children nathan and malina back to 1999 to protect them so they will grow up and be ready for their destiny of saving the world while also protecting them from erica kravid this is shown to not be a change to the timeline but rather something that was apparently destined to happen as noah had his memory of the day erased to protect the children from erica kravid and nathan now known as tommy clark and malina are seen before hiro travels back to the summit and then 1999 in sundae bloody sundae its revealed that hiro was partially responsible for minor changes to the timeline during his trip with noah noah altered a few things that resulted in the haitian and quentin still being alive but also turned quentin from good to evil reception  editugo networks listed hiro as one of their best heroes of all time 12 the character has had a mixed reception 13 14 15references
