articleby robert green a ny of the seemingly boundless number of managers and executives currently in the midst of a lean manufacturing initiative will likely tell you that its the best thing since sliced breada system designed specifically to reduce the manufacturing enterprise to its bare bones all the while increasing efficiency in a journey toward skyrocketing profits in fact if you dont hear the word journey youre probably not talking to someone with real lean experience indeed lean manufacturing does represent a journeyone aimed at a destination that is all but impossible to reach sound vague enough not unlike several other quality systems lean manufacturing has been around for yearsdecades evenbut still remains a mystery to many who havent been involved with such an initiative some might know that it aims at reducing waste or increasing efficiency but not as many can provide you much more than these superficial definitions leaving lean something of a cross between a program du jour and a glittering generality at least one organization however is attempting to provide the quality industryalways a fan of the objectivethe type of definition it can appreciate a standard retro lean ask u s manufacturers about the origins of lean and youll probably receive a bunch of toyotas mixed in with a few fords both answers could be considered correct more than 50 years ago toyota motor cos eiji toyoda visited a number of u s automobile manufacturing plants years later he told time magazine when i went to detroit in 1950 we were producing 40 cars a day ford was making 8000 units the gap was enormous nevertheless toyoda returned to japan determined to mimic u s automakers startling production numbers but do so more efficiently together with toyotas shigeo shingo and taiichi ohno toyoda developed a system whose objective was minimizing any consumption of resources that added no value to the finished product that system became known as the toyota production system the earliest form of lean manufacturing the meaning of lean there are nearly as many definitions of lean as there are lean practitioners and consultants nonetheless a few basic principles are common to most if not all definitions in short the aim of any lean initiative is to eliminate waste muda japanese for waste can come in many formsall of which either add nothing to the finished product or nothing for which the customer is willing to pay a few examples follow transportation any required transportation of products or parts adds nothing from the customers perspective therefore it should be minimized or eliminated its common for plant redesign or reorganization to be among the first steps in a lean effort overproduction  this occurs when a part or product is manufactured before its neededeither before a customer has ordered it or before it can begin the next process in the production system this results in a backlog of material that must be stored which adds unnecessary expense and inefficiency a truly lean enterprise isnt dependent upon speculative market forecasting for determining production runs work in progress wip can be caused by overproduction poor scheduling or long and uneven cycle times lean companies ensure that each manufacturing process takes roughly the same amount of time by adjusting the processes themselves or the resources dedicated to each additionally suppliers must be held accountable for reliable delivery of their shipments also inherent to a lean production system is the idea of continuous improvement the lean executive recognizes waste in any form as a singular enemy the fighting of which is his or her primary responsibility because every process includes some waste the elimination of all waste is an unattainable goal on the other hand lean optimists recognize that this truth means the benefits of a lean systemif diligently pursuedare inexhaustible too standard lean if theres a problem with lean its that the term is used by so many to refer to dozens of different systemsthough most share the same fundamentals in order to right the resulting confusion of this dilemma one organization has drafted a standard to define and guide the implementation of lean initiatives for those in its industry the organization is the society of automotive engineers and the document is j4000 now automotive and manufacturing companies will have a common definition of lean and a yardstick to measure their lean status as well as a methodology to compare their operations with the most successful lean operating systems explains roy trent the director of saes best manufacturing practices automotive manufacturing initiative according to trent the standard identification and measurement of best practice in implementation of lean operation sae j4000 can be used to identify and measure implementation of lean operations in manufacturing companies and may even be useful to automotive suppliers in meeting the continuous improvement program requirements in qs9000 and isots 16949 j4000 covers six lean implementation areas managementtrust people information supplierorganizationcustomer chain product and processflow it also lists 52 components that provide measurable points of reference for successful lean implementation the new standard is the result of saes ongoing best manufacturing practices survey program last year lean operation was chosen as the focus of the first ami survey after the vice presidents of manufacturing for six major automakers cited lean manufacturing as the most important success factor in the competitiveness of the auto industry for the next several years j4000 evolved from the template created for and used in the survey which evaluated operations at companies recognized as lean models donnelly corp freudenbergnok johnson controls inc lockheed martin corp raytheon co and the timken co these companies both from within and outside the automotive industry were selected based on input from automotive executives industry analysts and academics as well as independent research to assist users in interpreting and applying the standard sae has also developed sae j4001 implementation of lean operation users manual and a research report documenting examples of current best practices titled best practices in the implementation of lean operation among manufacturers this comprehensive and objective study spanned 12 months and involved lean experts from automakers and academia sae is also currently developing a number of other resources including lean assessor training and lean assessor certification to support the standard document sae j4000 is available for 59 for more information contact sae at 877 6067323 or email publicationssaeorg  sigma lean despite saes and others attempts to define and standardize lean theres a host of leanbased initiatives beginning to pop up that combine other buzzwords these include lean six sigma total lean manufacturing and the like theres no quality topic more popular than six sigma which focuses on driving defects to a nearly nonexistent level because the two systems share so many characteristics and goals a number of consultants have designed hybrid implementation and training programs offering the best of both six sigma and lean both aim to eliminate waste from the supply chain both help companies to develop robust products and processes both require the deep involvement of top executives but are also dedicated to the notion that the best solutions come from the workers and both are driven by customer requirements perhaps the greatest difference between the two is that six sigma emphasizes managements responsibility to make decisions based on quantifiable and reliable facts not educated guesses though the same could be said for lean the systems kaizen events promote open minded thinkingsometimes even from those outside the department or process under scrutinyabout how to attack the sole enemy waste leaning toward lean its undeniable that the implementation of lean production systems has saved companies millions of dollars for several decades now that being said top management should heed this warning no quality management system is onesizefitsall there are no magic bullets and lean isnt right for every enterprise most notably the principles of lean are typically only applied to manufacturing enterprises if youre interested in implementing a lean system theres no shortage of consultants from which to choose before you do so however you may want to first do some research on your own so that you know what to expect for example some consultants tell their clients that lean implementation can take between two and 10 years if you do decide to implement lean there are several things you can do to increase your chances of success prepare and motivate your employees your people will ultimately determine whether implementation is successful its important to prepare them for the new focus onif not obsession withcontinuous improvement and waste reduction as well as provide them with the training to be vital participants of such efforts communicate work diligently to share information and encourage lowlevel empowerment a pillar of any lean system those on the shop floor should be able to affect the process as it is they who are most familiar with it take risks because a critical lean technique involves tearing down and reconstructing failing or underperforming processes its important to impart an atmosphere tolerant of experimentationwhether successful or not be realistic during implementation put rigid performance goals on hold measure results not the number of completed activities remember lean aims at longterm improvements not quick fixes if the term bare bones scares you consider the implications of your primary competitor using lean to trim fat during these volatile economic times while your organization continues along the same path its currently on lean initiatives can increase ontime delivery rates reduce variation simplify scheduling improve the accuracy of market forecasts ensure quicker market response foster workplace culture transformation
