like most human infants neonatal puppies eyes upon first opening up to the world tend to have a bluish tinge to them this color generally doesnt last however and usually changes to its permanent coloration several weeks down the line it takes awhile to uncover puppies true eye colors eyes firmly shut puppies eyes arent visible right after theyre born the furry creatures start out with closed eyes and as a result no vision their eyes only begin to reveal themselves  and slowly open  once puppies are somewhere in the range of 8 to 14 days old at this time their eyes are blue and wholly uniform in color meaning there is no change from the irises to the pupils mature coloration once puppies are around 3 or 4 weeks in age their final eye color slowly starts to make its introduction dogs often have deep brown eyes so you might notice the chocolatey tones making their way through around this time however the process is a measured one and doesnt work overnight it often takes nine to 12 weeks starting from this point for a puppys eye color to settle in and stay puppies sometimes are 16 weeks in age by the time this happens however some puppies eyes do display their real colors sooner than that baby blues not all puppies eyes turn darker as they develop the majority of doggies out there have dark eyes but there are definitely some exceptions the siberian husky breed is one such example these intense sled dogs often have pale blue eyes in which case they start out blue as puppies and remain that way for life although perhaps in varying shades siberian huskies also sometimes have two eyes of differing colors  think a single blue eye and a single light yellowishbrown or brown eye apart from blue and brown possible eye colors in dogs run the gamut just as in people vision puppies eye colors arent developed when they first show themselves and the same applies to their actual vision when puppies initially open their peepers to their fascinating surroundings they cant take much in of what they see  everything still looks rather hazy puppies eyes generally start to operate like those of adults once theyre between 3 and 4 weeks old  around the same time the color starts coming into its own by naomi millburn references sacramento spca puppy development and socialization the humane society of the united states puppy behavior basics uc davis koret shelter medicine program canine  guide to raising orphan puppies purdue university college of veterinary medicine care and management of the neonate puppy about the author naomi millburn has been a freelance writer since 2011 her areas of writing expertise include arts and crafts literature linguistics traveling fashion and european and east asian cultures she holds a bachelor of arts in american literature from aoyama gakuin university in tokyo show comments
