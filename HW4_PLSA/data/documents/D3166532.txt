blog 330824331the home inspector many problems with installations of lp smart side siding by reuben saltzman october 6 2015 — 619am text sizeemail printmore lp smart side® is the new highend siding of choice here in minnesota it used to be stucco but moisture intrusion problems with stucco siding made many highend home builders start using james hardie siding in the last few years this his changed today i rarely see james hardie siding used on new homes any more builders are using lp smart side® instead for a headtohead comparison click on the following link for an indepth discussion of james hardie siding vs lp smartside which ryan carey posted on this blog over a year ago lp smart side® is a great product that i have yet to find a single failure on but i suspect ill be seeing failures soon enough because i find installation errors on nearly every home i inspect if you install lp smart side® dont make these mistakes if youre buying a home with lp smart side® or youre having it put on your own house watch out for these mistakes if youre a home inspector  well you see where im going with this check this stuff these are the most common mistakes being made by installers today missing paint without a doubt the most common installation error that i find with lp smart side® is missing paint at the cut edges the manufacturer requires all exposed surfaces to be primed and painted overdriven nails this is another common defect heres a small collage of overdriven nails the diagram below shows the appropriate repair methods for overdriven nails insufficient clearance the manufacturer requires 6 of clearance from the siding to the finished grade it seems that almost every home has one or two areas where this clearance requirement isnt met the manufacturer also requires 1 clearance to shingles this is usually done right but not always the manufacturer requires a 38 gap above windows and other similar penetrations this is rarely done a 38 gap is a big gap even when a gap is left here its usually not what the manufacturer requires improper butt joints the manufacturer requires a 316 gap at the end of each piece of siding this includes butt joints and places where the siding terminates vertically against windows doors and other fixtures a 316 gap is a pretty large gap heres what a proper 316 gap looks like insufficient kickout flashing kickout flashing is a piece of metal at a roof end that prevents water from leaking into the wall see below lp smart side® requires flashing to have a 4 upper leg this means the kickout flashing needs to be 4 high this usually isnt done joint treatments there are three options for keeping water out of the butt joints the first and second options are to have the joints caulked or have joint molding installed the third option is to have flashing at least 4 wide installed at the joints as long as the ends of the siding are factory finished and the siding is prefinished by an approved or preferred prefinisher that means no cut edges at the butt joints when fieldcut edges are present flashing at the joints is not an appropriate installation method conclusion that wraps up my list of the most common installation defects for lp smart side® again this is not a full list of defects for the full list of installation instructions and for more information on this product click here
