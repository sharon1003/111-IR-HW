best states to apply for cpa international students  candidates last updated november 14 2016 by stephanie ng 414 comments how to become a cpa for international students and candidates since most international candidates do not have a “preferred” state to practice their profession they are free to pick a state board with the most favorable cpa exam requirements this flexibility can be overwhelming with 55 states and jurisdictions to choose from how do you start which are the most popular states for international candidates cpa for international candidates states that in my opinion no longer works in your favor here are a few popular states that worked for many nonus candidates for many years but they may no longer work due to change of rules1 colorado — getting a lot more restricted colorado used to be one of the most attractive states for international candidates 150 credit hour is not necessary and members of icai and acca are automatically qualified for the cpa exam unfortunately on 9th december 2009 the state board has restricted this rule specifically the state board is no longer accepting association of chartered certified accountants acca certificates as evidence of having met educational requirement chartered accountant ca qualifications from australia canada ireland mexico and new zealand part of the u s international qualifications appraisal board iqab mra agreement is accepted but those from other jurisdiction eg india is no longer accepted sometime in early 2012 there were further restrictions applied to candidates with 3year degrees ca certificate is no longer evaluated as equivalent to a 4year accounting degree in the us in other words it will no longer work for bcom  ca holders candidates with mcom should be fine working experience there used to be an “education in lieu of experience” rule which allows you to use your education to waive the working experience requirement this is no longer valid after july 2015 details on colorado cpa exam requirement2 delaware little reason to pick this state now delaware used to be the only state that allow associate degree holder equivalent to a 3year bachelor degree to sit for the exam rule has been changed in august 2012 details on delaware cpa requirement3 michigan — all waivers removed michigan used to be a state that automatically gives out nts your cpa exam admission ticket if you have a chartered accountant membership certificate they have since restricted the rules and are no longer consider ca as an educational requirement details on michigan cpa requirement4 new hampshire new rules effective july 1 2014new hampshire used to recognize indian ca certificates but have stopped doing that since 2012 the latest rule effective july 1 2014 further restricts the eligibility nh used to require only 12 credit hours in accounting which suits nonaccounting majors since july 1 2014 30 accounting credit hours 24 business credit hours and 150 overall credit hours is required after the july 2014 rule you basically need to be an accounting major to get qualified there isn’t much reason for international candidates to pick this state going forward details on new hampshire cpa requirement5 montana – now a onetier state since july 2015 montana has switched to onetier this means that they no longer issue standalone cpa certificate to those who pass the exam instead montana follows the standard rule requiring candidates to follow the 150hour rule and to get 1 year of relevant experience candidates used to select montana because they can get the cpa certificate for credentials only it no longer works details on montana cpa requirement states that i think should work in some degree it depends on your educational background but the following could be a good starting point for you1 california 150 credit hours now required since january 2014 california requires 150 semester hours 48 accounting credit hours vs the previous 24 and 10 credit hours on ethics to obtain the license note that while california does not require a social security number ssn to sit for the exam the state board requires a ssn to grant you the license working experience one advantage of registering in california is that the state board may recognize working experience verified by a nonus cpa but it’s quite a hassle if your experience is gained outside of california details on california cpa requirement2 illinois — standard exam rules but flexible experience requirement illinois was a 2tier state until july 1 2012 the full 150 credit hour is required and the approval process takes longer than most other states there is still some advantage to go through illinois it is one of the few states that clearly does not require social security number there are great flexibility in the working experience requirements eg you don’t need a cpa to sign off your experience your supervisor who may or may not be a cpa can be the verifier note il state board requires candidate to take 3 credit hours in research  accounting you may need to take an extra class for this special requirement details on illinois cpa exam requirements states that provides the flexibility1 virginia may accept bcom  ca your supervisorverifier doesn’t need to be a cpayou can sit for the exam in virginia as long as you have 120 credit hours 24 accounting credit hours and 24 business credit hours also i heard that bcom  ca could be deemed an equivalent us bachelor degree as long as the evaluation report says so given rules change all the time bcom  ca holders who want to take this route must first double check with virginia state board another great advantage of virginia is the flexibility of working experience requirement you need to work 1 year in a relevant field but unlike most other state boards virginia doesn’t require your supervisor ie your verifier of experience to be a cpa this means that as long as you work in accounting you can qualify to get the license restrictionsdisadvantages of virginia strict requirement of social security number which makes most international candidates and h4 visa holders ineligible you need to be concentrated in accounting ie this state is not for nonaccounting majors at the end of the day you do need 150 credit hours to get the license details on virginia cpa requirements2 north dakota supervisorverifier doesn’t need to be a cpanorth dakota is a typical state that requires 150 credit hours however if your bottle neck is on the experience requirement ie cannot find a cpa to work under or verify experience for you then north dakota should work similar to virginia it does not require your supervisor to be a cpa and this supervisor can sign the verification form for you what’s better than virginia is that social security number is not required more info on north dakota cpa requirements update nd now requires a cpa equivalent to verify the experience3 guam 120 credit hour  no experience needed if you don’t mind the inactive license as long as you are an accounting major with a 4year bachelor degree and do not practice within guam territory hold yourself as a guam cpa you can get an “inactive” license without ssn working experience and fulfilling the 150 credit hours if you are not an accounting major you do need to fulfill the 150 credit hours details on guam cpa exam requirement4 alaska can sit before getting 120 credit hours there are quite a lot of international candidates going through alaska so it’s worth mentioning here since alaska allows candidates to sit for the exam before the graduation 3year bcom degree holders can technically sit for the exam as long as they fulfill enough accounting credit hours the requirement depends on whether you are an accounting or nonaccounting major the working experience requirement is also quite vague 2 years of relevant experience deemed appropriate by the board i suggest that you find out whether your work is acceptable by double checking with the state board before applying through alaska details on alaska cpa requirements5 washington experience can be verified by someone other than your boss washington requires candidates to have the full 150 credit hours to sit for the exam but your experience can be verified by a cpa who is not your supervisor in other words you can verify the nonus experience that you may have by someone you know who happens to be a us cpa — could be friend a mentor a business partner… which makes things much easier for washington this verifier must be an active us cpa for 5 years or more more info on washington cpa requirements conclusion every year around 800010000 nonus candidates take the cpa exam representing 110 of total candidates this exam is possible and doable
