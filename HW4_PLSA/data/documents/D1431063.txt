m aintaining appropriately low phosphate levels is one of the ongoing struggles that reef aquarists face elevated phosphate levels can cause a variety of undesirable effects including increased green algae growth and decreased growth of calcifying organisms such as corals and coralline algae there are many ways to help keep phosphate in check these methods include the growth and export of organisms that take up substantial amounts of phosphate such as macroalgae my preference certain corals and even bacteria other methods include exporting organic materials that contain phosphorus by using skimming activated carbon and polymer resins finally many aquarists use materials that directly bind phosphate many solid inorganic materials are sold to aquarists to bind phosphate most of these have been developed for binding phosphate and other ions in industrial situations and have been adapted for use in marine aquaria in a previous article i reviewed the use of certain aluminumcontaining materials and discussed the concerns related to the potential release of aluminum and its impact on corals recently ironbased phosphate binding materials have become popular among reef aquarists these materials have been used commercially to treat drinking water to remove arsenic for example and to treat wastewater to remove a wide range of pollutants including phosphate they are sold to aquarists under a variety of different brand names including phosban phosphate killer and rowaphos this article will describe what they are how they bind phosphate what else they may bind and what other effects they have ill also discuss some potential explanations of certain negative effects that a number of aquarists have encountered when using these materials including the potential bleaching of corals and the precipitation of calcium carbonate phosphate why worry about it t he simplest form of phosphorus in reef aquaria is inorganic orthophosphate h 3 po 4 h 2 po 4  hpo 4  and po 4  are all forms of orthophosphate orthophosphate is the form of phosphorus that most test kits measure and is a form that is readily bound by iron oxide hydroxide materials orthophosphate is also present in natural seawater although other forms exist there as well its concentration in seawater varies greatly from place to place and also with depth and with the time of day surface waters are greatly depleted of phosphate relative to deeper waters due to biological activities in the surface waters that sequester phosphate in organisms typical ocean surface phosphate concentrations are very low by reefkeeping standards sometimes as low as 0005 ppm absent specific efforts to minimize the phosphate level phosphates will typically accumulate and rise in reef aquaria they are introduced mostly with foods but can also enter with topoff water and with some methods of calcium and alkalinity supplementation if allowed to rise above natural levels phosphate can cause two undesirable results one is inhibition of calcification that is it can reduce the rate at which corals and coralline algae can build calcium carbonate skeletons potentially stunting their growth phosphate can also be a limiting nutrient for algae growth if phosphate is allowed to accumulate algae growth may accelerate and become problematic at concentrations below about 003 ppm the growth rate of many species of phytoplankton depends on the phosphate concentration assuming that something else is not limiting growth such as nitrogen or iron above this level the growth rate of many of the oceans organisms is independent of phosphate concentration although this relationship is more complicated in a reef aquarium containing iron andor nitrogen sources such as nitrate above natural levels consequently deterring algae growth by controlling phosphate requires keeping phosphate levels quite low for these reasons phosphate should be kept below 003 ppm whether keeping it below 001 ppm will yield substantial additional benefits or detriments remains to be established but that is a goal that some aquarists are pursuing with various methods of exporting phosphate including the iron oxide hydroxide materials other ways to maintain low levels of phosphate in normal aquaria are to incorporate some combination of phosphate export mechanisms such as growing and harvesting macroalgae or other rapidly growing organisms using foods without excessive phosphate skimming using limewater and using other phosphate binding media some aquarists have tried to reduce phosphate also by inducing blooms of microorganisms such as bacteria this last method should in my opinion be left to experienced aquarists what is iron oxide hydroxide a variety of different materials go by the general description of iron oxide hydroxide one version is frequently referred to as granular ferric oxide gfo and that name will be used throughout this article unless something else specific is intended ferric refers to iron in the 3 state called iron iii or fe   which is the most stable state of iron under aerobic conditions the iron in gfo is ferric ferrous refers to iron in the 2 state called iron ii or fe   it is the more stable salt form of iron under anaerobic conditions there is no ferrous iron in gfo except perhaps trace impurities iron hydroxide fe oh 3 is composed of an fe  ion surrounded by three hydroxide oh  ions it is readily formed by combing any soluble form of fe  with hydroxide ions adding fe  as in iron sulfate or chloride directly to seawater will instantly form largely insoluble fe oh 3 which appears as a brown mud this effect is the primary reason not to use unchelated ferric salts as iron supplements in marine aquaria but thats a story for a different article at the other end of the extreme of iron iii oxides and hydroxides is the dehydrated form ferric oxide fe 2 o 3 it is composed of fe  ions and o  ions solid fe oh 3 spontaneously loses water to form a material that is in between these extremes fe o oh which is what is often called iron oxide hydroxide as shown in equations 131 fe   3 oh  à fe oh 3ferric iron  hydroxide à iron hydroxide2 fe oh 3 à fe o oh  h 2 oiron hydroxide à iron oxide hydroxide plus water3 2 fe o oh à fe 2 o 3  h 2 oiron oxide hydroxide à iron oxide plus water iron oxide hydroxide can be completely amorphous having randomly arranged ions completely crystalline with an ordered arrangement of ions or something in between in nature it can take a variety of different crystalline forms including goethite lepidocrocite and limonite the detailed chemistry of these materials is beyond the scope of this article but in short all of the commercial gfos sold to aquarists are comprised of a solid of fe  and oh  and o  ions how crystalline the different commercial products are is unknown to me although one manufacturers representative confided in me the belief that the relative crystallinity is an important difference between some of them other differences are also important for phosphate binding and these will be discussed in the following section how iron oxide hydroxide binds phosphate p hosphate is believed to bind to iron oxide hydroxide through a direct ionic interaction between one or two negatively charged oxygen ions on the phosphate with the ferric ions fe  in the solid figure 1 shows phosphate in solution above a gfo solid figure 2 shows it bound via two ionic bonds with the displacement of hydroxide these figures are included so that aquarists can understand what is happening but are not intended to claim that the surfaces are not also covered with other ions that are known to bind to gfo surfaces including sulfate chloride calcium magnesium trace metals and organics figure 1 phosphate shown in its most common form in seawater hpo 4  above a gfo surface figure 2 phosphate displacing hydroxide oh  and binding to a gfo surface since phosphate binding takes place at the surface of the gfo and not deep down inside it the amount of surface area is a very important attribute in determining how much phosphate such a mineral can bind even though the commercial materials appear to be reasonably large particles salifert claims 02  2 mm on their product label they actually have a high internal surface area somewhat similar to activated carbon consequently particle size is an unreliable means by which to gauge available surface area though it is reliable for nonporous solids such as table salt i have not seen any measures of accessible surface area for the commercial gfo sold to aquarists but one research group 1 analyzed its own material and found a surface area of 4050 m 2 g while another group reported 20 m 2 g for a sample of goethite and 250 m 2 g for a sample of amorphous iron hydroxide 2 those values are much lower than activated carbon typically with hundreds to thousands of m 2 g but much larger than 1 mm cubes of a nonporous solid would provide 0002 m 2 g for these reasons crystallinity extent of hydration with water and surface area aquarists cannot simply substitute different commercial brands or other industrial materials and expect to attain identical results in aquaria interestingly the concentration of phosphate in marine sediment pore waters whose sediment is iron oxide hydroxide appears to be controlled to a great extent by phosphate bound to the iron 3 even more importantly this bound phosphate is still available to the water column by exchange so the sequestering is temporary rather than permanent 3 this fact may be unimportant in an application where the gfo is presented and then removed with its bound phosphate but in other applications such as mud substrates or gfo accidentally released into the aquarium it may become more of an issue in aquaria there is no doubt that gfo is effective at rapidly and efficiently reducing orthophosphate concentrations it may also be at least partially effective at reducing organic phosphate levels but fewer data are available on such removal since few aquarists measure organic phosphate what else does iron oxide hydroxide bind metals t hese materials are known to bind a wide range of other compounds from water including trace metals arsenic selenium 2 silicate and organics metals such as manganese cobalt nickel and zinc are known to bind to iron oxide hydroxide in simulated seawater solutions 45 it has also been claimed that the binding of copper and zinc by natural iron oxide hydroxide sediments exerts a powerful control on the concentration of copper and zinc in polluted rivers and estuaries 6 although not studied in seawater it has also been observed that phosphate binding by iron oxide hydroxide actually increases its binding of copper cadmium and nickel in freshwater 7whether the binding of any of these ions is important in aquaria and whether it should be considered a benefit or a detriment remains to be established for each trace metal nevertheless it is something that aquarists should keep in mind and it may also be important in suggesting potential explanations for some of the biological effects of using these materials that are discussed later in this article what else does iron oxide hydroxide bind organics g ranular ferric oxide is also known to bind organic materials 810 in addition to many studies on the binding of manmade chemicals 8 and natural organics from freshwater such as humic acids 9 it has also been demonstrated that dissolved organic phosphate is readily removed from seawater by binding it to iron hydroxide 10the binding of organics especially those containing phosphorus is likely to be beneficial in most aquarium circumstances one possible exception is during treatments of the aquarium with organic medications how effective this binding is compared to activated carbon or whether they even bind the same materials is unknown it would be expected however that certain very polar organic materials might well be bound by gfo and not by carbon these would include certain natural biochemicals that might readily provide phosphate to algae but that are too polar to be absorbed by activated carbon it should also be noted that gfo would not be expected to be very effective at binding purely hydrophobic molecules that will bind well to activated carbon consequently gfo and carbon are in some ways complimentary in their ability to bind organic materials if i had to select between the two for removing dissolved organics from aquaria id select activated carbon what else might iron oxide hydroxide do precipitation of ca co 3m any aquarists using gfo have reported unusually extensive precipitation of carbonates on the solid gfo and elsewhere in the system such precipitation can for example be a contributing factor in the caking of such materials and can coat other surfaces in the aquarium this precipitation can also contribute to a drop in alkalinity and possibly p h as it removes carbonate from the water column the effect of calcium will be similar but smaller on a percentage basis with a drop of only 20 ppm calcium for every 1 meql 28 dk h drop in alkalinity increased calcification by corals and coralline algae possibly spurred by reduced phosphate can also cause similar drops in calcium alkalinity and p h dissolution of these precipitates with acid accompanied by bubbling indicates that these deposits are carbonates and are most likely calcium carbonate since it is supersaturated in most reef aquaria and in the ocean several factors may contribute to this precipitation many of these are rather straightforward it is known for example that phosphate inhibits the precipitation of calcium carbonate much like the role that magnesium plays in seawater phosphate binds to the growing calcium carbonate crystals poisoning their surface against further precipitation of calcium carbonate many organic materials are also known to inhibit this precipitation near the surface of the gfo and downstream from it the organics and phosphate are expected to be lower in concentration than upstream from it the reduction in concentration of these inhibitors may well permit increased abiotic precipitation of calcium carbonate on such surfaces two more esoteric events may however be equally important the first is that the local p h near the gfo surfaces may be higher than in the bulk solution this effect arises as phosphate and other inorganic and organic ions displace hydroxide from the surface figure 2 for example shows phosphate displacing two hydroxide ions the net swap of hpo 4  for 2 oh  will raise the local p h the supersaturation of calcium carbonate increases as the p h rises driving the precipitation of calcium carbonate another possible role may be played by the iron itself gfo is not completely insoluble the solubility of iron hydroxide in natural seawater is small but still significant 002  2 ppb although it is largely controlled by the availability of organic ligands 1113 one interesting possibility lies in the way that soluble iron actually impacts the precipitation of calcium carbonate at high concentrations iron inhibits the precipitation of calcium carbonate while different researchers find different threshold concentrations for this inhibition 25 ppm in one case 14 7ppm in another case 15  it is a well established and studied phenomenon the mechanism is believed to be the same as for magnesium phosphate and organics which all poison the growing calcium carbonate surface at much lower concentrations however iron actually increases the precipitation of calcium carbonate by acting as a site for nucleation of new crystals in one case this happened at 100 ppb dissolved iron increasing the rate of scaling the precipitation of calcium carbonate on surfaces by about 60 14 in another case the induction time for precipitation that is the time it takes for precipitation to begin once the water becomes supersaturated was reduced by 40 at 14 ppm iron and the overall precipitation rate was increased by 32 at 560 ppb lower iron levels were not tested 15 these studies were carried out in freshwater and i have not seen similar studies in seawater is the natural dissolution of gfo important in the nucleation of calcium carbonate precipitation i am not sure but it is clearly one possible explanation that fits the observations of aquarists as well as known phenomena involving iron what else might iron oxide hydroxide do biological effects q uite a large proportion of aquarists using gfo in reef aquaria have reported undesirable effects on corals these reported effects include tissue recession and bleaching many advanced aquarists have associated these effects with the first addition or with a later change of the gfo while many or all of these reports may be coincidence there are enough reports that aquarists should be wary listed below are a number of possibilities that may be the cause a sudden drop in phosphate may stress certain organisms this stress might be particularly important to corals with algal symbionts the level of symbionts existing in a coral may depend to some extent on the availability of nutrients a sudden drop in nutrients may imbalance the organism leaving it with too many zooxanthellae for the newlyreduced nutrient levels especially if these corals are already living on the edge of survival such stress may tip the balance toward disease in some cases phosphate levels may drop below natural seawater levels and phosphate may become the limiting nutrient if this limitation is severe enough corals and other organisms using phosphate may well be stressed stop growing and become more susceptible to disease similar effects may result from a drop in certain trace metals since the effects of gfo on trace elements have not been clearly established in aquaria it is possible that one or more critical elements may drop below optimal levels the release of soluble iron hydroxide itself may irritate certain corals although many aquarists dose chelated iron without such effects the iron hydroxide may however nucleate the precipitation of calcium carbonate in suboptimal places such as tissue surfaces it may also bind directly to tissues the gfo may actually release certain metals other than iron from its surface i have not seen any data on the chemical purity of these materials and such issues may be a concern with some or all brands the drop in alkalinity andor p h caused by abiotic precipitation of calcium carbonate would not be expected to be very great in most aquaria and typically isnt especially large as reported by the aquarists themselves in the cases from which ive seen data the effect is not as great as the variability between aquaria or between dosing events in many aquaria still such changes might be important in some circumstances where conditions are already marginal since gfo binds organic materials the addition of a significant amount of fresh surface area may rapidly drop the dissolved organic levels such a drop may stress corals by rapidly increasing the available light levels or by reducing a food source or both in order to minimize such difficulties many aquarists start off using gfo more slowly than the directions might suggest such caution seems warranted in most cases in order to minimize such difficulties many aquarists start off using gfo more slowly than the directions might suggest such caution seems warranted in most cases using gfo in a reactor m any aquarists use gfo in a fluidized bed reactor figure 3 below this method reduces the likelihood of forming the particles into an unusable solid cake although it does not always prevent this from happening some manufacturers sell reactors for this purpose some aquarists that have used the gfo in a traditional media bag report that it formed a brick in short order such caking may relate to calcium carbonate precipitation or even to bacteria that are known to be able to knit the surfaces of two small iron oxide hydroxide particles together into a single particle 16figure 3 gfo in use in a fluidized bed reactor hanging on the sump photo courtesy of skip attix suggestions for using iron oxide hydroxide to bind phosphate i have only recently tried in my aquarium any of the commercial gfo brands sold to aquarists i used saliferts phosphate killer and it is too soon to comment on that test i have not yet however noticed any problems there are obvious differences between them including the amount of water they contain rowaphos for example comes as a wet solid while saliferts product phosphate killer comes as an apparently dry solid other differences could include the surface area any surface chemical treatments the amount of fine particles present and other factors for these reasons i should stress not to assume that they are all the same i am not prepared however to make any claims about the relative efficacy of the various brands some published experiments do purport to examine the relative effectiveness of different brands in one such study the phosphate binding data were largely generated at phosphate levels above the range likely to be encountered by most reef aquarists 05  35 ppm while at normal aquarium phosphate concentrations up to about 02 ppm the two products appeared equivalent in a second study two products being compared were dosed at such high levels that both products bound nearly all of the available phosphate down to 001 ppm such a test is akin to comparing the pain reducing efficacy of morphine and aspirin by showing that both relieved a headache a possibly better test would involve dosing less and seeing which brand if either reduces phosphate the most aquarists who choose to use such materials should be aware of the possible biological problems that other aquarists have encountered starting slowly and allowing the phosphate to decline over a period of a week or two may be less stressful than dropping it in a period of hours regardless of the mechanism of the problems encountered using a smaller amount of material and changing it more frequently may also be less stressful salifert recommends using 250 m l 85 ounces of its product phosphate killer to treat a 125250 gallon tank for up to three months there is however nothing wrong with starting with 110 that amount to see what happens while it may be more work using one ounce and changing it after two weeks may reduce some of the issues that aquarists have observed when changing the media aquarists should also be aware that dropping phosphate to extremely low ie growth limiting levels may cause undesirable effects that reef aquarists do not typically encounter without using such materials it is quite possible that if gfo can bind enough phosphate to limit the growth of algae it may be possible to bind enough phosphate to limit the growth of other organisms such as corals id suggest using a phosphate test kit as a guide to how much material to use ie use more if you maintain levels above 002003 ppm and perhaps use less if you never detect any phosphate kits can also be used to determine when to change the gfo change it if phosphate levels begin to rise after a period of being lower finally be sure to rinse these materials in fresh or salt water before adding them to the aquarium as fine particles may get loose in the aquarium clouding and coloring the water and possibly creating other problems there is no efficiency drawback to this rinsing aquarists using the gfo in a fluidized bed reactor or canister filter should just run some water change water on it for a few minutes before putting it into the tank a media bag of gfo can simply be rinsed with salt or rodi water a few times before adding it to the aquarium do not squeeze the gfo inside of the bag when rinsing as that may break the particles into smaller bits that can then escape the bag the bottom line would i use gfo to export phosphate the answer is a qualified yes phosphate is such a significant problem for reef aquaria that it should be kept appropriately low less than 003 ppm in some fashion there are many ways to minimize the accumulation of phosphate in my own reef i prefer to use skimming carbon and macroalgae growth to export phosphorus if these are unsuited to a particular setting then perhaps gfo is an appropriate alternative happy reefing
