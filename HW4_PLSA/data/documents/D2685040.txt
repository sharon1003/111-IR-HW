that you would encounter rats are also interested in getting at the fruits and vegetables in your garden they see your tomatoes carrots lettuce and other assorted homegrown morsels as just as tasty to them as they are to any other animal consider that the rat is a true omnivore meaning that you will eat just about anything if it will eat rotting garbage out of your waste can then consider how much it will enjoy your watermelon and cantaloupe keeping it out of your garden is obviously a big priority this can be done in several ways but the first and most important way is by putting up some kind of fence structure the fence does not have to be very tall because rats can only get up to a certain point before they are stopped from being able to get in rats to not climb so offense that is about 2 feet tall should be sufficient enough to keep them out your fence only needs to be about four or five inches below the surface keep them out as well rats are also not burrowers so they will not be digging deep below the surface to be able to get into your garden this means you don’t need to dig your fence very deep a fence should nearly be enough to do the job of keeping the rats out but there are other things that you can do to keep them out as well a popular choice is to build a mote like structure about one foot away from the place where your garden begins much like the motes were built around a castle you would do this very same thing with your garden the mote should be at least 18 inches deep and at least 18 inches across to keep the rats from getting across when it rains the mote will fill with water keeping the rats from entering since they do not swim particularly well the depth will keep them caught should they fall in this will make them easy prey for predators as well which can reduce your problem the width will make it impossible for them to climb across if you go for this option you want to make sure that you clean this out regularly leaves and other debris will fall into the mote at times ruining the perfect scheme that you have built check this at least once a week and after heavy storms go back to the how to get rid of rats home page or email me for more
