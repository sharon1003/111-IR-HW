answer 1 · maple trees answer · jeannethere are very few plants in my opinion that can be used as shrubs or groundcovers that are as hardy beautiful flowering and as drought resistant as the lantana many replace their lantana every 3 to 5 years as these plants can get woody and untidy looking over a period of years many of the lantanas need very little pruning each year to keep them looking nice if your plants are growing well but getting to large for the garden they can be cut back the best time to cut your lantana back is in early spring as new growth is starting to emerge pruning in the fall can cause the death of lantana as this makes the plant less resistant to winter cold weather rain entering stems can cause rotting and other diseases when cut back in the cooler wet season the plants can be cut back to 12 inches of the ground along with cutting out any damaged or death growth if you feel they are too large now i would only cut them back a third or less of there size now but not wait much longer in the year if you are interested in replacing them with another plant a few answers to questions would help to give you some ideas what hardiness zone are you in if your not sure give me your city and state and i can look it up is the area in full sun or does it get some shade during the day is the area kept watered or is the area fairly dry most of the time do you feel the soil is easily worked in or hard as clay soils can be does the soil seem to drain well or does water puddle for a time when watered or rained on i sounds as though your plants are doing well so you may be happy with pruning them back this coming year it is always nice if keeping plants that seem to come back well each year and give you the color you enjoy can be saved with a little pruning this pruning will also help to make the plants fuller without that woody looking appearance johnanswered by maple tree 4 years ago gardenality genius · zone 10a · 30° to 35° fcomment about this answer »rate it 2
