prevented what is an abnormal heart rhythm arrhythmia when the hearts electrical system malfunctions the normal rhythm of the heart can be affected depending upon the abnormality the heart may begin to beat too fast too slow irregularly or not at all heart rhythm disorders are often referred to as cardiac arrhythmias cardiac  heart a  lack of but this is technically incorrect since in most cases there is a heart rhythm but it is abnormal cardiac dysrhythmia dys  abnormal or faulty  rhythm might be a better term dysrhythmias may occur because of problems directly associated with the electrical wiring the sa node the av node or ventricular conducting system the issue may also be due to influences on the conducting system from outside the heart these can include electrolyte abnormalities in the bloodstream abnormal hormone levels for example thyroid function that is too high or too low and medication or drug ingestions any abnormality of the electrical cycle within the heart that generates an abnormal beat whether it is too fast too slow skipped or irregular is considered a dysrhythmia dysrhythmias are usually classified as originating from above the av node supraventricular  or below from the ventricle they are either fast slow or irregular and persistent or intermittent how does the heart work the heart is a twostage electric pump whose job it is to circulate blood through the body the initial electrical impulse that begins the process of a heartbeat is generated by a group of cells located in the upper chamber of the heart the atrium these cells act as an automatic pacemaker starting the electric signal that spreads along the wiring within the heart muscle allowing a coordinated squeeze so that the pump can function the heart has four chambers the upper chambers are the right and left atria singular  atrium while the lower chambers are the right and left ventricles the right side of the heart pumps blood to the lungs while the left side pumps it to the rest of the body blood from the body depleted of oxygen and containing carbon dioxide is collected in the right atrium and then pushed into the right ventricle with a small beat of the upper chamber of the heart the right ventricle pumps the blood to the lungs to pick up oxygen and release the carbon dioxide the oxygenrich blood returns to the left atrium where the small atrial beat pushes it to the left ventricle the left ventricle is much thicker than the right because it needs to be strong enough to send blood to the entire body there are special cells in the right atrium called the sinoatrial node sa node that generate the first electrical impulse allowing the heart to beat in a coordinated way the sa node is considered the natural pacemaker of the heart this pacemaker function begins the electrical impulse which follows pathways in the atrial walls almost like wiring to a junction box between the atrium and ventricle called the atrioventricular node  av node  this electric signal causes muscle cells in both atria to contract at once at the av node the electric signal waits for a very short time usually one to twotenths of a second to allow blood pumped from the atria to fill up the ventricles the signal then passes through electric bundles in the ventricle walls to allow these chambers to contract again in a coordinated way and pump blood to the lungs and body the sa node generates an electric beat about 60 to 80 times a minute and each should result in a heartbeat that beat can be felt as an external pulse after a heartbeat the muscle cells of the heart need a split second to get ready to beat again and the electrical system allows a pause for this to happen picture of the great vessels of the heart picture of the hearts electrical system the heart and its electrical activity work within a narrow range of normal fortunately the body tends to protect the heart as best as it can rhythm disturbances may be normal physiologic responses but some may be potentially life threatening every cell in the heart can act as a pacemaker a healthy sa node has an intrinsic heart beat generation rate of 60 to 80 if the atrium fails to generate a heartbeat then a healthy av node can do so at a rate of about 40 and if needed the ventricles themselves can generate heartbeats at a rate of about 20 per minute this may occur if the cells of the upper chamber fail to generate an electrical impulse or if the electrical signals to the ventricle are blocked however these lower rates may be associated with the inability of the heart to pump blood to the body to meet its needs and may result in shortness of breath chest pain weakness or passing out quick guide atrial fibrillation heart symptoms diagnosis  afib treatment cardiac arrhythmia treatment ablation ablation is used to treat abnormal heart rhythms or arrhythmias the type of arrhythmia and the presence of other heart disease will determine whether ablation can be performed surgically or nonsurgically nonsurgical ablation used for many types of arrhythmias is performed in a special lab called the electrophysiology ep laboratory surgical ablation procedures used for treating atrial fibrillation can be minimally invasive or traditional open surgery and may be combined with other surgical therapies such as bypass surgery valve repair or valve replacement surgical ablation procedures include the maze procedure minimally invasive surgical ablation the modified maze procedure read more about arrhythmia treatment »what causes heart rhythm disorders heart rhythm disturbances may occur because of problems within the heart itself or be the result of abnormalities in the bodys environment that can affect the hearts ability to conduct electricity cardiac or heart muscle cells become irritated when they are depleted of oxygen this can occur during a heart attack in which the coronary arteries the blood vessels that supply the heart with blood are blocked lack of oxygen can occur when the lungs are unable to extract oxygen from the air significant anemia or low red blood cell count decreases the oxygencarrying capacity of the blood and may prevent adequate oxygen delivery rapid heart rates may be due to wiring problems with the electrical pathways in the heart this can cause short circuits making the heart speed up and beat 150 beats a minute or more the abnormality can be due to a physical extra electrical pathway such as that seen in wolffparkinsonwhite wpw syndrome or it can be due to changes in the electrical physiology between a few cells like in atrial flutter rapid heart rates can also occur because of environmental issues that affect the heart these can be intrinsic to the body like anemia abnormal electrolyte levels or abnormal thyroid hormone levels they may also be due to reactions to outside influences like caffeine alcohol overthecounter cold remedies or stimulants such as amphetamines to the cardiac muscle cell they all appear to be adrenalinelike substances that can cause cell irritation slow dysrhythmias can also be problematic if the heart beats too slowly the body may not be able to maintain an adequate blood pressure and supply the bodys organs with enough oxygenrich blood to function slow heart rates may be due to aging of the sa node and its inability to generate an electrical pacemaker signal often though it is due to the side effects of medications used to control high blood pressure side effects of beta blocker and certain calcium channel blocker drugs include a slowing of the heart rate body environment is also important with slow heart rhythm abnormalities hypothermia or low body temperature is a potential cause what are the different types of heart rhythm disorders readers comments 36 share your story heart rhythm disorders are classified according to where they occur in the heart and how they affect the heartbeat what are the signs and symptoms of heart rhythm disorders readers comments 1 share your story many people may have heart rhythm disturbances and never be aware of them premature atrial contractions pacs and premature ventricular contractions  pvcs are variations of normal and most often people are unaware that an extra beat has occurred however some patients are keenly aware of any extra heartbeat even if it is a normal variant and requires no treatment that said the initial symptom of dysrhythmia is often palpitations a sensation that the heart is beating too quickly too slowly beating irregularly or skipping a beat the palpitations may be intermittent or may require medical intervention to resolve because of the heart rhythm abnormality other symptoms may occur because of decreased cardiac output the amount of blood that the heart pushes out to meet the bodys demand for oxygen and energy the patient may complain of lightheadedness weakness nausea and vomiting chest pain and shortness of breath in critical situations the patient may fall to the ground or lose consciousness this may be due to lifethreatening dysrhythmias like ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia it may be due to heart rates so fast that there isnt enough blood pressure generated to supply the brain with what it needs the same result can also occur if the heart beats too slowly and insufficient blood pressure is generated atrial fibrillation slideshow causes tests and treatment atrial fibrillation afib quiz test your medical iqheart symptoms never to ignore slideshow atrial fibrillation afibshare your story atrial fibrillation occurs when the atrium has lost the ability to beat in a coordinated fashion instead of the sa node generating a single electrical signal numerous areas of the atrium become irritated and produce electrical impulses this causes the atrium to jiggle or fibrillate instead of beating the av node sees all the electrical signals but because there are so many and because they are so erratic only some of the hundreds of signals per minute are passed through to the ventricle the ventricles then fire irregularly and often very quickly as in psvt the symptoms may include palpitations lightheadedness and shortness of breath the cause of atrial fibrillation however may be more significant since it may be due to aging of the conducting system of the heart and there may be associated atherosclerotic heart disease therefore atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response associated with chest pain or shortness of breath may need emergent cardioversion a procedure that uses electricity to shock the heart back into a normal rhythm or intravenous medications to control the heart rate one significant complication of atrial fibrillation is the formation of blood clots along the inside of the heart wall these clots may break off and travel to different organs in the body embolize blocking blood vessels and causing the affected organs to malfunction because of the loss of blood supply a common complication is a clot traveling to the brain resulting in a stroke the treatment of atrial fibrillation depends upon many factors including how long it has been present what symptoms it causes and the underlying health of the individual the patient and his or her doctor will decide whether or not to restore a normal sinus rhythm or to simply keep the heart rate under control atrial fibrillation can be a safe rhythm and not life threatening when the rate is controlled medications are used to slow the electrical impulses through the av node so that the ventricles do not try to capture each signal being produced the reason to return people to a regular rhythm has to do with cardiac output in atrial fibrillation the atria do not beat and pump blood to the ventricles instead blood flows into the ventricles by gravity alone this lack of atrial kick can decrease the hearts efficiency and cardiac output by 10 to 15 blood thinning or anticoagulation may be recommended for those patients with atrial fibrillation and elevated risk for stroke oral drugs that anticoagulate are warfarin  coumadin  dabigatran pradaxa rivaroxaban  xarelto  and apixaban  eliquis  there are other injectable drugs that are used in a hospital setting if the patient is at low risk the doctor may recommend aspirin alone for stroke prevention if atrial fibrillation is poorly tolerated due to symptomatic palpitations or symptoms of reduced cardiac output or if there are concerns with lifelong anticoagulation therapy more definitive therapy may include specific medications electrical cardioversion or catheter based ablation sometimes with a pacemaker inserted atrial fibrillation is a common condition with many implications and the best plan for each patient should be discussed at length with ones physician atrial flutter atrial flutter is similar to atrial fibrillation except that instead of having chaotic electrical firing from all points in the atrium one point has become irritated and can fire 300 times per minute or more many issues that exist for atrial fibrillation apply to atrial flutter atrial flutter may degenerate into atrial fibrillation and the two can often coexist from tips to better manage your migraine start now sinus bradycardia the heart its cells and its electricity may come under the many outside influences causing it to beat more slowly sinus bradycardia brady  slow  cardia  heart by definition is a heartbeat generated by the sa node at a rate slower than 60 beats per minute this may be normal in people who are active and athletic or in patients taking medications designed to slow the heart such as beta blockers and some calcium channel blockers vasovagal syncope is an episode of profound sinus bradycardia associated with a noxious stimulus that causes the vagal system of the body to kick in and slow the heart rate while the sympathetic system of the body is mediated by adrenaline the parasympathetic system is mediated by the vagus nerve and the chemical acetylcholine which promotes the exact opposite body reaction than adrenaline in some people exposure to pain or a difficult emotional situation can stimulate the vagus nerve slow the heart and dilate blood vessels veins causing cardiac output to decrease and making a person feel lightheaded or faint the vagus nerve also can be stimulated to slow the heart when one bears down to urinate micturition syncope or have a bowel movement tachycardia rapid heart rates can originate from either the atrium or the ventricle but rhythms from the ventricle are more often life threatening the initial approach to rapid heart rates is to quickly identify the rhythm and if blood pressure is maintained and there is no evidence of a failing heart then treatment is directed to rate control with the eventual return of the heart back to normal sinus rhythm if however there is evidence that the heart is failing because of the rapid rate then emergency measures including using electricity to shock the heart back into a regular rhythm may be necessary sinus tachycardia the heart its cells and its electricity may come under many outside influences that may cause it to beat more quickly sinus tachycardia sinus  from the sa node  tachy  rapid  cardia  heart or a rapid regular heartbeat is a common rhythm issue it occurs when the body signals the heart to pump more blood or when the electrical system is stimulated by chemicals the body needs increased cardiac output in times of physiologic stress cardiac output is the amount of blood the heart pumps in the course of 1 minute it can be calculated by the amount of blood that the heart pumps with each beat  stroke volume multiplied by the heart rate cardiac output   stroke volume x heart ratethe stroke volume tends to be relatively constant when the body requires extra oxygen delivery the heart rate needs to increase to meet that demand examples includeexercise in which the muscles have greater oxygen requirements and the heart rate speeds up to pump more blood to meet that needdehydration in which there is less fluid in the body and the heart rate has to speed up to compensate orin cases of acute bleeding that may occur after trauma the electrical system can be stimulated in a variety of ways to make the heart beat faster in times of stress the body generates cortisol and adrenaline causing an increased heart rate in addition to other changes in the body think of being frightened and feeling your heart race increased thyroid hormone levels in the body can also cause a tachycardia ingestion of a variety of drugs can also cause the heart to race including caffeine alcohol and overthecounter cold medications that include chemicals such as phenylephrine and pseudoephedrine these compounds are metabolized by the body and act like an adrenaline stimulus to the heart illegal drugs such as methamphetamine and cocaine can also cause a sinus tachycardia atrial fibrillation slideshow causes tests and treatment atrial fibrillation afib quiz test your medical iqheart symptoms never to ignore slideshow ventricular fibrillation vfibventricular fibrillation is technically not a rapid heart rhythm because the heart ceases to beat in ventricular fibrillation the ventricles do not have a coordinated electrical pattern and the ventricles instead of beating just jiggle or fibrillate since the heart doesnt beat blood is not circulated to the body or brain and all bodily functions stop without a coordinated impulse to signal the ventricle to beat sudden cardiac death occurs the treatment for vfib is defibrillation with an electrical shock automated external defibrillators aeds in public places have helped decrease the mortality from sudden cardiac death but prevention remains the mainstay to survive this event some people such as those with a very weak heart muscle or who have a prior history of ventricular fibrillation will require an implantable defibrillator to prevent future episodes of sudden death and treat this rhythm this rhythm is often associated with a heart attack in which the heart muscle doesnt get enough blood supply myocardial ischemia becomes irritated and causes secondary irritation of the electrical system aside from myocardial ischemia other causes of ventricular fibrillation may include severe weakness of the heart muscle  cardiomyopathy  electrolyte disturbances drug overdose and poisoning ventricular tachycardia vtachventricular tachycardia is another rapid heart rate that originates in the ventricle the causes are the same as those for ventricular fibrillation but because of the electrical conduction pattern in the heart pathways an organized signal is provided to the ventricles potentially allowing them to beat this remains an emergency since vtach may degenerate into ventricular fibrillation premature atrial contractions pacs and premature ventricular contractions pvcsevery person experiences the occasional palpitation in which the atrium or the ventricle beats early these premature atrial contractions pacs or premature ventricular contractions pvcs are normal variants and most people are unaware of their occurrence however some patients report a palpitation in the chest and neck often described as a thump or thud pacs and pvcs in otherwise healthy individuals do not pose any health risks quick guide atrial fibrillation heart symptoms diagnosis  afib treatment paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia psvtparoxysmal supraventricular tachycardia psvt occurs when the pathways in the av node or atrium allow an altered conduction of electricity and the atrium begins firing in a fast but regular rate sometimes more than 150 to 200 times per minute the ventricles sensing the electrical activity coming through the av node try to beat along with each electrical impulse and psvt occurs this is rarely a lifethreatening event but people may feel uncomfortable when psvt occurs they may become lightheaded weak have shortness of breath and describe a feeling of fullness in the throat psvt may also be tolerated and may stop on its own if this is a first time event activating ems emergency medical services and calling 911 is important since other tachycardias can be life threatening the treatment for psvt includes attempts to stimulate the vagus nerve to slow the heart see vasovagal syncope above by holding ones breath and bearing down as if to have a bowel movement intravenous medications are often used to interrupt the episode many patients have psvt due to congenital abnormalities in the electrical conduction system of the heart external causes can include hyperthyroidism electrolyte imbalances and the use of caffeine alcohol overthecounter cold medications containing stimulants or illegal drugs like cocaine and methamphetamine wolffparkinsonwhite wpw syndrome wolffparkinsonwhite syndrome is a specific type of psvt in which an inborn error of wiring has occurred near the av node and an accessory electrical pathway exists the diagnosis is made by electrocardiogram  ekg or electrophysiologic testing and the treatment may include medication or destruction of the accessory electrical pathway by invasive catheter ablation atrial fibrillation slideshow causes tests and treatment atrial fibrillation afib quiz test your medical iqheart symptoms never to ignore slideshow bradycardia aside from medications that are meant to slow the heart for treatment of a variety of medical problems bradycardia brady  low  cardia  heart is usually due to heart block and the aging of the electrical wiring of the heart this is no different than the aging of your homes electrical system but instead of being able to rewire the heart these conditions may need to be treated with an implantable pacemaker heart blocks heart blocks involving the ventricle may be asymptomatic and of little consequence except to point to underlying heart or lung disease they are diagnosed by ekg heart blocks involving the atrium can be classified as first second and thirddegree firstdegree heart block is common and usually of little significance there is a slight delay in getting the electrical signal from the sa node to the av node but the heart functions normally there are two types of seconddegree heart block mobitz i and mobitz ii with type ii being more serious than type i thirddegree heart block describes the complete loss of connection between the electrical activity of the atria and the ventricles second and thirddegree heart blocks are diagnosed by analyzing heart rhythm strips and ekgs heart blocks are symptomatic because the heart beats so slowly that cardiac output is decreased the symptoms may include lightheadedness or passing out syncope weakness shortness of breath and chest pain diagnosis and treatment of lifethreatening heart block happen at the same time often the patient with bradycardia may be taking medications that can slow the heart including beta blockers and certain calcium channel blockers if the patient is stable time can be taken to have the medications wear off while the patient is monitored if the bradycardia remains a pacemaker may be needed in certain situations a temporary pacemaker can be placed to stabilize the patient while decisions are made as to a permanent solution quick guide atrial fibrillation heart symptoms diagnosis  afib treatment when to seek medical care unexplained palpitations are not normal especially when associated with shortness of breath sweating feelings of chest pressure or passing out the person should be made comfortable and laid flat and ems emergency medical service should be activated by calling 911 or the emergency number in your area if the person is unconscious or unresponsive basic life support american heart association should be initiated call 911 get an aed and decide whether cpr should be initiated if the episode is shortlived and resolves spontaneously the primary care professional should be contacted urgently to seek advice if the episode is a recurrent problem the diagnosis is known and the rhythm disturbance resolves itself then a less urgent call to the primary care professional is warranted it is reasonable to seek emergent medical care any time that a heart rhythm disturbance occurs or if there is concern that a heart problem is present how are heart rhythm disorders diagnosed readers comments 2 share your story the mainstay of diagnosis remains the ekg and heart rhythm monitoring these are often done immediately in the ambulance or upon arrival in the emergency department in many patients the palpitations or symptoms may have resolved and no acute rhythm abnormalities can be found depending on the associated symptoms and the history observation and monitoring of the heart may occur in hospital or as an outpatient in patients who have passed out admission to the hospital often occurs those patients with chest pain and shortness of breath may also be admitted to evaluate their heart in patients who are not admitted a heart monitoring device may be placed to monitor the rhythm for a duration of time monitors may be worn for 24 hours or up to 1 month in some instances rhythm identification is elusive and may take months or years to capture and identify implantable cardiac monitors may be placed for periods greater than 1 year if the rhythm is known then tests to identify potential causes may be done these are dependent on the specific rhythm abnormality and can range from blood tests to lung evaluations and sleep studies to echocardiograms and electrophysiologic testing what is the treatment for heart rhythm disorders readers comments 9 share your story there is no one treatment for a heart rhythm abnormality when the patient is unstable with no pulse or blood pressure or when they are unconscious american heart association guidelines are available to direct care to hopefully restore the heart rhythm to normal and return a pulse for vfib and vtach electricity may be the most important drug and the heart is shocked back into a heart rhythm hopefully compatible with life other common medications used in crises situations depend upon the lifethreatening rhythm and may include epinephrine  adrenalin  atropine and amiodarone for patients with supraventricular tachycardia svt the goal is not only to slow down the heart rate but also to identify which rhythm is present vasovagal maneuvers like holding ones breath and bearing down as if to have a bowel movement may resolve the situation or it may slow the rate temporarily to make the diagnosis adenosine can be injected and may convert svt to normal sinus rhythm by slowing the electrical impulse at the av node it can also be used as a diagnostic challenge to help identify atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response the initial goal is to slow the rate and maintain normal blood pressure calcium channel clockers like diltiazem and beta blockers like metoprolol may be used intravenously to control rate digoxin is a secondline medication that may be helpful when firstline medications fail in unstable patients with chest pain shortness of breath or decreased consciousness cardioversion with an electric shock may be required the decision to electively convert afib to normal sinus rhythm depends upon the patient and situation and is often a decision left to the primary care professional the question regarding anticoagulation also will need to be addressed what is the prognosis for heart rhythm disorders while most heart dysrhythmias can be treated and controlled ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia can be fatal their recognition and treatment are true emergencies and there is no guarantee that sudden cardiac death can be reversed for all other rhythm abnormalities there may be time to make the diagnosis and design a treatment plan the goal is to minimize the effect that the dysrhythmia has on daily activity and quality of life can heart rhythm disorders be prevented minimizing risk factors for heart disease will be helpful including controlling blood pressure lowering cholesterol keeping diabetes under control and not smoking for those with rapid palpitations that are intermittent avoiding stimulants
