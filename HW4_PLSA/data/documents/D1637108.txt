hooks on didnt even bend dont know what people complain about the lure is phenomenal and gets the job done from sean stockton ca 3118comments strike kings is the best kvd is the best all other negative comments came from yuppy lovers that support mike iaconelli go buy some over price old rapala custom laconelli lure and screw off mustad hooks are the best i use them for all my costume baits yuppys complain people who know what there doing buy strike king products and quantum reels and rods your not going to be reimburse 2 dollars on try to catch fish in the trees and you smash the lure its not metal its made for bass not baseball bats or brick walls if you want some cheap lure go buy a berkeley or another product thats a off brand finally words strike kings wear its at if you want to catch state records but dont blame the lure cause the operator cant fish for nothing from david america 22818comments hooks are ok great color selection but paints chips bad like all strike kings action is effective nothing big just an effective side to side roll overall a very o k but no more than that crankbait not a confidence bait of mine because everyone throws it and i prefer to go a little more outside the box from seth indiana 2818comments very disappointed in this bait i would think a kvd crankbait you would not need to replace the garbage hooks on it must be beneficial to kevin also my 3 baits i purchased not one runs straight maybe strike king should focus some better effort in quality control from brian boston 2818comments if you live in a coastal area and want to catch big red fish just buy you a chartreuse and black 15 and hold on ive landed many 30 inch plus reds on these baits and have never had one break unless i slammed it into a bridge piling on the cast from terry vancleave ms 2718comments this is my go to lure for shallow water crank baits ive had great luck with the gizzard shad however last time i went fishing i caught one then i noticed my lure was acting erratically  it had a cracked bill i had a spare in my tackle back so i tied it on it acted crazy from the get go i never could get it tuned right i guess this was just a fluke ive had several and never had a problem before from randy ellaville ga 11117comments 25 all day catches little bass big ole fat bass and even 8 white perch i dont recommend any size smaller than the 25from unknonwn 103017comments one of the very best squarebills out there and shallow cranks period has the hunting action you want casts well and has a great selection of colors the stock hardware is pretty good and they just flat out catch fish from tyler grand junction co 5917comments i can say that the kvd square bills have become my go to shallow crankbait that being said on the last few that i have purchased i have had an eye come off on the very first trip out not sure if strike king has changed something in their process but something is wrong from lee hickory nc 42417comments i have at least 100 of these in all sizes i use many other brands from time to time but this is the most consistent running durable fish catcher of all time in square bills i beat them on rocks and smack them into any cover i can find and i have never broken a bait ive had the bills wear down from fishing rocks but never break i do change the hooks on these from butch ohio 4717comments whoever thought of a square style bill in a crankbait should get idea of the century next to a drop shot i mean the things are considerably hard to snag up they just work throw it out and reel it in fast or slow medium or burned they get bit makes it so easy for someone who just wants to pull up and get fishing without a lot of heady guesswork any time of year any time of day if you can cast and you can reel you can catch great lure ive fished them all it seems like these little silent square bills versus different style baits time and time again produce in a variety of conditions big norman guy spro wiggle wart etc etc etc they all work but when i really want to fish something and just go catching without any fuss i tie up one of these and by the time im second guessing my decision donkfrom tmoney  southern california 4117comments i love this bait i like the action and the colors but i would replace the hooks and the bill isnt really durable mine broke deflecting off a rock the 10 is a good for small mouth and large mouth from lucas  wi 33017comments i have several of these in different sizes and colors they are by far the best line of crankbaits ive ever uses they are very affordable durable and they catch fish ive only had one break and that was after smacking it into a bridge a few times strike king has become my 1lure of choice would like to see some in my lucky tackle box from justin grass lake mi 31617comments great lure my go to only 1 i use if i do cranks besides the super spot lure this is all i usenat colors are the best in md just do a med retrieve with some pauses they bite it after u resume from a pause catch alot but like all lures there easy to catch a pesky limbif u use heavier line i would go with 15 but i use 6lb mono and like the 10 sizein spring try the manns minus 1 lure too just med to fast retreive near shore lines always gets a bite tighest lines earl the pearl from germantown 3817comments these do work seem to work better with a med rate real speed of stop and go in nat colors bass crush em last year i got 14 bass in half hour at the boatramp on the nat bream pattern in spring cloudy day with med chop conditions from unknown 22717comments i have several of these in the 15 and 25 sizes ive never had one break the coating has never chipped either i snagged one up in a tree and it was chewed up by a raccoon replaced the hooks when i got it back and it still runs great today even with deep teeth marks and a missing eye from louella pittsburgh pa 21417comments i use this crank bait in the 10 size in sexy shad color and ive caught a ton of fish on the bait however i end up braking one of these baits every time i go out because the bill strength is very weak from brody roanoke 1417comments i love this lure the 25 in gizzard shad helped me catch my pb 9 pounds 13 ounces and i have caught many other fish also it is probably my most used lure from ryan bealeton 121616comments the things just get bit they come through cover better than you could even expect and the silent models i guarantee get more bites way less evasive way more natural even at night quality hard ware right out of the package always run true throw the damn thing out  reel it in they workfrom metatron star hollywood ca 9616comments my favorite all year round bait besides a texas rig flat out catches fish i literally have a hundred of them  only one bill broke when i hit my trolling motor rolling it under brush my big trick is that the 10 on bedded bass is deadly it caught so many 5lbers this spring from steven usa 8516comments this bait is amazing i have caught a variety of species on it including lmb smb walleye northerns crappie gills catfish bowfin  even large perch i also caught my pb lm on the 15 in summer sexy shad outstanding bait for the price from travis whitehall mi 72816comments these cranks are the best that i have tried the bills are not made great  i have broken several of them even with the bills breaking they are still a great lure from dylan rogersville al 62516comments they are good crankbaits they run well once you time tune them  catch fish but i recommend buying a rick clunn series three they are made better they are way more durable they run better deflect off cover better and are a way better crankbait for the price all strike king squarebills brake rather easily from big bass slayer ks 52816comments this bait runs great  really bounces off rocks  other surfaces well you can get it unsnagged quite easily as well the downside of this bait is that the paint chips extremely easily if a fish bites down hard enough or if you are fishing rocks all day so really you are spending 5 per day at least granted it is a cheap bait so thats to be expected from alex kewanee il 33016comments i have never had a bill brake on me i have used them for years fishing in ponds one of the first lures that got me started bass fishin awesome squarebill from ty ok 3116comments these are the best squarebills in the 5 price range they come in great colors they have great action  are pretty durable also the hooks are not bad if you have a good rod  get a good hookset the hooks will not pop out these are the best squarebills under 10 but you can get better for over this price point from taylor atl ga 21016comments i love these crankbaits they do not get hung up i ran them threw the timber  submerged trees  never got hung up and caught many fish  the hooks wont shake out of the fishes mouths great job strike kingfrom will houston tx 12315comments amazing crankbait action wise but needs improvement to quality ive caught

against any square bill out there  i would bet it would out catch the bulk of them from james amherst va 102915comments these are great crank baits after catching 50 plus fish on one the bill cracked otherwise very tough  reliablefrom jj la 101815comments this is a violent crankbait cought plent of fish with it in the shallows although they are not violent i have bounced it off a rock and snapped the bill right off i have more then one crank bait in my library and they all seem very strong unlike most they break easy not worth the money you can buy cheeper and better cankbaits from zachary bellevue mi 82015comments if you are having issues with the bills breaking use snaps you will get more action out of the bait that way too i didnt buy a single crank until this year when a friend recommended it to me in the first four tournaments of the year i won and had big bass this bait just flat out catches fish from ryan in 72815comments i love these cranks they work awesome and boy do they catch fish but of the 10 i ordered this spring i have had 7 of the bills bust off the price point is great but if they break so easy im just going to stick to my arashis from adam rice lake wi 62115comments i bought a bunch of the 15s in may of 2015 as part of my annual tackle purchase i was using the black backchartreuse in my club tournament this past weekend and broke the bill off two of them while deflecting them off some woodexactly what theyre made for i maybe got 2030 casts out of each one before they broke im contacting strike king to see if there was a batch that had a defect i bought these because they catch fish and theyre reasonably priced they still catch fish but i realized its very expensive when youre paying 6 for a bait that only lasts 30 casts from nick indianapolis in 6415comments one of the best squarebills out there for the price tons of colors as well ive lost count of how many bass ive caught with these i have 2 boxes of these kvd squarebills and i just order 3 more i have had several break on me mostly the bills and had one break in half the hooks are ok i do replace them with red mustad or laser sharp trebles from pao pa 52615comments this

fishing i caught 10 fish ranging 1540 lbs i would definitely recommend this bait to anyone looking to catch some nice bassfrom cole ca 51615comments this crank is great when its new but once you start using it always seems to break one thing i can say is that this crank does catch really big fish from gabriel ut 51415comments this bait by far has caught me more fish than any other lure ever ive ever tried ive caught bass on this from any thing from 43 water temps to 86 water temps its caught me my biggest bass ive ever caught a 8lb 3 ounce pig for iowa thats a monster i fish a incredibly large amount of time and ive caught bass on it every time i go out will never stop using thesefrom samuel ia 32615comments this bait works great over grass either rip it free after hitting grass or retrieve it at a medium pace and kill it and they just cant handle it i have every size in the natural bluegill color except in the 80 and 10 both of which are on the list i swear by that color and it looks amazing in the water pair them with some kvd 1x strong 2x short treble hooks and you have a serious weapon at your disposal i have about 10 in diffrent sizes and colors 80 is on its way from michael smithfield va 31415comments not sure how or why so many people are having problems with broken bills ive got a whole box full of these not a one has had that issue i fish em on 1520 lb fluorocarbon burn em bang em off rocks crash them into tree limbs or dock pilings theyve always held up catch lots of fish too which is the most important part from steve md 11615comments great lure you cant beat it for 549 my favorite is the original sexy shad but other colors work great i have had some issues with the hooks bending but for 549 you should not expect perfection i would say 45 for a regular crankbait but for a crankbait for only 549 55 i highly recommend this bait from mitch mn 1415comments i have a whole box full of these crankbaits with broken lips some are cracked vertical where they are glued together some are cracked completely off these are productive baits but they are not durable no mater what the other reviews say you also have to change out the hooks because the front treble constantly gets hung up on the diving lip from nick usa 123014comments the best for the price you just cant go wrong caught some nice basswalley and pike with these square bill black backchart works awesome for me from yvon ottawa 101214comments this bait is definitely one for the books great price and it always runs true id like to see some more detail in the colors but other than that i will continue to place this bait on my line from wisconsin angling outdoors wi 92914comments these cranks out perform all other cranks ive tried i speed cast windy banks and crush the foodchain bass that are there best colors are the shads in cool water and gills in warm water from flapjaw mi 91814comments i love these squarebills good price great value and every one ive gotten runs true right out of the box from shane santee sc 9814comments you cant get a more productive square bill for the price it simply catches fish all sizes youve got a color for every bait and water situation these little crank baits are the answer to your shallow fishing needs throw the 10 the 10 catches big bass little bass pike pickerel big panfish catfish etc to weed out the small fish throw the 15 or 25 that requires bait casting bump it off rocks docks logs grass and pause always pause so that it floats up out of harms way and subsequently inhaled by a big fish you can burn it so that it gets down to 6 feet or wake it at the top but epoxy the bill and downsize the front treble the hooks are sticky sharp but the front one hooks the bill get ya some from ben pittsfield ma 61914comments okay i promised another review after customer service dealt with my warranty claim and it turned me back into a believer they were more than willing to help fix the problem and stand behind their product i sent the baits back and they returned me new ones with some extras within 1 week i was very happy and i will stand behind any company that stands behind their products well done strike king from sean mi 53014comments i have the exact same review of sean i have fished these for a while and really like striking products but the last four i have bought the bill broke off did not hit any thing hard with them not sure what the deal is from harrison id 52414comments i have fished these in the past and loved them i ordered 4 more and got out to fish them yesterday i was less than impressed to say the least fishing on the edge of a sand flat no rocks or even weeds when on the 12th cast or so i realized i could not feel the bait for the last 20 feet or so only to realize the bill had broken off approx 1 cm from the body i switched colors and on the 3rd cast the bill broke in the exact same spot and looked identical to the already broken one the breaks were consistent so i am assuming there was a manufacturing defect in the bills i contacted strike king and will post another review updating their customer service i will not be purchasing more of these from sean mi 5914comments you cannot be wrong with this crankbait excellent action good castablity good price hardiness and definitively it catches fish i bought two colours but the gizzard shad worked so well to me that i havent tried the other from quino sevilla spain 5514comments i cant say enough about strike king lures i have several 25s and 15s and i have had zero problems out of any of them they have a good action with a wide wobble theyre very durable have sharp strong hooks and run true right out of the pack great color schemes i have banged mine off of seawalls rocks docks stumps just about anything you can think of and the paint has held up i have the bluegill chart perch sexy shad black back chart and gizzard shad i personally like the 25s better than the 15s but there is a time and place for both by far the best square bill out from j c usa 42914comments this bait gets action every time i hit the water ive caught too many bass on the 15 not to have it tied on the only downside is the lips break too often i fished for 3 hours the other night and broke lips off two 15s they flat out catch fish thoughfrom scott ky 42114comments these little crankbaits are awesome i fish the 10 for smallmouth and the 15 for largemouth they have the best action out of all the other squarebills ive fished go get ya somefrom henry usa 41714comments first time using my 15 in the neon bluegill color and man did they eat it caught 6 on it the first day the action on this thing is unbelievable it has a really nice wobble that just drives the fish crazy had no problems with the trebles getting a good hook set but will eventually replace em at some point great lure come to expect nothing less from strike king from tyler parkerburg wv 4114comments this little crank bait is the best try to never hit the lake without one i prefer the 15 in black back chart but every color works great fish them shallow along shore lines and stumps get some now from sam anderson sc 33114comments the glue split apart and now i cant even use them they had nice hooks and they caught fish but over 10 of 15 of them are garbage because o the glue splitting apart from greg il 33014comments you can call them

ton of bass on the sexy and chartreuse colors on my local lakes and ponds for such a low price these cracks cant be beat from kirk roscoe il 32214comments works good love the action but the paint

matthew wicomments these crankbaits are not some kind of secret every one and there brother uses them around here yet the load the boat thats the mark of a great bait i have never had a qc issue with any but i do change the stock hooks to the mustad kvd 2x triple grips what can i say if kvd told me to jump off a cliff i would since they have been out the 15 has produced and this year i started using the 25 when i needed a big bite and it has not dissapointed from basswipe meatwads pond comments i have caught multiple four and five pound fish with this lure i dont want to brag on them too much bc my local tackle shops keep selling out hahah great bait cant be beat is shallow water from josh ilcomments this is the best square billed crank on the market i pulled this thing through weeds that were supper thick and one the second cast i hauled in a five pound bass from riley parker azcomments my favorite crank right now fish have stayed buttoned for me and the bill does a great job deflecting cover and allows me to rip thru grass because hooks ride high above bill from tampa flcomments ive had great luck on the black back chartreuse which tackle warehouse unfortunately doesnt carry but anyways my first outing with this bait i caught two 3 pound bass on a hot day and a full moon goes to show you this bait does catch fish i even caught a fish while my line was hung up in a tree pretty awesome i will be buying many more from joe comments one of the best cranks ive ever owned fished the chartruse sexy shad twice and have been pleased both times seems to be really killer on the sunny days great action from tyler allendale micomments best square bill on the market in my opinion catch loads of better than average bass on kentucky and lake barkley if you have never fished kentucky lake you need to plan on doing so kentucky lake is a great fishery check out some of my youtube videos fishing kentucky lake from fishinkentucky24 kycomments bluegill 15 killer pattern no wonder why its always out of stock this pattern has been my top producing square bill after waiting for a whole month to get this in its literally bang up from catching so many fish from bvang fresno cacomments caught about 40 bass and 20 were keepers on black back chartreuse 10 before a pike swallowed it and snapped the line one of the best little baits ever made from nolan micomments this is a great shallow diving crank and i live in iowadid u read that iowa bass fishing is tough sometimes and sometimes really goodbut this is one of the most beast cranks out there one day at around 2 oclock i was throwing the sexy shad color and had six solid bass in half an hour one was 4 and a half pounds i also had some success on the 15 chili craw casting by trees overall a great crank from noah iacomments just got my series 15 today in sexy sunfish color i have a feeling that this bait will be catching alot of big bass for me this year from nathan nccomments just got back from the lake and caught a 5 on the bluegill color as well as several 2 and 3 pounders great bait would recomend it for all ages from david spokane wacomments i have fished the same one for a year straight and mines fine just switch the hooks from jesse phx azcomments i dont know why all you guys are saying the bill breaks because franklyit doesnti smashed this bait of a dock 3 or 4 times yesterday and i was bumpin stumpslogs rocks etc so i have no clue on how you guys manage to break the bills off from shane hinsdale macomments these are some pretty nice cranks between me and my brothers we probably have all of the colors these catch bass of all sizes seen small as one year old bass to seven pounders caught on this crank awesome crank from fire tiger california delta comments great bait the only problem i had was the hooks are weak i lost a 8lb plus bass the other day when the hook straigtened out on me from brett flcomments these bait rocks for the price lost my sexy shad last weekend to a hog error on my side and a weak knot two more came in today thanks tw sadly sloppy job on gluing the bill u can see china man finger prints all over the bill hope these prints enhance water movement lol still going to catch fish from b fresno cacomments i dont know why people say this bait is junk i went to a local lake and caught over 30 fish with all the stock hooks no problems i lost in a tree but that happens if u dont know how to work it threw cover from jeremy atascadero cacomments jim square bill cranks do get hungup occasionally it doesnt matter how well they are designed this is a great crankbait from luke alcomments i have fished this bait in many ponds and rivers aroiund my house and havent been anywhere this bait wont produce my favorite is the 15 because you have a nice balance not to big not to small but if you want a big bight go with the 25 and if the bite is tough the 10 will catch em year round from tristan hoover alcomments top notch i always catch something on these baits from tim txcomments there is a reason why these have been the top seller on tw for over a yearthey work i picked up a few 10 in chart shad and chrome sexy shad and hit the lake in my kayak ice out was about a week and a half ago so that water was cccooold i found some stumps and ran this bait over them and into them and i grabbed three 3 lbrs and few 2s and two 4lbrs slilent small crank was key to be subtle and match the early baitfish size from bassmaster comments this bait is great i have the black back chartruese chartruese sexy shad and ive caight tons of bass already i just bought the bluegill and orange belly craw in 10 get some now from lance pecker comments have used these for a while and have caught smallmouth walleye and pike on this squarebill the paint jobs on these lures is very durable the action of these is amazing from kyle micomments have had a few of these now for about 6 months and couldnt be happier i have found that they work great in 8 to 12 feet of water with some taller brush only trouble ive had is the front hook sometimes getting hooked on the bill but other than that they have great action and very durable ive even caught a few pike on this and its held up ive used mainly 15s but plan to use a few 1s in the spring just ordered 5 more from josh madison wicomments i tried this bait for the first time during a tournament the other day i was able to catch a key 5th fish using the blue gill color 25 in 52 degree water the bait bounced off wood great and the action on it was awesome i really like the bait so far its a great bait especially for the price i didnt replace the stock hooks like i usually do but they still performed well i will be buying some more of the crankbaitsfrom tom north charleston sccomments im new to these lures but they work well 15 and 25 in sexy shad people complain about the hooks but i can count the fish i have lost with 2 fingers great lures i need to try some other colors next awesome wobble it drives the fish nuts from trey jupiter flcomments one of the best crankbaits i have ever used bass love them there paint is great doesnt chip from mike akron ohio comments these are great baits no doubt its just why put such a carppy paint job on them the colors are great dont get me wrong its just the quality especially the cromegold jobs redeye shads are the same way not going to stop buying them though due to the fish catching ability th 10 is gonna be a winter killerfrom rusty texas where else comments this is by far the best crankbait i have ever used i got the 15 inch in bluegill and chart shad when they came out sadly i threw both of them off due to crappy snap and goes when i went to buy another bluegill 15 it was the new crappy color that looks nothing like a bluegill the 25 inch is the good color so if you want bluegill get 25 inch overall igive this product 5 stars from ethan noblesville incomments super popular bait everyone has em and throws em but ya know what they catch fish i hate using what everyone else does but damn itthey catch fish have i mentioned that they catchyou get it if you have no faith in cranks or are just starting outhere you go from meatwad not out west comments love mine ive never really had any luc with crankbaits until i used this the other day me and my buddy caught 17 bass one weighing 8 and a couble 56 pounds in 1 hour great bait love sexy shad from ben comments great squarebill i have caught many fish on them but i have one problemif i throw it with a little velosity and it hits a dock or some wood the plastic chamber that holds the weight breaks and then the crankbait is extremely off balance and doesnt run right still a great crank and will buy more from cody florida comments not sure if it is the size but size 1 does not run true more specifically it it is horrible i am using a 521 gear ratio with a slow retrieve and its on top of the water pretty much a waste of money 25 has been great for me has not produced any fish yet but they run true and have a nice wobble to them from brett rochester nycomments love this bait so far in cold water conditions i think it produces the best i perfer the 15 size the best because you can still catch average size fish and still get the bigger bite also bluegill color is one of my favorites and went out fishing the other day and caught over 40 bass witch is the most iv ever caught in one day it was crazy will be getting more of these soon in the new size as well and in some diffrent colors from matt ilcomments definitely my favorite crankbait in my opinion the 15 in green gizzard shad is one of the best baits for highly pressure lakes and reservoirs a slow and steady retrieve usually gets the job done from kurt njcomments put the kvd hooks on and you have a real fishcatchingfun lure to use anytime bass are in shallow water from banks kimberly alcomments just an amazing crankbait i just started fishing with it and everytime even in tought conditions it payed off i outfished in size and in quality people using lucky craft i dont thinks ill buy any lucky craft anymore strike king is the deals kvd 15 and 25 set the hook from alexis canada comments these baits are great for the budget minded fisherman they have great action and are easy to work the only problem ive found is they hang up easy working them through wooded areas if you want the best squarelip crankbait for all situations you cant beat the lucky craft rick clunn series crankbait that these obviously are a knockoff of you can buy almost 3 of these though to one of those from bryan austin txcomments caught a 2 lb white bass first cast with the chtblk back very nice action i replaced the front hook with a 4 red lazer sharp treble 15 is perfect size 910from bill wvcomments used the bluegill pattern in texas and caught a good bit in some shallow grass but i also lost some i would recommend changing out the trebels if you can but besides that there a good little crank from billy comments these kvd 15 cranks have plain out caught me fish when other cranks wouldnt that silent bait is a great change up thx sk  kvdfrom sonny east wareham macomments things are so great i was fishin greenwood lake in nj it was gettin slow middle of the day with bright sunshine and i thought to myself when the bite gets tough go silent  kvd so i threw on the kvd silent 15 in green gizzard shad and started cranking it along a 6 foot flat bass were killing it in the middle of the day this crankbait is a must from kurt njcomments these are good cranks but strike king needs to get better hooks i lost 2 good fish on these yesterday replace hooks and it should be good to go from leng siloam springs arcomments as a follow up of my last review i got a few more colors and all work well but the black backchart had a shad dot and a red gill which kinda turned me off on the color it still catches fish though over all a great bait ps change the hooks from jonathon nashville tncomments all time favorite crankbait catches lil dinks to 8 12 pound lunkers for me fishing private ponds rippin through grass great bait by strike king from geoffrey spring hill flcomments great product for the money have caught alot of fish with the only problem being the hooks from chris central valley cacomments caught a ton of bass on this bait the hooks broke after 4 fish just switch the hooks and you have yourself a fish catching machine from terry roscommon micomments this is a pretty decent bait for the money i have broken the bills off of about 6 or 7 of these baits but have also broken bills off of 15dollar lucky craft rc crankbaits so maybe i am just a little rough on crankbaits i would say the quality overall is as good as the rc baits for about 13rd the price good job strike king i wish they could make a bait the size of a 15 but in a 12oz model  from jeremy punxsutawney pacomments this is an outstanding product from strike king great action good hooks awesome patterns works great around wood and rocks green gizzard and blue gill were getting pounded by smallies and rock bass all day in a reservoir near me will be getting some more of the 15 and maybe a 25 from joseph liverpool nycomments these are awesome i caught some nice bass off the bluegill color this is awesome i switched the hooks now im gonna buy another 15 and 25 and see how the hooks work love these crankbaits from chavez nmcomments i have a couple of these in the 15 and then specifically the 25 in the bluegill and sexy sunfish the bluegill had been my goto lure of choice at a local favorite spot for staging bass landed a number of 4 lbers with no probs i know kvd said he had swapped out the factory hooks for the bassmaster classic but i found the hooks to be just fine overall good affordable shallowdiving crank from svm lax wicomments this bait is amazing i got the sexy sunfish and sexy shad on the first day i got to fish for about 2 hours and caught over 20 fish and a 5 pound kicker the hooks are good but changed mine out with spin techs kept the others if i ever need extras good paint and bill holds up great i will soon buy more also the 15 will catch a lot more fish and big fish but if you need a kicker the 25 will do it for you from jonathon nashville tncomments this crankbait is so awesome it will catch a bunch of fish it caught me one trout and some bass awesome bait from richard dulce nmcomments caught several pike on it and a couple nice bass as well i was absolutely hammering this thing into chunk rock and it held up perfectly one pike actually threw it when it was going ballistic but it belly hooked itself and i still landed it in other words i wont be bothering with switching out the hooks from seth spokane wacomments just know that the bill will break on you maybe i had a sour grape in the batch but mine broke after 1520 casts lure provides great action and it does catch big bass green gizzard  ghost seems to work best for me from cvang mpls mncomments i love this bait the ones i bought had perfect hooks theyve stayed nice and sharp too it being silent has really allowed me to catch fish under conditions in which i wouldnt even originally consider throwing a crankbait the paint on them is really good as well all around good bait only complaint is local dealers cant keep the dang things in stockfrom dylan gacomments strange thing this complaint regarding crap hooks ive caught at least a dozen bass off my chartreuse sexy 15 over 6 lbs so far this spring and ive lost none i havent even changed the hooks and this is after fishing over rock and shells some of you folks might want to examine your rod reel and line combination rather than criticize strike king from robert calhoun gacomments havent had any problems with any breaking comes through cover great great search bait from joe cacomments the only thing i can say about this thing is its okay its very cheaply made the paintjob is good but thats about it when you buy one replace the hooks on it i did lose 3 fish on this bait that couldve won me the tournament i fished todaybut i blame that on the angler not the bait another thing is the bill breaks and scratches way too easily i had the bill break on mine just by it brushing the side of a dock so no thanks strike king ill stick with the rc 15s from alan talbott tncomments they catch fish but everything about them is fragile broke three in one weekend two bills one set of hooks from corey nhcomments this is the best crankbait iv ever used runs great out of the package finally got to use it in a tournment and caught a few large mouth and smallmouth of the blackblack chart from mike channahon il
