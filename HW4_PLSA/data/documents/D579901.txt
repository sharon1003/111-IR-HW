benefits shortterm disability plan design affects behavior outcomes by stephen miller jul 9 2009like save print emailreuse permissions new orleans—by making simple plan design changes employers can reduce costs from unnecessarily prolonged absences under their shortterm disability std programs said maria henderson a health and productivity principal with hdmsolutions inc henderson spoke on june 30 at the 2009 society for human resource management annual conference during a session on shortterm disability plan design effects on employee behavior and outcomes put plan design on your radar screen she advised in order to understand and mitigate unintended effects on employee behavior length of fulltime leave the maximum length of benefits under std plans ranges from 90 days to 52 weeks and typically exhausts at 180 days or 26 weeks offering longer std benefits might not be doing employees on leave a favor since studies show that if employees are out for more than six months the odds that they will return to work on a regular basis drop dramatically in contrast employees are two times more likely to return to fulltime work with transition work henderson said so for employees on leave who cant perform their normal duties for example because of the physical strain she advised requiring participation in a returntowork rtw program that provides some form of appropriate physically lighter work that will bring these employees back into the worksite in the written disability plan do not include language that would result in employees being able to refuse a temporary or transitional assignment and continue to receive benefits when the company has identified productive work she recommended use language to require employees to assume any transitional assignment available relapserecurrence period on the other hand beware of allowing employees to run serial std claims by returning to their normal duties briefly and then filing a new std claim for what is essentially the same condition they thus avoid shifting to longterm disability with lesser benefits plans with a strong returntowork focus and high productivity outcomes have a cycle of at least 30 days back on the job before an employee can file a new std claim henderson said while many plans provide a standard 14 days if the recurrence period is too short its difficult to determine whether the person is able to sustain permanent employment or just toughing it out until they can file an std claim for a new condition she observed wage replacement rate wage replacement rates under std programs range typically from 60 percent of salary to twothirds to be concurrent with workers compensation to 100 percent often with tiered benefit structures eg 100 percent of predisability earnings for the first 14 weeks and 80 percent thereafter but henderson cautioned that the watershed level for wage replacement is 70 percent over 70 percent increases lost time she said because employees feel they can cut back on expenses and stay out she noted that benchmarking studies comparing leaves taken within the same industry for the same type of work and the same conditions show that leave duration periods were at least 20 percent higher than normal when companies offered 100 percent income replacement whereas below 70 percent reduced lost time because employees who were able to return to work had a financial incentive to do so and reclaim their full salary in short 70 percentplus is an incentive not to come back to work she said leave durations were at least 20 percent higher than normal when companies offered 100 percent income replacement pretax vs aftertax benefits employers can give their employees the opportunity to choose each year whether to pay short and longterm disability premiums on a pre or aftertax basis without causing the plan to be treated as a contributory plan under applicable treasury regulations henderson pointed out referencing irs revenue ruling 200455 this is significant because it outlines a way employers can give their employees substantial flexibility to determine whether their short or longterm disability benefits will be subject to tax she noted employees can avoid taxes on their disability benefits by paying the premiums themselves with aftertax dollars or by including the value of employerpaid premiums in their income would you rather have 60 percent of your pay taxed when you are on disability or receive your disability pay tax free she asked while aftertax premiums can be a benefitenhancer for some employees — think of it as the disability income equivalent of a roth 401 k — henderson commented that offering this option can complicate the annual election process and add complexity to open enrollment consequently it increases the need for detailed communications from hr elimination period following the waiting period after which an employee becomes eligible for std benefits eg six months after the hire date the elimination period is the amount of time an employee is away from work before std leave begins usually it runs concurrent with the period covered by sick leave or paid time off pto which can be from day one of disability to after an elimination period of three seven 14 or 30 days but the rules can get complex such as offering std after day one for hospitalization or accidents but requiring a sevenday wait for other triggers henderson recounted that officials of one leading u s company unidentified couldnt understand why they were encountering substantially longer std leaves and related expenses than their similarly situated competitors henderson said you had only to look at their plan to understand why it provided that std kicked in after 31 days and at that time the plan reinstated all pto and vacation time that the employee had used during the leave employees out for removal of a gall bladder which usually takes three weeks for surgery and recovery were asking their doctors to squeak their disability certification to say 35 days so they could keep all their pto and vacation days henderson said once the plan was redesigned to eliminate this incentive recovery times reverted back to the benchmark as did the companys std costs hendersons recommendation the best practice is an elimination period of three to seven days with benefits starting day four or day eight after the medical disability and a maximum benefit duration of 24 to 26 weeks then shifting to longterm leave a main consideration is concurrency and centralization of fmla family and medical leave act and std administration she added offering a concluding tip henderson advised the key to reducing costs and absence duration is early intervention stephen miller is an online managereditor for shrm online
