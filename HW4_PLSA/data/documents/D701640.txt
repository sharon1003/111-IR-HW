from wikipedia the free encyclopedia redirected from opioid crisisnavigation search overdose deaths involving opioids united states 2000–2015 deaths per 100000 population 1the opioid epidemic or opioid crisis is the rapid increase in the use of prescription and nonprescription opioid drugs in the united states and canada beginning in the late 1990s and continuing throughout the first two decades of the 2000s opioids are a diverse class of moderately strong painkillers including oxycodone commonly sold under the trade names oxy contin and percocet  hydrocodone  vicodin  and a very strong painkiller fentanyl which is synthesized to resemble other opiates such as opium derived morphine and heroin the potency and availability of these substances despite their high risk of addiction and overdose have made them popular both as formal medical treatments and as recreational drugs due to their sedative effects on the part of the brain which regulates breathing opioids in high doses present the potential for respiratory depression and may cause respiratory failure and death 2according to the u s drug enforcement administration overdose deaths particularly from prescription drugs and heroin have reached epidemic levels 3 iii nearly half of all opioid overdose deaths in 2016 involved prescription opioids 1 from 1999 to 2008 overdose death rates sales and substance abuse treatment admissions related to opioid pain relievers all increased substantially 4 by 2015 annual overdose deaths from heroin alone surpassed deaths from both car accidents and guns with other opioid overdose deaths also on the rise 5drug overdoses have since become the leading cause of death of americans under 50 with twothirds of those deaths from opioids 6 in 2016 the crisis decreased overall life expectancy of americans for the second consecutive year 7 overall life expectancy fell from 787 to 786 years men were disproportionately more affected due to higher overdose death rates with life expectancy declining from 763 to 761 years womens life expectancy remained stable at 811 years 7in 2016 over 64000 americans died from overdoses 21 percent more than the almost 53000 in 2015 6 8 9 by comparison the figure was 16000 in 2010 and 4000 in 1999 10 11 while death rates varied by state 12 public health experts estimate that nationwide over 500000 people could die from the epidemic over the next 10 years 13 in canada half of the overdoses were accidental while a third were intentional the remainder were unknown 14 many of the deaths are from an extremely potent opioid fentanyl which is trafficked from mexico 15 the epidemic cost the united states an estimated 504 billion in 2015 16cdc director thomas frieden said that america is awash in opioids urgent action is critical 17 the crisis has changed moral social and cultural resistance to street drug alternatives such as heroin 18 in march 2017 larry hogan the governor of maryland declared a state of emergency to combat the opioid epidemic 19 and in july 2017 opioid addiction was cited as the  fda s biggest crisis 20 on october 26 2017 president donald trump concurred with his commissions report

were fewer than 3000 overdose deaths in 1970 when a heroin epidemic was raging in u s cities there were fewer than 5000 recorded in 1988 around the height of the crack epidemic more than 64000 americans died from drug overdoses last year 2016 according to the u s centers for disease control and prevention mike strobe ap medical writer 23opiates such as morphine have been used for pain relief in the united states since the 1800s and were used during the american civil war opiates soon became known as a wonder drug and were prescribed for a wide array of ailments even for relatively minor treatments such as cough relief 24 bayer began marketing heroin commercially in 1898 beginning around 1920 however the addictiveness was recognized and doctors became reluctant to prescribe opiates 25 heroin was made an illegal drug with the antiheroin act of 1924 in which the u s congress banned the sale importation or manufacture of heroin in the 1950s heroin addiction was known among jazz musicians but still fairly uncommon among average americans many of whom saw it as a frightening condition 18 the fear extended into the 1960s and 1970s although it became common to hear or read about drugs such as marijuana and psychedelics which were widely used at rock concerts like woodstock 18 heroin addiction began to make the news around 1970 when rock stars such as janis joplin jimi hendrix and jim morrison whom most people did not know were addicted died from overdoses during and after the vietnam war addicted soldiers returned from vietnam where heroin was easily bought heroin addiction grew within lowincome housing projects during the same time period 18 in 1971 congressmen released an explosive report on the growing heroin epidemic among u s servicemen in vietnam finding that ten to fifteen percent were addicted to heroin the nixon white house panicked wrote political editor christopher caldwell and declared drug abuse public enemy number one 26 by 1973 there were 15 overdose deaths per 100000 people 18modern prescription opiates such as vicodin and percocet entered the market in the 1970s but acceptance took several years and doctors were apprehensive about prescribing them 24 until the 1980s physicians had been taught to avoid prescribing opioids because of their addictive nature 25 a brief letter published in the new england journal of medicine nejm in january 1980 titled  addiction rare in patients treated with narcotics  generated much attention and changed this thinking 27 28 a group of researchers in canada claim that the letter may have originated and contributed to the opioid crisis 27 the nejm published its rebuttal to the 1980 letter in june 2017 pointing out among other things that the conclusions were based on hospitalized patients only and not on patients taking the drugs after they were sent home 29 the original author dr hershel jick has said that he never intended for the article to justify widespread opioid use 27in the midtolate 1980s the crack epidemic followed widespread cocaine use in american cities the death rate was worse reaching almost 2 per 100000 in 1982 vice president george h w bush and his aides began pushing for the involvement of the cia and the u s military in drug interdiction efforts the socalled war on drugs 30 the initial promotion and marketing of oxy contin was an organized effort throughout 19962001 to dismiss the risk of opioid addiction purdue pharmaceutical hosted over forty promotional conferences at three select locations in the southwest and southeast of the united states coupling a convincing partners against pain campaign with an incentivized bonus system purdue trained its salesforce to convey the message that the risk of addiction was under one percent ultimately influencing the prescribing habits of the medical professionals that attended these conferences 31 by comparison the opioid epidemic was killing on average 103 people per 100000 in 2016 with the highest rates including over 30 per 100000 in new hampshire and over 40 per 100000 in west virginia 18according to the substance abuse and mental health services administration s national survey on drug use and health in 2016 more than 11 million americans misused prescription opioids nearly 1 million used heroin and 21 million had an addiction to prescription opioids or heroin 32while rates of overdose of legal prescription opiates has leveled off in the past decade overdoses of illicit opiates have surged since 2010 nearly tripling 33heroin  editbetween 46 of people who misuse prescription opioids turn to heroin and 80 of heroin addicts began by abusing prescription opioids 34in 2014 it was estimated that more than half a million americans had an addiction to heroin 35oxycodone  editoxycodone is the most widely used recreational opioid in america the u s department of health and human services estimates that about 11 million people in the u s consume oxycodone in a nonmedical way annually 36oxycodone was first made available in the united states in 1939 in the 1970s the fda classified oxycodone as a schedule ii drug indicating a high potential for abuse and addiction in 1996 purdue pharma introduced oxy contin a controlled release formulation of oxycodone 37 in 2007 purdue paid 600 million in fines after being prosecuted for making false claims about the risk of drug abuse associated with oxycodone 38 in 2010 purdue pharma reformulated oxy contin using a polymer to make the pills extremely difficult to crush or dissolve in water to reduce oxy contin abuse the fda approved relabeling the reformulated version as abuseresistant 39 however drug users quickly learned how to simply crush the controlled release tablet to swallow inhale or inject the highstrength opioid for a powerful morphinelike high in fact purdue’s private testing conducted in 1995 determined that 68 of the oxycodone could be extracted from an oxy contin tablet when crushed 40oxy contin was removed from the canadian drug formulary in 2012 41 in june 2017 the fda asked the manufacturer to remove its injectable form of oxymorphone opana er from the us market because the drugs benefits may no longer outweigh its risks this being the first time the agency has asked to remove a currently marketed opioid pain medication from sale due to public health consequences of abuse 42fentanyl  editthere have always been drug addicts in need of help but the scale of the present wave of heroin and opioid abuse is unprecedented in maryland the first six months of 2015 saw 121 fentanyl deaths in the first six months of 2016 the figure rose to 446 christopher caldwell senior editor the weekly standard 18fentanyl a newer synthetic opioid painkiller is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine and 30 to 50 times more potent than heroin 18 with only 2 mg becoming a lethal dose it is pure white odorless and flavorless with a potency strong enough that police and first responders helping overdose victims have themselves overdosed by simply touching or inhaling a small amount 43 44 45 as a result the dea has recommended that officers not field test drugs if fentanyl is suspected but instead collect and send samples to a laboratory for analysis exposure via inhalation or skin absorption can be deadly they state 46fentanylrelated deaths increased by 540 percent across the united states since 2015 47 this accounts for almost all the increase in drug overdose deaths from 2015 to 2016 according to a study published in the journal of the american medical association 48fentanyllaced heroin has become a big problem for major cities including philadelphia detroit and chicago 49 its use has caused a spike in deaths among users of heroin and prescription painkillers while becoming easier to obtain and conceal some arrested or hospitalized users are surprised to find that what they thought was heroin was actually fentanyl 18 according to cdc director thomas frieden as overdose deaths involving heroin more than quadrupled since 2010 what was a slow stream of illicit fentanyl a synthetic opioid 50 to 100 times stronger than morphine is now a flood with the amount of the powerful drug seized by law enforcement increasing dramatically america is awash in opioids urgent action is critical 17according to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc death rates from synthetic opioids including fentanyl increased over 72 from 2014 to 2015 50 in addition the cdc reports that the total deaths from opioid overdoses may be undercounted since they do not include deaths that are associated with synthetic opioids which are used as pain relievers the cdc presumes that a large proportion of the increase in deaths is due to illegallymade fentanyl as the statistics on overdose deaths as of 2015 do not distinguish pharmaceutical fentanyl from illegallymade fentanyl the actual death rate could therefore be much higher than reported 51those taking fentanyllaced heroin are more likely to overdose because they do not know they also are ingesting the more powerful drug the most highprofile death involving an accidental overdose of fentanyl was singer prince 52 53 54fentanyl has surpassed heroin as a killer in several locales in all of 2014 the cdc identified 998 fatal fentanyl overdoses in ohio which is the same number of deaths recorded in just the first five months of 2015 the u s attorney for the northern district of ohio stated one of the truly terrifying things is the pills are pressed and dyed to look like oxycodone if you are using oxycodone and take fentanyl not knowing it is fentanyl that is an overdose waiting to happen each of those pills is a potential overdose death 55in 2016 the medical news site stat reported that while mexican cartels are the main source of heroin smuggled into the u s chinese suppliers provide both raw fentanyl and the machinery necessary for its production 55 in british columbia police discovered a lab making 100000 fentanyl pills each month which they were shipping to calgary alberta 90 people in calgary overdosed on the drug in 2015 55 in southern california a homeoperated drug lab with six pill presses was uncovered by federal agents each machine was capable of producing thousands of pills an hour 55overdoses involving fentanyl have greatly contributed to the havoc caused by the opioid epidemic in new hampshire two thirds of the fatal drug overdoses involved fentanyl and most do not know that they are taking fentanyl in 2017 a cluster of fentanyl overdoses in florida was found to be caused by street sales of fentanyl pills sold as xanax according to the dea one kg of fentanyl can be bought in china for 3000 to 5000 and then smuggled into the united states by mail or mexican drug cartels to generate over 15 million in revenue the profitability of this drug has led dealers to adulterate other drugs with fentanyl without the knowledge of the drug user 56pill mills  edita pill mill is a clinic that dispenses narcotics to patients without a legitimate medical purpose this is done at clinics and doctors offices and the doctors will go through checkups extremely quickly to prescribe painkillers these clinics will often charge an office fee of 200 to 400 dollars and can see up to 60 patients a day which is very profitable for the clinic 57 these pill mills are also large suppliers of the illegal painkiller black markets on the streets 58 dealers may hire people to go to pill mills to get painkiller prescriptions 59 there have been attempts recently to shut down pill mills 250 pill mills in florida were shut down in 2015 60 florida clinics also are no longer allowed to dispense painkillers directly from their clinics which has helped reduce the distribution of prescription opiates 61a pennsylvania doctor was charged with the deaths of five people after prescribing nearly 3 million pills in a 19month period without proper patient examinations 62trafficking  editopiate selfinjection paraphernalia as the number of opioid prescriptions rose drug cartels began flooding the u s with heroin from mexico for many opioid users heroin was cheaper more potent and often easier to acquire than prescription medications 10 according to the cdc tighter prescription policies by doctors did not necessarily lead to this increased heroin use 63 the main suppliers of heroin to the u s have been mexican transnational criminal organizations 10 from 2005–2009 mexican heroin production increased by over 600 from an estimated 8 metric tons in 2005 to 50 metric tons in 2009 10 between 2010 and 2014 the amount seized at the border more than doubled 64 according to the dea smugglers and distributors profit primarily by putting drugs on the street and have become crucial to the mexican cartels 3 3illicit fentanyl is commonly made in mexico and trafficked by cartels 65 north americas dominant trafficking group is mexicos sinaloa cartel which has been linked to 80 percent of the fentanyl seized in new york 66causes  editwhen people continue to use opioids beyond what a doctor prescribes whether to minimize pain or to enjoy the euphoric feelings it can mark the beginning stages of an opiate addiction with a tolerance developing and eventually leading to dependence when a person relies on the drug to prevent withdrawal symptoms 50what the u s surgeon general dubbed the opioid crisis likely began with overprescription of powerful opioid pain relievers in the 1990s which led to them becoming the most prescribed class of medications in the united states as of 2016 more than 289 million prescriptions were written for opioid drugs per year 67 43 in the late 1990s around 100 million people or a third of the u s population were estimated to be affected by chronic pain this led to a push by drug companies and the federal government to expand the use of painkilling opioids 12 between 1991 and 2011 painkiller prescriptions in the u s tripled from 76 million to 219 million per year the most commonly prescribed opioids have been oxycodone  oxy contin and percocet and hydrocodone  vicodin  with the increase in volume the potency of opioids also increased by 2002 one in six drug users were being prescribed drugs more powerful than morphine by 2012 the ratio had doubled to oneinthree 12furthermore the structure of the us healthcare system in which most people are required to get their own insurance in the absence of universal health care favors prescribing drugs over expensive therapies according to professor judith feinberg from the west virginia university school of medicine most insurance especially for poor people wont pay for anything but a pill 68 as a consequence prescription rates for opioids in the us are 40 percent higher than the rate in other developed countries such as germany or canada 69 nevertheless most opioid abusers did not start out as pain patients studies suggest that 75 of opioid abusers started their opioid use by taking drugs which had been obtained in a way other than by legitimate prescription and only 812 of chronic opioid patients became addicted 70despite the increased use of painkillers there has been no change in the amount of pain reported in the u s 71 67 this has led to differing medical opinions with some noting that there is little evidence that opioids are effective for chronic pain not caused by cancer 63the ensuring patient access and effective drug enforcement act which was signed into law by president obama on april 19 2016 decreased the deas ability to intervene in the opioid crisis by modifying the controlled substances act to require the dea to prove imminent danger to the public health and safety before seizing shipments of controlled substances 72effects  editus yearly overdose deaths and the drugs involved among the more than 64000 deaths estimated in 2016 the sharpest increase occurred among deaths related to fentanyl and synthetic opioids  20000 deaths 73see also opioid overdose effects of the opioid epidemic are multifactorial the high death rate by overdose the spread of communicable diseases and the economic burden are major issues caused by the epidemic the opioid epidemic has since emerged as one of the worst drug crises in american history more than 33000 people died from overdoses in 2015 nearly equal to the number of deaths from car crashes with deaths from heroin alone more than from gun homicides 74 it has also left thousands of children suddenly in need of foster care after their parents have died from an overdose 75in alberta a 2017 report stated that emergency department visits as a result of opiate overdose rose 1000 in the past five years 14in 2016 a study estimated that the cost of prescription opioid overdoses abuse and dependence in the united states in 2013 was approximately 785 billion most of which was attributed to health care and criminal justice spending along with lost productivity however in two years statistics show significantly larger estimates because the epidemic has worsened with overdose and with deaths doubling in the past decade the white house stated on november 20 2017 that in 2015 alone the opioid epidemic cost the united states an estimated 504 billion 76spread of disease by drug users has also been an issue rates of hepatitis b and c diagnoses tripled over five years the most effective medications to cure hepatitis c cost around 100000 for a sixmonth course outbreaks of hiv among drug users have been reported in places like austin indiana where 200 new cases were diagnosed 77demographics  editof the 52898 overdose deaths in the usa in 2015 8 opioids were involved in 33091 78 in 2015 the five states with the highest rates of death due to drug overdose were west virginia 415 per 100000 new hampshire 343 per 100000 kentucky 299 per 100000 ohio 299 per 100000 and rhode island 282 per 100000 78 8in the u s addiction and overdose victims are mostly white or native american and workingclass 10 native americans and alaskan natives experienced a fivefold increase in opioidoverdose deaths between 1999 and 2015 with native americans have the highest increase of any demographic group 79 one physician conjectured that this trend may be due to doctors being less likely to prescribe opiates to black patients because of past drug abuse stereotypes 80in america those living in rural areas of the country have been the hardest hit as a percentage of the national population 81 canada is similarly affected with 90 of cities with the highest hospitalization rates having a population below 225000 82western canada has an overdose rate nearly 10 times that of the eastern provinces 83prescription drug abuse has been increasing in teenagers especially as 12 to 17yearolds were onethird of all new abusers of prescription drugs in 2006 teens abuse prescription drugs more than any illicit drug except marijuana more than cocaine heroin and methamphetamine combined per the office of national drug control policys 2008 report prescription for danger  citation needed deaths from overdose of heroin affect a younger demographic than deaths from other opiates 10 the canadian institute for health information found that while overall a third of overdoses were intentional among those ages 15–24 nearly half were intentional 14prescription rates for opioids vary widely across the states in 2012 healthcare providers in the highestprescribing state wrote almost three times as many opioid prescriptions per person as those in the lowestprescribing state health issues that cause people pain do not vary much from place to place and do not explain this variability in prescribing 84 in hawaii doctors wrote about 52 prescriptions for every 100 people whereas in alabama they wrote almost 143 prescriptions per 100 people researchers suspect that the variation results from a lack of consensus among doctors in different states about how much pain medication to prescribe a higher rate of prescription drug use does not lead to better health outcomes or patient satisfaction according to studies 10in palm beach county florida overdose deaths went from 149 in 2012 to 588 in 2016 85 in middletown ohio overdose deaths quadrupled in the 15 years since 2000 86 in british columbia 967 people died of an opiate overdose in 2016 and the canadian medical association expected over 1500 deaths in 2017 87 in pennsylvania the number of opioid deaths increased 44 percent from 2016 to 2017 with 5200 deaths in 2017 governor tom wolf declared a state of emergency in response to the crisis 88table opioid prescriptions per 100 persons in 2012 89  show state opioid prescriptions written rank outside north america  editapproximately 80 percent of the global pharmaceutical opioid supply is consumed in the united states 90 it has also become a serious problem outside the u s mostly among young adults 91 the concern not only relates to the drugs themselves but to the fact that in many countries doctors are less trained about drug addiction both about its causes or treatment 71 according to an epidemiologist at columbia university once pharmaceuticals start targeting other countries and make people feel like opioids are safe we might see a spike in opioid abuse it worked here why wouldnt it work elsewhere 71the majority of deaths worldwide from overdoses were from either medically prescribed opioids or illegal heroin in europe prescription opioids accounted for threequarters of overdose deaths among those between ages 15 and 39 91 some worry that the epidemic could become a worldwide pandemic if not curtailed 71 prescription drug abuse among teenagers in canada australia and europe were at rates comparable to u s teenagers 71 in lebanon and saudi arabia and in parts of china surveys found that one in ten students had used prescription painkillers for nonmedical purposes similar high rates of nonmedical use were found among the young throughout europe including spain and the united kingdom 71from january to august 2017 there were 60 fatal overdoses of fentanyl in the uk 92countermeasures  editu s government  editin 2010 the us government began cracking down on pharmacists and doctors who were overprescribing opioid painkillers an unintended consequence of this was that those addicted to prescription opiates turned to heroin a significantly more potent but cheaper opioid as a substitute 12 18 a 2017 survey in utah of heroin users found about 80 percent started with prescription drugs 93in 2010 the controlled substances act was amended with the secure and responsible drug disposal act which allows pharmacies to accept controlled substances from households or longterm care facilities in their drug disposal programs or takeback programs 94in 2011 the federal government released a white paper describing the administrations plan to deal with the crisis its concerns have been echoed by numerous medical and government advisory groups around the world 95 96 97 in july 2016 president barack obama signed into law the comprehensive addiction and recovery act which expands opioid addiction treatment with buprenorphine and authorizes millions of dollars in funding for opioid research and treatment 98in 2016 the u s surgeon general listed statistics which describe the extent of the problem 67 the house and senate passed the ensuring patient access and effective drug enforcement act which was signed into law by president obama on april 19 2016 and may have decreased the deas ability to intervene in the opioid crisis 72 in december 2016 the 21st century cures act which includes 1 billion in state grants to fight the opioid epidemic was passed by congress by a wide bipartisan majority 945 in the senate 39226 in the house of representatives 99 and was signed into law by president obama 100as of march 2017 president donald trump appointed a commission on the epidemic chaired by governor chris christie of new jersey 101 102 103 on august 10 2017 president trump agreed with his commissions report released a few weeks earlier and declared the countrys opioid crisis a national emergency 104 105 trump nominated representative tom marino to be director of the office of national drug control policy or drug czar 106 however on october 17 2017 marino withdrew his nomination after it was reported that his relationship with the drug industry might be a conflict of interest 107 108 in july 2017 fda commissioner scott gottlieb stated that for the first time pharmacists nurses and physicians would have training made available on appropriate prescribing of opioid medicines because opioid addiction had become the fdas biggest crisis 20in april 2017 the department of health and human services announced their opioid strategy consisting of five aims improve access to prevention treatment and recovery support services to prevent the health social and economic consequences associated with opioid addiction and to enable individuals to achieve longterm recoverytarget the availability and distribution of overdosereversing drugs to ensure the broad provision of these drugs to people likely to experience or respond to an overdose with a particular focus on targeting highrisk populationsstrengthen public health data reporting and collection to improve the timeliness and specificity of data and to inform a realtime public health response as the epidemic evolvessupport cuttingedge research that advances our understanding of pain and addiction leads to the development of new treatments and identifies effective public health interventions to reduce opioidrelated health harms and advance the practice of pain management to enable access to highquality evidencebased pain care that reduces the burden of pain for individuals families and society while also reducing the inappropriate use of opioids and opioidrelated harms 32samhsa administers the opioid state targeted response grants a twoyear program authorized by the 21st century cures act which provided 485 million to states and u s territories in the fiscal year 2017 for the purpose of preventing and combatting opioid misuse and addiction 32state and local governments  editin july 2016 governors from 45 u s states and three territories entered into a formal compact to fight opioid addiction they agreed that collective action would be needed to end the opioid crisis and they would coordinate their responses across all levels of government and the private sector including opioid manufacturers and doctors 109in march 2017 several states issues responses to the opioid crisis the governor of maryland declared a state of emergency to combat the rapid increase in overdoses by increasing and speeding up coordination between the state and local jurisdictions 110 19 in 2016 about 2000 people in the state had died from opioid overdoses 111 delaware which has the 12thhighest overdose death rate in the u s introduced bills to limit doctors ability to overprescribe painkillers and improve access to treatment in 2015 228 people had died from overdose which increased 35—to 308—in 2016 112 a similar plan was created in michigan which introduced the michigan automated prescription system maps allowing doctors to check when and what painkillers have already been prescribed to a patient and thereby help keep addicts from switching doctors to receive drugs 113 114 in maine new laws were imposed which capped the maximum daily strength of prescribed opioids and which limited prescriptions to seven days 18during the 2017 general session of the utah legislature rep edward h redd and sen todd weiler proposed amendments to utahs involuntary commitment statutes which would allow relatives to petition a court to mandate substanceabuse treatment for adults 115 93in west virginia which leads the nation in overdose deaths per capita lawsuits seek to declare drug distribution companies a public nuisance in an effort to place accountability upon the drug industry for the costs associated with the epidemic 116 117 in february 2017 officials in everett washington filed a lawsuit against purdue pharma the manufacturer of oxy contin for negligence by allowing drugs to be illegally trafficked to residents and failing to prevent it the city wants the company to pay the costs of handling the crisis 118arizonas governor doug ducey signed the arizona opioid epidemic act on january 26 2018 to confront the states opioid crisis in maricopa county which includes phoenix 3114 overdoses were reported from june 15 2017 through january 11 2018 119 the law provides 10 million for treatment and limits an initial prescription to five days with exemptions letter signed by multiple united states senators referring to problems with trump and the ondcpon january 17 2018 several senators including new hampshire senator maggie hassan wrote a letter to president trump expressing extreme concern regarding his lack of commitment to the white house office of nation drug control policy ondcp which plays a critical role in coordinating the federal governments response to the fentanyl heroin and opioid epidemic the letter states that the ondcp and dea drug enforcement administration have both been without permanent senateconfirmed leadership since trump took office and he has not presented the senate with qualified candidates for these positions the senators requested that trump provide their offices with a list of his political appointees to key drug policy positions and those appointees relevant qualifications including appointees at ondcp the department of justice including the dea the substance abuse and mental health services administration samhsa and elsewhere in his administration avalere health has researched recent individual state efforts to combat the opioid crisis by providing access to lifesaving drugs typically associated with opioid overdoses their research measured how states are performing in providing a key frontline treatment for opioid addiction  buprenorphine  compared to the amount of opioid overdose deaths they have by state generally the more access a state can provided drug users to the drug the lower the mortality rate amongst opioid addicts were in a given state 120prescription drug monitoring  editin 2016 the cdc published its guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain recommending opioids only be used when benefits for pain and function are expected to outweigh risks and then used at the lowest effective dosage with avoidance of concurrent opioid and benzodiazepine use whenever possible 121 silvia martins an epidemiologist at columbia university has suggested getting out more information about the risks the greater social acceptance for using these medications versus illegal substances and the misconception that they are safe may be contributing factors to their misuse hence a major target for intervention is the general public including parents and youth who must be better informed about the negative consequences of sharing with others medications prescribed for their own ailments equally important is the improved training of medical practitioners and their staff to better recognize patients at potential risk of developing nonmedical use and to consider potential alternative treatments as well as closely monitor the medications they dispense to these patients 91as of april 2017 prescription drug monitoring programs pdmps exist in every state 122 a person on opioids for more than three months has a 15fold 1500 greater chance of becoming addicted 63 pdmps allow pharmacists and prescribers to access patients prescription histories to identify suspicious use however a survey of us physicians published in 2015 found only 53 of doctors used these programs while 22 were not aware these programs were available 123 the centers for disease control and prevention cdc was tasked with establishing and publishing a new guideline and was heavily lobbied 124 125in the media  editmedia coverage has largely focused on lawenforcement solutions to the epidemic which portray the issue as criminal rather than medical 126 there has been differential reporting on how white suburban or rural addicts of opioids are portrayed compared to black and hispanic urban addicts often of heroin reinforcing stereotypes of drug users and drugusing offenders 127 in newspapers white addicts stories are often given more space allowing for a longer backstory explaining how they became addicted and what potential they had before using drugs black and hispanic addicts are more likely to be dehumanized portrayed criminally and mentioned more briefly 127 in early 2016 the national desk of the washington post began an investigation with assistance from fired dea regulator joseph razzazzisi on the rapidly increasing numbers of opioid related deaths 128while media coverage has focused more heavily on overdoses among whites use among african hispanic and native americans has increased at similar rates deaths by overdose among white black and native americans increased by 200300 from 20102014 during this time period overdoses among hispanics increased 140 and the data available on overdoses by asians was not comprehensive enough to draw a conclusion 10in july 2017 a 400page report by the national academy of sciences presented plans to reduce the addiction crisis which it said was killing 91 people each day 129treatment  editmain article drug abuse treatment the opioid epidemic is often discussed in terms of prevention but helping those who are already addicts is talked about less frequently 126 opioid dependence can lead to a number of consequences like contraction of hiv and overdose for addicts who wish to treat their addiction there are two classes of treatment options available medical and behavioral 130 neither is guaranteed to successfully treat opioid addiction which or which combination is most effective varies from person to person 131these treatments are doctorprescribed and regulated but differ in their treatment mechanism popular treatments include kratom naloxone methadone and buprenorphine which are more effective when combined with a form of behavioral treatment 131methadone  editmethadone has been used for opioid dependence since 1964 and studied the most of the pharmacological treatment options 132 it is a synthetic longacting opioid so it can replace multiple heroin uses by being taken once daily 131 it works by binding to the opioid receptors in the brain and spinal cord activating them reducing withdrawal symptoms and cravings while suppressing the high that other opioids can elicit the decrease in withdrawal symptoms and cravings allow the user to slowly taper off the drug in a controlled manner decreasing the likelihood of relapse it is not accessible to all addicts it is a regulated substance and requires that each dose be picked up from a methadone clinic daily this can be inconvenient as some patients are unable to travel to a clinic or avoid the stigma associated with drug addiction 131naloxone  editnaloxone most commonly sold under the brand name narcan can be used as a rescue medication for opioid overdose or as a preventive measure for those wanting to stop using opiates it is an opioid antagonist meaning it binds to opioid receptors which prevents them from being activated by opiates it binds more strongly than other drugs so that when someone is overdosing on opioids naloxone can be administered allowing it to take the place of the opioid drug in the persons receptors turning them off this blocks the effect of the receptors 131many states have made narcan available for purchase without a prescription additionally peace officers in many districts have begun carrying narcan on a routine basis vivitrol is a longlasting injectable form of naloxone that blocks the effects of opiates for four weeks this eliminates the need to remember to take narcan on a daily basis 133 naloxone is sometimes administered with other drugs such as buprenorphine as a way to taper off buprenorphine over time 131buprenorphine  editbuprenorphine is used similarly to methadone with some doctors recommending it as the best solution for medicationassisted treatment to help people reduce or quit their use of heroin or other opiates it is claimed to be safer and less regulated than methadone with monthlong prescriptions allowed it is also said to eliminate opiate withdrawal symptoms and cravings in many patients without inducing euphoria 134 probuphine is an implantable form of buprenorphine lasting six months 133unlike methadone treatment which must be performed in a highly structured clinic buprenorphine according to samhsa can be prescribed or dispensed in physician offices 135 patients can thereby receive a full year of treatment for a fraction of the cost of detox programs 134behavioral treatment  editit is less effective to use behavioral treatment without medical treatment during initial detoxification it has similarly been shown that medical treatments tend to get better results when accompanied by behavioral treatment 130 popular behavioral treatment options include group or individual therapy residential treatment centers and twelvestep programs such as narcotics anonymous 132safe injection sites  editnorth americas first safe injection site opened in vancouver rather than try to treat to prevent people from using drugs these sites are intended to allow addicts to use drugs in an environment where help is immediately available in the event of an overdose health canada has licensed 16 safe injection sites in the country 136 in canada about half of overdoses resulting in hospitalization were accidental while a third were deliberate overdoses 14countermeasures  editprescription drug monitoring  editbig data technologies like smartphone applications and artificial intelligence have been playing an increasingly prominent role in assisting researchers healthcare providers and law enforcement to identify misuse behavior companies like ibm watson are using their capabilities to help the efforts in curbing opioid abuse the company collaborated with map health management in may 2017 to utilize machine learning in a predictive capacity the collaborative technology will combine prescribers handwriting analyses realtime data from smart devices and patientrisk models to assist treatment providers healthcare insurers and care managers in intervening appropriately to prevent relapses in highrisk patients smartphone apps can also use data to predict and prevent relapse triggr uses data from smartphones that assess likelihood of relapse as relapse likelihood approaches a threshold level triggr engages in intervention techniques including outreach to the user and alerting the users specified relations or care providers in the media  editsocial media may also be an outlet for detecting illegal online sales of opioids in 2017 researchers tested a methodology that used keywords to aggregate tweets and employed unsupervised machine learning and web forensic analyses to identify illegal online marketing of opioids these efforts can aid criminal investigators in identifying violators of the ryan haight online pharmacy
