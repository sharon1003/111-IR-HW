pains in our bodies especially in the low back if you find yourself commonly searching for remedies for fast back pain relief it may be time to investigate the psoas muscle the psoas major technically named iliopsoas may very well be one of the most important muscles in the body why this deepseated core muscle helps support your back and so much more if the psoas is weak it could be the cause of back pain neck pain and various other issues in fact the psoas major muscle is especially unique particularly when it comes to postural function it’s the only muscle that connects the lumbar spine and lower body  1 it’s clear to see taking care of this deep psoas muscle is crucial to a strong painfree body many others believe a healthy psoas is important for emotional and spiritual health too what is the psoas muscle why is it important there are two psoas muscles on each side of the back the larger one is called the psoas major and the smaller the psoas minor the psoas major often known as “the might psoas” originates at the spine around the bottom of the rib cage and runs down the thigh along the femur the psoas major works by flexing the hip the psoas minor also originates at the spine around the bottom of the rib cage but it runs down to the bony pelvis it acts to flex the lower spine  2the psoas helps us perform all sorts of daily activities including freeing the legs for walking and running the psoas muscle is also vital in providing good posture anyone who takes pilates knows the psoas intimately — the form of exercise is praised for improving psoas muscle health and related back pain  3 olympic weightlifters runners triathletes gymnasts — all heavily rely on the support of the psoas too how iliopsoas muscles work 3d anatomy of muscles in motion your browser does

muscles that create what is called the iliopsoas group they are the psoas major and iliacus you have probably heard your fitness instructor suggest stretching the hip flexors at the end of your strength class the psoas major and iliacus are important to the hip flexor muscles because they help stabilize and support the lower back there is another muscle called the psoas minor but it is more useful for 4 legged animals than for humans  4the word psoas is greek and means loin region the psoas muscle group makes an upside down v connected to the spine starting at about the bottom point of the rib cage and working its way down to the top of the femur specifically itis a long spindlelike muscle found between the pelvic inlet and the pelvic floor it joins the iliacus muscle which is what forms the iliopsoas a chiropractor can actually apply pressure in the pelvic inlet area to help release a tight psoas this is commonly done for athletes in addition to stretches although it should always be done by a soft tissue professional with expertise in psoas release  5why do we need a strong psoas muscle potential problems a strong psoas supports everyday activity but a weak psoas can make even the easiest task a challenge in addition to causing bigger problems such as sway back  6 the psoas is a key messenger of the central nervous system and when there is lack of support from it the way your body responds to gravity is different than intended muscle imbalances can often cause the body to compensate in another area and that can cause additional issues and even injury some people are even diagnosed with psoas syndrome or iliopsoas tendonitis these ailments cause pain in the hip area while these are two separate conditions they are often described similarly however psoas syndrome is a condition involving a stretch tear or rupture of the iliopsoas muscle or tendon iliopsoas tendonitis involves an inflamed muscle the piriformis syndrome is also closely associated with this sort of pain and may be referenced when seeking a diagnosis  7yoga therapist danielle prohom olson calls the psoas muscle “the muscle of the soul” olson says on her website “the psoas is connected to the diaphragm through connective tissue or fascia which affects both our breath and fear reflex this is because the psoas is directly linked to the reptilian brain the most ancient interior part of the brain stem and spinal cord”  8 in fact psoas expert liz koch author of the psoas book says that emotional trauma or lack of emotional support can actually leak to a chronically contracted psoas this results in a lack of core awareness  9 since your ancient limbic system is closely related to emotions like fear and anxiety this makes sense symptoms of psoas problems discomfort pain and aches in the front hip socket restriction in the hip socket iliopsoas bursitistendinitis restriction moving the thigh backward deep pelvic pain on the side that feels tight deep “bellyache”chronic constipation twisted pelvis  10what causes a weak psoas there are two common behaviors that typically cause a weak psoas sitting all day and bad posture the national association of sports medicine notes too much sitting causes a weak psoas and a weak psoas can lead to lower back problems all that sitting can cause the psoas iliopsoas and rectus femoris to remain in a shortened position for extended periods of time what happens is that these muscles get used to this shortened state and that makes them tight and overactive because these muscles are attached to the pelvis and lumbar spine this shortening or tightening of the muscles may cause a forward tilt of the pelvis and weakness in the gluteal muscles combined this can cause lower back pain  11 consider a standing desk to reduce your sitting time each day bad posture whether standing or sitting can create a lot of discomfort if not corrected rounded shoulders or a forward head posture may seem to be the easiest on the body but since we are constantly working against gravity it will weaken the supporting muscles of the body over time  123 major benefits of a strong healthy psoas muscle1 may reduce low back pain a published in the journal of american osteopathic association identified the psoas as an important muscle linked to our core muscle development the psoas had been initially overlooked as a solution for back pain that a 48yearold man had been experiencing  7he receivedosteopathic manipulative treatment defined as handson care by a trained physician using the hands a trained professional can help diagnose treat and even prevent illness or injury by moving the muscles and joints with stretching techniques gentle pressure and resistance the patient enjoyedsignificant improvement confirming that with a the help of a professional combined with the commitment of the patient to perform specific stretches at home back pain can be eliminated without surgery  132 can affect your sports activities i noted earlier that the psoas is actually the muscle that allows you to run each knee lift causes a contraction of this ropelike muscle and each time the leg swings back to its original position the psoas will lengthen runner’s world reports that a runner will contract and lengthen the psoas more than 5000 times during an hour long run the psoas is also a big factor in good posture the psoas combined with other core muscles such as the abdominals and obliques as well as those that help form and support the lower back provides stability offering a strong posture so it makes sense that if there is a problem with the psoas it will likely affect your sports activities in particular those that require running  14 3 provides a more painfree pregnancy pregnancy creates a lot of changes in the body one of which is the shift in your center of gravity it shifts forward as the baby develops causing the pelvis to move toward the front of the body this may cause the muscles in the lower back region to tighten and the hamstrings and glutes to stretch out and weaken additionallythe ligaments attached to the uterus can come under a lot of stress causing pain in the abdomen and lower back the psoas and surrounding muscles take on much of the stress which can cause discomfort due to tightness and imbalances however by performing stretches and exercises that help to strengthen the psoas you can eliminate most if not all of the pain  15psoas stretches  exercises whether an athlete pregnant or not active at all it’s important to release the psoas to ensure that it
