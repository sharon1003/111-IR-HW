1 what are the different types of vsam files available esds entry sequence data set ksds key sequence data set rrds relative data set2 what is idcams  idcams is the access method services program you run the idcams program and supply ams commands thru sysin examples of ams commands are delete define repro etc3 can ams commands be run from the tso prompt  yes4 syntax of ams modal commands  note these can be used only under idcams and not from the tso prompt if lastcc or maxcc  or  etc value then do command set such as delete define etcelse do command set lastcc  condition code from the last function such as delete executed maxcc  max condition code that was returned by any of the prev functions set is also a valid ams command set lastcc or maxcc  value the maximum condition code is 16 a cond code of 4 indicates a warning a cond code of 8 is usually encountered on a delete of a dataset that is not present5 under idcams  multiple functions can be executed each of which returns a cond code what will be the condition code returned to the operating system  the maximum condition code generated is returned as the condition code of the idcams step6 what is control interval control area  control interval is analogous to a physical block for qsam files it is the unit of io must be between 512 bytes to 32 k usually either 2k or 4k a larger control interval increases performance for sequential processing while the reverse is true for random access under cics when a record is locked the entire ci gets locked control area is a group of control intervals ca is used during allocation ca size is calculated based on the allocation type cyl tracks or records and can be max of 1 cylinder7 what is freespace  coded in the define as freespace ci ca where ci is the percentage of each control interval to be left free for insertions ca is the percentage of control intervals in each control area to be left empty8 how do you decide on optimum values for ci freespace etc ci size should be based on record length type of processing usually ci is 4k if record length is larger 1k chose 6k or 8k freespace should be large if more number of insertions are envisaged usual values are 20 20 when heavy updates are expected ci size can be calculated9 would you specify freespace for an esds no because you cannot insert records in an esds also when you rewrite a record it must be of the same length thus putting any value for freespace does not make any sense10 what is shareopts  shareopts is a parameter in the define and specifies how an object can be shared among users it is coded as shareopts a b where a is the cross region share option ie how two or more jobs on a single system can share the file while b is the cross system share option ie how two or more jobs on different mvses can share the file usual value is 2 311 what is the meaning of each of the values in shareopts 2 3 value of 2 for cross region means that the file can be processed simultaneously by multiple users provided only one of them is an updater value of 3 for cross system means that any number of jobs can process the file for input or output vsam does nothing to ensure integrity12 how do you define a ksds  define cluster cluster name with the indexed parameter also specify the ds name for the data component  the ds index component other important parms are recordsize keys shareoptions13 how do you define an altindx  how do you use altindxs in batch cics pgms  define alternateindex important paramters are relate where you specify the base cluster name keys recordsizeshareoptionsuniquekey or nonuniquekey data ds name for the data component index ds name for the index component then define path important paramters are name ds name for the path pathentry ds name of the alternate index name update or noupdate which specifies whether an alt index is updated when a update to the base cluster takes place then bldindex parameters are indataset ds name of base cluster outdataset ds name of aix using alternate indexes in batch pgms in the jcl you must have dd stmts for the cluster and for the path s in the cobol pgm select  assign to ddname for base cluster record key is alternate record key is using alternate indexes in cics pgms fct entries must be created for both base cluster  the path to read using the alternate index use the dd name of the path in cics file control commands14 what happens when you open an empty vsam file in a cobol program for input a vsam file that has never contained a record is treated as unavailable attempting to open for input will fail an empty file can be opened for output only when you open for output cobol will write a dummy record to the file  then delete it out15 how do you initialize a vsam file before any operation a vsam with alternate index can write a dummy program that just opens the file for output  then closes it16 what does a file status of 02 on a vsam indicate duplicate alternate key  happens on both input and output operation17 how do you calculate record size of an alternate cluster give your values for both unique and nonunique unique case 5   altkeylength  primarykey nonunique case 5   altkeylength  n  primarykey where n   of duplicate records for the alternate key any one who knows  can you explain 18 what is the difference between sequential files and esds files sequential qsam files can be created on tape while esds files cannot also you can have altindex for an esds while no such facility exists for qsam files19 how do you load a vsam data set with records  using the repro command20 how do you define a gdg  use the define generationdatagroup command in the same idcams step another dataset must be defined whose dcb parameters are used when new generations of the gdg are created this dataset is known as the model dataset the ds name of this model dataset must be the same as that of the gdg so use a disp of keep rather than catlg and also specify space trk021 do all versions of the gdg have to be of the same record length  no the dcb of the model dataset can be overridden when you allocate new versions22 how are different versions of gdg named basefilename gnnnnn v00 where nnnn generation number upto 255nnnn will be 0000 for the 1st generation23 suppose 3 generations of a gdg exist how would you reference the 1 st generation in the jcl use gdg name 224 suppose a generation of gdg gets created in a particular step of a proc how would you refer the current generation in a subsequent step what would be the disposition of this generation now relative generation numbers are updated only at the end of the job not at the end of a step to allocate a new generation we would be using 1 with a disp of newcatlgdelete to refer to this in a subsequent step in the same job we would again use 1 but with a disp of shr or old25 what more info you should give in the dd statement while defining the next generation of a gdg give 1 as the generation number give newcatlg for disp give space parameter can give the dcb parameter if you want to override the dcb of the model dataset26 assuming that the define jcl is not available how do you get info about a vsam fileï¿½s organisation  use the listcat command27 during processing of a vsam file some system error occurs and it is subsequently unusable  what do you do  run verify
