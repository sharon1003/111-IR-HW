allen received national attention after scoring five touchdowns in the game when it came time for allen to select a college he had scholarship offers as a defensive player but very few universities showed interest in him as an offensive player all of his other offers fell to the wayside when the university of southern california usc offered him a scholarship he wanted to be a usc trojan even if that meant he would never play offense allen began his career at usc as a defensive back but when injuries thinned out the tailback position coach john robinson asked the awestruck freshman to move to the offensive side of the ball allen agreed and a hall of fame football player was born from blocking back to the heisman allen played sparingly behind charles white who was having an allamerican season during allen ’ s sophomore year he moved to fullback taking on linemen and linebackers who weighed 100 pounds or more than the 19yearold converted defensive back though he endured horrendous punishment it was better than sitting the bench and he helped charles white win the heisman trophy allen rushed for his first ever 100 yard game against texas tech when white was injured but spent the rest of the season blocking in his junior year allen was named the starting tailback but was criticized for not performing as spectacularly as white he gained 1563 yards to finish second in the nation in rushing but many usc fans and alumni were not satisfied with the team or its tailback despite what many considered to be a down year at tailback allen entered the 1981 season proclaiming that he would gain 2000 yards — more than any other college running back in the history of the game allen began his senior season ripping off 210 yards against tennessee 274 against indiana and 208 against

as a trojan with a 219yard effort in the rose bowl allen won the heisman trophy with 1797 points and 441 first place votes on to the nflallen was considered too slow coming out of college for a premier running back position in the nfl so he trained with ucla track coach jim bush another knock against allen was that he liked the high life too much as a friend of fellow heisman trophy winner and usc tailback o j simpson on draft day the recently relocated los angeles raiders made allen their first round pick and the tenth pick allaround after a long training camp allen was named the starter and rushed for 100 yards in his first game then following the second week of the season the players went on strike for eight weeks though allen signed for a 400000 bonus and made 150000 a year he still lived in a hotel in oakland with no car after the strikemarred 1982 season ended allen was named the rookie of the year and was invited to the pro bowl in allen ’ s second season he rushed for 1014 yards and the raiders went to the super bowl against the heavily favored washington redskins the raiders dominated the redskins and won the game 389 allen was named the game ’ s mvp after gaining 191 yards on 20 carries socially allen traveled in lofty circles he was a regular guest at simpson ’ s brentwood estate with al cowlings and other sports luminaries such as kareem abduljabbar ahmad rashad and lynn swann but his success was leading him to trouble as he gained more attention from the media and the raiders team and owner got less raiders maverick owner al davis was becoming increasingly aware that one of his players was being singled out above the team allen continued his individual brilliance the following year in 1984 leading the league in touchdowns with 18 and gaining 1168 yards but the raiders faltered by the end of the season davis was openly calling allen a selfish player to his coaching staff allen went into the 1985 season at the top of his game and became the centerpiece of the raiders offense he justified the organization ’ s confidence with a breakout season he gained 1759 yards on the ground and set a singleseason nfl record with 2314 total yards he was named the player of the year and voted to his third pro bowl but the 124 raiders again lost in the first round of the playoffs davis was soon complaining about the team being too “ one dimensional ”allen hoped to follow up the 1985 season with another strong campaign but he injured his ankle in the third game despite the lack of any fracture the pain did not go away throughout the season allen tried to play through the pain and even took a shot of painkillers before one game to be able to play but he could not play the same in a pivotal game with the philadelphia eagles allen fumbled the ball as the raiders were in the midst of a gamewinning drive and the team lost the game the raiders lost the next four contests to finish the season out of the playoffs many raiders observers felt that allen ’ s career with the organization went downhill after that one game against the eagles the 1987 season opened again with a players ’ strike davis viewed the action as a personal betrayal rather than a work stoppage allen was one of the players who stayed out of camp over the course of the entire strike he had another surprise waiting for him when he returned to the raiders davis signed baseball player and college football star bo jackson to play for the team in the second half of the season allen regarded this move as an attempt to replace him but he kept his feelings to himself midway through a frustrating season he even volunteered to play fullback while jackson played tailback this arrangement improved the tense situation but the raiders were a team in decline longtime raiders head coach tom flores even retired after the disappointing 1987 season the new man to lead the raiders was former broncos assistant mike shanahan shanahan tried to change the raiders ’ longball system but was often overruled by davis allen had another mediocre campaign in 1988 splitting time with jackson he gained 831 yards on the ground and caught only 34 passes the only bright side of the 1988 season for allen came outside of the professional arena he met kathryn eickstaedt a model from wisconsin who would become his wife allen ’ s contract was up after the season and his agent was made to wait until the beginning of the next regular season for a new contract offer allen returned to a team in turmoil shanahan was fired after four games the next coach was former raiders player and assistant coach art shell the first black head coach in the nfl allen ’ s excitement at playing for the new coach was tempered after he injured his knee in the first game of shell ’ s tenure he spent eight weeks on the inactive list and did not get significant playing time for the rest of the season the 1990 season began as the previous one did — with allen holding out or depending on one ’ s point of view being held out when he finally returned to camp he was listed as the fourth running back and matters did not improve for the former star allen claimed that all the coaches had been instructed by davis not to play him and even raider quarterback jay schroeder had been told not to throw the ball his way though the raiders won the afl west that year allen was used only in short yardage situations when the team desperately needed yards the 1991 season started off badly as he tore a ligament in his knee in the first game allen missed eight games and the raiders lost to kansas city in the first round of the playoffs in 1992 the fivetime pro bowl player was again listed fourth on the depth chart allen was told before games that he would not be playing and was used only for thirddown plays he would sit on the end of the bench separate from the rest of the team after walking out of practice one day allen decided he had had enough he called shell and demanded to be traded but shell told him davis would not trade him after confronting davis allen was told that no other team would be interested in him allen was stuck being the best football player on a team that would not play him allen felt he had no choice but to file a free agency lawsuit against the raiders and the nfl during the raiders game against the miami dolphins on monday night football abc aired an interview that allen had done just before the game with al michaels allen unloaded on davis accusing the raiders ’ owner of trying to ruin his career allen ’ s interview was so incendiary that michaels told allen to call if he wanted to retract any of his statements allen would not back down and the interview was aired the reaction was immediate though davis made no public statement coach shell went on the air accusing allen of lying despite all the division he had caused within the organization allen ’ s teammates voted to give him the commitment to excellence award as the team ’ s most inspirational player after 11 years with the team his time with the raiders was over allen told sport magazine ’ s dan dieffenbach that he was not bitter about his time with los angeles “ to me it is all an education it was a wonderful education although i hated it i didn ’ t realize it at the time when i was going through it there was not light at the end of the tunnel for me but when you look back at it and deal with everything it was a tremendous experience ”a career rejuvenated in 1993 allen signed with the kansas city chiefs coach marty schottenheimer aggressively pursued him as a free agent and the chiefs made the most substantial contract offer before he left los angeles allen married kathryn in the backyard of simpson ’ s brentwood mansion allen went to kansas city and had fun playing football again though he did not start for the first eight games allen was contributing to the team along with the chiefs other big import joe montana one of his biggest moments was scoring his 100th career touchdown against the raiders after the game no one on allen ’ s former team even shook his hand allen started the last eight games of the regular season and led the chiefs to the afc conference championship where kansas city lost to the buffalo bills allen finished his ninth season as the chiefs most valuable player mvp earned another trip to the pro bowl after a sixyear absence and was named the nfl comeback player of the year allen recovered from the 1993 season and took a few months off to recuperate he was in the cayman islands when he heard his friend ’ s exwife nicole brown simpson had been murdered further his friend o j simpson went on trial for the murder allen continued to support simpson throughout the trial and he and his wife even visited simpson in jail when the 1994 season opened allen was very distracted there were rumors he was seen driving simpson ’ s white bronco on the night nicole was murdered and that he had been having an affair with nicole but allen became focused on football and helped lead the chiefs to a perfect start despite the team ’ s success allen ’ s close relationship with simpson continued to cause him grief assistant prosecutor on the simpson murder trial christopher darden came to kansas city to interview allen and asked him if he had an affair with nicole the rumor escalated after appearing in the national enquirer and soon allen was being scolded by the daytime talk shows his house was invaded by journalists some posing as repairman and other delivering flowers on the football field allen injured his knee and was forced to sit out three games he roared back from injury and led the chiefs to two straight victories at the end of the season including a 132yard performance against the raiders as the 1995 season started allen had to adjust to a new role on the field allen platooned with greg hill but the two reluctant running backs combined to become a formidable tandem despite the continuing saga of the simpson criminal and civil trials allen focused on football during the game against the raiders allen gained 124 yards and became the first player to gain 10000 yards rushing and 5000 yards receiving the chiefs finished the season 133 and allen gained 890 yards during the wild card game the week before the chiefs would begin their playoff campaign allen joined abc in the broadcast booth

yards and totaled 145 touchdowns including one super bowl mvp and one regular season mvp award furthermore he achieved all this success buried so far down in al davis ’ s doghouse that he averaged fewer than five carries a game for three seasons but setting records was not the reason that he played football allen told the capitoljournal ’ s rick dean at his retirement press conference “ the records i ’ m proud of but it ’ s the people i ’ ve worked with on a daytoday basis who really made the game for me the most important thing has always been the journey and the people you meet and
