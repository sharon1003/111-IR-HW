in ghosts little susie redirected from little susie edit comments 6 share it was disgusting how mangled the body was when detective joey steen found it in a closet he pondered at how the victim had died there was a gun on the floor this was either a suicide or a murder the gun would have to be taken back to the lab to test for prints just as he was about to leave he found a note attached to the victims arm it read there was a little girl named susie who died at age five she stands near the old road as if she were alive she wears a pink bow pink dress and pink bunny she will be your friend and make everything funny but theres one thing you dont want to do and that is to make her mad because if you do he could not read the rest because the blood had drenched the paper what a strange poem and why on a suicide note he thought to himself he decided to go and investigate on this little ghost girl he drove his car up to the old road and looked for her in the distance he could see a small pink figure he ran up to it to find a little girl sitting with a bunny in her hand hello there what is your name he asked the little girlsusie she replied so he found her but she didnt look like a ghost mister i never have anyone to play with and my only friend is gone will you be my friend joey remembered the poem on the note this is not a ghost its just a little girl who needs someone to be with her alright little susie ill be your friend he repliedreally oh thank you mister she got up and started to laugh joey could not help but laugh as well she seemed nice and kind how could she ever get mad come mister she grabbed his arm and pulled him to a small table she took out some fake food and some tea cups we can have a tea party would you like tea mister well yes thank you joey replied playfully susie poured some imaginary tea into his cup he pretended to sip his imaginary tea and smiled he went home toward the end of the day and said goodbye to little susie when he looked at his desk he saw a fax from the lab the gun had the victims fingerprints so this actually was a suicide this was curious why would this man kill himself and leave such a weird note behind he didnt even explain why he did it he went to bed thinking of what to do tomorrow to try and solve this puzzle while he drove past the old road he saw little susie standing there he stopped to say hello mister do you want to play dress up with my bunny she asked him oh im sorry susie i cant play now i have to go to work when she heard him say this her smiled fadedoh he patted her head and went off to work while examining the blood on the note he felt this weird aura surrounding him it felt heavy and dark he turned around to find susie susie how did you get here he yelled in surprise i followed you so we could play youre at work now thats what you said right youre going to work so i followed you she said her face was emotionless and her eyes seemed darker than usual no susie i cant play i have work to do you didnt say that you said you were going to work you didnt say you had to do things at work her face was getting more sinister now her eyes were turning completely black now her dress was also getting blacker as well as her dress there was blood coming out of her mouth and eyes joey then realized she was mad he ran to his car and began to drive away when he past the old road he saw susies bunny it was hung by the neck on a piece of rope and had cuts with blood all over it joey was terrified by the time he got home it was about 100 am when he finally decided to go to bed he closed his eyes but couldnt sleep he felt that heaviness again he was afraid to open his eyes but he couldnt take the fear that she was there he saw her across the room sitting in the corner staring at him he stood there staring back at her until the sun came out did she finally leave he stood there in horror why is this happening he didnt do anything wrong why wont she leave him alone later in the day he got a call from his father son i dont know how to tell you this but your mother is dead joey nearly dropped the phone hhow did this happen he finally said well when she was sleeping she had a heart attack im sorry son there was nothing that could be doneiits alright dad ill be fine take care of yourself he hung up the phone it cant be a coincidence that a ghost was angry with him and that his mother died just a day after was susie doing this he went for a walk outside to get some fresh air when he felt that heavy feeling again he turned around and saw susie standing there yyou go away leave me alone she just stood there and stared she then walked away and disappeared into the distance he ran back into his home he was sweating all over he almost died when the phone rang he picked it up and slowly put it to his ear joey you are such a horrible person it was his girlfriend loise how could you cheat on me with that slut i am never talking to you again you dog he didnt even get one word in before she hung up no not louise he was so in love with her he was going to marry her why would this happen to him he finally understood what susie was doing she was getting rid of the people who he cared about most she killed his mother and got rid of his girlfriend she was going to get rid of every single thing that he cared about and ruin his life three weeks after this happened joey didnt go to work he didnt call anyone or go anywhere someone from his detective job went to his house to investigate he found joey hanging on a rope from his neck with a fallen chair under his feet oh joey what happened the man said if only joey had been able to read the rest of that note on that dead body then he would have known she will make your life bad shell watch you in bed and kill others who love you if you want to escape her theres only one thing to do take a rope a gun or knife and just commit suicide categories ghosts
