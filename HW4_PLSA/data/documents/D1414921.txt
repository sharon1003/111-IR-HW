arrangement cost of child care satisfaction with child care summary data source references text begins over the last three decades the need for child care has grown steadily with the rise in employment rates among women 1 and the corresponding increase in dualincome earner families this has accompanied changes in the composition of canadian families notably increases in loneparent and stepfamilies impacting both the need and type of child care required bushnik 2006 2beyond need the demand for quality child care has also increased due to the potential benefits on peer socialization school readiness and numeracy and language skills oecd 2006 nores and barnett 2010 in canada options for child care are varied ranging from nannies home daycares 3 daycare centres preschool programs and before and after school services finding the most appropriate child care arrangement can at times be challenging parents must often balance the need between the overall quality convenience availability and cost of child care using the 2011 gss on families this report provides an overview of child care in canada examining its overall use factors influencing use types of child care arrangements and cost for the purpose of this report the term ‘child care’ is used to refer to nonparental care that is the care of children by someone other than a parent or guardian 4use of child care across canada almost half of parents reported using child care for their children in 2011 almost half 46 of parents reported using some type of child care for their children aged 14 years and younger in the past year this reliance on child care varied widely based on the age of the child more than half 54 of parents with children aged 4 and under used child care mirroring previous findings from the national longitudinal survey of children and youth bushnik 2006 in comparison 39 of parents with schoolaged children 5 to 14 years used some form of nonparental care these two broad figures however mask important agespecific differences in particular parents of infants aged 1 and younger were among the least likely to use child care with about onequarter 26 doing so the lower rate generally reflects both the availability of employment insurance benefits in the child’s first year 5 and the lower rate of mother’s labour force participation when children are very young oecd 2013 the use of child care was lower at the other end of the age spectrum that is for children aged 11 to 14 years 19 children in this age range are often considered emotionally and developmentally mature enough to be unsupervised for short periods of time ie before and after school resulting in a reduced need for child care 6by far child care arrangements were most frequently used for children aged 2 to 4 years of age chart 1 roughly six in ten of these parents had some form of child care arrangement for their child rates were also high though somewhat lower for parents with children aged 5 to 7 these children are typically in the school system and would generally need care in the morning hours before the start of school andor after the end of the school day description for chart 1quebec parents report highest rates of child care manitoba the lowest in canada provincial and territorial governments are primarily responsible for child care and as such the specific child care policies can vary across canada among all provinces quebec’s system is considered the most unique in canada it is the only province to have a universal child daycare program where the cost of daycare is subsidized stalker and ornstein 2013 7at 58 parents in quebec were most likely to have used child care in the year preceding the survey chart 2 manitoban parents were among the least likely with about onethird 34 of parents in this province reporting that they had used some form of child care in the previous year rates of child care were also below average in alberta 40 and ontario 43 description for chart 2these interprovincial differences were observed across all age groups including among both children aged 4 and under and those aged 5 to 14 years in all provinces a greater proportion of parents used child care for preschoolaged children than for schoolaged children child care most common when both parents worked outside the home a range of factors can influence a parent’s decision to place their child in nonparental care while parents were not asked about reasons for using child care rates of child care were generally highest among dualincome earner families 8 in particular 71 of households where both partners 9 worked for pay used child care for a preschool child and 49 did the same for a schoolaged child between the ages of 5 and 14 child care rates were also high for loneparent families where the parent worked at a paid job or business over half 58 of these parents used child care for their preschool children and 35 used some form of nonparental care for their older children the lowest rates of child care were among couple households where only one parent worked for pay an estimated 42 of these parents turned to child care for their child aged 4 and under and 25 used care for their older children closely tied to patterns in labour force participation and family structure is household income in general parents belonging to a higher income household were more likely to have used some form of nonparental care more precisely about twothirds 65 of parents with an annual household income of at least 100000 used child care for their preschooler this was nearly double the rate recorded for households with an income below 40000 34 10 along the same lines 46 of the highest income households used child care for schoolaged children compared to 32 of the lowest income households hours of care child care is most often used on a regular basis most parents 86 using child care arrangements did so on a regular basis that is the same place and time every week such as every day of the week or every friday in general patterns in the regularity of child care use followed a similar pattern in the overall use with regular child care peaking at the age 4 and steadily decreasing with the increasing age of the child along with the regularity of care parents were asked about the amount of time children spent in care among parents who relied on child care 60 used their main arrangement on a fulltime basis meaning at least 30 hours a week this was more often the case when the child had not yet entered school in particular 70 of parents using care for their child aged 4 and under used fulltime care compared to 36 of parents of schoolaged children this latter figure is even lower 20 when excluding 5year olds who may not yet be enrolled in school fulltime types of child care arrangements type of child care for young children varies by region parents primarily relied on three types of child care arrangements for their children aged 4 and under daycare centres 33 home daycares 31 and private arrangements such as grandparents other relatives or nannies 28 11 the use of these specific types of child care arrangements however differed by province daycare centres were most commonly used by parents in quebec ontario and the atlantic provinces with over onethird of parents in these provinces using daycare centres for their young child table 1 quebec also stood out for having the greatest proportion of parents using home daycares 50 quebec parents were almost twice as likely as parents elsewhere in canada to use this form of care child care patterns in quebec can be largely explained by quebec’s child care structure table 1 type of child care arrangement among parents using child care by region type of child care arrangement

atlantic provinces used private arrangements for their children aged 4 and under as did 43 of parents in prairie provinces and 40 of those in british columbia before and after school programs less commonly used in western canada while before and after school programs were the most common type of child care arrangement for schoolaged children this was not uniformly the case across canada the great majority 86 of parents in quebec relied on before and after school programs while about half in ontario 50 and the atlantic provinces 51 did the same in contrast parents living west of ontario were less likely to use this form of care and more often opted for private child care arrangements in 2011 38 of parents in the prairies and 43 of british columbia parents reported enrolling their child in a before and after school program most parents turn to relatives or other private child care arrangements for very young children the age of the child also had an impact on parents’ choice of care but mainly outside the province of quebec very young children were most often placed in the care of relatives nannies and other private arrangements with over half 58 of nonquebec parents reporting the use of private arrangements for their infants aged 1 and younger private arrangements continued to be used after the age of 1 though daycare centres also became a top choice in particular for children aged 2 to 3 31 of nonquebec parents used daycare centres and 36 relied on private arrangements by the age of 4 daycare centres became the leading child care arrangement outside quebec 34 followed closely by private arrangements 28 the use of home daycares outside of quebec was relatively uncommon at every age at around 20 this contrasts the situation in quebec where home daycares combined with daycare centres were used almost exclusively child care patterns in quebec can be largely explained by quebec’s child care structure which supports reduced contribution spaces in home daycares and daycare centres reasons for type of child care arrangement location leading reason for child care preference parents cited various reasons for their decision to use a particular type of care onethird 33 of parents indicated that the location of the child care service was the leading reason behind their decision chart 3 this was followed by a feeling they could trust the care provider 18 the affordability of care 11 and the feeling that it was the only option available 11 these reasons were the same regardless of the age of the child description for chart 3differences however were observed based on where parents lived quebec parents were more likely to identify location as a reason for care 44 versus 33 and half as likely to mention trust in the care provider 8 versus 18 the latter difference may be partly explained by the finding that almost twothirds of quebec parents with preschoolers relied on a government accredited centre or familybased care ie centre de la petite enfance which are subject to specific regulations the reason of ‘only option available’ was most often identified by parents living in quebec 21 manitoba 19 and newfoundland and labrador 15 factors influencing type of child care arrangement the preference of one child care arrangement over another can depend on such factors as household income family structure and workstudy patterns of parents 1 bushnik 2006 according to the 2011 gss parents with a household income below 40000 were most likely to use a daycare centre over any other type of child care arrangement this result is consistent with previous findings bushnik 2006 and may be explained by the eligibility of government subsidies within daycare centres home daycare was the most common child care arrangement for parents with a household income between 40000 up to 100000 while daycare centres and private arrangements were the leading choices for highincome parents those with household income above 100000 household income had little bearing on child care arrangements for older children before and after school services were the most common for all income levels with the exception of parents reporting a household income of 40000 to 59999 for these parents private arrangements were the top choice for their schoolaged children sample size was too small to examine impact of family structure and workstudy patterns on choice of child care arrangements1cost of child care monthly per child cost of fulltime care ranged from 152 in quebec to 677 in ontario parents were asked about their child care expenditures 12 these costs are based on the amount of money spent by parents and account for any reductions based on subsidies but does not consider income tax credits or other financial supports which can reduce total outofpocket expenses one of the main contributing factors to parents’ costs is where they live child care programs and subsidies can vary from one province to another influencing the actual cost to parents most notably because of quebec’s differing child care model significant differences in child care costs exist for parents living in quebec compared to elsewhere in canada reflecting quebec’s subsidized daily rate of 7 per day 65 of quebec parents using fulltime care 13 for their children aged 4 and under paid under 200 a month per child expressed differently the median cost of fulltime child care in quebec was 152 a month 14 making it almost four times lower than the second lowest region the atlantic provinces which recorded a median cost of 541 a month the highest cost of fulltime child care for children aged 4 and younger was found in ontario with a median cost of 677 one in eight parents outside quebec had no direct cost of child care a certain portion of parents who used child care reported no direct cost of child care for their young children this was most often the case outside of quebec where about one in eight parents reported no cost of fulltime care for their preschooler chart 4 the absence of cost may reflect subsidies for lowerincome parents which makes parents totally exempt from any child care expenses alternatively the actual cost of child care may not be borne by the parents themselves as other family members or friends may pay for the cost of care in other cases the nonparental care provider may be unpaid 15description for chart 4cost of before and after school care varies the cost of care is generally tied to hours of care with fewer hours of care translating into reduced expenditures for parents this means that costs are typically lower for older children who are enrolled in school fulltime and spend only part of their time in child care a fairly even spilt in cost was observed among parents living outside the province of quebec about half of parents 48 paid under 200 while the other half 52 paid 200 or more per month for before and after school arrangements 16in quebec the vast majority 90 of parents paid under 200 for before and after school care no marked difference in cost was evident between private arrangements and before and after school services satisfaction with child care vast majority of parents satisfied with child care arrangement overall most parents were satisfied with their main type of child care arrangement in particular 69 of parents indicated that they were very satisfied with the overall quality of their child care arrangement and another 29 were satisfied 17 less than a handful 2 of parents were dissatisfied quebec parents were generally not more satisfied than overall despite the unique nature of quebec’s subsidized child care system summary about half of all canadian parents used some form of child care for their children aged 14 years and younger in 2011 overall child care rates peaked between the ages of 2 and 4 then subsequently declined with increasing age across all ages quebec parents were most likely to turn to child care the types of child care arrangements varied by province private arrangements such as family members and nannies were most common in eastern and western canada while daycare centres were most frequently used in quebec ontario and the atlantic provinces the median cost of fulltime child care also differed by province ranging from a low of 152 per month in quebec to a high of 677 in ontario data source this report is based on cycle 25 of the general social survey gss on families conducted in 2011 the target population included all persons 15 years and older living in the ten provinces of canada excluding fulltime residents of institutions in 2011 all respondents were interviewed by telephone households without telephones or with only cellular phone service were excluded based on the 2010 residential telephone services survey rtss these two groups combined represented approximately 14 of the target population this proportion may be higher for 2011 due to the likely increase in cellularonly households once a household was contacted an individual 15 years or older was randomly selected to respond to the survey the sample size in 2011 was 22435 respondents for this report the target population included all parents who lived in the same household as their child aged 14 years or younger data collection data collection took place in 2011 computer assisted telephone interviewing cati was used to collect data respondents were interviewed in the official language of their choice response rates the overall response rate was 658 types of nonresponse included respondents who refused to participate could not be reached or could not speak english or french survey estimates were weighted to represent the noninstitutionalized canadian population aged 15 years or over data limitations as with any household survey there are some data limitations the results are based on a sample and are therefore subject to sampling error somewhat different results might have been obtained if the entire population had been surveyed this article uses the coefficient of variation cv as a measure of the sampling error any estimate that has a high cv over 333 has not been published because the estimate is too unreliable in these cases the symbol ‘f’ is used in place of an estimate in the figures and data tables an estimate that has a cv between 166 and 333 should be used with caution and the symbol ‘e’ is referenced with the estimate where descriptive statistics and crosstabular analysis were used statistically significant differences were determined using 95
