told abcnewscom that kelley retained his services in february 2012 they demanded that she abort he said de primo guided kelley through the connecticut state law regarding surrogacy in the state a gestational carrier that is biologically unrelated to the child has no parental rights after baby s was born in connecticut she would be placed in foster care for kelley this was not an option she will be lost to me forever kelley wrote in a march 2012 blog post that was when kelley says she began to contemplate leaving the state according to her blog de primo said he told kelley which states where she as the birth mother would have parental rights to the baby all i did was tell her the options he told abcnewscom she made a decision i told her where you have rights as her mother kelley decided to head to michigan where she could go to the c s mott childrens hospital at the university of michigan which has one of the top pediatric heart programs in the country soon she picked up her kids and drove to ann arbor where she set up a network of labor coaches and midwives for support in michigan she also retained a new attorney herbert a brail who specialized in adoptions brail told abcnewscom that kelley was abhorred by the actions of her baby s intended parents and wanted to set up an adoption plan at one point during the lengthy proceedings with the intended parents kelley told cnn they offered her 10000 to abort the baby she first refused then in what cnn called a weak moment she said she would for 15000 but she told cnn this tested her convictions and she believes she would not have gone through with it and indeed she did not kelley did not respond to requests for an interview placed by abc news through her lawyers brail said that given the strength of her position even with the higher amount theres no way that she would have gone ahead with it she was very committed to facilitating the adoption of the child brail said kelley was sued by the connecticut couple seeking to enforce the parenting agreement and thats when she found out the embryos that had been used for the surrogacy were not those of the intended mother an affidavit attached to that suit mentioned that the egg was from an anonymous donor brail said with the intended mother legally out of the picture the intended father soon decided to waive his rights to baby s this left kelley free to pursue an adoption michigan recognizes the person who gives birth as the childs mother brail said in cases where everyones in agreement you can get a parentage out of the courts with agreement of all the parties within hours of being born baby s underwent a number of tests many of the heart defects that were predicted while she was in the room were present she had a cleft palate she has a hypoplastic right ear which she cannot hear from she had holoprosencephaly where the brain fails to completely divide into distinct hemispheres baby s did not have down syndrome kelley wrote baby s will undergo a number of risky cardiac procedures in her infancy as well as surgeries for her cleft palate even then holoprosencephaly still brings the risk of early death according to medical experts kelley was able to find adoptive parents baby s was in good shape on july 11 2012 the day that kelley says that she went to relinquish her rights to the baby she had worked tirelessly to bring into the world according to kelley on her blog kelly described the adoptive parents who remain anonymous as wonderful fabulous people she wrote that she knows that they understand the unique bond that baby s and she share and that she is happy that she can keep two promises to the child she carried i will always be there for you and i will never give up on you she wrote comments add interests customize
