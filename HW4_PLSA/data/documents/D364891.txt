levels of organization in an ecosystem to understand the levels of belonging in an ecosystem let us consider the diagram below individual species organism an individual is any living thing or organism individuals do not breed with individuals from other groups animals unlike plants tend to be very definite with this term because some plants can crossbreed with other fertile plants in the diagram above you will notice that gill the goldfish is interacting with its environment and will only crossbreed with other gold fishes just like her population a group of individuals of a given species that live in a specific geographic area at a given time example is gill and his family and friends and other fishes of gillâ€™s species note that populations include individuals of the same species but may have different genetic makeup such as haireyeskin colour and size between themselves and other populations community this includes all the populations in a specific area at a given time a community includes populations of organisms of different species in the diagram above note how populations of gold fishes salmons crabs and herrings coexist in a defined location a great community usually includes biodiversity ecosystem as explained in the pages earlier ecosystems include more than a community of living organisms biotic interacting with the environment abiotic at this level note how they depend on other abiotic factors such as rocks water air and temperature biome a biome in simple terms is a set of ecosystems sharing similar characteristics with their abiotic factors adapted to their environments biosphere when we consider all the different biomes each blending into the other with all humans living in many different geographic areas we form a huge community of humans animals and plants and microorganisms in their defined habitats a biosphere is the sum of all the ecosystems established on planet earth it is the living and decaying component of the earth system
