chaplin at keystone the tramp is born by jeffrey vance adapted from his book chaplin genius of the cinema new york 2003 © 2009 roy export sasbuilding on traditions forged in the commedia dell’arte which he learned in the british music halls charles chaplin brought traditional theatrical forms into an emerging medium and changed both cinema and culture in the process the birth of modern screen comedy occurred when chaplin donned his derby hat affixed his toothbrush moustache and stepped into his impossibly large shoes for the first time at the keystone film company the comedies chaplin made for keystone chart his rapid evolution from music hall sketch comedy artiste to master film comedian and director chaplin dressed as the tramp circa 1914it would be easy to mistake the story of how chaplin stumbled into his first motionpicture contract as the plot of a chaplin comedy were it not true alfred reeves manager of the fred karno theatrical company touring in america received a telegram at the nixon theatre in philadelphia on may 12 1913 which read “is there a man named chaffin in your company or something like that stop if so will he communicate with kessel and baumann 24 longacre building broadway” 1reeves believing the telegram must be referring to chaplin showed it to him when chaplin discovered that the tenants of the longacre building were mostly attorneys he imagined that his greataunt elizabeth wiggins had died and left him an inheritance he immediately arranged a day trip to new york city promotional poster for karno sketch a night in a london club amy minister top alf reeves charlie chaplin muriel mickey palmer charlie chaplin mike asher chaplin was disappointed to discover that the telegram had been sent by adam kessel jr and charles o baumann owners of the new york motion picture company who wanted to sign him as a comedian with the keystone film company keystone’s lead comedy player ford sterling was intending to leave to start his own company and they needed a replacement an official of the new york motion picture company and mack sennett who ran keystone had both seen chaplin in one of his tours and recognized his potential for film comedy chaplin was lured to accept the keystone offer by the large salary 150 weekly for three months raised to 175 weekly for the rest of the year which was more than double his karno salary of 75 a week in september 1913 he signed his first film contract for a period of one year with the keystone film company beginning december 13 1913 2chaplin had considered appearing in motion pictures before he received the offer from keystone wanting to purchase the motionpicture rights to all of fred karno’s sketches and make films of them ironically chaplin actually believed that making movies would help his stage career he had seen some keystone films and was not particularly impressed “i was not terribly enthusiastic about the keystone type of comedy but i realized their publicity value a year at that racket and i could return to vaudeville an international star” he had surmised 3motionpicture comedy began with a simple comic situation in the lumiére brothers’ l’arroseur arrosé watering the gardener 1895 in which a boy steps on a garden hose as a gardener waters a lawn cutting off the water only to step off just as the gardener peers quizzically at the nozzle and is doused with the restored flow of water soon the chase developed as the essential element of comedy in europe pathé frères the great french film company made trick and chase films america lagged behind europe in the development of film comedy and chaplin was not the first comic star of the cinema foremost of the europeans was max linder of france a gifted artist who had been making films since 1905 for pathé and cinema’s first international comedy star his style and technique influenced chaplin linder’s character was a resourceful and gallant boulevardier who ingeniously managed to extricate himself from the many predicaments that confronted him other star comedians such as polidor and rigadin charles prince were popular as well prior to world war i when continental europe rather than american production dominated even american screens chaplin was not even the first comic film star in america that distinction goes to the fat and genial john bunny who had made a successful series of comedy films from 1910 to 1915 for the vitagraph company however from its inception keystone consistently produced the best american comedies of early silent film mack sennett on a film set the keystone film company was presided over by mack sennett frequently billed in his lifetime as “the king of comedy” irish canadianborn sennett worked as a boilermaker before failing as an actor in burlesque and musical comedy he joined the american biograph company in new york city in 1908 as an actor and there learned film craft from the leading american film director d w griffith by late 1910 sennett was scenarist and director of many of biograph’s comic productions two years later kessel and baumann hired sennett as production chief of their new comedy studio in california the keystone film company keystone was based in the former bison studios at 1712 alessandro street now glendale boulevard in the edendale district of los angeles near presentday echo park relocating to the west coast sennett brought his principal players from biograph to keystone mabel normand with whom sennett had a long and tense intimate relationship fred mace and ford sterling the original keystone players were quickly augmented by roscoe arbuckle known as “fatty“ chester conklin known as “walrus” mack swain called “ambrose” and others at the time chaplin joined keystone the company was producing twelve onereel comedies plus one tworeel comedy a month sennett directed the first unit while henry “pathé” lehrman—a former streetcar conductor whose nickname derived from his fraudulent representation of himself to d w griffith as associated with pathé frères—directed the second unit keystone studios sennett possessed an intuitive almost uncanny understanding of film comedy he was the creative force behind the keystone cops a madcap mockery of the police force the sennett bathing beauties and custardpie fights in motion pictures in sennett’s films frantic pacing of broad slapstick comedy took precedence over characterization and story although crude and obvious these comedies also were simple and joyous affairs brimming with ebullience and vitality keystone rarely deviated from certain types of comedies those set in parks filmed in los angeles’ echo park or westlake park those staged against the background of public events such as parades and those filmed exclusively at the studio or in a combination of studio and location filming a situation typically led to some sort of rally or chase explosion or the principal characters falling into a lake the world of the keystone comedies embraced the innocent mischief of the comic strips—hurling bricks hitting rivals or police officers with mallets kicking someone in the backside—and was populated with pretty girls virago wives and men with grotesque moustaches and beards chaplin arrived at keystone in early december 1913 and took a room at the great northern hotel in downtown los angeles he would later relocate to the los angeles athletic club sennett was startled to find chaplin to be young because he had played older men on the stage the actor was intimidated by the keystone lot and its players sennett took me aside and explained their method of working “we have no scenario—we get an idea then follow the natural sequence of events until it leads up to a chase which is the essence of our comedy” this method was edifying but personally i hated a chase it dissipates one’s personality little as i knew about movies i knew that nothing transcended personality” 4making a living 1914chaplin’s first film was aptly titled making a living in which chaplin plays a “sharper” he is an impoverished gentleman dressed in a top hat frock coat and monocle with a drooping moustache of a typical stage villain and reminiscent of his karno characters archibald binks in the wowwows and the drunk in a night in a london club the action of the film involves the sharper’s efforts to usurp the girlfriend and job of a news photographer henry lehrman chaplin was accustomed to months of rehearsing and refining a comedy sketch with karno he quickly discovered that at keystone subtlety always gave way to speed inevitably friction developed between chaplin and lehrman who also directed making a living chaplin wanted a characterdriven film with a slower pace while lehrman insisted on fast knockabout he was further confused by why scenes were shot out of narrative order he had no previous film experience and had always rehearsed and performed his theatrical work in the proper sequence chaplin was devastated when he saw the final product and discovered what lehrman had edited recalling “although the picture was completed in three days i thought we contrived some very funny gags but when i saw the finished film it broke my heart for the cutter had butchered it beyond recognition cutting into the middle of all my funny business” 5despite chaplin’s low opinion of the film making a living was wellreceived when it was released on february 2 1914 the moving picture world an important trade magazine wrote “the clever player who takes the role of the nervy and very nifty sharper in this picture is a comedian of the first water who acts like one of nature’s own naturals…people out for an evening’s good time will howl” 6the second film chaplin made at keystone mabel’s strange predicament was the first film in which chaplin donned the costume and character of the tramp however kid auto races at venice cal chaplin’s third film was the first tramp film to be released sennett evidently brought chaplin into the cast of mabel’s strange predicament as an afterthought wanting him simply to enter a hotel lobby set and provide some comic business he told chaplin “put on a comedy makeup anything will do” 7 chaplin recalled in his autobiography i had no idea what makeup to put on i did not like my getup as the press reporter in making a living however on the way to the wardrobe i thought i would dress in baggy pants big shoes a cane and a derby hat i wanted everything to be a contradiction the pants baggy the coat tight the hat small and the shoes large i was undecided whether to look old or young but remembering sennett had expected me to be a much older man i added a small moustache which i reasoned would add age without hiding my expression i had no idea of the character but the moment i was dressed the clothes and the makeup made me feel the person he was i began to know him and by the time i walked on to the stage he was fully born 8encouraged by the laughs his tramp was receiving chaplin explained the character to sennett “you know this fellow is manysided a tramp a gentleman a poet a dreamer a lonely fellow always hopeful of romance and adventure he would have you believe he is a scientist a musician a duke and a poloplayer however he is not above picking up cigarettebutts or robbing a baby of its candy and of course if the occasion warrants it he will kick a lady in the rear—but only in extreme anger” 9 and thus nearly spontaneously was born the most celebrated character in the history of motionpicture comedy in mabel’s strange predicament the tramp is introduced slightly tipsy in the lobby of a hotel in a typical keystone plot he becomes involved with a young woman mabel normand in a bedroom mixup later the tramp encounters mabel in the corridor of the hotel dressed in her pajamas as she has managed to lock herself out of her room the favorable reaction to chaplin’s character by the seasoned sennett company was a major victory for chaplin and sennett allowed chaplin’s first scene to go the entire 75 foot length approximately one minute without any editing not the usual method at keystone moreover chaplin’s tramp character was reworked into the film’s scenario to appear in nearly all of its scenes from beginning to end sennett was pleased and so was chaplin he later explained “as the clothes had imbued me with the character i then and there decided i would keep to this costume whatever happened” 10 yet chaplin was not entirely accurate although he used the costume for the majority of the keystone films he frequently deviated from it as well the tramp character was influenced by tramp comedians of the british music hall as well as reallife tramps chaplin had encountered in his childhood a distinctive costume that fostered immediate recognition was traditionally an integral part of the success of a circus clown or musichall comedian the particular mixture chaplin concocted—derby hat toothbrush moustache whangee a type of bamboo walking stick baggy trousers tight cutaway coat and oversize boots chaplin’s actual shoe size was five he originally wore size fourteen boots as the tramp for a splay footwalk—was when combined his own creation kid auto races at venice 1914 the first film released in which chaplin wore the tramp costume motion picture audiences first saw the tramp on the screen in chaplin’s third film for keystone kid auto races at venice cal also directed by lehrman which was filmed on the sunday afternoon of the following week in which mabel’s strange predicament was filmed but kid auto races at venice cal was edited and delivered to exhibitors first kid auto races at venice cal a keystone “event” comedy was a split reel film five hundred feet or less and running approximately seven minutes reportedly filmed in fortyfive minutes to take advantage of a children’s car race at the oceanside resort of venice california the plot such as it is is quite simple the tramp makes a nuisance of himself while a camera crew attempts to film the event although quite primitive the film is historic not only because it represents the first appearance of the tramp on screen but also because it manages to record the first audience’s reaction to the character the audience of course is the throng of spectators at the race who begin to notice this peculiar fellow causing trouble with a “camera crew” at first the audience does not know what to make of the tramp then they begin to smile then titter and then laugh at his antics in those brief moments of discovery recorded for posterity a comedic revolution was born pulitzer prizewinning critic and author walter kerr observed he is elbowing his way into immortality both as a “character” in the film and as a professional comedian to be remembered and he is doing it by calling attention to the camera as camera he would do this throughout his career using the instrument as a means of establishing a direct and openly acknowledged relationship between himself and his audience in fact he is with this film establishing himself as one among the audience one among those who are astonished by this new mechanical marvel one among those who would like to be photographed by it and—he would make the most of the implication later—one among those who are invariably chased away he looked at the camera and went through it joining the rest of us the seeds of his subsequent hold on the public the mysterious and almost inexplicable bond between this performer and everyman were there 11the genius of the tramp character is that he is so human and familiar—he is one of us it is remarkable that when directed by sennett to find something funny to wear chaplin invented spontaneously that day in 1914 a symbol of all downtrodden and resilient humanity chaplin took every opportunity he could to learn the business of making films and in his first efforts went beyond what was expected of him he believed he could be creating the scenarios and directing his films better than keystone directors lehrman george nichols and even sennett when he was assigned to take direction from mabel normand for the tworeel comedy mabel at the wheel and normand would not take his suggestions for his character’s comedy business chaplin confronted her and refused to work on the film for the rest of the day in protest according to chaplin sennett at that point was on the brink of discharging him but a telegram from the front office arrived clamoring for more chaplin pictures sennett mollified chaplin and normand and they completed mabel at the wheel amicably chaplin then asked to direct his own films volunteering to deposit 1500—his entire savings—as a guarantee if it could not be released sennett agreed and promised chaplin a 25 bonus for each picture he made as a director from his first films as director twenty minutes of love and caught in the rain to the end of his year at keystone chaplin directed many of the films in which he appeared the notable exception being tillie’s punctured romance 12chaplin’s keystone films greatly differed from the gentle sophisticated comedy that would be the hallmark of his later work yet chaplin injected into the keystone comedies an acute understanding of character and movement that he had refined during his years in the british music halls and a style of comedy that was polished yet appeared spontaneous at the same time within weeks of the tramp’s first appearance the public had embraced him orders for the chaplin keystone films grew tremendously it would only take a few months for chaplin to be recognized as the most popular comedian in motion pictures although his great fame and global stardom would not flower until after he signed with the essanay film manufacturing company in early 1915 once chaplin had control over his own films he began to enjoy his work at keystone “it was this charming alfresco spirit that was a delight—a challenge to one’s creativeness it was so free and easy—no literature no writers we just had a notion around which we built gags then made up the story as we went along” 13 he recalled in his autobiography most of the films were made in a week a park a hotel a café a dentist’s office a bakery a racetrack backstage of a theater or even a motion picture studio were the simple backdrops against which chaplin’s inspired comedies unfolded chaplin reprised his famed falldown drunk from his karno days on several occasions at keystone mabel’s strange predicament tango tangles his favorite pastime mabel’s married life the rounders chaplin’s years with karno also prepared him well for the considerable athletic prowess required to perform the pratfalls and physical clowning of the keystone comedian in the keystone films chaplin imbues the tramp with some of his famous traits the waddling shuffle the way he rounds a corner making a sharp turn and skidding holding one foot straight out and balancing on the other foot while holding his hat his iconoclastic nosethumbing known as “cock a snoot” at propriety and authority and his twitching moustache he can be seen dropkicking a cigarette over his shoulder or laughing at the camera behavior that would appear in subsequent films the tramp’s reactions to a situation were often more interesting than the situations themselves the new janitor 1914the new janitor a onereel comedy is the first appearance of pathos in a chaplin film chaplin later recalled i can trace the first prompting of a desire to add another dimension to my films besides that of comedy i was playing in a picture called the new janitor in a scene in which the manager of the office fires me in pleading with him to take pity on me and let me retain my job i started to pantomime appealingly that i had a large family of little children although i was enacting mock sentiment dorothy davenport an old actress was on the sidelines watching the scene and during rehearsal i looked up and to my surprise found her in tears ‘i know it’s supposed to be funny’ she said ‘but you just make me weep’ she confirmed something i already felt i had the ability to evoke tears as well as laughter 14posters for dough and dynamite ouside a cinema dough and dynamite a tworeel comedy directed by chaplin is one of the most successful keystone films charlie and chester conklin are waiters at a bakerycafé who are forced by their illtempered employer to man the ovens when the bakers go on strike the film is filled with wonderful comedy touches such as charlie balancing a tray of bread loaves on his head and making doughnuts by flinging dough around his wrists like bracelets in both characterization and structure dough and dynamite is much finer than other comedy films of the time according to chaplin the film took nine days to film at a cost of 1800 because he went over his prescribed budget of 1000 sennett withheld his 25 directing bonus yet the film grossed more than 135000 in its first year 15tillies punctured romance 1914tillie’s punctured romance is hollywood’s first featurelength slapstick comedy it was designed to star the famous stage comedienne marie dressler and was based on tillie’s nightmare the 1910 broadway hit that gave new impetus to her already impressive and lengthy career despite chaplin having only a supporting role in the production tillie’s punctured romance benefited him more than anyone else when the film was released nearly every motionpicture producer pursued him wanting to sign him to a contract directed by mack sennett and filmed in approximately fortyfive days tillie’s punctured romance was tremendously popular when released and chaplin was singled out for his considerable work in making the film a hit chaplin however did not think much of the film in his autobiography he dismissed it “it was pleasant working with marie but i did not think the picture had much merit” 16chaplin’s personal life during his time at keystone was almost nonexistent he worked long hours six days a week keystone player peggy pearce was apparently his first known love in los angeles he met her he remembered in the third week at the studio and described her as his “first heartthrob” however chaplin recalled “at that time i had no desire to marry anyone freedom was too much an adventure no woman could measure up to that vague image i had in my mind” 17chaplin’s last keystone releases as actordirector were the sophisticated tworeeler his prehistoric past and the simple onereel park film getting acquainted both proved to be a strain on his concentration with so many business propositions required his attention “i suppose that was the most exciting period of my career for i was on the threshold of something wonderful” 18 chaplin later wrote when keystone sought to renew chaplin’s contract he announced to sennett that he wanted 1000 a week sennett responded that that was more than he earned himself to which chaplin replied “i know it but the public doesn’t line up outside the boxoffice when your name appears sic as they do for mine” 19 the producer was unwilling to meet his demands sennett’s “fun factory” was indeed a factory and chaplin’s films only a part of its product sennett was willing to lose one key comedian after another always hoping to replace them with someone good who would not disturb the economic equilibrium of the production line chaplin refined keystone slapstick and film comedy in general by slowing down the frantic pace of the films giving them a rudimentary structure and establishing a strong character which he accomplished by drawing on his knowledge of stagecraft and pantomime at keystone he developed film technique and comic pacing for motion pictures that he would employ in some form or fashion for the rest of his career although chaplin’s relationship with the leader of the keystone “fun factory” was often rocky sennett was a man of great enthusiasm if the work was good a trait he shared with fred karno and he afforded chaplin the validation he needed ultimately when sennett gave chaplin control over his own films the men worked well together chaplin also admired sennett’s belief in his own taste a quality he instilled in the actor that helped to stimulate his creative imagination chaplin’s tenure at keystone is important because it marks the birth of the tramp more than just a great character the tramp embodies the heroic age of cinema to many he was film as lewis jacobs wrote in 1939 “to think of charlie chaplin is to think of the movies” 20chaplin photo by witzel 1914an extraordinary aspect of chaplin’s popularity is that he quickly became the most popular comedian in america and soon after throughout the world it is staggering to consider that not only was there no radio television or internet to publicize or advertise the tramp but also the keystone film company never credited its players by name on the films themselves or on its posters during chaplin‘s tenure to draw a crowd many exhibitors merely cut out a cardboard figure of the tramp and placed it outside the cinema with the phrase “i am here today” 21chaplin said “all i need to make comedy is a park a policeman and a pretty girl” 22 he was confident in his own ideas however despite the advances in film comedy he made at keystone his tramp character was far from fully formed it would take several years for chaplin to develop the emotional range that would mark his mature art yet this art began at keystone as mack sennett remembered “it was a long time before he abandoned cruelty venality treachery larceny and lechery as the main characteristics of the tramp chaplin shrank his tramp in gradually diminishing sizes and made him pathetic—and loveable” 23after completing over thirtyfive films for keystone of various lengths—split reels onereelers and tworeelers plus the feature film tillie’s punctured romance—chaplin emerged triumphant from his first experience in motion pictures without knowing his name audiences embraced him as the most popular character in film comedy not a bad beginning for a young vaudevillian who thought he was summoned to a lawyer’s office to receive an old aunt’s inheritance notes 1 charles chaplin my autobiography london 1964 145 2 chaplin’s contract with the keystone

which he had appeared indicating six of them as “my own” the earliest of the six was twenty minutes of love suggesting it as his directorial debut chaplin’s 1924 article “does the public know what it wants” gives further confirmation that chaplin considered twenty minutes of love as his directorial debut chaplin “does the public know what it wants” adelphi 1 no 8 jan 1924 702 however chaplin wrote in his autobiography that caught in the rain was the first film he directed historians may never know with absolute certainty which film was chaplin’s first as a director chaplin’s contribution to twenty minutes of love may have been confined to story or comic business maddern may have provided supervision to chaplin’s apprentice effort it is suggestive that chaplin remembered in his
