—product description building on its patentpending design that has taken the bearing category and the speed record books by storm seismic now introduces a 6ball version of the tekton™ – constructed with fewer larger stronger balls than ordinary 608z bearings this means less total ballraceway surface contact less friction quicker acceleration higher speed and longer life the balls are rated p4 the highest grade available which means a superhigh degree of roundness extremely smooth surfaces and even more speed and durability for extra credit seismic adds one of the most expensive lubes available  all tekton bearings feature wide flat contact surfaces at the ends of integrated custommachined halfspacers the broad flanges square up coalign and selfstabilize inside your wheels – correcting for flaws in bearing seat levelness bearing seat spacing axle diameter and axle straightness the tektons literally block themselves from sitting or rocking out of alignment so they stay straighter than any other bearing system ever your wheels roll faster with better control while the bearings last longer and stay quieter  other features include dupont engineeringgrade nylon retainers black outer casings and removable rubbercoated steel seals with printed graphic the inner race is specially contoured underneath the seal to resist contamination and it’s stepped between the bearing and the flange to save weight on the side opposite the flange the inner race extends 05mm to form a thin integrated washer product details item weight 352 ounces shipping weight 64 ounces

ive pretty much always rode bones swiss or reds on my boards and always loved em so i came across these here on amazon they look and sound like some decent bearings figured id switch it up and give these puppies a try when you first open them up they are a bit deceiving they dont seem to spin very long out of the box but as soon as you install them and go for your first ride you can tell instantly that these are some fast bearings my bro has a longboard with reds and my shorttrick board with these seismics absolutely smokes it imo these are very comparable to bones swiss personally i will buy these over the swiss though from now on these seem to ride a bit smoother faster and longer and the built in spacers are nice as well just ordered a set of the ceramic seismics about twice price as these so ill be doing a review on them in a couple weeks to see if the price difference is worth it comment 14 people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no report abuse stephanie carter50 out of 5 stars son loves themjuly 8 2017verified purchase ordered these for my son he changed them out with his old ones and said he loves them works great and really helped him with picking up speed comment was this review helpful to you yes no report abuse amazon customer30 out of 5 stars alright october 3 2017verified purchasenot the fastest bearing but only a week of riding they are decent ill gve them a month to see if they improve comment was this review helpful to you yes no report abusehehehe50 out of 5 stars get emmarch 8 2014verified purchase i rode em for a week thought they were smooth quick etc week two they broke in omfg sooo fast months later ive only hit em with speed cream after some sever water contact still holding strong and fast mountain bike garage will confirm they couldnt keep up comment 6 people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no report abuse rudy f louisville ky50 out of 5 stars when they say fast they mean fastapril 5 2013verified purchaseon the box it says the bearing behind the world speed record set by mischo erban once you get them out and ride them for the first time you will understand why these bearings are incredibly fast straight out of the box im scared to see what their top speed will be once broken in not exactly sure but i think the standard 7 ball abec 7 tekton was the one used for the world speed record so if thats true then in theory these six ball tektons and the 7 ball ceramic tektons should be capable of even higher speeds than the 8083mph record set by erban so if youre looking for hispeed on a budget these are cheaper than bones swiss super 6 balls and have a better design with their selfaligning spacers that make them stay perfectly aligned wether your running with cheap non faced cast hangers w standard size axles or have precision hangers that are perfectly faced with precision 8mm axles i would highly reccomend these bearings if they are in youre price range but if they arent go for zealous they have similar features and are pretty much just as fast once broken in just with the zealous bearings its the lube that makes them fast so you must ride in clean dry areas until they are broken in so u dont risk lubricant washout which is not a worry with these so if u got the extra dough go for tektons also i have no experience w ceramics but after riding the bones super swiss and reds which seem to be the industry standard these are way better in almost every way get them dont matter 7 ball 6 ball ceramic these bearings are awesome do itcomment 15 people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no report abuse adonis famila50 out of 5 stars solid upgrade december 15 2013verified purchase these bearings spin very well they felt stable and right out of the box before they were broken in they spun better than my busting abec 7 bearings this is that most money im willing to spend on bearings so i feel satisfied with these comment 4 people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no report abuse len cutler20 out of 5 stars counterfeit fake and not worth it february 13 2015verified purchase im having serious doubts about whether or not these are real seismics at all first off one of the bearings just doesnt fit on any of my trucks at all just one the rest fit fine but that one just wont work tried it on three different sets of trucks one of them brand new no dice it could be a production issue but when one of the major selling points is how well engineered these things are its not comforting to learn that the construction and quality control are sloppy enough for this to happen at all then theres the second problem held in between my fingers that last bearing spins for less than a second my old reds do better than that they might look like the real thing but they sure feel like a cheapo knockoff im returning these asap and getting some bones instead comment was this review helpful to you yes no
