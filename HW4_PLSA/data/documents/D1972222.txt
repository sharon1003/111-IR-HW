was born 5 october of the same year but died in infancy the only child to survive infancy richard junius booth was born 21 january 1819 2career  editbooth’s interests in theatre came after he attended a production of othello at the covent garden theatre the prospects of fame fortune and freedom were very appealing to young booth he displayed a talent for acting from an early age deciding on a career in the theatre by the age of 17 he performed roles in several small theatres throughout england and joined a tour of the low countries in 1814 returning the following year to make his london debut booth gained national renown in england with his performance in the title role of richard iii in 1817 at the covent garden theatre critics compared his performances favorably with those of edmund kean who was at the time the foremost tragedian in britain partisans of the two actors called boothites and keanites would occasionally start rows at venues where the two were playing together this did not stop the two from performing in the same plays kean and booth acted in several shakespearean productions at the drury lane theatre from 1817 to 1821 kean then saw booth as a threat and orchestrated a way for the two of them to perform those roles yet again planning to outperform his opponent kean’s longstanding presence contributed to booth’s neverending comparisons to his rival move to the united states  editin 1821 booth emigrated to the united states with mary ann holmes a flower girl abandoning his wife and their young son booth and holmes claimed to be married that year 2 and settled in 1822 near bel air maryland for years they lived in a log cabin booth bought moved to his 150 acres and whitewashed just before his death he began building a much grander house which he named tudor hall it was listed on the national register of historic places in 1973 3booth was quickly hired to play richard iii in less than a year booth became the most prominent actor in the united states critic william winter said he was followed as a marvel mention of his name stirred an enthusiasm no other could awaken smith 23 he embarked upon a 30year acting career that made him famous throughout the country booth traveled to such cities as baltimore boston and new york a persistent story but apocryphal according to some sources is that junius brutus booth was acclaimed for performing orestes in the french language in new orleans theatrical manager noah ludlow who was performing with booth at the time at the american theatre in new orleans recounts the actual events starting on page 230 of his memoir dramatic life as i found it and concludes therefore i consider the story of mr booth having performed orestes in the french language on the french stage altogether a mistake arising from his having acted that character in the french theatre of new orleans in 1822 but in the english language 4 however stephen m archer notes that ludlow was in mobile alabama in 1828 so was not present for this performance the folger shakespeare library in washington dc has two playbills from the production and both are in french booths daughter asia wrote that her father spoke fluent french and cited a review on the subject the review was not oblivious to the fact that booths french pronunciation was less than perfect however 5 in 1823 booth did the role in new york in the english adaptation by ambrose philips with mary ann duff as hermione ltor booths sons john edwin and junius jr in julius caesar in 1825–1826 and 1836–1837 booth made tours of his native england he took his whole family with him for the second of these during their stay in england one of his children henry byron succumbed to smallpox by 1831 he had become the manager of the adelphi theatre in baltimore his acclaim continued to grow throughout the rest of his life walt whitman described him as the grandest histrion sic of modern times although his relationship with holmes his supposed wife was relatively happy four of their children died three in the same year 1833 when epidemics of cholera occurred in addition he suffered from alcoholism which had an effect on the entire family booth’s alcoholism also caused him to become increasingly unpredictable and reckless he would drop lines miss scenes and cause chaos onstage during a performance of hamlet booth suddenly left the scene he was playing with ophelia scurried up a ladder and perched up in the backdrops crowing like a rooster until his manager retrieved him he was once booked for a soldout performance in richmond then disappeared from town for several days eventually he was found with ragged besotted wretches the greatest actor on the american stage booths alcoholism and violent nature often caused problems onstage during his performances on several occasions when he played the title character in richard iii the actor playing the earl of richmond fled the stage when booth became too aggressive during their dueling scene one night when booth was appearing as othello the actress playing desdemona had to be rescued by other cast members when booth tried to genuinely suffocate her with a pillow 6booth soon became so unreliable that he had to be locked into his hotel rooms with a guard standing watch often he would still find ways of escaping to drink at a nearby tavern once when a theater manager locked booth in his dressing room before a performance booth bribed a stage hand to go out and buy a bottle of whiskey as the stage hand stood outside the door booth stuck a drinking straw through the keyhole and sipped whiskey from the bottle 7booths violent behavior offstage was notable as well in charleston in 1838 booth was so intoxicated that he attacked a friend tom flynn with a fireplace andiron to defend himself flynn hit booth in the face breaking his nose and forever altering the actors profile and voice 8some historians and critics have claimed that reality could become overwhelming for booth so he would flee into alcoholism and the roles he played one critic said of booth that the personality of the actor was forgotten and all the details seemed spontaneous workings and unconscious illustrations of the character he represented he seemed to be possessed by the characters losing his own identity such subjective judgments are perhaps too facile as edwin booths later comment about his father certainly was great minds to madness closely are allied in any case from february 1817 onward junius booth played almost 3000 performances booth brought a romantic natural acting style to america which he pioneered in the hearts of american audiences to help him maintain a modicum of stability and also to ensure that he sent his earnings home to the family junius and mary ann chose their son edwin to accompany him as his dresser aid and guardian this was an exhausting job because junius brutus could go without sleep for very long periods of time and would often disappear in 1835 booth wrote a letter to president andrew jackson demanding he pardon two pirates in the letter he threatened to kill the president though there would also be an actual attempt of assassination on the president early that year the letter was believed to be a hoax until a handwriting analysis of a letter written some days after the threat concluded that the letter was in fact written by booth 9 booth apologized to jackson though since he and jackson were friends the threat likely was booths clumsy attempt at a joke 10 decades later booth’s son john wilkes assassinated president abraham lincoln 11later life  editin 1852 booth was involved in a tour of california with his sons edwin and junius jr performing in san francisco and sacramento where torrential rains not only closed the theatres but also seriously depleted food supplies inflation skyrocketed and the booths returned to san francisco without having made a penny on 1 october he left san francisco without either of his sons junius jr had previously established his home there and edwin struck out on his own acting in various venues in northern california booth had told his first wife at the time of his initial departure from england that he would be touring the united states for several years but would send her money to support her and his young son richard but booths sister and brotherinlaw later arrived with their children from england and demanded to be housed and supported in exchange for keeping quiet about his american family after some years this arrangement became financially untenable and booth stopped sending his wife money so regularly this prompted adelaide to send their son now 25 to baltimore for three years booth somehow fooled him into believing that he lived alone but eventually richard discovered the truth he sent word to his mother who arrived in baltimore in december 1846 and confronted booth when he returned home from touring in march after living the requisite three years in maryland she was able to divorce him in february 1851 on 10 may 1851 with the youngest of their 10 children now 11 years of age booth finally legally married mary ann holmes 2 12death
