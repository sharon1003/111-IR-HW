neural prosthetics is a discipline related to neuroscience and biomedical engineering concerned with developing neural prostheses they are sometimes contrasted with a brain–computer interface which connects the brain to a computer rather than a device meant to replace missing biological functionality 1neural prostheses are a series of devices that can substitute a motor sensory or cognitive modality that might have been damaged as a result of an injury or a disease cochlear implants provide an example of such devices these devices substitute the functions performed by the ear drum and stapes while simulating the frequency analysis performed in the cochlea a microphone on an external unit gathers the sound and processes it the processed signal is then transferred to an implanted unit that stimulates the auditory nerve through a microelectrode array through the replacement or augmentation of damaged senses these devices intend to improve the quality of life for those with disabilities these implantable devices are also commonly used in animal experimentation as a tool to aid neuroscientists in developing a greater understanding of the brain and its functioning by wirelessly monitoring the brains electrical signals sent out by electrodes implanted in the subjects brain the subject can be studied without the device affecting the results accurately probing and recording the electrical signals in the brain would help better understand the relationship among a local population of neurons that are responsible for a specific function neural implants are designed to be as small as possible in order to be minimally invasive particularly in areas surrounding the brain eyes or cochlea these implants typically communicate with their prosthetic counterparts wirelessly additionally power is currently received through wireless power transmission through the skin the tissue surrounding the implant is usually highly sensitive to temperature rise meaning that power consumption must be minimal in order to prevent tissue damage 2the neuroprosthetic currently undergoing the most widespread use is the cochlear implant with over 300000 in use

was created in 1957 other milestones include the first motor prosthesis for foot drop in hemiplegia in 1961 the first auditory brainstem implant in 1977 and a peripheral nerve bridge implanted into the spinal cord of an adult rat in 1981 in 1988 the lumbar anterior root implant and functional electrical stimulation fes facilitated standing and walking respectively for a group of paraplegics 4regarding the development of electrodes implanted in the brain an early difficulty was reliably locating the electrodes originally done by inserting the electrodes with needles and breaking off the needles at the desired depth recent systems utilize more advanced probes such as those used in deep brain stimulation to alleviate the symptoms of parkinsons disease the problem with either approach is that the brain floats free in the skull while the probe does not and relatively minor impacts such as a low speed car accident are potentially damaging some researchers such as kensall wise at the university of michigan have proposed tethering electrodes to be mounted on the exterior surface of the brain to the inner surface of the skull however even if successful tethering would not resolve the problem in devices meant to be inserted deep into the brain such as in the case of deep brain stimulation dbs visual prosthetics  editmain article visual prosthetic a visual prosthesis can create a sense of image by electrically stimulating neurons in the visual system a camera would wirelessly transmit to an implant the implant would map the image across an array of electrodes the array of electrodes has to effectively stimulate 6001000 locations stimulating these optic neurons in the retina thus will create an image the stimulation can also be done anywhere along the optic signals path way the optical nerve can be stimulated in order to create an image or the visual cortex can be stimulated although clinical tests have proven most successful for retinal implants a visual prosthesis system consists of an external or implantable imaging system which acquires and processes the video power and data will be transmitted to the implant wirelessly by the external unit the implant uses the received powerdata to convert the digital data to an analog output which will be delivered to the nerve via micro electrodes photoreceptors are the specialized neurons that convert photons into electrical signals they are part of the retina a multilayer neural structure about 200 um thick that lines the back of the eye the processed signal is sent to the brain through the optical nerve if any part of this pathway is damaged blindness can occur blindness can result from damage to the optical pathway  cornea aqueous humor crystalline lens and vitreous  this can happen as a result of accident or disease the two most common retinal degenerative diseases that result in blindness secondary to photoreceptor loss is age related macular degeneration amd and retinitis pigmentosa rp the first clinical trial of a permanently implanted retinal prosthesis was a device with a passive microphotodiode array with 3500 elements 5 this trial was implemented at optobionics inc in 2000 in 2002 second sight medical products inc sylmar ca began a trial with a prototype epiretinal implant with 16 electrodes the subjects were six individuals with bare light perception secondary to rp the subjects demonstrated their ability to distinguish between three common objects plate cup and knife at levels statistically above chance an active sub retinal device developed by retina implant gmb h reutlingen germany began clinical trials in 2006 an ic with 1500 microphotodiodes was implanted under the retina the microphotodiodes serve to modulate current pulses based on the amount of light incident on the photo diode 6the seminal experimental work towards the development of visual prostheses was done by cortical stimulation using a grid of large surface electrodes in 1968 giles brindley implanted an 80 electrode device on the visual cortical surface of a 52yearold blind woman as a result of the stimulation the patient was able to see phosphenes in 40 different positions of the visual field 7 this experiment showed that an implanted electrical stimulator device could restore some degree of vision recent efforts in visual cortex prosthesis have evaluated efficacy of visual cortex stimulation in a nonhuman primate in this experiment after a training and mapping process the monkey is able to perform the same visual saccade task with both light and electrical stimulation the requirements for a high resolution retinal prosthesis should follow from the needs and desires of blind individuals who will benefit from the device interactions with these patients indicate that mobility without a cane face recognition and reading are the main necessary enabling capabilities 8the results and implications of fully functional visual prostheses are exciting however the challenges are grave in order for a good quality image to be mapped in the retina a high number of microscale electrode arrays are needed also the image quality is dependent on how much information can be sent over the wireless link also this high amount of information must be received and processed by the implant without much power dissipation which can damage the tissue the size of the implant is also of great concern any implant would be preferred to be minimally invasive 8with this new technology several scientists including karen moxon at drexel john chapin at suny and miguel nicolelis at duke university started research on the design of a sophisticated visual prosthesis other scientists  who have disagreed with the focus of their research arguing that the basic research and design of the densely populated microscopic wire was not sophisticated enough to proceed auditory prosthetics  editmain articles cochlear implant and auditory brainstem implant for receiving soundcochlear implants cis auditory brain stem implants abis and auditory midbrain implants amis are the three main categories for auditory prostheses ci electrode arrays are implanted in the cochlea abi electrode arrays stimulate the cochlear nucleus complex in the lower brain stem and amis stimulates auditory neurons in the inferior colliculus cochlear implants have been very successful among these three categories today the advanced bionics corporation the cochlear corporation and the medel corporation are the major commercial providers of cochlea implants in contrast to traditional hearing aids that amplify sound and send it through the external ear cochlear implants acquire and process the sound and convert it into electrical energy for subsequent delivery to the auditory nerve the microphone of the ci system receives sound from the external environment and sends it to processor the processor digitizes the sound and filters it into separate frequency bands that are sent to the appropriate tonotonic region in the cochlea that approximately corresponds to those frequencies in 1957 french researchers a djourno and c eyries with the help of d kayser provided the first detailed description of directly stimulation the auditory nerve in a human subject 9 the individuals described hearing chirping sounds during simulation in 1972 the first portable cochlear implant system in an adult was implanted at the house ear clinic the u s food and drug administration fda formally approved the marketing of the house3m cochlear implant in november 1984 10improved performance in cochlea implants not only depends on understanding the physical and biophysical limitations of implant stimulation but also on an understanding of the brains pattern processing requirements modern signal processing represents the most important speech information while also providing the brain the pattern recognition information that it needs pattern recognition in the brain is more effective than algorithmic preprocessing at identifying important features in speech a combination of engineering signal processing biophysics and cognitive neuroscience was necessary to produce the right balance of technology to maximize the performance of auditory prosthesis 11cochlear implants have been also used to allow acquiring of spoken language development in congenitally deaf children with remarkable success in early implantations before 2–4 years of life have been reached 12 there have been about 80000 children implanted worldwide the concept of combining simultaneous electricacoustic stimulation eas for the purposes of better hearing was first described by c von ilberg and j kiefer from the universitätsklinik frankfurt germany in 1999 13 that same year the first eas patient was implanted since the early 2000s fda has been involved in a clinical trial of device termed the hybrid by cochlear corporation this trial is aimed at examining the usefulness of cochlea implantation in patients with residual lowfrequency hearing the hybrid utilizes a shorter electrode than the standard cochlea implant since the electrode is shorter it stimulates the basil region of the cochlea and hence the highfrequency tonotopic region in theory these devices would benefit patients with significant lowfrequency residual hearing who have lost perception in the speech frequency range and hence have decreased discrimination scores 14for producing sound see speech synthesis prosthetics for pain relief  editmain article spinal cord stimulator the scs spinal cord stimulator device has two main components an electrode and a generator the technical goal of scs for neuropathic pain is to mask the area of a patients pain with a stimulation induced tingling known as  paresthesia  because this overlap is necessary but not sufficient to achieve pain relief 15 paresthesia coverage depends upon which afferent nerves are stimulated the most easily recruited by a dorsal midline electrode close to the pial surface of spinal cord are the large dorsal column afferents which produce broad paresthesia covering segments caudally in ancient times the electrogenic fish was used as a shocker to subside pain healers had developed specific and detailed techniques to exploit the generative qualities of the fish to treat various types of pain including headache because of the awkwardness of using a living shock generator a fair level of skill was required to deliver the therapy to the target for the proper amount of time including keeping the fish alive as long as possible electro analgesia was the first deliberate application of electricity by the nineteenth century most western physicians were offering their patients electrotherapy delivered by portable generator 16 in the mid1960s however three things converged to ensure the future of electro stimulation pacemaker technology which had it start in 1950 became available melzack and wall published their gate control theory of pain which proposed that the transmission of pain could be blocked by stimulation of large afferent fibers 17pioneering physicians became interested in stimulating the nervous system to relieve patients from pain the design options for electrodes include their size shape arrangement number and assignment of contacts and how the electrode is implanted the design option for the pulse generator include the power source target anatomic placement location current or voltage source pulse rate pulse width and number of independent channels programming options are very numerous a fourcontact electrode offers 50 functional bipolar combinations the current devices use computerized equipment to find the best options for use this reprogramming option compensates for postural changes electrode migration changes in pain location and suboptimal electrode placement 18motor prosthetics  editdevices which support the function of autonomous nervous system include the implant for bladder control in the somatic nervous system attempts to aid conscious control of movement include functional electrical stimulation and the lumbar anterior root stimulator bladder control implants  editmain article sacral anterior root stimulator where a spinal cord lesion leads to paraplegia patients have difficulty emptying their bladders and this can cause infection from 1969 onwards brindley developed the sacral anterior root stimulator with successful human trials from the early 1980s onwards 19 this device is implanted over the sacral anterior root ganglia of the spinal cord controlled by an external transmitter it delivers intermittent stimulation which improves bladder emptying it also assists in defecation and enables male patients to have a sustained full erection the related procedure of sacral nerve stimulation is for the control of incontinence in ablebodied patients 20motor prosthetics for conscious control of movement  editmain article brain–computer interface researchers are currently investigating and building motor neuroprosthetics that will help restore movement and the ability to communicate with the outside world to persons with motor disabilities such as tetraplegia or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis research has found that the striatum plays a crucial role in motor sensory learning this was demonstrated by an experiment in which lab rats firing rates of the striatum was recorded at higher rates after performing a task consecutively to capture electrical signals from the brain scientists have developed microelectrode arrays smaller than a square centimeter that can be implanted in the skull to record electrical activity transducing recorded information through a thin cable after decades of research in monkeys neuroscientists have been able to decode neuronal signals into movements completing the translation researchers have built interfaces that allow patients to move computer cursors and they are beginning to build robotic limbs and exoskeletons that patients can control by thinking about movement the technology behind motor neuroprostheses is still in its infancy investigators and study participants continue to experiment with different ways of using the prostheses having a patient think about clenching a fist for example produces a different result than having him or her think about tapping a finger the filters used in the prostheses are also being finetuned and in the future doctors hope to create an implant capable of transmitting signals from inside the skull wirelessly as opposed to through a cable preliminary clinical trials suggest that the devices are safe and that they have the potential to be effective  citation needed some patients have worn the devices for over two years with few if any ill effects  citation neededprior to these advancements philip kennedy  emory and georgia tech had an operable if somewhat primitive system which allowed an individual with paralysis to spell words by modulating their brain activity kennedys device used two neurotrophic electrodes the first was implanted in an intact motor cortical region eg finger representation area and was used to move a cursor among a group of letters the second was implanted in a different motor region and was used to indicate the selection 21developments continue in replacing lost arms with cybernetic replacements by using nerves normally connected to the pectoralis muscles these arms allow a slightly limited range of motion and reportedly are slated to feature sensors for detecting pressure and temperature 22dr todd kuiken at northwestern university and rehabilitation institute of chicago has developed a method called targeted reinnervation for an amputee to control motorized prosthetic devices and to regain sensory feedback sensorymotor prosthetics  editin 2002 an multielectrode array of 100 electrodes which now forms the sensor part of a braingate was implanted directly into the median nerve fibers of scientist kevin warwick the recorded signals were used to control a robot arm developed by warwicks colleague peter kyberd and was able to mimic the actions of warwicks own arm 23 additionally a form of sensory feedback was provided via the implant by passing small electrical currents into the nerve this caused a contraction of the first lumbrical muscle of the hand and it was this movement that was perceived 23obstacles  editmathematical modelling  editaccurate characterization of the nonlinear inputoutput io parameters of the normally functioning tissue to be replaced is paramount to designing a prosthetic that mimics normal biologic synaptic signals 24 25 mathematical modeling of these signals is a complex task because of the nonlinear dynamics inherent in the cellularmolecular mechanisms comprising neurons and their synaptic connections 26 27 28 the output of nearly all brain neurons are dependent on which postsynaptic inputs are active and in what order the inputs are received spatial and temporal properties respectively 29once the io parameters are modeled mathematically integrated circuits are designed to mimic the normal biologic signals for the prosthetic to perform like normal tissue it must process the input signals a process known as transformation in the same way as normal tissue size  editimplantable devices must be very small to be implanted directly in the brain roughly the size of a quarter one of the example of microimplantable electrode array is the utah array 30wireless controlling devices can be mounted outside of the skull and should be smaller than a pager power consumption  editpower consumption drives battery size optimization of the implanted circuits reduces power needs implanted devices currently need onboard power sources once the battery runs out surgery is needed to replace the unit longer battery life correlates to fewer surgeries needed to replace batteries one option that could be used to recharge implant batteries without surgery or wires is being used in powered toothbrushes  citation needed these devices make use of inductive coupling to recharge batteries another strategy is to convert electromagnetic energy into electrical energy as in radiofrequency identification tags biocompatibility  editcognitive prostheses are implanted directly in the brain so biocompatibility is a very important obstacle to overcome materials used in the housing of the device the electrode material such as iridium oxide 31  and electrode insulation must be chosen for long term implantation subject to standards iso 147083 20081115 implants for surgery  active implantable medical devices part 3 implantable neurostimulators crossing the blood–brain barrier can introduce pathogens or other materials that may cause an immune response the brain has its own immune system that acts differently from the immune system of the rest of the body questions to answer how does this affect material choice does the brain have unique phages that act differently and may affect materials thought to be biocompatible in other areas of the body data transmission  editwireless transmission is being developed to allow continuous recording of neuronal signals of individuals in their daily life this allows physicians and clinicians to capture more data ensuring that short term events like epileptic seizures can be recorded allowing better treatment and characterization of neural disease a small light weight device has been developed that allows constant recording of primate brain neurons at stanford university 32 this technology also enables neuroscientists to study the brain outside of the controlled environment of a lab methods of data transmission must be robust and secure neurosecurity is a new issue makers of cognitive implants must prevent unwanted downloading of information or thoughts  citation needed from and uploading of detrimental data to the device that may interrupt function correct implantation  editimplantation of the device presents many problems first the correct presynaptic inputs must be wired to the correct postsynaptic inputs on the device secondly the outputs from the device must be targeted correctly on the desired tissue thirdly the brain must learn how to use the implant various studies in brain plasticity suggest that this may be possible through exercises designed with proper motivation technologies involved  editlocal field potentials  editlocal field potentials lfps are electrophysiological signals that are related to the sum of all dendritic synaptic activity within a volume of tissue recent studies suggest goals and expected value are highlevel cognitive functions that can be used for neural cognitive prostheses 33 also rice university scientists have discovered a new method to tune the lightinduced vibrations of nanoparticles through slight alterations to the surface to which the particles are attached according to the university the discovery could lead to new applications of photonics from molecular sensing to wireless communications they used ultrafast laser pulses to induce the atoms in gold nanodisks to vibrate 34automated movable electrical probes  editone hurdle to overcome is the long term implantation of electrodes if the electrodes are moved by physical shock or the brain moves in relation to electrode position the electrodes could be recording different nerves adjustment to electrodes is necessary to maintain an optimal signal individually adjusting multi electrode arrays is a very tedious and time consuming process development of automatically adjusting electrodes would mitigate this problem andersons group is currently collaborating with yuchong tais lab and the burdick lab all at caltech to make such a system that uses electrolysisbased actuators to independently adjust electrodes in a chronically implanted array of electrodes 35imaged guided surgical techniques
