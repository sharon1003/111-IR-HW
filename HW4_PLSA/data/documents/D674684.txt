exboston red sox pitcher and an alcoholic owns the bar its purchase and this life which was his salvation from his alcoholism which was largely the cause of the end of his baseball career he ends up having a lovehate relationship with intellectual diane chambers who he hires as a waitress and whose cultured mentality is foreign to anyone else in the bar he also has an evolving relationship with rebecca howe who managed the bar for the lily corporation which bought it from sam but whose outward business savvy belied the fact that she was a mess of a woman who was struggling to find her place

»user reviews raise your glasses17 july 2012  by jcosms – see all my reviews i adored cheers on its original release in the early 80s and have lately been revisiting my adoration in catching reruns right back to the first series like the best series it makes you stay with it through series after series cast changes or not like other american favourites of mine the mary tylermoore show rhoda m a s h taxi newhart and more recently friends indeed its easy to see cheers influence on the latter both fixing much of the action on a popular drinking hole this was back in the days when writers wrote laughoutloud jokes and characters you could empathise with unlike todays post modern ironic shows where the odd line might make you smile at best cheers always kept you watching for the next line which more often than not brought forth a laugh setbound as it was like say the bridge on the starship enterprise familiarity bred content as you got to know the characters and their surroundings the characters were great from the start sam mayday malone pseudointellectual barmaid diane the feral barmaid carla permanent barstool residents cliff and norm and best of all the dotty bar manager coach with a heart of pure gold newer characters entered as the series progressed especially oddballs frazier and lilith crane carlas combative husband nick and later the dim young barman woody harrelsons woody a great replacement for coach and kirsty alleys backseat becky ditto for diane great as the smart direction and comedic delivery were it was all about the writing great writers like heidi perlman the charles brothers david lloyd and earl pomerantz kept the quality high season after season as im sure my endtoend reviewing will testify 7 down 244 to go9 of 11 people found this review
