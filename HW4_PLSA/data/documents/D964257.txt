fruit and veg are good wouldnt suggest to feed a rabbit biscuits sugar yoghurt or bread though youve got to try and give them things that they would find in the wild if you want to give it treats then buy them from a pet shop they are specfically made for animals probably weeing a lot because all fruit and veg contains water if thats all you ate you would wee a lot too lots of people have house bunnies so potty training is a must otherwise you would be constantly stepping in pooh again go to the pet store and buy litter and a tray constantly pop the rabbit in there when it is about to go to the loo it should learn that it must go in the litter tray good luck and give him a hug from mehelen · 10 years ago0 0 comment askers rating you are feeding too much fruit no good not a bit they need hay timothy hay and more hay this is their main diet and they should never be without any rabbit pellets not the commercial mix with nuts and fruits are 14 cup only and then you can give greens broccoli parsely spinach kale etc fruit is a treat and should only be given in small quantity and only once a week or once in a while bread yogurt busicuits sugar tomatoes prepared food store saladsare no good food store salads have chemicals added to them plums cherries apples pears peaches bananas are good once in a while only and only a small piece you give the rabbit a litter box and when it does its business outside the box you put the poo inside the box and put the bunny in the box so he gets the message that this is where he is to go if you feed you rabbit the diet i noted
