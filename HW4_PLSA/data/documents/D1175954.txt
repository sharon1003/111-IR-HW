features november 2003the most wanted works of art by kelly devine thomas posted 110103 1200 am if a piece is “truly truly to die for” and is still in private hands it is no doubt on someone else’s wish list like that 100 million cézanne steve wynn is approached on a regular basis about works he owns such as his tahitian gauguin bathers 1902 he reportedly paid close to 35 million for it the museum of modern art has one so does los angeles collector eli broad they can be predictable or idiosyncratic practical or fantastical but most wish lists are very very private “that’s really personal stuff” a top new york collector chuckled when asked to name his most wanted artworks still in private hands yearning—the more discreet the better—makes the art world go ’round dealers and auction specialists at the top of their game know where the most wanted artworks are at any given moment and what price might wrest a coveted object from its owner museum curators keep track of the same information to court loans and gifts collectors meanwhile no matter how desired the works in their own collections always have an eye on something else“we all have our wish lists but we don’t go around talking about them it gets in the way of our getting the work” says miami art collector donald rubell “we hope that when our friends die their children won’t like their art those are our silent wishes”jackson pollock’s lucifer a prime 1947 drip painting owned by the anderson collection in san francisco is so coveted it could fetch 50 million or more sources say were it ever to come on the market don’t hold your breath entertainment mogul david geffen who owns pollock’s coveted number 5 1948 offered the andersons 50 million for lucifer in the mid1990s according to sources and was rejected shipping magnate george embiricos owns cézanne’s the cardplayers 1892–93 the only work in the series in private hands which experts say could be worth as much as 100 million canadian publisher kenneth thomson and his son david recently paid 76 million for rubens’s recently discovered the massacre of the innocents ca 1609–11 at sotheby’s against competition from the j paul getty museum in los angeles yet rembrandt’s 1654 portrait jan six owned by the six family foundation in amsterdam says new york dealer otto naumann is possibly the most wanted old master painting in private hands “it is a killer” says naumann “it is worth in excess of 150 million easily”the whereabouts of the most expensive painting ever sold at auction—van gogh’s portrait of dr gachet 1890 which sold for 825 million at christie’s in 1990 and 90 million seven years later in a private sale through sotheby’s—remain a mystery but to a select few they’re not talking but hotelcasino mogul steve wynn for one would rather acquire van gogh’s portrait of patience escalier 1888 or the artist’s selfportrait with bandaged ear and pipe 1889 both of which are owned by the niarchos family heirs of the late greek shipping tycoon stavros niarchos “those are the two pictures i’d want before dr gachet ” wynn told artnews “ dr gachet is known primarily because of the amount of money that was spent on it”san francisco collector john a pritzker owns the most expensive photograph known to have been sold man ray’s glass tears 1932–33 for which he paid a reported 13 million four years ago today peter mac gill president of new york’s pacemac gill gallery who sold the vintage print to pritzker says the photograph’s value has increased substantially “there are some man rays that are worth a couple million dollars” says mac gill when asked which images would command such a sum he replied “now you’re putting me in a tough spot i’m trying to get one”fans of damien hirst would love to get their hands on the artist’s the physical impossibility of death in the mind of someone living 1991—a 14foot tiger shark floating in formaldehyde that is owned by charles saatchi and could be worth several million today sources say saatchi reportedly paid around 75000 for it and the popularity of thomas cole’s iconic the falls of kaaterskill 1826 continues to astound its owner paper manufacturing tycoon jack warner of tuscaloosa alabama who says “you know it’s been to the vatican” it was shown in “a mirror of creation 150 years of american nature painting” at the vatican museums in 1980 specific works land on wish lists because of what collectors do or more often don’t already own some collectors are haunted by not having acted quickly enough in the past and fear they will be priced out of the market for an artist or body of work others are moved by a new or renewed appreciation of a particular period in an artist’s career or by a desire to reunite works in a series that was not kept together sometimes the pursuit simply comes down to ego“it is a matter of being persistent and finding these works and going for them” says simon de pury chairman of phillips de pury  luxembourg who adds “people who go after these things do not want to point them out and do not want them pointed out”when major works in private collections become available astounding sums are paid “iconic paintings by key artists are what this market seems to want” says new york dealer michael findlay “there are certain artworks that are hot eternally—a tahitian gauguin monet’s “water lilies”—iconic things that collectors talk about generically rather than specifically”wynn says he is approached on a regular basis about works he owns such as his tahitian gauguin bathers 1902 for which he reportedly paid close to 35 million and van gogh’s peasant woman against a background of wheat 1890 for which he paid 475 million“we all know what the other guy’s got” says wynn of major collectors willing to spend tens of millions of dollars on a work of art “approaches at this level are very serious it is usually direct and done very casually we talk back and forth ‘if you are ever going to sell that picture don’t call anyone call me’”it took wynn several years to acquire picasso’s le rêve 1932 a portrait of mariethérèse walter the artist’s mistress after losing it to collector wolfgang flöttl who paid 484 million for it at christie’s in 1997 three years ago wynn paid close to 60 million to acquire it from flöttl according to sources and bring it to las vegas where he plans to install it in his 2 billion wynn las vegas hotel slated to open in 2005 wynn declined to comment on the price he paid for the work or the identity of the seller seattle collectors mary and jon shirley own the most expensive sculpture known to have been sold the couple paid more than 30 million several years ago to acquire constantin brancusi’s bronze bird in space 1926 from collector hester diamond in a private sale arranged through new york dealer vivian horan last year brancusi’s danaïde ca 1913 doubled expectations to sell for 182 million—a record for any sculpture sold at auction—to an anonymous buyer at christie’s“if you have a stellar aplus museum work the feeling in the market is that these works keep making more than anyone would have thought” says david norman cochairman of sotheby’s impressionist and modern department worldwide “whenever someone goes out on a limb and pays an unprecedented price for an outstanding work the market always seems to catch up and exceed it”for example ronald lauder chairman of new york’s museum of modern art paid close to 50 million in 1997 for cézanne’s still life flowered curtain and fruit 1904–6 in a private deal arranged through paris dealer daniel malingue who was representing an unidentified seller two years later sotheby’s sold cézanne’s still life with curtain pitcher and bowl of fruit 1893–94 for a record 605 million wynn who bid on the painting at auction privately acquired the work several months later for an undisclosed price in recent years demand has increased dramatically for postwar american artists such as jasper johns robert rauschenberg cy twombly clyfford still willem de kooning and roy lichtenstein leonard lauder chairman of the whitney museum of american art paid 26 million three years ago for johns’s 09 1961 through new york dealer arne glimcher acting on behalf of an anonymous seller he then donated the painting along with a trove of other works to the museum“art of the 1950s ’60s and ’70s has passed the test of time” says los angeles collector eli broad “collectors are more comfortable buying those artists now than when they first emerged because people didn’t know then how the work would be viewed historically”broad is looking to add a 1961 twombly he already owns six works by the artist and an early johns from the 1950s he has ten from other periods to his collection broad who says he would also like to acquire a ron mueck and a great hirst recently approached saatchi through a dealer about the possibility of acquiring some works from saatchi’s collection “we are not close to doing it” broad told artnews in september “some works he is willing to part with some he is not it always comes down to price”geffen has the largest private holdings of works by pollock johns and de kooning including de kooning’s woman iii 1952–53 and interchange 1955 he owns one of the best johns works in private hands target with plaster cast 1955 a collage with plaster casts of body parts in compartments worth tens of millions today says san francisco dealer richard polsky alfred h barr jr founding director of new york’s museum of modern art famously passed on acquiring the work for 1500 because it includes a compartment containing a green cast of a penis geffen also owns johns’s false start 1959 which he bought from publisher s i newhouse jr along with a group of other works in the early 1990s newhouse had paid a breathtaking 17 million for the work in 1988 “ninetyeight percent of geffen’s collection should be in a museum” says david ross former director of the san francisco museum of modern art and the whitney “museums salivate over the collection”another most wanted johns work diver 1962 is owned by miami collector norman braman who paid 418 million for it in 1988 “today it’s worth vastly more” says amy cappellazzo codirector of postwar and contemporary art at christie’s new york collector agnes gund president emerita of the modern who owns twombly’s 1961 untitled rome regrets not acquiring one of twombly’s “blackboard” paintings from the late 1960s when she had a chance ten years ago “now they are much too much” says gund of the works that can command nearly eightfigure sums arshile gorky is another favorite “i’ve always coveted gorky” says gund who owns his painting housatonic falls 1943–44 other important gorkys in private hands include to project to conjure 1944 owned by new york collector stephen swid and scent of apricots on the fields 1944 which newhouse acquired in recent years according to sources from collector thomas lee who paid 39 million for it at sotheby’s in 1995 geffen who owns gorky’s charred beloved i 1946 has tried to lure the artist’s the plow and the song 1947 and mark rothko’s white band no 27 1954 away from collector anne marion according to sources but she won’t sell them “they are two of the most beautiful paintings i have” says marion early 1990s works by brice marden such as his “cold mountain” series 1988–91 are also sought after and hard to come by several people according to sources have recently tried to pry marden’s the muses 1991–93 an 8 to 10 million picture away from the daros foundation in zurich a great blackandwhite gerhard richter from the 1960s could bring a similar sum says gerard goodrow director of art cologne and former head of postwar and contemporary art at christie’s in london los angeles collector beth swofford longs to own john currin’s painting pat 1996 which is owned by a friend and maurizio cattelan’s bidibidobidiboo 1996 an installation of a stuffed squirrel bent over a yellow kitchen table after having apparently committed suicide a work she first saw at the 1999 tate exhibition “abracadabra” “both pieces were the first i had seen by these artists” notes swofford “they made me fall in love with their work in general”swofford has since acquired currin’s painting the producer 2002 as well as cattelan’s charlie 2003 a freewheeling mechanical boy on a tricycle that debuted at this year’s venice biennale and a small version of the artist’s 1999 la nona ora ninth hour which depicts the pope struck by a meteor miami realestate

1925 which was owned by the model’s descendants “it was a picture we had been negotiating to acquire since we first learned about its existence three years ago” says mattis another most wanted photograph the reading establishment 1846 by william henry fox talbot an “astonishing document from the dawn of photography” says mattis works by japanese artist takashi murakami are also in great demand according to cappellazzo chicago collector stefan edlis paid a record 567500 for murakami’s 1996 miss ko2 squared a lifesize fiberglass cartoon figure at christie’s last may christie’s owner

1999 he is the only collector to own both hiropon 1997 and my lonesome cowboy 1998 largerthanlife oversexed brother and sister superhero sculptures that were made in an edition of three“i’ve always been interested in societies undergoing dramatic change” says logan “murakami’s work is about japanese identity which is consistent with the postwar period in japan” as for what remains on logan’s wish list—a jeff koons painting from the artist’s “celebration” series rubell says that the museum of contemporary art in chicago wants his charles ray oh charley charley charley… 1992 lifesize figures of the artist sexually cavorting with himself “but they want me to give it to them” says rubell says a museum spokesperson “we would love to have it”rubell would like to own jeff koons’s rabbit 1986 he says if it weren’t for the 5 million it would likely cost him what he would “truly truly die for” says rubell would be to acquire all of the paintings in luc tuymans’s “diagnostic view” series 1992 which are now in separate collections “what we most want in life we often can’t have my mother taught me that when i was young” says rubell “but we should all dream it’s very healthy”such aspirations can lead to tantalizing offers “a collector who has no intention of selling can be quite flattered by the kind of prices he can get for a work” says de pury “the magnitude of an offer can be quite tempting” or as old master dealer otto naumann says “you cannot make a painting for sale unless you want to grossly overpay for it”a collector with his heart set on obtaining an early de kooning recently offered seattle collector jane lang davis 8 million for her town square 1948 a small blackandwhite painting “i couldn’t believe it” says davis who paid 90000 for the work in 1976 “it shows you how hard it is to get these works at this point” asked if she accepted the offer davis laughs “no where would i get another one”for many years davis says new york dealer larry gagosian tried to persuade her to sell her large 1963 rothko for which she paid 75000 in 1972 gagosian’s last offer was 5 million davis says and that was a few years ago before the artist’s 1958 no 9 white and black

duchamp work in private hands is the artist’s original l h o o q 1919 a postcardsize reproduction of the mona lisa defaced by duchamp with a mustache and goatee some years ago naumann says he approached the owner who was living in paris at the time and whom naumann declined to identify to ask if he might consider selling it “he asked if i knew the highest price ever paid for a work of art” naumann recalls “i said i thought it was around 65 million having forgotten about the van gogh he said ‘okay bring me a collector willing to pay 66 million dollars and we’ll talk’”gund was recently offered 30 million for her 1956 de kooning the time of the fire one in a series of abstract paintings of urban subjects the artist created from 1955 to 1956 another work in the series police gazette 1955 has been acquired by geffen from wynn who paid 119 million for it in 1998 gund declined to sell her de kooning explaining “it’s a museum picture i think the modern will probably get it in honor

degas pastels and a renoir portrait at sotheby’s for 16 million in order to acquire degas’s masterpiece duchessa di montejasi with her daughters elena and camilla 1876 one of the last great family portraits by the artist other factors aside from finances can also come into play it took michigan collector gilbert silverman more than a decade to track down a work that he first saw hanging from the ceiling at the paula cooper gallery in new york a dozen or so years ago“i thought ‘boy that would be a neat thing to get’” recalls silverman when a dealer recently called silverman to tell him she had found the unique work he’d been looking for silverman replied “well that’s half the battle”silverman still had to convince his wife to allow him to acquire the work a bronze double dildo by lynda benglis he won’t say what he paid for it “initially she said ‘forget it’ she didn’t want it hanging in the office” says silverman “but we have separate bathrooms and she said i could hang it in
