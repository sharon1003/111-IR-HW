human guinea pig humiliating myself for fun and profit may 7 2007 517 pmive got the secret what happened when i followed the bestselling books advice for two months by emily yoffe listen to the mp3 audio version of this story here or sign up for slates free daily podcast on i tunes decades before the best seller was published my father knew the secret of the secret he was aware there were people with esoteric knowledge who controlled all the wealth had all the power and were specifically excluding him from getting any he bought the books of his time that promised like the secret to unlock these mysteries i loved listening to him spin his theories about how things really worked—until either i got too old to believe him anymore or his spinning took him further and further away from reality he died with nothing living under an assumed name so i will acknowledge that i came to the secret with a negative attitude when i bought it i quickly stuffed it into a plastic bag glancing around barnes  noble to make sure i saw no one i knew the last time i was this embarrassed at a bookstore was when i bought the g spot another best seller that provided instructions for achieving bliss for the human guinea pig column i usually do things that readers are too embarrassed or too intelligent to do themselves—like entering a beauty pageant or entertaining at a kids birthday party i wanted to see if applying the rules of the secret to my life would bring me the perfect happiness that it promises but millions of you have already beaten me to this one there are now 53 million copies of the book in print in the united states and publisher simon  schuster says it is selling about 150000 a week a separate dvd version has sold at least 15 million copies groups have formed to discuss how to best live by the secrets rules it is a no 1 best seller in australia england and ireland and it is scheduled to be translated into 30 languages emily yoffe emily yoffe is a contributing editor at the atlantic advertisement theres no secret to the secret the book and movie simply state that your thoughts control the universe through this law of attraction you manifest your desires it is exactly like placing an order from a catalogue … you must know that what you want is yours the moment you ask see yourself living in abundance and you will attract it it works every time with every person the appeal is obvious forget education effort performance everything you want—money power comfortable shoes—is yours simply by wanting it enough there are certain caveats apparently the universe has a languageprocessing disorder and doesnt comprehend standard english usage of the words dont not and no  so as the book explains if you summon the universe by saying i dont want to spill something on this outfit the universe translates this as i want to spill something on this outfit if only rhonda byrne the television producer who is the author of the book and creator of the dvd had been there to counsel those negative authors of the ten commandmentsbyrne says shakespeare newton lincoln and einstein all owed their achievements to their understanding of the law of attraction she asserts that the discoveries of quantum physics … are in total harmony with the teachings of the secret  to prove this she explains i never studied science or physics at school and yet when i read complex books on quantum physics i understood them perfectly because i wanted to understand them pop quiz rhonda what is the energy of a single photon in e v from a light source with a wavelength of 400 nm the book is dotted with quotations from great men of history that supposedly back up the secrets assertions take this one from winston churchill you create your own universe as you go along something about this struck me as sounding not terribly churchillian i looked it up and it turned out churchill did write it but it was his mocking characterization of the metaphysical twits of his day given my skepticism how could i make myself believe in the secret enough to give it a fair test to quote one of the secrets avatars ralph waldo emerson a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds clearly the secret is drivel but why should that stop me from sincerely throwing myself into seeing if it worked i am already deeply susceptible to superstition and seeing signs—if i find a penny faceup only i pick it up knowing something good will happen to me as selfabsorbed as i already am i loved the permission the book gave to sink deeper into a jacuzzi of megalomania as the secret points out you are the master of the universe you are the heir to the kingdom you are the perfection of life just as id always suspectedadvertisement so i vowed to follow byrnes simple rules for abundance and see what happened the book encourages one to start big it is as easy to manifest one dollar as it is to manifest one million dollars but i thought starting with the milliondollar manifestation was like saying i love you on a first date i didnt want to scare the universe into not taking my calls i came up with three things i thought the universe would find reasonable a kitchen floor unclogged sinuses and a new desk at this point i should add that the secret is not only drivel—its pernicious drivel the obvious question that arises from its claim that its easy to get what you want is why do so many people get what they dont want as byrne writes imperfect thoughts are the cause of all humanitys ills including disease poverty and unhappiness yes according to the secret people dont just randomly end up being massacred for example they are in the wrong place because of their own lousy thinking cancer patients have long been victims of this school of belief but the secret takes it to a new and more repulsive level with its advice not just to blame people for their illness but to shun them lest you start being infected by their bummer thoughts too but look i needed a kitchen floor and if abandoning sick friends and loved ones was what was required—well who really enjoys those bedside visits anyway we recently renovated our house and everything went great except our kitchen floor remember being told in school that the holy roman empire was neither holy roman nor an empire my kitchen floor was supposed to be acidstained concrete and while it was a floor it turned out to be neither acidstained nor concrete instead it was made of some sort of epoxy with a surface that looked as if my dog had fallen into a mud pit and then come inside and rolled all over it i spent weeks attempting to find an easy inexpensive way to resurface it one concrete guy said if he came it to fix it id have to remove all my appliances and baseboards let him grind down the existing floor and pour a new surface and pay him 4000 to do it thankfully he decided the job was too small and troublesome to be worth it covering the floor with cork tiles would also require appliance removal and an outlay of about 3500 and so it went with every alternative so i followed the secrets recommendation and notified the universes call center that i wanted a quick economical pleasing and durable kitchen floor once i did that the next step was to enter such an intense state of visualization that it was as if my new floor already existed byrne writes a shortcut to manifesting your desires is to see what you want as absolute fact although normally people who see things that arent there are considered delusional i went with byrnes recommendation to act as if you have it already one day my husband called from work to check on various house issues and i said im so grateful that i finally got a beautiful kitchen floor advertisementare you on something he asked it turns out i was on a universal high because a few nights later i awoke at 3 am from a dream that had supplied the answer paint the floor to look like acidstained concrete the next morning i searched the internet and contacted every faux painter within a 50mile radius only one deanne lenehan cunningham agreed to come and take a look she had never done a floor and was concerned whether her products would adhere to the sealant now on my floor she said she would talk to the manufacturer see if was possible then give us an estimate when a week went by without a callback my husband suggested i phone her and that i also explore other alternatives just in case normally i tend toward the anxiously obsessive and i would have already been doing that instead i told him it wasnt necessary because we already had a perfect kitchen floor secret speak requires this odd futurepresent construction which my husband came to call sounding like a moron but as byrne so amply proves the universe loves people who sound like morons deanne finally got back to us said she could do it and that she would charge us 912 we now have a gorgeous glowing floor and i had to admit just sitting back and letting my desires manifest freed up a lot of time—and was much more relaxing than trying to take care of things myself with that success i moved on to my sinuses each spring pollen causes my nose to resemble a drip irrigation device i spend months spraying my nostrils and popping antihistamines why not put in a secret request to get rid of my allergies after all the fiftysomething byrne describes how it took her only three days of proper thinking to get rid of her reading glasses and restore her eyesight to that of a twentysomething so i shelved the drugs walked my dog breathed deep and expressed gratitude for my sensational sinuses this worked great for weeks through one of the most frigid springs on record and i was starting to think that maybe my father was right maybe people like byrne really knew how the world worked then the weather warmed up and the air was thick with pollen my eyes swelled my nose started pouring and i ended up with a sinus infection and a bag of medications from the otolaryngologist of course one could say the secret failed but look at it this way when i first started imagining myself dripfree the universe responded by sending a cold snap then because i became so blasé about my sinuses the universe decided to warm things up again surely there is a lesson here for al gore finally the desk i had spent months dragging myself around to furniture stores and cruising the internet for the desk which i can see quite clearly its sleek and made of steel lshaped with plenty of work space on top and storage below unfortunately no one who manufactures desks also sees it following the secrets precepts i stopped wasting my time looking for it and instead expressed my gratitude for its arrival ive now spent six weeks visualizing this desk to no effect perhaps the problem is signal interference from my husband who keeps suggesting i manifest the word ikea into my search engine and just order a damn desk or perhaps the problem is that millions of people are now putting in their orders and the universes servers have crashed or maybe its something else as one of byrnes favorites albert einstein said in a quote that doesnt make it into the secret  only two things are infinite the universe and human stupidity and im not sure about the former single page1 2 next
