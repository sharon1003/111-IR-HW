lp lpeabbles asked on january 21 2015q cant open multiple word documents i have a user who occasionally cant open a word document if he already has one open if he has a word document open and tries to open another existing document he will get a second word window but it will be blank not a blank document but just a blank instance of word this is very inconsistent it doesnt happen all the time and doesnt even happen consistently with the same documents sometimes a document will open fine if something else is open sometimes it wont its also inconsistent in terms of where the documents come from hes had it happen while opening documents from the shared drive from an email or even from the internet if this happens to him and again this happens only occasionally and inconsistently he can close out of word completely and try again and it almost always works the next time as you can see its a tough one because it cant be replicated and its somewhat vague if anyone has any troubleshooting tips please pass them along thank youleah reply i have the same question 33
