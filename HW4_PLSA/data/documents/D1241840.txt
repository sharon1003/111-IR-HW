this information is intended for use by health professionals1 name of the medicinal product clopixol 200 mgml solution for injection clopixol conc 500 mgml solution for injection2 qualitative and quantitative composition clopixol injection zuclopenthixol decanoate 200 mgml clopixol conc injection zuclopenthixol decanoate 500 mgml for the full list of excipients see section 613 pharmaceutical form solution for injection clear yellowish oil practically free from particles4 clinical particulars41 therapeutic indications the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia and paranoid psychoses42 posology and method of administration posology adults dosage and dosage interval should be adjusted according to the patients symptoms and response to treatment the usual dosage range of zuclopenthixol decanoate is 200  500 mg every one to four weeks depending on response but some patients may require up to 600 mg per week the maximum single dose at any one time is 600 mg for example 1200 mg every 2 weeks should not be given in patients who have not previously received depot antipsychotics treatment is usually started with a small dose eg 100 mg to assess tolerance an interval of at least one week should be allowed before the second injection is given at a dose consistent with the patients condition adequate control of severe psychotic symptoms may take up to 4 to 6 months at high enough dosage once stabilised lower maintenance doses may be considered but must be sufficient to prevent relapse injection volumes of greater than 2 ml should be distributed between two injection sites older patients in accordance with standard medical practice initial dosage may need to be reduced to a quarter or half the normal starting dose in the frail or older patients paediatric population clopixol is not recommended for use in children due to lack of clinical experience patients with renal impairment clopixol can be given in usual doses to patients with reduced renal function where there is renal failure dosage should be reduced to half the normal dosage patients with hepatic impairment use with caution in patients with liver disease see section 44 patients with compromised hepatic function should receive half the recommended dosages serumlevel monitoring is advised method of administration by deep intramuscular injection into the upper outer buttock or lateral thigh note as with all oilbased injections it is important to ensure by aspiration before injection that inadvertent intravascular entry does not occur43 contraindications hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 61 circulatory collapse depressed level of consciousness due to any cause eg intoxication with alcohol barbiturates or opiates coma44 special warnings and precautions for use caution should be exercised in patients having liver disease cardiac disease or arrhythmias severe respiratory disease renal failure epilepsy and conditions predisposing to epilepsy eg alcohol withdrawal or brain damage parkinsons disease narrow angle glaucoma prostatic hypertrophy hypothyroidism hyperthyroidism myasthenia gravis phaeochromocytoma and patients who have shown hypersensitivity to thioxanthenes or other antipsychotics acute withdrawal symptoms including nausea vomiting sweating and insomnia have been described after abrupt cessation of antipsychotic drugs recurrence of psychotic symptoms may also occur and the emergence of involuntary movement disorders such as akathisia dystonia and dyskinesia has been reported the plasma concentrations of zuclopenthixol decanoate gradually decrease over several weeks which make gradual dosage tapering unnecessary when transferring patients from oral to depot antipsychotic treatment the oral medication should not be discontinued immediately but gradually withdrawn over a period of several days after administering the first injection the possibility of development of neuroleptic malignant syndrome hyperthermia muscle rigidity fluctuating consciousness instability of the autonomous nervous system exists with any neuroleptic the risk is possibly greater with the more potent agents patients with preexisting organic brain syndrome mental retardation and opiate and alcohol abuse are overrepresented among fatal cases treatment discontinuation of the neuroleptic symptomatic treatment and use of general supportive measures dantrolene and bromocriptine may be helpful symptoms may persist for more than a week after oral neuroleptics are discontinued and somewhat longer when associated with the depot forms of the drugs like other neuroleptics zuclopenthixol decanoate should be used with caution in patients with organic brain syndrome convulsions or advanced hepatic disease blood dyscrasias have been reported rarely blood counts should be carried out if a patient develops signs of persistent infection as with other drugs belonging to the therapeutic class of antipsychotics zuclopenthixol decanoate may cause qt prolongation persistently prolonged qt intervals may increase the risk of malignant arrhythmias therefore zuclopenthixol decanoate should be used with caution in susceptible individuals with hypokalaemia hypomagnesaemia or genetic predisposition and in patients with a history of cardiovascular disorders eg qt prolongation significant bradycardia 50 beats per minute a recent acute myocardial infarction uncompensated heart failure or cardiac arrhythmia cases of venous thromboembolism vte have been reported with antipsychotic drugs since patients treated with antipsychotics often present with acquired risk factors for vte all possible risk factors for vte should be identified before and during treatment with zuclopenthixol decanoate and preventive measures undertaken concomitant treatment with other antipsychotics should be avoided see section 45 as described for other psychotropics zuclopenthixol decanoate may modify insulin and glucose responses calling for adjustment of the antidiabetic therapy in diabetic patients leukopenia neutropenia and agranulocytosis have been reported with antipsychotics including zuclopenthixol decanoate longacting depot antipsychotics should be used with caution in combination with other medicines known to have a myelosuppressive potential as these cannot rapidly be removed from the body in conditions where this may be required older people older people require close supervision because they are especially prone to experience such adverse effects as sedation hypotension confusion and temperature changes cerebrovascular an approximately 3fold increased risk of cerebrovascular adverse events has been seen in randomised placebo controlled clinical trials in the dementia population with some atypical antipsychotics the mechanism for this increased risk is not known an increased risk cannot be excluded for other antipsychotics or other patient populations zuclopenthixol should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for stroke increased mortality in older people with dementia data from two large observational studies showed that older people with dementia who are treated with antipsychotics are at a small increased risk of death compared with those who are not treated there are insufficient data to give a firm estimate of the precise magnitude of the risk and the cause of the increased risk is not known clopixol conc injection and clopixol conc injection are not licensed for the treatment of dementiarelated behavioural disturbances45 interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction in common with other antipsychotics zuclopenthixol enhances the response to alcohol the effects of barbiturates and other cns depressants zuclopenthixol may potentiate the effects of general anaesthetics and anticoagulants and prolong the action of neuromuscular blocking agents the anticholinergic effects of atropine or other drugs with anticholinergic properties may be increased concomitant use of drugs such as metoclopramide piperazine or antiparkinson drugs may increase the risk of extrapyramidal effects such as tardive dyskinesia combined use of antipsychotics and lithium or sibutramine has been associated with an increased risk of neurotoxicity antipsychotics may enhance the cardiac depressant effects of quinidine the absorption of corticosteroids and digoxin the hypotensive effect of vasodilator antihypertensive agents such as hydralazine and α blockers eg doxazosin or methyldopa may be enhanced concomitant use of zuclopenthixol and drugs known to cause qt prolongation or cardiac arrhythmias such as tricyclic antidepressants or other antipsychotics should be avoided increases in the qt interval related to antipsychotic treatment may be exacerbated by the co administration of other drugs known to significantly increase the qt interval coadministration of such drugs should be avoided relevant classes include• class ia and iii antiarrhythmics eg quinidine amiodarone sotalol dofetilide• some antipsychotics eg thioridazine• some macrolides eg erythromycin• some antihistamines• some quinolone antibiotics eg moxifloxacinthe above list is not exhaustive and other individual drugs known to significantly increase qt interval eg cisapride lithium should be avoided drugs known to cause electrolyte disturbances such as thiazide diuretics hypokalemia and drugs known to increase the plasma concentration of zuclopenthixol should also be used with caution as they may increase the risk of qt prolongation and malignant arrhythmias see section 44 antipsychotics may antagonise the effects of adrenaline and other sympathomimetic agents and reverse the antihypertensive effects of guanethidine and similar adrenergicblocking agents antipsychotics may also impair the effect of levodopa adrenergic drugs and anticonvulsants the metabolism of tricyclic antidepressants may be inhibited and the control of diabetes may be impaired since zuclopenthixol is partly metabolised by cyp2d6 concomitant use of drugs known to inhibit this enzyme may lead to higher than expected plasma concentrations of zuclopenthixol increasing the risk of adverse effects and cardiotoxicity46 fertility pregnancy and lactation pregnancy zuclopenthixol decanoate should not be administered during pregnancy unless the expected benefit to the patient outweighs the theoretical risk to the foetus neonates exposed to antipsychotics including zuclopenthixol decanoate during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk of adverse reactions including extrapyramidal andor withdrawal symptoms that may vary in severity and duration following delivery there have been reports of agitation hypertonia hypotonia tremor somnolence respiratory distress or feeding disorder consequently newborns should be monitored carefully animal studies have shown reproduction toxicity see section 53 breastfeeding as zuclopenthixol is found in breast milk in low concentrations it is not likely to affect the infant when therapeutic doses are used the dose ingested by the infant is less than 1 of the weight related maternal dose in mgkg breastfeeding can be continued during zuclopenthixol decanoate therapy if considered of clinical importance but observation of the infant is recommended particularly in the first 4 weeks after giving birth fertility in humans adverse events such as hyperprolactinaemia galactorrhoea amenorrhoea erectile dysfunction and ejaculation failure have been reported see section 48 these events may have a negative impact on female andor male sexual function and fertility if clinical significant hyperprolactinaemia galactorrhoea amenorrhoea or sexual dysfunctions occur a dose reduction if possible or discontinuation should be considered the effects are reversible on discontinuation administration of zuclopenthixol to male and female rats was associated with a slight delay in mating in an experiment where zuclopenthixol was administered via the diet impaired mating performance and reduced conception rate were noted47 effects on ability to drive and use machines zuclopenthixol is a sedative drug alertness may be impaired especially at the start of treatment or following the consumption of alcohol patients should be warned of this risk and advised not to drive or operate machinery until their susceptibility is known patients should not drive if they have blurred vision48 undesirable effects the majority of undesirable effects are dose dependent the frequency and severity are most pronounced in the early phase of treatment and decline during continued treatment extrapyramidal reactions may occur especially in the early phase of treatment in most cases these side effects can be satisfactorily controlled by reduction of dosage andor use of antiparkinsonian drugs the routine prophylactic use of antiparkinsonian drugs is not recommended antiparkinsonian drugs do not alleviate tardive dyskinsea and may aggravate them reduction in dosage or if possible discontinuation of zuclopenthixol therapy is recommended in

vein thrombosis have been reported with antipsychotic drugs – frequency unknown abrupt discontinuation of zuclopenthixol may be accompanied by withdrawal symptoms the most common symptoms are nausea vomiting anorexia diarrhoea rhinorrhoea sweating myalgias paraesthesias insomnia restlessness anxiety and agitation patients may also experience vertigo alternate feelings of warmth and coldness and tremor symptoms generally begin within 1 to 4 days of withdrawal and abate within 7 to 14 days reporting of suspected adverse reactions reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the

pointes cardiac arrest and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported when administered in overdose together with drugs known to affect the heart treatment treatment is symptomatic and supportive measures aimed at supporting the respiratory and cardiovascular systems should be instituted adrenaline epinephrine must not be used in these patients there is no specific antidote5 pharmacological properties51 pharmacodynamic properties pharmacotherapeutic group neuropleptics antipsychotics atc code n05af05mechanism of action the action of zuclopenthixol as with other antipsychotics is mediated through dopamine receptor blockade zuclopenthixol has a high affinity for d 1 and d 2 receptors and activity has been demonstrated in standard animal models used to assess antipsychotic action serotonergic blocking properties a high affinity for alphaadrenoreceptors and slight antihistamine properties have been observed52 pharmacokinetic properties after deep intramuscular injection of clopixol serum levels of zuclopenthixol increase during the first week and decline slowly thereafter a linear relationship has been observed between clopixol dosage and serum level metabolism proceeds by sulphoxidation dealkylation and glucuronic acid conjugation sulphoxide metabolites are mainly excreted in the urine while unchanged drug and the dealkylated form tend to be excreted in the faeces53 preclinical safety data reproductive toxicity impaired mating performance and reduced conception rates were observed in rats treated with zuclopenthixol at doses equal to the maximum recommend human dose of 50 mg on a mgm 2 basis there was no evidence of embryotoxicity or teratogenic effects in rats treated with zuclopenthixol however adverse effects on preand postnatal development ie increased stillbirths reduced pup survival and delayed development of pups was observed the clinical significance of these findings is unclear and it is possible that the effect on pups was due to neglect from the dams that were exposed to doses of zuclopenthixol producing maternal toxicity6 pharmaceutical particulars61 list of excipients thin vegetable oil62 incompatibilities this product may be mixed in
