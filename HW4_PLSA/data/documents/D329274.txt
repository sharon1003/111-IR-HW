understanding the three primary goals of social media august 27 2015  3 comments  in social media  by jennifer cario five years later this article is still one of jen’s most popular observations driving tons of search traffic each week we thought we’d revisit it with an update a new intro and a bit of relevant perspective enjoy it seems a little funny to think that five years ago i was writing about the need for businesses to recognize that their social media investment needs to be about more than the teenage “everyone else is doing it” mentality why is it funny mostly because all these years later we still have that conversation with prospective clients on a regular basis despite the ongoing need for that conversation the truth is we’ve come a long way in five years we’re starting to understand more about how to value social media efforts as well as how to properly measure them we’ve seen the introduction of new metrics like amplification applause and conversation that now exist alongside more easily understood metrics like economic value how does your brand hold up with these new metrics give us a call today to help conduct a social media audit with metrics to hold us accountable it’s becoming easier to not just build but to measure adjust and recognize the success or failure of a particular campaign still in order to build a measurable plan you have to have an idea of the types of things you can accomplish in the realm of social media so whether you’re coming at things from the marketing side or the prcommunications side whether you’re part of customer service or product development or whether you’re just a tiny little business looking for exposure you can’t get anywhere without an idea of what’s possible that’s why it’s essential to understand the
