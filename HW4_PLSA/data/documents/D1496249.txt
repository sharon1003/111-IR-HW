what is this verifythalidomide sold under the brand name immunoprin among others is an immunomodulatory drug and the prototype of the thalidomide class of drugs today thalidomide is used mainly as a treatment of certain cancers  multiple myeloma and of a complication of leprosy thalidomide was first marketed in 1957 in west germany under the tradename contergan the german drug company chemie grünenthal developed and sold the drug primarily prescribed as a sedative or hypnotic thalidomide also claimed to cure  anxiety insomnia gastritis and tension 3 afterwards it was used against nausea and to alleviate morning sickness in pregnant women thalidomide became an overthecounter drug in west germany on october 1 1957 shortly after the drug was sold in west germany between 5000 and 7000 infants were born with phocomelia malformation of the limbs only 40 of these children survived 4 throughout the world about 10000 cases were reported of infants with phocomelia due to thalidomide only 50 of the 10000 survived those subjected to thalidomide while in the womb experienced limb deficiencies in a way that the long limbs either were not developed or presented themselves as stumps other effects included deformed eyes and hearts deformed alimentary and urinary tracts blindness and deafness 5 the negative effects of thalidomide led to the development of more structured drug regulations

further reading12 external links medical uses  editpack of thalidomide capsules thalidomide is used as a firstline treatment in multiple myeloma in combination with dexamethasone or with melphalan and prednisone to treat acute episodes of erythema nodosum leprosum and for maintenance therapy 7 8thalidomide is used offlabel in several ways the bacterium that causes tuberculosis is related to leprosy thalidomide may be helpful in some cases where standard tb drugs and corticosteroids are not sufficient to resolve severe inflammation in the brain 9 10it is used as a secondline treatment to manage graft versus host disease and aphthous stomatitis in children and has been prescribed for other conditions in children including actinic prurigo and epidermolysis bullosa the evidence for these uses is weak 11 it is recommended only as a third line treatment in graft versus host disease in adults based on lack of efficacy and side effects observed in clinical trials 12 13contraindications  editthalidomide should not be used by people who are breast feeding or pregnant trying to conceive a child or cannot or will not follow the risk management program to prevent pregnancies the prescribing doctor is required to ensure that contraception is being used and regular pregnancy tests must be administered some people are allergic to thalidomide and should not take it it should be used with caution in people with chronic infections like hiv or hepatitis b 8 7adverse effects  editsee also list of thalidomide side effects thalidomide causes birth defects 8 7 14 the fda and other regulatory agencies have approved marketing of the drug only with an auditable risk evaluation and mitigation strategy that ensures that people using the drug are aware of the risks and avoid pregnancy this applies to men and women both as the drug can be transmitted in sperm 14there is a high risk that thalidomide can cause excessive blood clots there is also a high risk that thalidomide can interfere with formation of various kinds of new blood cells creating a risk of infection via neutropenia leukopenia and lymphopenia and risks that blood will not clot via thrombocytopenia there is also a risk of anemia via lack of red blood cells the drug can also damage nerves causing peripheral neuropathy that may be irreversible 8 7thalidomide has several cardiovascular adverse effects including risk of heart attacks pulmonary hypertension and changes in heart rhythm including syncope bradycardia and atrioventricular block 8 7it can cause liver damage and severe skin reactions like stevensjohnson syndrome it tends to make people sleepy which creates risk for driving and operating other machinery as it kills cancer cells it can cause tumor lysis syndrome thalidomide can prevent menstruation 8 7other than the above very common reported in more than 10 of people adverse effects include tremor dizziness tingling numbness constipation and peripheral edema 8 7common reported by 110 of people adverse effects include confusion depressed mood reduced coordination heart failure difficulty breathing interstitial lung disease lung inflammation vomiting dry mouth rashes dry skin fever weakness and a sense of unwellness 8 7interactions  editthere are no expected pharmacokinetic interactions between thalidomide and other medicines due to its neutral effects on pglycoprotein and p450 cytochromes it may interact with sedatives due to its sedative action it may also interact with bradycardic agents due to its bradycardiainducing effects the risk of peripheral neuropathy may be increased by concomitant treatment with other agents known to cause peripheral neuropathy 15 the risk of venous thromboembolisms with thalidomide seems to be increased when patients are treated with oral contraceptives or other cytotoxic agents including doxorubicin and melphalan concurrently thalidomide may interfere with the contraceptive effects of various contraceptives and hence it is advised that women of reproductive age use at least two different means of contraception to ensure that no child will be conceived while they are receiving thalidomide 15 8 7overdose  editas of 2013 eighteen cases of overdoses had been reported with doses of up to 144 g without any reported fatalities 15 no specific antidote for overdoses exists and treatment is purely supportive 15pharmacology  editthe precise mechanism of action for thalidomide is unknown although efforts to identify thalidomides teratogenic action generated 2000 research papers and the proposal of 15 or 16 plausible mechanisms by 2000 16 as of 2015 the main theories were inhibition of the process of angiogenesis its inhibition of cereblon a ubiquitin ligase and its ability to generate reactive oxygen species which in turn kill cells 17 18thalidomide also binds to and acts as an antagonist of the androgen receptor ar and hence is a nonsteroidal antiandrogen nsaa of some capacity 19 in accordance it can produce gynecomastia and sexual dysfunction as side effects in men 20thalidomide is provided as a racemic mixture of two enantiomers while there are reports that only one of the enantiomers may cause birth defects the body converts each enantiomer into the other through mechanisms that are not well understood 14chemistry  editthe two enantiomers of thalidomide left  s  −thalidomide right  r  thalidomide thalidomide is racemic while the sthalidomide is the bioactive form of the molecule the individual enantiomers can racemize to each other due to the acidic hydrogen at the chiral centre which is the carbon of the glutarimide ring bonded to the phthalimide substituent the racemization process can occur in vivo 2 21 22 23celgene corporation originally synthesized thalidomide using a threestep sequence starting with lglutamic acid treatment but this has since been reformed by the use of lglutamine 24 as shown in the image below ncarbethoxyphtalimide 1 can react with lglutamine to yield nphthaloyllglutamine 2 cyclization of nphthaloyllglutamine occurs using carbonyldiimidazole which then yields thalidomide 3 24 celegne corporations original method resulted in a 31 yield of sthalidomide whereas the twostep synthesis yields 8593 product that is 99 pure muller et al s twostep thalidomide synthesis history  editthalidomide was discovered by scientists at the german pharmaceutical company chemie grünenthal now grünenthal gmb h around 1953 the company had been set up as a soap maker just after wwii ended to address the urgent market need for antibiotics heinrich mueckter was appointed to head the discovery program based on his experience working with the german armys antiviral research program in the course of preparing reagents for the work mueckters assistant wilhelm kunz isolated a byproduct that was in turn recognized by pharmacologist herbert keller as an analog of glutethimide a sedative and the medicinal chemistry work turned to improving the lead compound into a suitable drug the result was thalidomide the toxicity was examined in several animals and the drug was introduced in 1956 as a sedative 25researchers at chemie grünenthal also found that thalidomide was a particularly effective antiemetic that had an inhibitory effect on morning sickness 26 hence on october 1 1957 the company launched thalidomide and began aggressively marketing it under the trade name contergan 27  better source needed it was proclaimed a wonder drug for insomnia coughs colds and headaches  citation neededduring this time period the use of medications during pregnancy was not strictly controlled and drugs were not thoroughly tested for potential harm to the fetus 26 thousands of pregnant women took the drug to relieve their symptoms at the time of the drugs development scientists did not believe any drug taken by a pregnant woman could pass across the placental barrier and harm the developing fetus 6 even though the effect of alcohol on fetal development had been documented by case studies on alcoholic mothers since at least 1957 28 there soon appeared reports of findings of abnormalities in children being born traced back to the use of the drug thalidomide in late 1959 it was noticed that peripheral neuritis developed in patients who took the drug over a period of time and it was only after this point that thalidomide ceased to be provided over the counter 29hence while initially considered safe the drug was responsible for teratogenic deformities in children born after their mothers used it during pregnancies prior to the third trimester in november 1961 thalidomide was taken off the market due to massive pressure from the press and public 30 experts estimate that the drug thalidomide led to the death of approximately 2000 children and serious birth defects in more than 10000 children about 5000 of them in west germany  citation needed the regulatory authorities in east germany did not approve thalidomide 4  dead link one reason for the initially unobserved side effects of the drug and the subsequent approval in west germany was that at that time drugs did not have to be tested for teratogenic effects they had been tested on rodents only as was usual at the time 31in the uk the british pharmaceutical company the distillers company biochemicals ltd a subsidiary of distillers co ltd now part of diageo plc  marketed thalidomide under the brand name distaval as a remedy for morning sickness throughout the united kingdom australia and new zealand their advertisement claimed that distaval can be given with complete safety to pregnant women and nursing mothers without adverse effect on mother or child outstandingly safe distaval has been prescribed for nearly three years in this country 4  dead link around the world more and more pharmaceutical companies started to produce and market the drug under license from chemie grünenthal by the mid 1950s 14 pharmaceutical companies were marketing thalidomide in 46 countries under 37 some reports suggest 51 different trade names in the u s representatives from chemie grünenthal approached smith kline  french skf now glaxo smith kline gsk with a request to market and distribute the drug in north america a memorandum rediscovered in 2010 in the archives of the u s food and drug administration fda shows that as part of its inlicensing approach smith kline and french conducted animal tests and ran a clinical trial of the drug in the united states involving 875 people including pregnant women in 1956–57  citation needed in 1956 researchers at skf involved in clinical trials noted that even when used in very high doses thalidomide could not induce sleep in mice  citation needed and when administered at doses 50 to 650 times larger than that claimed by chemie grünenthal to be sleep inducing the researchers could still not achieve the hypnotic effect in animals that it had on humans  citation needed after completion of the trial and based on reasons kept hidden for decades skf declined to commercialize the drug later chemie grünenthal in 1958 reached an agreement with william s merrell company in cincinnati ohio  later richardsonmerrell now part of sanofi  to market and distribute thalidomide throughout the united states 4  dead linkthe u s fda refused to approve thalidomide for marketing and distribution however the drug was distributed in large quantities for testing purposes after the american distributor and manufacturer richardsonmerrell had applied for its approval in september 1960  citation needed the official in charge of the fda review frances oldham kelsey did not rely on information from the company which did not include any test results richardsonmerrell was called on to perform tests and report the results the company demanded approval six times and was refused each time nevertheless a total of 17 children with thalidomideinduced malformations were born in the u s 32in canada the history of the drug thalidomide dates back to april 1 1961 there were many different forms sold with the most common variant being talimol 33 two months after talimol went on sale pharmaceutical companies sent physicians letters warning about the risk of birth defects 33 it was not until march 2 1962 that both drugs were banned from the canadian market by the fdd and soon afterward physicians were warned to destroy their supplies 33leprosy treatment  editin 1964 israeli physician jacob sheskin administered thalidomide to a patient critically ill with leprosy the patient exhibited erythema nodosum leprosum enl a painful skin condition one of the complications of leprosy this was attempted despite the ban on thalidomides use but results were favourable the patient slept for hours and was able to get out of bed without aid upon awakening a clinical trial studying the use of thalidomide in leprosy soon followed 34thalidomide has been used by brazilian physicians as the drug of choice for the treatment of severe enl since 1965 and by 1996 at least 33 cases of thalidomide embryopathy were recorded in people born in brazil after 1965 35 since 1994 the production dispensing and prescription of thalidomide have been strictly controlled requiring women to use two forms of birth control and submit to regular pregnancy tests despite this cases of thalidomide embryopathy continue 36 37 with at least 100 cases identified in brazil between 2005 and 2010 38 58 million thalidomide pills were distributed throughout brazil in this time period largely to poor brazilians in areas with poor access to healthcare and these cases have occurred despite the controls in 1998 the fda approved the drugs use in the treatment of enl 39 because of thalidomides potential for causing birth defects the drug may be distributed only under tightly controlled conditions the fda required that celgene corporation which planned to market thalidomide under the brand name thalomid establish a system for thalidomide education and prescribing safety steps oversight program the conditions required under the program include limiting prescription and dispensing rights to authorized prescribers and pharmacies only keeping a registry of all patients prescribed thalidomide providing extensive patient education about the risks associated with the drug and providing periodic pregnancy tests for women who take the drug 39in 2010 the world health organisation who stated that it did not recommend thalidomide due the difficulty of adequately controlling its use and due to the availability of clofazimine 40cancer treatment  editshortly after the teratogenic properties of thalidomide were recognized in the mid1960s its anticancer potential was explored and two clinical trials were conducted in people with advanced cancer including some people with multiple myeloma the trials were inconclusive 41little further work was done with thalidomide in cancer until the 1990s 41judah folkman pioneered studies into the role of angiogenesis the proliferation and growth of blood vessels in the development of cancer and in the early 1970s had shown that solid tumors could not expand without it 42 43 in 1993 he surprised the scientific world by hypothesizing the same was true of blood cancers 44 and the next year he published work showing that a biomarker of angiogenesis was higher in all people with cancer but especially high in people with blood cancers and other evidence emerged as well 44 meanwhile a member of his lab robert damato was looking for angiogenesis inhibitors and discovered in 1994 that thalidomide inhibited angiogenesis 45 around that time the wife of a man who was dying of multiple myeloma and whom standard treatments had failed called folkman asking him about his antiangiogenesis ideas 43 folkman persuaded the patients doctor to try thalidomide and that doctor conducted a clinical trial of thalidomide for people with multiple myeloma in which about a third of the subjects responded to the treatment 43 the results of that trial were published in the new england journal of medicine in 1999 43 46after further work was done by celgene and others in 2006 the u s food and drug administration granted accelerated approval for thalidomide in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients 43 47society and culture  editbirth defects crisis  editbaby born to a mother who had taken thalidomide while pregnant in the late 1950s and early 1960s more than 10000 children in 46 countries were born with deformities such as phocomelia as a consequence of thalidomide use 48 the severity and location of the deformities depended on how many days into the pregnancy the mother was before beginning treatment thalidomide taken on the 20th day of pregnancy caused central brain damage day 21 would damage the eyes day 22 the ears and face day 24 the arms and leg damage would occur if taken up to day 28 thalidomide did not damage the fetus if taken after 42 days gestation 30it is not known exactly how many worldwide victims of the drug there have been although estimates range from 10000 to 20000 49 to 100000 30 despite the side effects thalidomide was sold in pharmacies in canada until 1962 33 50these artificial limbs were made for an affected child in the 1960s by the department of health and social security s limb fitting centre in roehampton london in the united kingdom the drug was licensed in 1958 and withdrawn in 1961 of the approximately 2000 babies born with defects around half died within a few months and 466 survived to at least 2010 51in spain thalidomide was widely available throughout the 1970s perhaps even into the 1980s there were two reasons for this first state controls and safeguarding were poor indeed it was not until 2008 that the government even admitted the country had ever imported thalidomide second grünenthal failed to insist that its sister company in madrid warn spanish doctors and permitted it to not warn them the spanish advocacy group for victims of thalidomide estimates that in 2015 there were 250–300 living victims of thalidomide in spain 52the australian obstetrician william mc bride and the german paediatrician widukind lenz suspected a link between birth defects and the drug a theory lenz proved in 1961 53 54 mc bride was later awarded a number of honors including a medal and prize money by linstitut de la vie in paris 55 further animal tests were conducted by dr george somers chief pharmacologist of distillers company in britain which showed foetal abnormalities in rabbits 56 similar results were also published showing these effects in rats 57 58 and other species 59in east germany the head of the central pharmacy control commission friedrich jung suspected an antivitaminic effect of thalidomide as derivative of glutamic acid 60 meanwhile in west germany it took some time before the increase in dysmelia at the end of the 1950s was connected with thalidomide in 1958 karl beck a former pediatric doctor in bayreuth wrote an article in a local newspaper claiming a relationship between nuclear weapons testing and cases of dysmelia in children 61 based on this fdp whip erich mende requested an official statement from the federal government 61 for statistical reasons the main data series used to research dysmelia cases started by chance at the same time as the approval date for thalidomide 61 after the nazi regime with its law for the prevention of hereditarily diseased offspring used mandatory statistical monitoring to commit various crimes western germany had been very reluctant to monitor congenital disorders in a similarly strict way 62 the parliamentary report rejected any relation with radioactivity and the abnormal increase of dysmelia 61 also the dfg research project installed after the mende request was not helpful the project was led by pathologist franz büchner who ran the project to propagate his teratological theory büchner saw lack of healthy nutrition and behavior of the mothers as being more important than genetic reasons 62 furthermore it took a while to install a surgeon general in germany the federal ministry of health was not founded until 1962 some months after thalidomide was banned from the market 61 in germany approximately 2500 thalidomide babies were born 54several countries either restricted the drugs use or never approved it ingeborg eichler a member of the austrian pharmaceutical admission conference enforced thalidomide tradename softenon being sold under the rules of prescription medication and as a result relatively few affected children were born in austria and switzerland 63 in the united states pharmacologist frances oldham kelsey m d withstood pressure from the richardsonmerrell company and refused food and drug administration fda approval to market thalidomide saying further studies were needed 48 this reduced the impact of thalidomide in united states patients although thalidomide was never approved for sale in the united states at the time over 25 million tablets had been distributed to over 1000 physicians during a clinical testing program it is estimated that nearly 20000 patients several hundred of whom were pregnant women were given the drug to help alleviate morning sickness or as a sedative and at least 17 children were consequently born in america with thalidomideassociated deformities 64 65a woman named sherri finkbine publicized the serious problems of thalidomide 66 finkbine had been taking sleeping pills that contained this drug while she was pregnant as it was popular at the time she had later learned that thalidomide was causing fetal deformities she wanted to abort her pregnancy but the laws of arizona allowed abortion only if the mothers life was in danger finkbine traveled to sweden to have the abortion which was expensive for her thalidomide was found to have deformed the fetus 64aftermath of scandal  editthe numerous reports of malformations in babies brought about the awareness of the side effects of the drug on pregnant women the birth defects caused by the drug thalidomide can range from moderate malformation to more severe forms possible birth defects include phocomelia dysmelia amelia bone hypoplasticity and other congenital defects affecting the ear heart or internal organs 26 franks et al looked at how the drug affected newborn babies the severity of their deformities and reviewed the drug in its early years webb in 1963 also reviewed the history of the drug and the different forms of birth defects it had caused the most common form of birth defects from thalidomide is shortened limbs with the arms being more frequently affected this syndrome is the presence of deformities of the long bones of the limbs resulting in shortening and other abnormalities 33germany  editin 1968 a large criminal trial began in germany charging several grünenthal officials with negligent homicide and injury after grünenthal settled with the victims in april 1970 the trial ended in december 1970 with no finding of guilt as part of the settlement grünenthal paid 100 million dm into a special foundation the german government added 320 million dm the foundation paid victims a onetime sum of 250025000 dm depending on severity of disability and a monthly stipend of 100450 dm the monthly stipends have since been raised substantially and are now paid entirely by the government as the foundation had run out of money grünenthal paid another 50 million euros into the foundation in 2008 on 31 august 2012 grünenthal chief executive harald f stock who served as the chief executive officer of grünenthal gmb h from january 2009 to may 28 2013 and was also a member of executive board until may 28 2013 apologized for the first time for producing the drug and remaining silent about the birth defects 67 at a ceremony stock unveiled a statue of a disabled child to symbolize those harmed by thalidomide and apologized for not trying to reach out to victims for over 50 years at the time of the apology there were 5000 to 6000 sufferers still alive victim advocates called the apology insulting and too little too late and criticized the company for not compensating victims they also criticized the company for their claim that no one could have known the harm the drug caused arguing that there were plenty of red flags at the time 68united kingdom  editin 1968 after a long campaign by the sunday times a compensation settlement for the uk victims was reached with distillers company now part of diageo  which had distributed the drug in the uk 69 70 this compensation which is distributed by the thalidomide trust in the uk was substantially increased by diageo in 2005 71 the uk government gave survivors a grant of £20 million to be distributed through the thalidomide trust in december 2009 72australia  editmelbourne woman lynette rowe who was born without limbs led an australian class action lawsuit against the drugs manufacturer grünenthal which fought to have the case heard in germany the supreme court of victoria dismissed grünenthals application in 2012 and the case was heard in australia 73 on 17 july 2012 rowe was awarded an outofcourt settlement believed to be in the millions of dollars and paving the way for class action victims to receive further compensation 74 in february 2014 the supreme court of victoria endorsed the settlement of 89 million aud to 107 victims of the drug in australia and new zealand 75 76canada  editthe drug thalidomides birth defects in children affected many peoples lives and from these events came the formation of the group called the thalidomide victims association of canada a group of 120 canadian survivors 77 78 their goal was to prevent future usage of drugs that could be of potential harm to mothers and babies the members from the thalidomide victims association were involved in the steps program which aimed to prevent teratogenicity 26the effects of thalidomide increased fears regarding the safety of pharmaceutical drugs the society of toxicology of canada was formed after the effects of thalidomide were made public focusing on toxicology as a discipline separate from pharmacology 79 the need for the testing and approval of the toxins in certain pharmaceutical drugs became more important after the disaster the society of toxicology of canada is responsible for the conservation environment protection act focusing on researching the impact to human health of chemical substances 79 thalidomide brought on changes in the way drugs are tested what type of drugs are used during pregnancy and increased the awareness of potential side effects of drugs according to canadian news magazine program w5 most but not all victims of thalidomide receive annual benefits as compensation from the government of canada excluded are those who cannot provide the documentation the government requires 80united states  edit1962 fda pharmacologist frances oldham kelsey receives the presidents award for distinguished federal civilian service

testing and licensing of drugs such as the kefauver harris amendment 87 u s directive 6565eec1 e u  88 and the medicines act 1968 89 90 in the united states the new regulations strengthened the fda among other ways by requiring applicants to prove efficacy and to disclose all side effects encountered in testing 48 the fda subsequently initiated the drug efficacy study implementation to reclassify drugs already on the market research  editresearch efforts have been focused on determining how thalidomide causes birth defects and its other activities in the human body efforts to develop safer analogs and efforts to find further uses for thalidomide thalidomide analogs  editmain article development of analogs of thalidomide the exploration of the antiangiogenic and immunomodulatory activities of thalidomide has led to the study and creation of thalidomide analogs 91 92 celgene has sponsored numerous clinical trials with analogues to thalidomide such as lenalidomide that are substantially more powerful and have fewer side effects — except for greater myelosuppression 93 in 2005 celgene received fda approval for lenalidomide revlimid as the first commercially useful derivative revlimid is available only in a restricted distribution setting to avoid its use during pregnancy further studies are being conducted to find safer compounds with useful qualities another more potent analog pomalidomide is now fda approved 94 additionally apremilast was approved by the fda in march 2014 these thalidomide analogs can be used to treat different diseases or used in a regimen to fight two conditions 95interest turned to pomalidomide a derivative of thalidomide marketed by celgene it is a very active antiangiogenic agent 92 and also acts as an immunomodulator pomalidomide was approved in february 2013 by the u s food and drug administration fda as a treatment for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma 96 it received a similar approval
