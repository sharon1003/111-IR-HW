their spellings are similar molarity and molality cannot be interchanged compare the molar and molal volumes of 1 mol of solute dissolved in ccl  d  159 g  m lby definition a 1 m solution would contain 1 mol of solute in exactly 100 l of ccl and a 1 m solution would contain 1 mol of solute in 629 m l of ccl1 kg of cclx 1000 g  1 kg x m l  159 g  629 m l ccl normality normality n is another ratio that relates the amount of solute to the total volume of solution it is defined as the number of equivalents per liter of solutionnormality  number of equivalents  1 l of solution there is a very simple relationship between normality and molarity n  n × m where n is an integerfor an acid solution n is the number of h provided by a formula unit of acid example a 3 m h2so4 solution is the same as a 6 n h2so4 solution for a basic solution nis the number of oh provided by a formula unit of baseexample a 1 m ca oh2 solution is the same as a 2n ca oh2 solution remember the normality of a

difference between molarity normality and molality normality  molarity x number of equivalents so if number of equivalents is 1 then normality  molarity a good example is hcl and h2so4 solution a one normal hcl solution  a one molar hcl solution because only i mole of h is formed per mole of hcl however with sulphuric acid h2so4 2 moles of h are formed per mole of acid therefore 1 molar h2so4  2 normal h2so4 molality  number of moles of solute per kg of solvent molality is important with solvents where the volume changes significantly with temperature remember it is kg of solvent and not solution where the volume will not change significantly with temperature eg water it will not make much difference however if we are talking about ethanol solvent it will make a difference and molarity and molality at a high temperature will differ considerably396 views amritendu chatterjee msc in chemistry answered dec 1 2015molarity is the number of mole of substance present per liter of solution let us take sulphuric acid for example molecular mass of sulphuric acid is 98 now if 98 gram of sulphuric acid is present in 1 liter of solution then it is 1 molar solution of sulphuric acid and therefore molarity will be 1 molality is the number of mole of substance present per kg of solventif 98 gram of sulphuric acid is present in 1 kg of water then it is 1 molal solution of sulphuric acid in water and therefore molality will be 1 normality is the number of grameqivalent of substance present per liter of solution molecular mass of sulphuric acid is 98 equivalent weight is 49 now if
