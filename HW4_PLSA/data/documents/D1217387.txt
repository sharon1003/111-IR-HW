  next   back   home our view of the universe all observations that have been made using the most powerful telescopes show that the universe looks the same in all directions the average density of galaxies is the same throughout the universe and does not change with distance or direction this is called the cosmological principle on average and at large scales the distribution of galaxies is the same throughout the universe since the expansion of space occurs evenly at every point in the universe galaxies are separating from each other at about the same pace giving the universe a nearly uniform density and structure as a result the universe appears smooth at large distance scales in scientific terms it is said to be homogeneous and isotropic in the image on the left the universe is isotropic this means that if you stand at the center and look in every direction the universe will look the same in the image on the right the universe is homogeneous this means that if you stand in any place and look around the universe will be the same homogeneous and isotropic whats the difference homogeneous usually pronounced homogeeneeus literally means to be the same throughout no matter where you are in the universe if you look at the universe from earth or from a galaxy a million lightyears away it will look the same isotropic pronounced eyesotropic means to appear the same in every direction or viewing angle this approximation breaks down when viewing the night sky from earth since our planet is located inside of the milky way but if you were able to stand at any point outside of a galaxy the universe would look the same in all directions scientists are careful to distinguish between these separate concepts uniform with respect to position homogeneous and uniform with respect to viewing angle isotropic while most intuitive examples will be both homogeneous and isotropic like our universe in theory there can be universes which exhibit one property and not the other do galaxies expand if we expanded at the same rate as space we would not perceive any expansion planets stars and galaxies are bound together by gravity on the short distance scales present in these systems the force of gravity is great enough to resist and stop the expansion of space gravity opposes the expansion of the universe on larger scales as well but since the strength of gravity falls with the square of the distance according to the inverse square law the force is not enough to halt the expansion if every object expanded with space including ourselves we would not perceive any expansion at all what is the universe expanding into the expansion of the universe is consistent with the big bang theory but what is the universe expanding into in short nothing most cosmologists believe that the universe is infinite there is nothing outside of it space and time only exist within the universe so what happens when infinity expands it is still infinity just a bit bigger rewinding the universe think of the universe today as a movie playing we see expansion everything moving apart from everything else but what happens when we rewind the movie everything becomes closer and closer to everything else and the universe becomes hotter and denser until we reach the edge of scientific understanding the big bang press the rewind button to go back in timewe even have a picture that goes further back in time than this movieto the infant universe known as the cosmic microwave background 23a cosmic conundrums the expanding universe  next   back   top
