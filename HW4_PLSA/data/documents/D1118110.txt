urinary incontinence what it is urinary incontinence urinary incontinence is defined as the involuntary or uncontrollable leaking of urine from the bladder there are many ways that urinary incontinence can come to be but age is the most common source of the problem as pets age they produce a decreased amount of the hormones they need to control the tissue that acts as a valve for the bladder incontinence has several secondary problems resulting from the leaking urine like bladder infections and urine scalding what to watch for dripping urine constantly licking near the vulva or penile opening finding wet spots in bed or where pet is sleeping irritated skin from contact with urine note finding wet spots in the house doesnt necessarily mean your pet is incontinent pets with

behavioral problem how its caused urinary incontinence can have neurogenic and nonneurogenic causes if your dog shows the signs of urinary incontinence mentioned above the first step of treatment is to identify the cause 1 neurogenic causes abnormalities of parts of the nervous system involved in regulation of urination 2 nonneurogenic causes congenital problems abnormalities present at birth such as a misplaced urethral opening ectopic ureter overdistension of the bladder due to partial obstruction hormoneresponsive incontinence and incontinence associated with urinary tract infection pets can be incontinent for many different reasons it can involve the bladder the urethra or it can be caused by abnormalities in the parts of the brain and spinal cord that control bladder function young pets may have a birth defect that causes incontinence ectopic ureter s is the most common birth defect that causes incontinence in young dogs the ureters carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder if one or both ureters bypass the bladder and connect to an abnormal location such as the urethra or vagina the puppy may drip urine dog breeds with a high occurrence of this birth defect include siberian huskies miniature poodle labrador retriever collie welsh corgi wirehaired fox terrier west highland white terrier female dogs are affected the most if one ureter is abnormal the dog will dribble urine but will also be able to urinate normally if both ureters are affected then the puppy wont be able to urinate normally at all bladder infection this can cause either a strong urge to urinate scarring of the bladder preventing it from stretching to hold urine in this case the pet is usually not truly incontinent instead they are aware that they are urinating and urinate in abnormal locations or very frequently because of a strong urge to empty their bladder blockage pets with a partial blockage of the urethra with a stone or a tumor may show incontinence if they cant completely empty their bladder because of blockage of the path to the outside the bladder can become so large that it forces some urine to leak around the blockage the enlarged bladder can be felt on examination total blockage of urine flow is usually fatal in 3 to 4 days hormoneresponsive incontinence occurs in neutered dogs of both sexes and occasionally in spayed female cats it is the most common in female dogs these pets can urinate normally but leak urine while resting hormoneresponsive incontinence can occur months to years after a pet is neutered physical examination and blood and urine tests are usually given for these pets age pets may become incontinent as they get older this may be from the weakening of the muscles that hold urine in the bladder there are various diseases that can cause a pet to create an abnormal amount of urine such as polyuria several such diseases occur in older pets if a pet has one of these diseases and frequently has a full bladder the bladder can push against the weakened sphincter causing incontinence older pets can also develop senility and become unaware that they are leaking brain or spinal cord disease can cause a pet to lose control over bladder function brain or spinal cord disease dogs and cats with these diseases may either leak urine or be unable to urinate they will usually have other signs of nervous system disease like muscle weakness or paralysis intermittent incontinence primarily at rest and has been reported in cats that are positive for the feline leukemia virus it is not yet known how the virus causes incontinence vulvovaginal stenosis a less common cause of incontinence in female dogs it is a condition in which the vagina is narrowed where the urethra ends some urine may get trapped in the vagina in front of the narrowed area when the pet gets up the urine pours out the incontinence may or may not resolve because other defects may also be present treatment the treatment for urinary incontinence will of course depend on the cause if the cause is from urethral weakness or old age estrogen supplements may be prescribed there are several medications that can aid in the strengthening
