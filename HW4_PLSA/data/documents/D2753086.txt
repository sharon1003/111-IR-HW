what are lnc rnas advances in rna sequencing technologies have revealed the complexity of our genome noncoding rnas make up the majority 98 of the transcriptome and several different classes of regulatory rna with important functions are being discovered understanding the significance of this rna world is one of the most important challenges facing biology today and the noncoding rnas within it represent a gold mine of potential new biomarkers and drug targetslnc rna sequences long noncoding rnas lnc rnas are a large and diverse class of transcribed rna molecules with a length of more than 200 nucleotides that do not encode proteins or lack  100 amino acid open reading frame lnc rnas are thought to encompass nearly 30000 different transcripts in humans hence lnc rna transcripts account for the major part of the noncoding transcriptome lnc rna discovery is still at a preliminary stage there are many specialized lnc rna databases which are organized and centralized through rnacentral lnc rnas can be transcribed as whole or partial natural antisense transcripts nat to coding genes or located between genes or within introns some lnc rnas originate from pseudogenes  milligan  lipovich 2015  lnc rnas may be classified into different subtypes  antisense intergenic overlapping intronic bidirectional and processed according to the position and direction of transcription in relation to other genes  peschansky  wahlestedt 2014 mattick  rinn 2015 lnc rna expression gene expression profiling and in situ hybridization studies have revealed that lnc rna expression is developmentally regulated can be tissue and celltype specific and can vary spatially temporally or in response to stimuli many lnc rnas are expressed in a more tissuespecific fashion and with greater variation between tissues compared to proteincoding genes  derrien et al  2012  in general the expression level of lnc rna is at least one order of magnitude below that of m rna many lnc rnas are located exclusively in the nucleus but some are cytoplasmic or are located in both nucleus and cytoplasmlnc rna functions to date very few lnc rnas have been characterized in detail however it is clear that lnc rnas are important regulators of gene expression and lnc rnas are thought to have a wide range of functions in cellular and developmental processes lnc rnas may carry out both gene inhibition and gene activation through a range of diverse mechanisms adding yet another layer of complexity to our understanding of genomic regulation it is estimated that 25 – 40 of coding genes have overlapping antisense transcription so the impact of lnc rnas on gene regulation is not to be underestimated figure 1overview of some of the functions of long noncoding rna click for a larger image lnc rnas are involved in gene regulation through a variety of mechanisms the process of transcription of the lnc rna itself can be a marker of transcription and the resulting lnc rna can function in transcriptional regulation or in chromatin modification usually via dna and protein interactions both in cis and in trans lnc rnas can bind to complementary rna and affect rna processing turnover or localization the interaction of lnc rna with proteins can affect protein function and localization as well as facilitate formation of riboprotein complexes some lnc rnas are actually precursors for smaller regulatory rnas such as micro rnas or piwi rnas figure modified from wilusz et al genes dev 2009 23 14941504 pmid 19571179lnc rna mechanisms of gene regulationlnc rnas are not defined by a common mode of action and can regulate gene expression and protein synthesis in a number of different ways figure 1 some lnc rnas are relatively highly expressed and appear to function as scaffolds for specialized subnuclear domains lnc rna possess secondary structures which facilitate their interactions with dna rna and proteins lnc rna may also bind to dna or rna in a sequencespecific manner gene regulation may occur in cis eg in close proximity to the transcribed lnc rna or in trans at a distance from the transcription site in the case of chromatin modulation the effect of lnc rna is typically genespecific exerted at a local level  in cis however regulation of chromatin can also occur in trans a few lnc rnas have had their functions experimentally defined and have been shown to be involved in fundamental processes of gene regulation including chromatin modification and structure direct transcriptional regulation regulation of rna processing events such as splicing editing localization translation and turnoverdegradation posttranslational regulation of protein activity and localization facilitation of ribonucleoprotein rnp complex formation modulation of micro rna regulation gene silencing through production of endogenous si rna endosi rnaregulation of genomic imprinting it has recently been attempted to categorize the various types of molecular mechanisms that may be involved in lnc rna function lnc rnas may be defined as one or more of the following five archetypes the signal archetype functions as a molecular signal or indicator of transcriptional activity the decoy archetype binds to and titrates away other regulatory rnas eg micro rnas or proteins eg transcription factors the guide archetype directs the localization of ribonucleoprotein complexes to specific targets eg chromatin modification enzymes are recruited to dna the scaffold archetype has a structural role as platform upon which relevant molecular components proteins and or rna can be assembled into a complex or spatial proximity the enhancer archetype controls higher order chromosomal looping in an enhancerlike modellnc rna and disease with such a wide range of functions it is not surprising that lnc rna play a role in the development and pathophysiology of disease interestingly genome wide association studies have demonstrated that most disease variants are located outside of proteincoding genes lnc rnas have been found to be differentially expressed in various types of cancer including leukemia breast cancer hepatocellular carcinoma colon cancer and prostate cancer key oncogenes and tumor suppressors including pten and kras are now known to be regulated by corresponding lnc rna pseudogenes which also act as competing endogenous rnas ce rnas or micro rna sponges  poliseno et al  2010 johnsson et al   this highlights the important role that lnc rnas play in oncogenesis other diseases where lnc rnas are dysregulated include cardiovascular diseases neurological disorders and immunemediated diseases and genetic disorders one of the first lnc rna to be discovered was the xist lnc rna which plays an important role in x chromosome inactivation  penny et al  1996  an extreme case of genomic imprinting lnc rnas are present at almost all imprinted loci arguing for an important role for lnc rnas in this form of epigenetic regulation lnc rnas represent a gold mine of potential new biomarkers and drug targets as well as a step change in the way we understand mechanisms of disease the challenges of studying lnc rnaonly a relatively small proportion of lnc rnas have so far been investigated and although we can start to classify different types of lnc rna functions we are still far from being able to predict the function of new lnc rnas this is mainly due to the fact that unlike proteincoding genes whose sequence motifs are indicative of their function lnc rna sequences are not usually conserved and they don’t tend to contain conserved motifs other differences between lnc rna and m rna are summarized in table 1 the main challenges of working with lnc rna are the fact that they can be present in very low amounts typically an order of magnitude lower than m rna expression levels can overlap with coding transcripts on both strands and are often restricted to the nucleus exiqon offer a comprehensive range of products and services for all aspects of lnc rna research – from discovery and expression analysis to elucidation of lnc rna functions we are committed to developing novel tools and

uncover the function of lnc rna identifying lnc rnas that are differentially expressed during development or in particular situations can shed light on their potential functions alternatively looking for lnc rnas and proteincoding genes whose expression is correlated can perhaps indicate coregulation or related functions whole transcriptome rna sequencing is the method of choice for comprehensive

continue to use the lna™ technology to develop new and innovative ways to improve our understanding of lnc rnas in this rapidly developing field functional analysis of lnc rnas has been revolutionized

rnas by q pcr precise subcellular localization of lnc rnas can be studied using lna™ probes for in situ hybridization silencing lnc rna to disrupt their function one strategy to study the function of lnc rna is to silence them using specific and potent antisense oligonucleotides  antisense lna™ gapme rs  the nuclear localization of many lnc rnas has meant that si rna approaches to knockdown lnc rna have met with limited success the doublestranded si rna duplex has difficulty crossing the nuclear membrane and the passenger strand nontargeting sequence of the duplex can often elicit its own effect confounding interpretation of results antisense lna™ gapme rs overcome this challenge by enabling highly efficient rnase h mediated silencing of all lnc rna rnase h is present both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus and it has been shown that lna™ gapmers offer significantly better knockdown of nuclear targets than si rna mediated silencing in addition the single stranded lna™ gapme rs are an advantage for lnc rnas that are transcribed as antisense transcripts to coding genes because there is no second strand that could compromise specificity antisense lna™ gapme rs show high potency in a broad range of tissues in vivo when administered systemically without formulation in animal models this makes lna™ gapme rs very promising antisense drugs for lnc rna targets in the future studying lnc rna interactions with dna rna and proteins the fact that the molecular mechanism of lnc rnas often relies on sequence specific interaction with dna rna or proteins means that it is
