having a plan despite a lack of gains in wages is the best strategy for all workers photo rod millington for usa todaystory highlights median family income in 2012 was 51071adjusted for inflation incomes have been falling since 2000despite a lack of gains theres plenty to be said for having an investing plan connect tweet linkedin comment email morelets say youre an average person ok actually well say youre a median person you live in the middle of the country and you drive only on the median strip more important half the people in the nation earn more than you do half earn less thats just how its been all your life last year you earned 51071 before taxes youre 60 now and youve earned the median income since you started working in 1975 – which conveniently is when the census bureaus data series begins how much do you need to retire and what percentage of your income do you need to have saved to get there as you can imagine its not an easy question and any hypothetical example will be holier than a swiss cheese sandwich at a sandwich shop in lourdes but the example — and the problems with it — show how difficult it can be to save for retirement and what some of those difficulties are lets construct a scenario for our median earner he started work at age 22 after college and pulled down the median wage in 1975 which was 11800 adjusted for inflation thats the equivalent of 45788 in 2012 dollars but we dont care about no stinkin inflationadjusted dollars he earned 11800 and being a prudent young person decided that he would save 5 of his salary every year for retirement in his first year he saved 590 each year in a happy coincidence that could only happen in the land of hypothesis he earned the median income in the nation in 1990 the median was 29943 so he put aside 1497 in 2012 he socked away 2551 how is our median person doing assuming he invested in a blend of largecompany stocks 60 and government bonds 40 a middleoftheroad asset allocation he would have earned an average 113 annually according to ibbotson associates at that rate he would have had 600488 in his retirement savings at age 60 not bad our median man or woman were flexible still has five more years left until retirement age assuming his income rises at the same rate as the past 10 years 175 he saves the same amount 5 and earns the same amount 113 hed have 1044279 if he were to invest that in an immediate annuity now the company would guarantee him and his spouse an income of 4778 a month thats 57336 a year but annuities have two drawbacks if they both get eaten by hippos in a freak zoo accident at age 66 the insurance company keeps all their money and their payment remains the same over time meaning that inflation will erode the value of their income for that reason most financial planners recommend you start with a 5 withdrawal from your retirement account and adjust that annually for inflation using the 5 rule our median man would still be able to duplicate his final income and give himself an inflation bump each year by saving 5 a year all his working life a person earning the median wage could retire with an income close to his final salary what could go wrong plenty lets start with a few of the obvious things• young poverty most people dont earn the median wage just out of college they earn some pathetic wage hoping to earn more later in all likelihood our median man would have earned much less than the median wage in the first five years of his working life and saved much less that would have been extremely unfortunate if he didnt start saving until 1980 his retirement kitty would be 765699 instead of more than 1 million thanks to compounding those small amounts stashed away early became a significant part of our median mans savings• big bull markets you probably did a doubletake at the 113 average annual return since 1975 but both stocks and bonds have earned exceptional returns in the past three decades despite at least three soulshattering bear markets in 1980 2000 and 2007 whether a mix of stocks and bonds will return the same going forward is debatable at best• experience a young person investing in stocks and bonds in 1975 would have been unusual to say the least the stock market fell 45 from 1973 to 1974 and bonds had lost money for three decades thanks to rising interest rates my first year in the financial business was in 1973 says mark bass a financial planner in lubbock texas at the end of 1974 i was thinking what have i done with my life other problems retirement accounts we take for granted such as iras and 401 ks werent widely available in 1975 the average worker still doesnt have a 401 k available our median man didnt experience any extended periods of unemployment or sickness that would have kept him from saving he invested regularly in the same mix of stocks and bonds without chasing bubbles in housing technology or baseball cards thats a lot harder than it seems for people just starting out now our median man does provide some good lessons• save more and assume youll earn less if our median man had earned an average 5 hed be staring at a 208000 retirement balance at age 65 its better to assume youll earn less — say 7 in a mix of stocks and bonds over the long term — and save more you can control how much you save you cant control what the stock and bond markets will give you• make use of your 401 k plan particularly if it has a company match and especially if youre young• dont dismiss social security the average payout is 1269 a month and its adjusted for inflation each year its brutal trying to live on social security alone but its a lifesaver if youve ever had a hiccup in your retirement savings one final note probably the kindest thing a parent can do for a child is to make a roth ira contribution for a child in the earliest days of her working years says bass by the time our median man was retirement age his first five years worth of savings had grown to 25 of his
