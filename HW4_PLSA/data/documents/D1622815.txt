inhaling it into the lungs or become ill after ingesting it this would change blood pressure and heart rate and lead to a loss of consciousness or a seizure as well as this the lack of a physical exam after ingestion could result in more long term problems such as asthma putting the teenagers at risk of further complications st john ambulance clinical director alan weir also outlines that this challenge could potentially have fatal consequences we do not condone this dangerous activity which is anything but a challenge and urge people not to participate in the latest social media craze if someone has ingested chemicals or poisons such as laundry detergent it is vital to call 999 or 112 for emergency help and give them as much information as possible as to what chemical has been swallowed keep monitoring the patients breathing and level of response and be prepared to give cpr if they become unresponsive weir said how to treat poisoning signs  sypmtoms  first aid training  st
