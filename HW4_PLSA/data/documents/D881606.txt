us economy monetary policy federal reserve tools and how they work share flip pin email•••by kimberly amadeo updated march 27 2018the federal funds rate is the most wellknown federal reserve tool but the u s central bank has many more monetary policy tools and they all work together reserve requirement the reserve requirement refers to the amount of deposit that a bank must keep in reserve at a federal reserve branch bank on december 30 2010 the fed set it at 10 percent of all bank liabilities over 588 million the lower this requirement is the more a bank can lend out it stimulates economic growth by putting more money into circulation a high requirement is especially hard on small banks since they dont have as much to lend out in the first place for that reason there is no requirement for banks with liabilities under 107 million the requirement is only 3 percent for liabilities between 107 million and 588 million the fed rarely changes the reserve requirement for one thing it is very expensive for the banks to change their policies and procedures to conform to a new requirement more important adjusting the fed funds rate achieves the same result with less disruption and cost fed funds rate if a bank doesnt have enough on hand to meet the reserve requirement it will borrow from other banks the federal funds rate is the interest banks charge each other for these overnight loans the amount lent and borrowed is called the fed funds the federal open market committee targets a particular level for the current fed funds rate at one of its eight regularly scheduled meetings interest on reserves in 2008 the fed agreed to pay interest on the reserve requirement and any excess reserves it can now use this rate to change the fed funds rate banks wont lend fed funds for less than what they receive from the fed for their reserves reverse repos in 2013 the fed began to issue reverse repos to banks the fed borrows money from banks overnight it pays them interest for this loan it uses its holdings of u s treasurys as collateral like all repurchase agreements banks dont record it as a loan the interest it pays will support the fed funds rate as the fed gradually raises it margin requirements on november 12 2015 the worlds central banks agreed to develop margin requirements in lockstep with the fed any financial firm that lends money for investors to buy securities must require a percent or margin to be held back as collateral for example if a trader wants to borrow 100 for a day the bank will require him to borrow 105 the extra five bucks is the margin bank lending for securities is a 44 trillion market the margin would apply to loans for repos stocks bonds and other risky securities it would not apply to loans to purchase treasurys or other safe securities they make up twothirds of the securities lending market the fed has this authority from the 1934 securities exchange act but hasnt used it since the 1970s the fed is reviving this power to reduce the kind of risktaking exposed by the 2008 financial crisis critics say it may also lessen the number of traders that would increase price volatility if there arent enough financial firms to help traders buy and sell in a market crash open market operations the open market operations tool is how the fed makes sure banks lend at its targeted fed funds rate the fed uses it when it buys or sells securities from the member banks its most likely to purchase treasury notes or mortgagebacked securities  buying or selling securities is the same as removing or adding them to the open market the fed will buy securities from banks when it wants them to drop the fed funds rate to meet its target they will because they now have more money on hand and must lower rates to lend out all the extra capital when the fed wants rates to rise it does the opposite it sells securities to banks reducing their capital since theres less to lend they can comfortably raise the fed funds rate to the feds target discount window the fed uses the discount window to lend money to banks at the feds discount rate to meet the reserve requirement the feds discount rate is higher than the fed funds rate banks usually only use the discount window when they cant get overnight loans from other banks for that reason the fed usually only uses this tool in an emergency examples include the y2k scare after 911 and the great recession the financial crisis timeline details when the fed used this tool discount rate the discount rate is the rate that the federal reserve charges banks to borrow at its discount window it is usually a percentage point above the fed funds rate thats because the fed wants to discourage excessive borrowing money supply the money supply is the total amount of currency held by the public the fed reports on it weekly as m1 which is currency and check deposits m2 which includes m1 plus money market funds cds and savings accounts the fed increases the money supply by lowering the fed funds rate which lowers the banks’ cost of maintaining reserve requirements this gives them more money to loan which gives consumers more money in their pockets feds alphabet soup the fed created many new and innovative programs to combat the financial crisis they were created quickly so the names described exactly what they did in technical terms it made a lot of sense to bankers but very few others the acronyms resulted in an alphabet soup of programs such as mmif taf cppf abcp and the mmf liquidity facility although these tools worked well they confused the general public as a result the people did not trust the feds intentions and actions now that the crisis is over these tools have been discontinued click on the hyperlink to learn more about them money market investor

it affects the economy and the feds outlook for the future the fed chair presents the report twice a year to congress he or she appears before the senate committee on banking housing and urban affairs and the house committee on financial services the report a mustread for anyone who wants an expert analysis of the u s economy unfortunately its so detailed and technical that it is often overlooked even the financial media pay attention to the fed chairs testimony instead they focus on whether the policy is likely to change and how it will affect the stock market sadly the same is often true of
