current rating shape size and type of connectors the types used in each country are set by national standards some of which are listed in the iec technical report tr 60083 plugs and socketoutlets for domestic and similar general use standardized in member countries of iec 1 the scope of iec tr 60083 states the report only contains systems for which standard sheets have been published in a national standard which may be a national standard of the country itself or any other iec member country plugs and sockets for portable appliances started becoming available in the 1880s to replace connections to light sockets with easier to use wallmounted outlets a proliferation of types developed to address the issues of convenience and protection from electric shock today there are approximately 20 types in common use around the world and many obsolete socket types are still found in older buildings coordination of technical standards has allowed some types of plugs to be used over wide regions to facilitate trade in electrical appliances and for the convenience of travellers and consumers of imported electrical goods some multistandard sockets allow use of several different types of plugs

energized clockwise from top left cee 74 german plug and matching cee 73 socket cee 75 french socket the international electrotechnical commission publishes iec 60050 the international electrotechnical vocabulary which is also available as iev online 2generally the plug is the movable connector attached to an electrically operated devices mains cable and the socket is fixed on equipment or a building structure and connected to an energised electrical circuit the plug has protruding pins or in us terminology blades referred to as male that fit into matching slots or holes called female in the sockets a plug is defined in iec 60050 as an accessory having pins designed to engage with the contacts of a socketoutlet also incorporating means for the electrical connection and mechanical retention of flexible cables or cords a plug does not contain components which modify the electrical output from the electrical input except where a switch or fuse is provided as a means of disconnecting the output from input there is an erroneous tendency to refer to power conversion devices with incorporated plug pins as plugs but iec 60050 refers to these as direct plugin equipment defined as equipment in which the mains plug forms an integral part of the equipment enclosure so that the equipment is supported by the mains socketoutlet in this article the term plug is used in the sense defined by iec 60050 sockets are designed to prevent exposure of bare energised contacts sockets may also have protruding exposed contacts but these are used exclusively for grounding earthing to reduce the risk of users accidentally touching energized conductors and thereby experiencing electric shock plug and socket systems often incorporate safety features in addition to the recessed slots or holes of the energized socket these may include plugs with insulated sleeves recessed sockets sockets with blocking shutters and sockets designed to accept only compatible plugs inserted in the correct orientation the term plug is in general and technical use in all forms of english common alternatives being power plug 3electric plug 4 and in the uk plug top 5 the normal technical term in both british and international english for an ac power socket is socketoutlet 6 but in nontechnical contexts a number of other terms are in common use in british english the general term is socket but there are numerous common alternatives including power point 7 plug socket 8 wall socket 9 and wall plug 10 in american english receptacle which is a term not defined in iec 60050 is used in official standards and codes such as the nema connector standard and the national electrical code the american national electrical contractors association s national electrical installation standards neca 1302010 defines outlet as a point on the wiring system at which current is taken to supply utilization equipment in common use outlet is used to refer to the actual receptacle or socket sometimes with qualifiers such as wall outlet electrical outlet and electrical receptacle all of these sometimes to be found in the same document 11 there is also colloquial use of socket in american english 12 common usage in australia and new zealand is general purpose outlet gpo 13 but this is no longer an official term 14a socket may be surrounded by a decorative or protective cover called a wall plate face plate outlet cover 15 socket cover or wall cover in some designs this is an integral piece with the socket itself bought and installed as a single unit electrical sockets for single phase domestic commercial and light industrial purposes generally provide either two or three electrical connections to the supply conductors twopin sockets normally provide neutral 16 and line 17 connections both of which carry current and are defined as live parts 18 19 neutral is usually very near to earth potential usually being earthed either at the distribution board or at the substation line also known as phase or hot and commonly but technically incorrectly as live carries the full supply voltage relative to the neutral and to earth threepin sockets provide in addition a protective earth 20 connection for exposed metal parts of an appliance if internal insulation should fail a shortcircuit to the earthed exposed metal parts will hold them at a low potential and should operate fuses or circuit breakers to isolate the faulty appliance from the supply depending on the supply system some sockets may have two line connections each at significant voltage to earth and without a neutral pin for example a split phase system may have 240 v between line connections each at 120 v with respect to earth ground but a singlephase socket connected to a threephase system may have for example 208 v between contacts and 120 v between each contact and earth ground an adaptor in the context of plugs and sockets is defined in iec 60050 as a portable accessory constructed as an integral unit incorporating both a plug portion and one or more socketoutlet portions there is an alternative spelling adapter but adaptor is the form usually used in standards and official documents history  editearly history  editlampholder plug from 1893 gec ltd london catalogue when electricity was first introduced into houses it was primarily used for lighting at that time many electricity companies operated a splittariff system where the cost of electricity for lighting was lower than that for other purposes  citation needed this led to portable appliances such as vacuum cleaners electric fans and hair driers being connected to light bulb sockets using lampholder plugs 21british origins  editearly gec 2 pin plug and socket as depicted in the 1893 gec catalogue as electricity became a common method of operating laboursaving appliances a safe means of connection to the electric system other than using a light socket was needed thomas tayler smith of london england received british patent 4162 in 1882 for an electriccircuit connection to enable the electric conductors conveying the current to one or more lamps or along a flexible cord to be rapidly and safely brought into connection with the line or main wires smith subsequently received us patent 311616 22 for the same device in 1885 according to british author john mellanby 23 there were british patents for plug and sockets granted to t t smith in 1883 no 3883 and w b sayers  g hookham in 1884 no 16655 mellanby also writes that there were twopin designs by 1885 one of which appears in the british general electric company ltd catalogue of 1889 gustav binswanger a german immigrant who founded the british general electric company ltd obtained a patent gb189516898 in 1895 for a plug and socket using a concentric coaxial contact system hubbells inventions  editu s patent 774250 the first us power plug and socket dated 1904several early american electrical plug and socket arrangements were invented by harvey hubbell on 26 february 1903 he filed two patent applications featuring 2pin plugs and adaptors for using his plugs with existing designs of lamp sockets and wall receptacles hubbells first plug design had two round pins which differed from those already in use in europe in that the tips of the pins had annular detents similar to those of presentday jack plugs to positively retain a plug in its socket in one patent us 774250 24 a plug was used with a socket which screwed into a lampholder like the early lampholder plugs in the other patent us 776326 25 the same type of plug was used with various threeway adaptors that could be connected to lampholders or a receptacle of any ordinary type figures 2 and 4 of this patent show an adaptor plugged into what appears to be a chapman receptacle 26hubbell evidently soon found the round pin design unsatisfactory as a subsequent patent us 774251 27 filed on may 27 1904 shows lampholder adaptors similar to those of his first patent for use with plugs having coplanar tandem flat pins hubbells catalogue of 1906 includes various threeway adaptors similar to those shown in the us 776326 patent but modified for use with the coplanar flat pin plugs 28 the chapman receptacle must have been in general use at the time as it was the only type of nonlampholder receptacle for which adaptors were supplied the 1906 catalogue says of the chapman adaptor the device avoids fastening the cords together as is necessary with the ordinary chapman plug when used for more than one purpose this suggests that hubbells original invention was prompted by his observation of the problem that arose with the use of this sort of receptacle and plug gradually wall sockets were developed to supplement those that screwed into lampholders 29 30 31in 1912 hubbell rotated his tandem pins by 90 degrees to arrive at the parallel flat pin configuration still widely used today nema 115 a feature common to all of hubbells patented designs is the provision of detents to retain a plug in its socket this would have been a desirable feature in the days before wall receptacles became widespread and for many consumers the only source of electricity was an electric light socket hubbell vs other american manufacturers  editdespite hubbels objections other manufacturers adopted the hubbell pattern omitting hubbells detents as these did not affect interchangeability and by 1915 the use of hubbells configuration was widespread in 1919 hubbell unsuccessfully attempted to get an injunction to prevent other manufacturers from making receptacles and plugs to the dimensions used by hubbell the report of the court proceedings 32 includes a comprehensive review of the development of the art in the us prior to 1919 based on evidence presented to the court separable plugs had been available for more than a decade prior to hubbells 1904 design the earliest presented to the court was the weston us patent 480900 issued august 16 1892 for which hubbell had taken out a licence another unidentified type following in 1897 plugs per se with parallel flat pins such as the fort wayne design were in common use by 1886 and flush receptacles such as the bryant electrical company design by 1902 hubbell had introduced its own parallel flat pin configuration in 1912 in 1915 there were from 15 to 20 different types of blades and from 15 to 30 different types of receptacles the line of each was not interchangeable with competing lines  the existence of both tandem and parallel pin configurations had led to the introduction in 1914 of some receptacles having both configurations of slots and others having t slots by 1915 hubbell had sold about 13 million receptacles and plug basescaps with tandem slotspins and about 125 million with parallel slotspins most of which were then still in active use meaning that hubbells configurations were by far the most widely used following the lead set by the lamp manufacturers in standardising lamp bases a conference of the plug and receptacle manufacturers including hubbell was arranged with a view to agreeing a standard configuration it was a time of great expansion in the use of electrical appliances such as fans heaters and cookers as well as portable devices such as hair curlers and irons and the public wanted interchangeability hubbells parallel pin configuration was preferred but hubbell rebelled against standardization and refused to agree asserting that it had common law rights in the dimensions of its line the other conference members pressed on regardless and agreed to standardize on hubbells parallel flat pin configuration and dimensions hubbells court action only served to confirm the legality of their activities to the great benefit of the us public earthed plugs  editillustration of tripin 3pin earthed plug dated 1911 the earthed consumer plug has several claimants to its invention a 1911 book 33 dealing with the electrical products of a p lundberg  sons of london describes the tripin earthed plug available in 25 amp and 5 amp models the pin configuration of the tripin appears virtually identical to modern bs 546 plugs in her 1914 book electric cooking heating cleaning etc 34 maud lucas lancaster mentions an earthed ironclad plug and socket by the english firm of reyrolle and co the earliest american patent application for an earthed plug appears to be 11 january 1915 by george p knapp on behalf of the harvey hubbell company 35 this patent covers the use of an earthing pin which extends further than the other two contacts to ensure that it is engaged first knapps design was obsoleted in the us before the modern nema designations but is still used in some other countries including china argentina and australia the configuration of the socket was not operable with existing twocontact unearthed plugs other earthed sockets that are widely used in the us today are operable with unearthed plugs it is sometimes claimed eg in illumin 36 that the modern american version of the earthed plug was invented by philip f labre who was issued a us patent for an earthed socket and plug in 1928 37 however labres design is no more similar to the modern version than knapps earlier design the german schuko system plug is believed to date from 1925 and is attributed to albert büttner 38 as the need for safer installations became apparent earthed threecontact systems were made mandatory in most industrial countries proliferation  editduring the first fifty years of commercial use of electric power standards developed rapidly based on growing experience technical safety and economic factors influenced the development of all wiring devices and numerous varieties were invented gradually the desire for trade eliminated some standards that had been used in only a few countries former colonies may retain the standards of the colonising country sometimes offshore industrial plants or overseas military bases use the wiring practices of their controlling country instead of the surrounding region some countries have multiple voltages frequencies and plug designs in use which can create inconvenience and safety hazards hotels and airports may maintain sockets of foreign standards for the convenience of travellers consolidation  editde facto standards became formalised as official national and international standards old installations with obsolete sockets exist the international electrotechnical commission in 1934 established technical committee tc 23 for electrical fittings only two meetings were held before the outbreak of the second world war 39 in europe since 1951 the international commission on the rules for the approval of electrical equipment cee has published a standard cee 7 specification for plugs and socketoutlets for domestic and similar purposes 40 describing the plugs and sockets used in 1953 the cee published technical report 83 later 60083 which was a listing of plugs and sockets then in use in north america the national electrical manufacturers association nema publishes standards for plugs and sockets the international standard iec 608841 defines the general requirements for plugs and sockets intended for household and similar purposes iec 608841 does not define specific plug and socket types which are the subject of national standards in each country iec 608841 para 92 does stipulate that it shall not be possible within a given system to engage a plug with a socketoutlet having a higher voltage rating or a lower current rating iec 608841 para 61 defines the preferred voltage ratings for single phase plugs and sockets as 130 v or 250 v the foreword of iec 608841 states in order to promote international uniformity iec national committees undertake to apply iec publications transparently to the maximum extent possible in their national and regional publications any divergence between any iec publication and the corresponding national or regional publication shall be clearly indicated in the latter 41consolidation of standards eases international trade and travel for example the cee 77 plug has been adopted in several european countries and is compatible with both cee 73 and cee 75 sockets while the unearthed and unpolarised cee 716 europlug is compatible with even more european and other socket types in response to a suggestion that the european commission introduce a common system across the whole of the european union the commissions regulatory fitness and performance refit programme issued a report in 2017 the report found that the harmonisation of plug and socket outlet systems in europe by introducing changes in national wiring legislations would have important transitional periods above 75 years and that the cost to replace the old socketoutlets and the corresponding plugs of the appliances being used was estimated at 100 billion euro generating a huge environmental impact producing some 700 000 tons of electrical waste 42 the report does not recommend harmonising the plugs and socketoutlet systems in europe iec 609061 has been proposed as a common standard for plugs and sockets in countries using 230 v a modified version is used in brazil but iec 609061 has been adopted only in south africa in 1993 becoming the “preferred configuration for new installations” in 2013 a statement released by the south african bureau of standards in 2016 said that the rollout of the new standard would be gradual and that the implementation of a new standard could take “ up to 50 years” 43iec 609062 recognizes the wide use of the nema 515 parallel blade plug and socket and recommends it for all 120 v applications application issues  editdesign features of plugs and sockets have gradually developed to reduce the risk of electric shock and fire safety measures may include pin and slot dimensions and layout that permit only proper insertion of plug into socket and earth pins designed such that the device becomes earthed before power is connected shutters that open only for the correct plug prevent foreign objects from contacting live slots according to british author john mellanby 23 the first shuttered socket was introduced by british manufacturer crompton in 1893 electrical insulation of the pin shanks was added to some designs to reduce live contact exposure when a plug is partially inserted in a socket mellanby shows such a plug from british manufacturer diamond h dated 1905 some types include fuses and switches earthing grounding  edita third contact for a connection to earth is intended to protect against insulation failure of the connected device early unearthed plug and socket types were revised to include an earthing pin or phased out in favor of new earthed types different types of plugs are used for different iec appliance classes the assigned class depends on whether or not the device is earthed and the degree of insulation it incorporates class i for example refers to earthed equipment which requires a third contact in the plug and socket while class ii refers to unearthed equipment protected by double insulation polarization  editwhere the building wiring system defines a neutral conductor that is close to earth potential it is an advantage for appliance designers to preserve that distinction for example appliances may ensure singlepole switches interrupt the line side of the circuit or ensure that screwbase lampholder shells are connected to the neutral side of the supply minimizing the chance of contact with live parts this requires a plug that can only be connected in one way to the socket so that the energised and neutral conductors are not interchanged in most designs such  polarized  plugs cannot be mated with nonpolarized sockets wiring systems where both circuit conductors have a significant potential with respect to earth do not benefit from polarized plugs polarization is maintained by the shape size or position of plug pins and socket holes and socket recesses to ensure that a plug fits only one way into a socket lamps with screw bases will connect the shell of the lamp socket to the neutral conductor similarly the singlepole switch of the appliance is connected in series with the energized wire however due to the uncertainty in practice of which conductor is the neutral some appliances contain dualpole switches which interrupt both conductors interchange hazards  editplugs and sockets are designed as a system to meet standards for safety and reliability some types of socket may accept more than one type of plug where this is an official approved intention of the socket design all the approved combinations will be tested to the applicable safety standards occasionally plug and socket combinations may allow power to flow but may not meet product standards for mating force earthing current capacity life expectancy or safety improvised or usermodified connectors will not meet the product safety standards adaptors between different standards can overcome mechanical incompatibility physical compatibility does not ensure that the appliance and socket match in frequency or voltage appliance connections and extensions  editso that manufacturers need not build distribute and maintain many similar appliances differing only in the type of plug fitted a common strategy is to provide an iec 60320 inlet on the appliance and a detachable power cord mains flex lead to allow connection of the appliance to the socket the appliance need only to be tested to the power inlet some types of appliance require the consumer to also change a switch to adapt to different voltages or frequency in addition to sockets permanently attached to building wiring extension cords extension leads are used for temporary connections when a socket is not within convenient reach of an appliances power lead portable equipment such as gardening power tools may have a male power inlet compatible with the connector at the end of an extension cord this allows one long cord to be shared among several tools and so saves storage space and cost for the consumer multiple small appliances may be connected to sockets on a power strip which can also include switching surge voltage and overcurrent protection a power strip equipped with different series of plug and sockets can act as an adaptor for imported equipment special purpose plugs and sockets  editspecial purpose sockets may be found in residential industrial commercial or

electricity by country there are two common standards for voltage and frequency in the world one is the european standard of 220–240 volts at 50 hz and the other is the north american standard of 120 volts at a frequency of 60 hz japan uses 100v with either 50 or 60hz the differences arose for historical reasons as discussed in the article mains electricity the plugs and sockets used in each country are set by national standards some of which are listed in the iec technical report tr 60083 plugs and socketoutlets for domestic and similar general use standardized in member countries of iec the iec also maintains a web page giving arbitrary letter designations for generally compatible types of plugs 44 the iec web page does not identify the national standards corresponding to each plug letter the letter codes are often used as a de facto naming standard when comparing different ac power plugs especially when describing travel adaptors physically identical sockets may be connected to voltages incompatible with an appliance the letter codes do not identify all the variants of a plug and socket family for different current ratings or for special purposes and not all plug types have been assigned letters where an iec letter code exists it is shown in this article an earlier and now obsolescent us government list of letter designations was last revised in 1998 45 intended as a

until 2007 when its adoption was made optional for manufacturers it became compulsory on january 1 2010 few private houses in brazil have an earthed supply so even if a threepin socket is present it is not safe to assume that all three terminals are actually connected most large domestic appliances were sold with the option to fit a flying earth tail to be locally earthed but many consumers were unsure how to use this and so didnt connect it the new standard has an earth pin which in theory eliminates the need for the flying earth tail 51brazilian 10 ampere socket and plugs brazilian 20

modification 4 in march 1983 55 cee 7 consists of general specifications plus a number of standard sheets for specific connectors a number of standards based on two round pins with centres spaced at 19 mm are in use in continental europe and elsewhere most of which are listed in iectr 60083 plugs and socketoutlets for domestic and similar general use standardized in member countries of iec 56 there is no european union regulation of domestic mains plugs and sockets and the low voltage directive specifically excludes domestic plugs and sockets 57 eu countries each have their own regulations

having 48 by 19 mm 0189 by 0748 in pins because they have no earth connections they have been or are being phased out in most countries the regulations of countries using the cee 73 and cee 75 socket standards vary in whether cee 71 sockets are still permitted in environments where the need for earthing is less critical sweden for example prohibited them from new installations in 1994 in germany unearthed sockets are rare whereas in the netherlands and sweden it is still common to find them in dry areas such as in bedrooms or living rooms some countries prohibit use of unearthed and earthed sockets in the same room in the insulated room concept so that people cannot touch an earthed object and one that has become live at the same time the depth of the sockets varies between countries and age older sockets are so shallow that it is possible to touch the pins of a plug when the plug is inserted only deep enough to get electrical power on the pins while newer sockets are deep enough to protect from this kind of accident cee 71 sockets accept cee 74 cee 76 and cee 77 plugs without providing an earth connection the earthed cee 73 and cee 75 sockets were specifically designed not to

projecting earth pin this standard is also used in belgium poland the czech republic slovakia and some other countries although the plug is polarised cee 7 does not define the placement of the line and neutral and there is no universallyobserved standard however the czech standard recommends that the line wire be on the left side when facing the socket the french convention changed circa 2002 from nothing particular to if the earth pin was at the top then the line hole in the socket would be on the right looking at the socket  citation needed however the socket may not necessarily be installed with the earth pin at the top packaging in france of sockets is normally marked with correct connection of the cables polarised prefitted plugs on appliances are therefore connected with the brown line wire to the right pin and the blue neutral wire to the left the earth being connected to the contact at the top of the plug cee 72 and 74 plugs are not compatible with the cee 75 socket

which has national equivalents in most european countries as described in iec 60083 the europlug is not rewirable and must be supplied with a flexible cord because it is unpolarised it can be inserted in either direction into a socket so line and neutral are connected arbitrarily plugs and sockets are usually designed together with the contacts of the socket part designed to accept the specific pin diameter pin length and pin spacing of the mating plug part however there is no socket defined by en 50075 neither is there a socket specified in cee 7 to accept only 4 mm 0157 in pins or the profile of a europlug there are examples of sockets on the market which accept only such plugs sometimes in multiples but these meet no recognized standard instead of being designed with a matching socket the europlug was designed to be compatible with a range of sockets in common use throughout mainland europe these sockets including the cee 71 cee 73 germanschuko cee 75 french and most israeli swiss danish and italian sockets were designed to accept pins of various diameters mainly 48 mm but also 40 mm and 45 mm and are usually fed by final circuits with either 10 a or 16 a overcurrent protection devices 60 to improve contact with socket parts intended to receive pins having a diameter larger than 40 mm the europlug has two round slightly flexible pins which converge slightly towards their

variation for hospital equipment with a rectangular left pin which is used for life support equipment traditionally all danish sockets were equipped with a switch to prevent touching live pins when connectingdisconnecting the plug today sockets without switch are allowed but then it is a requirement that the sockets have a cavity to prevent touching the live pins the shape of the plugs generally makes it difficult to touch the pins when connectingdisconnecting since the early 1990s earthed sockets have been required in all new electric installations in denmark older sockets need not be

twopin unearthed socket the 16 a socket used to be referred to as per la forza motrice 65 for electromotive force see above or sometimes inappropriately industriale industrial or even calore old adaptor from forza to 2 × luce and 1 × forza the two standards were initially adopted because up to the second half of the 20th century in many regions of italy electricity was supplied by means of two separate consumer connections — one for powering illumination and one for other purposes — and these generally operated at different voltages typically 127 v single phase and 220 v single or split phase the electricity on the two supplies was separately metered was sold at different tariffs was taxed differently and was supplied through separate and different sockets 66 even though the two electric lines and respective tariffs were gradually unified beginning in the 1960s the official but purely theoretical date was the summer of 1974 67 many houses had dual wiring and two electricity meters for years thereafter in some zones of lazio the 127 v network was provided for lighting until 1999 the two gauges for plugs and sockets thus became a de facto standard which is now formalized under cei 2350 some older installations have sockets that are limited to either the 10 a or the 16 a style plug requiring the use of an adaptor if the other gauge needs to be connected numerous cross adaptors were used almost every appliance sold in italy nowadays is equipped with cee 77 germanfrench cee 716 or cee 717 plugs but the standard italian sockets will not accept the first and the third ones since the pins of the cee 77 and cee 717 plugs are thicker 48 mm than the italian ones 4 mm besides the pins are not sheathed and forcing them into a linear italian socket may cause electrocution
