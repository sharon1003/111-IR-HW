cobalt is found in the earths crust only in chemically combined form save for small deposits found in alloys of natural meteoric iron the free element produced by reductive smelting is a hard lustrous silvergray metal cobaltbased blue pigments  cobalt blue have been used since ancient times for jewelry and paints and to impart a distinctive blue tint to glass but the color was later thought by alchemists to be due to the known metal bismuth miners had long used the name kobold ore german for goblin ore for some of the bluepigment producing minerals they were so named because they were poor in known metals and gave poisonous arsenic containing fumes when smelted in 1735 such ores were found to be reducible to a new metal the first discovered since ancient times and this was ultimately named for the kobold today some types of cobalt are produced specifically from one of a number of metalliclustered ores such as for example cobaltite co as s  the element is however more usually produced as a byproduct of copper and nickel mining the copper belt in the democratic republic of the congo drc central african republic and zambia yields most of the global cobalt production the drc alone accounted for more than 50 of world production in 2016 123000 tonnes according to natural resources canada 4cobalt is primarily used in the manufacture of magnetic wearresistant and highstrength alloys the compounds cobalt silicate and cobalt ii aluminate co al 2 o 4 cobalt blue give a distinctive deep blue color to glass ceramics inks paints and varnishes cobalt occurs naturally as only one

gravity of 89 the curie temperature is 1115 °c 2039 °f 5 and the magnetic moment is 16–17 bohr magnetons per atom 6 cobalt has a relative permeability twothirds that of iron 7 metallic cobalt occurs as two crystallographic structures hcp and fcc the ideal transition temperature between the hcp and fcc structures is 450 °c 842 °f but in practice the energy difference between them is so small that random intergrowth of the two is common 8 9 10cobalt is a weakly reducing metal that is protected from oxidation by a passivating oxide film it is attacked by halogens and sulfur heating in oxygen produces co 3o 4 which loses oxygen at 900 °c 1650 °f to give the monoxide co o 11 the metal reacts with fluorine  f 2 at 520 k to give co f 3 with chlorine  cl 2  bromine  br 2 and iodine  i 2  producing equivalent binary halides it does not react with hydrogen gas  h 2 or nitrogen gas  n 2 even when heated but it does react with boron carbon phosphorus arsenic and sulfur 12 at ordinary temperatures it reacts slowly with mineral acids and very slowly with moist but not with dry air compounds see also category cobalt compounds common oxidation states of cobalt include 2 and 3 although compounds with oxidation states ranging from −3 to 5 are also known a common oxidation state for simple compounds is 2 cobalt ii these salts form the pinkcolored metal aquo complex co h 2 o 6 2 in water addition of chloride gives the intensely blue co cl 4 2− 3 in a borax bead flame test cobalt shows deep blue in both oxidizing and reducing flames 13oxygen and chalcogen compounds several oxides of cobalt are known green cobalt ii oxide co o has rocksalt structure it is readily oxidized with water and oxygen to brown cobalt iii hydroxide co oh 3  at temperatures of 600–700 °c co o oxidizes to the blue cobalt iiiii oxide co 3 o 4  which has a spinel structure 3 black cobalt iii oxide co 2 o 3 is also known 14 cobalt oxides are antiferromagnetic at low temperature co o  néel temperature 291 k and co 3 o 4 néel temperature 40 k which is analogous to magnetite fe 3 o 4  with a mixture of 2 and 3 oxidation states 15the principal chalcogenides of cobalt include the black cobalt ii sulfides co s 2 which adopts a pyrite like structure and cobalt iii sulfide co 2 s 3  halides cobalt ii chloride hexahydrate four dihalides of cobalt ii are known cobalt ii fluoride co f 2 pink cobalt ii chloride co cl 2 blue cobalt ii bromide co br 2 green cobalt ii iodide co i 2 blueblack these halides exist in anhydrous and hydrated forms whereas the anhydrous dichloride is blue the hydrate is red 16the reduction potential for the reaction co 3  e − → co 2 is 192 v beyond that for chlorine to chloride 136 v consequently cobalt iii and chloride would result in the cobalt iii being reduced to cobalt ii because the reduction potential for fluorine to fluoride is so high 287 v cobalt iii fluoride is one of the few simple stable cobalt iii compounds cobalt iii fluoride which is used in some fluorination reactions reacts vigorously with water 11coordination compounds as for all metals molecular compounds and polyatomic ions of cobalt are classified as coordination complexes that is molecules or ions that contain cobalt linked to several ligands the principles of electronegativity and hardness–softness of a series of ligands can be used to explain the usual oxidation state of cobalt for example co 3 complexes tend to have ammine ligands because phosphorus is softer than nitrogen phosphine ligands tend to feature the softer co 2 and co  an example being tris triphenylphosphinecobalt i chloride  p c 6 h 5 3 3 co cl the more electronegative and harder oxide and fluoride can stabilize co 4 and co 5 derivatives eg caesium hexafluorocobaltate cs 2 co f 6 and potassium percobaltate k 3 co o 4  11alfred werner a nobelprize winning pioneer in coordination chemistry worked with compounds of empirical formula co nh 3 6 cl 3 one of the isomers determined was cobalt iii hexammine chloride this coordination complex a typical wernertype complex consists of a central cobalt atom coordinated by six ammine orthogonal ligands and three chloride counteranions using chelating ethylenediamine ligands in place of ammonia gives tris ethylenediaminecobalt iii chloride  co en 3 cl 3  which was one of the first coordination complexes to be resolved into optical isomers the complex exists in the right and lefthanded forms of a threebladed propeller this complex was first isolated by werner as yellowgold needlelike crystals 17 18organometallic compounds

known 23isotopes main article isotopes of cobalt59 co is the only stable cobalt isotope and the only isotope that exists naturally on earth twentytwo radioisotopes have been characterized the most stable 60co has a halflife of 52714 years and 57 co has a halflife of 2718 days 56 co a halflife of 7727 days and 58 co a halflife of 7086 days all the other radioactive isotopes of cobalt have halflives shorter than 18 hours and in most cases shorter than 1 second this element also has 4 meta states all of which have halflives shorter than 15 minutes 24the isotopes of cobalt range in atomic weight from 50 u  50 co to 73 u  73 co the primary decay mode for isotopes with atomic mass unit values less than that of the most abundant stable isotope 59 co is electron capture and the primary mode of decay in isotopes with atomic mass greater than 59 atomic mass units is beta decay the primary decay products below 59 co are element 26  iron isotopes above that the decay products are element 28 nickel isotopes 24history early chinese blue and white porcelain manufactured c 1335cobalt compounds have been used for centuries to impart a rich blue color to glass glazes and ceramics cobalt has been detected in egyptian sculpture persian jewelry from the third millennium bc in the ruins of pompeii destroyed in 79 ad and in china dating from the tang dynasty 618–907 ad and the ming dynasty 1368–1644 ad 25cobalt has been used to color glass since the bronze age the excavation of the uluburun shipwreck yielded an ingot of blue glass cast during the 14th century bc 26 27 blue glass from egypt was either colored with copper iron or cobalt the oldest cobaltcolored glass is from the eighteenth dynasty of egypt 1550–1292 bc the source for the cobalt the egyptians used is not known 28 29the word cobalt is derived from the german kobalt from kobold meaning goblin a superstitious term used for the ore of cobalt by miners the first attempts to smelt those ores for copper or nickel failed yielding simply powder cobalt ii oxide instead because the primary ores of cobalt always contain arsenic smelting the ore oxidized the arsenic into the highly toxic and volatile arsenic oxide adding to the notoriety of the ore 30swedish chemist georg brandt 1694–1768 is credited with discovering cobalt circa 1735 showing it to be a previously unknown element different from bismuth and other traditional metals brandt called it a new semimetal 31 32 he showed that compounds of cobalt metal were the source of the blue color in glass which previously had been attributed to the bismuth found with cobalt cobalt became the first metal to be discovered since the prehistorical period all other known metals iron copper silver gold zinc mercury tin lead and bismuth had no recorded discoverers 33during the 19th century a significant part of the worlds production of cobalt blue a dye made with cobalt compounds and alumina and smalt  cobalt glass powdered for use for pigment purposes in ceramics and painting was carried out at the norwegian blaafarveværket 34 35 the first mines for the production of smalt in the 16th century were located in norway sweden saxony and hungary with the discovery of cobalt ore in new caledonia in 1864 the mining of cobalt in europe declined with the discovery of ore deposits in ontario canada in 1904 and the discovery of even larger deposits in the katanga province in the congo in 1914 the mining operations shifted again 30 when the shaba conflict started in 1978 the copper mines of katanga province nearly stopped production 36 37 the impact on the world cobalt economy from this conflict was smaller than expected cobalt is a rare metal the pigment is highly toxic and the industry had already established effective ways for recycling cobalt materials in some cases industry was able to change to cobaltfree alternatives 36 37in 1938 john livingood and glenn t seaborg discovered the radioisotope cobalt60 38 this isotope was famously used at columbia university in the 1950s to establish parity violation in radioactive beta decay 39 40after world war ii the us wanted to guarantee the supply of cobalt ore for military uses as the germans had been doing and prospected for cobalt within the u s border an adequate supply of the ore was found in idaho near blackbird canyon in the side of a mountain the firm calera mining company started production at the site 41occurrence the stable form of cobalt is produced in supernovas through the rprocess 42 it comprises 00029 of the earths crust free cobalt the native metal is not found on earth because of the oxygen in the atmosphere and the chlorine in the ocean both are abundant enough in the upper layers of the earths crust to prevent native metal cobalt from forming except as recently delivered in meteoric iron pure cobalt in native metal form is unknown on earth the element has a medium abundance but natural compounds of cobalt are numerous and all amounts of cobalt compounds are found in most rocks soil plants and animals in nature cobalt is frequently associated with nickel both are characteristic components of meteoric iron though cobalt is much less abundant in iron meteorites than nickel as with nickel cobalt in meteoric iron alloys may have been well enough protected from oxygen and moisture to remain as the free but alloyed metal 43 though neither element is seen in that form in the ancient terrestrial crust cobalt in compound form occurs in copper and nickel minerals it is the major metallic component that combines with sulfur and arsenic in the sulfidic cobaltite co as s safflorite co as 2  glaucodot  cofeas s and skutterudite co as 3 minerals 11 the mineral cattierite is similar to pyrite and occurs together with vaesite in the copper deposits of katanga province 44 when it reaches the atmosphere weathering occurs the sulfide minerals oxidize and form pink erythrite cobalt glance co 3 as o 4 2·8h 2o and spherocobaltite co co 3  45 46cobalt is also a constituent of tobacco smoke 47 the tobacco plant readily absorbs and accumulates heavy metals like cobalt from the surrounding soil in its leaves these are subsequently inhaled during tobacco smoking 48production cobalt ore world production trend see also cobalt extraction techniques the main ores of cobalt are cobaltite erythrite glaucodot and skutterudite see above but most cobalt is obtained by reducing the cobalt byproducts of nickel and copper mining and smelting 49 50since cobalt is generally produced as a byproduct the supply of cobalt depends to a great extent on the economic feasibility of copper and nickel mining in a given market demand for cobalt was projected to grow 6 in 2017 51several methods exist to separate cobalt from copper and nickel depending on the concentration of cobalt and the exact composition of the used ore one method is froth flotation in which surfactants bind to different ore components leading to an enrichment of cobalt ores subsequent roasting converts the ores to cobalt sulfate and the copper and the iron are oxidized to the oxide leaching with water extracts the sulfate together with the arsenates the residues are further leached with sulfuric acid yielding a solution of copper sulfate cobalt can also be leached from the slag of copper smelting 52the products of the abovementioned processes are transformed into the cobalt oxide co 3 o 4  this oxide is reduced to metal by the aluminothermic reaction or reduction with carbon in a blast furnace 11cobalt extraction the united states geological survey estimates world reserves of cobalt at 7100000 metric tons 53 the democratic republic of the congo drc currently produces 63 of the world’s cobalt this market share may reach 73 by 2025 if planned expansions by mining producers like glencore plc take place as expected but by 2030 global demand could be 47 times more than it was in 2017 bloomberg new energy finance has estimated 54changes that congo made to mining laws in 2002 led did attract investment in congolese copper and cobalt projects however glencore dominates the coltran market in drc its mutanda mine shipped 24500 tons of cobalt from its mutanda mine last year 40 of congo drc’s output and nearly a quarter of global production t glencore’s katanga mining project is resuming as well and should produce 300000 tons of copper and 20000 tons of cobalt by 2019 according to glencore 51democratic republic of the congo see also conflict minerals child labor and strip mining in 2005 the top producer of cobalt was the copper deposits in the democratic republic of the congo s katanga province formerly shaba province the area had almost 40 of global reserves reported the british geological survey in 2009 55 by 2015 drc supplied 60 of world cobalt production 32000 tons at 20000 to 26000 per ton recent growth in production could at least partly be due to how low mining production fell during drc congos very violent civil wars in the early 2000s or to the changes the country made to its mining code in 2002 to encourage foreign and multinational investment and which did bring in a number of investors including glencore three of its current congo projects artisanal mining supplied 10 to 25 of the drc production 56 some 100000 cobalt miners in congo drc use hand tools to dig hundreds of feet with little planning and fewer safety measures say workers and government and ngo officials as well as washington post reporters observations on visits to isolated mines the lack of safety precautions frequently causes injuries or death 57 mining pollutes the vicinity and exposes local wildlife and indigenous communities to toxic metals thought to cause birth defects and breathing difficulties according to health officials 58human rights activists have alleged and investigative journalism reported confirmation 59 60 that child labor is used in mining cobalt from african artisanal mines 56 61 this revelation prompted cell phone maker apple inc on march 3 2017 to stop buying ore from suppliers such as zhejiang huayou cobalt who source from artisanal mines in the drc and begin using only suppliers that are verified to meet its workplace standards 62 63the political and ethnic dynamics of the region have in the past caused horrific outbreaks of violence and years of armed conflict and displaced populations this instability affected the price of cobalt and also created perverse incentives for the combattants in the first and second congo wars to prolong the fighting since access to diamond mines and other valuable resources helped to finance their military goals—which frequently amounteed to genocide—and also enriched the fighters themselves while dr congo has in the 2010s not recently been invaded by neighboring military forces some of the richest mineral deposits adjoin areas where tutsis and hutus still frequently clash unrest continues although on a smaller scale and refugees still flee outbreaks of violence 64cobalt extracted from small congolese artisanal mining endeavors in 2007 supplied a single chinese company congo dong fang international mining a subsidiary of zhejiang huayou cobalt one of the world’s largest cobalt producers congo dong fang supplied cobalt to some of the world’s largest battery manufacturers who produced batteries for ubiquitous products like the apple i phones corporate pieties about an ethical supply chain were thus met with some incredulity a number of observers have called for tech corporations and other manufacturers to avoid sourcing conflict metals in central africa at all rather than risk enabling the financial exploitation human rights abuses like kidnappings for unfree labor environmental devastation and the human toll of violence poverty and toxic conditions the mukondo mountain project operated by the central african mining and exploration company camec in katanga province may be the richest cobalt reserve in the world it produced an estimated one third of the total global coval production in 2008 65 in july 2009 camec announced a longterm agreement to deliver its entire annual production of cobalt concentrate from mukondo mountain to zhejiang galico cobalt  nickel materials of china 66canada in 2017 some exploration companies were planning to survey old silver and cobalt mines in the area of cobalt ontario where significant deposits are believed to lie 67 the mayor of cobalt stated that the people of cobalt welcomed new mining endeavours and pointed out that the local work force is peaceful and englishspeaking and good infrastructure would allow much easier sourcing of spare parts for the equipment or other supplies than were to be found in conflictzones applications cobalt has been used in production of high performance alloys 49 50 it can also be used to make rechargeable batteries and the advent of electric vehicles and their success with consumers probably has a great deal to do with the drcs soaring production other important factors were the 2002 mining code which encouraged investment by foreign and transnational corporations such as glencore and the end of the first and second congo wars although outbr alloys cobaltbased superalloys have historically consumed most of the cobalt produced 49 50 the temperature stability of these alloys makes them suitable for turbine blades for gas turbines and jet aircraft engines although nickelbased single crystal alloys surpass them in performance 68 cobaltbased alloys are also corrosion and wearresistant making them like titanium useful for making orthopedic implants that dont wear down over time the development of wearresistant cobalt alloys started in the first decade of the 20th century with the stellite alloys containing chromium with varying quantities of tungsten and carbon alloys with chromium and tungsten carbides are very hard and wearresistant 69 special cobaltchromium molybdenum alloys like vitallium are used for prosthetic parts hip and knee replacements 70 cobalt alloys are also used for dental prosthetics as a useful substitute for nickel which may be allergenic 71 some high speed steels also contain cobalt for increased heat and wearresistance the special alloys of aluminium nickel cobalt and iron known as alnico and of samarium and cobalt  samariumcobalt magnet are used in permanent magnets 72 it is also alloyed with 95 platinum for jewelry yielding an alloy suitable for fine casting which is also slightly magnetic 73batteries lithium cobalt oxide li co o 2 is widely used in lithium ion battery cathodes the material is composed of cobalt oxide layers with the lithium intercalated during discharge  clarification needed the lithium is released as lithium ions 74 nickelcadmium 75 ni cd and nickel metal hydride 76 ni mh batteries also include cobalt to improve the oxidation of nickel in the battery 75 transparency market research estimated the global lithiumion battery market at 30 billion in 2015 and predicted an increase to over us75 billion by 2024 77although in 2018 most cobalt in batteries was used in a mobile device 78 a more recent application for cobalt is rechargeable batteries for electric cars this industry has increased fivefold in its demand for cobalt which makes it urgent to find new raw materials in more stable areas of the world 79 demand is expected to continue or increase as the prevalence of electric vehicles increases 80 exploration in 2016–2017 included the area around cobalt ontario an area where many silver mines ceased operation decades ago 79since child and slave labor have been repeatedly reported in coltan mining primarily in the artisanal mines of dr congo tech companies seeking an ethical supply chain have faced shortages of this raw material and 81 the price of cobalt metal reached a nineyear high in october 2017 more than us30 a pound versus us10 in late 2015 82catalysts several cobalt compounds are oxidation catalysts cobalt acetate is used to convert xylene to terephthalic acid the precursor of the bulk polymer polyethylene terephthalate typical catalysts are the cobalt carboxylates known as cobalt soaps they are also used in paints varnishes and inks as drying agents through the oxidation of drying oils 74 the same carboxylates are used to improve the adhesion between steel and rubber in steelbelted radial tires cobaltbased catalysts are used in reactions involving carbon monoxide cobalt is also a catalyst in the fischer–tropsch process for the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide into liquid fuels 83 hydroformylation of alkenes often uses cobalt octacarbonyl as a catalyst 84 although it is often replaced by more efficient iridium and rhodiumbased catalysts eg the cativa process the hydrodesulfurization of petroleum uses a catalyst derived from cobalt and molybdenum this process helps to clean petroleum of sulfur impurities that interfere with the refining of liquid fuels 74pigments and coloring cobalt blue glass cobaltcolored glass before the 19th century cobalt was predominantly used as a pigment it has been used since the middle ages to make smalt a bluecolored glass smalt is produced by melting a mixture of roasted mineral smaltite quartz and potassium carbonate which yields a dark blue silicate glass which is finely ground after the production 85 smalt was widely used to color glass and as pigment for paintings 86 in 1780 sven rinman discovered cobalt green and in 1802 louis jacques thénard discovered cobalt blue 87 cobalt pigments such as cobalt blue cobalt aluminate cerulean blue cobalt ii stannate various hues of cobalt green a mixture of cobalt ii oxide and zinc oxide  and cobalt violet  cobalt phosphate are used as artists pigments because of their superior chromatic stability 88 89 aureolin cobalt yellow is now largely replaced by more lightfast  clarification needed yellow pigments radioisotopes cobalt60 co60 or 60 co is useful as a gamma ray source because they can be produced in predictable quantity and high activity by bombarding cobalt with neutrons it produces two gamma rays with energies of 117 and 133 me v 24 90cobalt is used in external beam radiotherapy sterilization of medical supplies and medical waste radiation treatment of foods for sterilization cold pasteurization  91 industrial radiography eg weld integrity radiographs density measurements eg concrete density measurements and tank fill height switches the metal has the unfortunate property of producing a fine dust causing problems with radiation protection cobalt from radiotherapy machines has been a serious hazard when not discarded properly and one of the worst radiation contamination accidents in north america occurred in 1984 when a discarded radiotherapy unit containing cobalt60 was mistakenly disassembled in a junkyard in juarez mexico 92 93cobalt60 has a radioactive halflife of 527 years loss of potency requires periodic replacement of the source in radiotherapy and is one reason why cobalt machines have been largely replaced by linear accelerators in modern radiation therapy 94 cobalt57 co57 or 57 co is a cobalt radioisotope most often used in medical tests as a radiolabel for vitamin b 12 uptake and for the schilling test cobalt57 is used as a source in mössbauer spectroscopy and is one of several possible sources in xray fluorescence devices 95 96nuclear weapon designs could intentionally incorporate 59 co some of which would be activated in a nuclear explosion to produce 60 co the 60 co dispersed as nuclear fallout is sometimes called a cobalt bomb 97other uses cobalt is used in electroplating for its attractive appearance hardness and resistance to oxidation 98it is also used as a base primer coat for porcelain enamels 99biological role cobalamin cobalt deficient sheep cobalt is essential to the metabolism of all animals it is a key constituent of cobalamin also known as vitamin b 12 the primary biological reservoir of cobalt as an ultratrace element 100 101 bacteria in the stomachs of ruminant animals convert cobalt salts into vitamin b 12 a compound which can only be produced by bacteria or archaea a minimal presence of cobalt in soils therefore markedly improves the health of grazing animals and an uptake of 020 mgkg a day is recommended because they have no other source of vitamin b 12 102in the early 20th century during the development of farming on the north island volcanic plateau of new zealand cattle suffered from what was termed bush sickness it was discovered that the volcanic soils lacked the cobalt salts essential for the cattle food chain 103 104the coast disease of sheep in the ninety mile desert of the southeast of south australia in the 1930s was found to originate in nutritional deficiencies of trace elements cobalt and copper the cobalt deficiency was overcome by the development of cobalt bullets dense pellets of cobalt oxide mixed with clay given orally for lodging in the animals rumen  clarification needed 105 104proteins based on cobalamin use corrin to hold the cobalt coenzyme b 12 features a reactive cco bond that

eg those of zinc and iron other cobaltoproteins are known besides b 12 these proteins include methionine aminopeptidase 2 an enzyme that occurs in humans and other mammals that does not use the corrin ring of b 12 but binds cobalt directly another noncorrin cobalt enzyme is nitrile hydratase an enzyme in bacteria that metabolizes nitriles 108precautions main article cobalt poisoning cobalt is an essential element for life in minute amounts the ld 50 value for soluble cobalt salts has been estimated to be between 150 and 500 mgkg 109 in the us the occupational safety and health administration
