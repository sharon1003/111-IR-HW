skeleton armadillos are new world placental mammals in the order cingulata with a leathery armour shell the chlamyphoridae and dasypodidae are the only surviving families in the order which is part of the superorder xenarthra along with the anteaters and sloths the word armadillo means little armoured one in spanish the aztecs called them āyōtōchtli aːjoːˈtoːt͡ʃt͡ɬi nahuatl for turtlerabbit āyōtl ˈaːjoːt͡ɬ turtle and tōchtli ˈtoːt͡ʃt͡ɬi rabbit 1 the portuguese word for armadillo is tatu which derives from the tupi language 2 similar names are also found in other especially european languages about nine extant genera and 21 extant species of armadillo have been described some of which are distinguished by the number of bands on their armour their average length is about 75 cm 30 in including tail the giant armadillo grows up to 150 cm 59 in and weighs up to 54 kg 119 lb while the pink fairy armadillo is a diminutive species with an overall length of 13–15 cm 5–6 in all species are native to the americas where they inhabit a variety of different environments recent genetic research suggests that an extinct group of giant armoured mammals the glyptodonts should be included within the lineage of armadillos having diverged some 35 million years ago much more recently than previously assumed 3contents  hide 1 history and distribution2 habitat and anatomy3 classification4 armadillos and humans41 in science42 as musical instruments5 references6 further reading7 external links history and distribution  editlike all of the xenarthra lineages armadillos originated in south america due to the continents former isolation they were confined there for most of the cenozoic the recent formation of the isthmus of panama allowed a few members of the family to migrate northward into southern north america by the early pleistocene as part of the great american interchange 4 some of their much larger cingulate relatives the pampatheres and chlamyphorid glyptodonts made the same journey 4today all extant armadillo species are still present in south america they are particularly diverse in paraguay where 11 species exist and surrounding areas many species are endangered some including four species of dasypus are widely distributed over the americas whereas others such as yepess mulita are restricted to small ranges two species the northern nakedtailed armadillo and ninebanded armadillo are found in central america the latter has also reached the united states primarily in the southcentral states notably texas but with a range that extends as far east as south carolina and florida and as far north as nebraska and central indiana 5 their range has consistently expanded in north america over the last century due to a lack of natural predators habitat and anatomy  editarmadillos are small to mediumsized mammals the smallest species the pink fairy armadillo is roughly chipmunk sized at 85 g 30 oz and 13–15 cm 51–59 in in total length the largest species the giant armadillo can be the size of a small pig and weigh up to 54 kg 119 lb and can be 150 cm 59 in long 6 they are prolific diggers many species use their sharp claws to dig for food such as grubs and to dig dens the ninebanded armadillo prefers to build burrows in moist soil near the creeks streams and arroyos around which it lives and feeds the diets of different armadillo species vary but consist mainly of insects grubs and other invertebrates some species however feed almost entirely on ants and termites paws of a hairy and a giant armadillo in common with other xenarthrans armadillos in general have low body temperatures of 33–36 °c 91–97 °f and low basal metabolic rates 40–60 of that expected in placental mammals of their mass this is particularly true of types that specialize in using termites as their primary food source for example priodontes and tolypeutes  7the armour is formed by plates of dermal bone covered in relatively small overlapping epidermal scales called  scutes  composed of bone with a covering of horn most species have rigid shields over the shoulders and hips with a number of bands separated by flexible skin covering the back and flanks additional armour covers the top of the head the upper parts of the limbs and the tail the underside of the animal is never armoured and is simply covered with soft skin and fur 8this armourlike skin appears to be the main defense of many armadillos although most escape predators by fleeing often into thorny patches from which their armour protects them or digging to safety only the south american threebanded armadillos  tolypeutes rely heavily on their armour for protection when threatened by a predator tolypeutes species frequently roll up into a ball other armadillo species cannot roll up because they have too many plates the north american ninebanded armadillo tends to jump straight in the air when surprised so consequently often collides with the undercarriage or fenders of passing vehicles 9armadillos have short legs but can move quite quickly the ninebanded armadillo is noted for its movement through water 10 which is accomplished via two different methods it can walk underwater for short distances holding its breath for as long as six minutes also to cross larger bodies of water it is capable of increasing its buoyancy by swallowing air inflating its stomach and intestines 11armadillos have very poor eyesight and use their keen sense of smell to hunt for food 6 they use their claws for digging and finding food as well as for making their homes in burrows they dig their burrows with their claws making only a single corridor the width of the animals body they have five clawed toes on their hind feet and three to five toes with heavy digging claws on their fore feet armadillos have a large number of cheek teeth which are not divided into premolars and molars but usually have no incisors or canines the dentition of the ninebanded armadillo is p 77 m 11  32 12gestation lasts from 60 to 120 days depending on species although the ninebanded armadillo also exhibits delayed implantation so the young are not typically born for eight months after mating most members of the genus dasypus give birth to four monozygotic young that is identical quadruplets 13 but other species may have typical litter sizes that range from one to eight the young are born with soft leathery skin which hardens within a few weeks they reach sexual maturity in three to 12 months depending on the species armadillos are solitary animals that do not share their burrows with other adults 8classification  editpink fairy armadillo family dasypodidae subfamily dasypodinae genus dasypus1658 woodcut of an armadillo ninebanded armadillo or longnosed armadillo dasypus

rabbits and mice on their footpads are among the few known species that can contract the disease systemically they are particularly susceptible due to their unusually low body temperature which is hospitable to the leprosy bacterium mycobacterium leprae the leprosy bacterium is difficult to culture and armadillos have a body temperature of 34 °c 93 °f similar to human skin 15 humans can acquire a leprosy infection from armadillos by handling them or consuming armadillo meat 16 armadillos are a presumed vector and natural reservoir for the disease in texas and louisiana and florida 17 18 prior to the arrival of europeans in the late 15th century leprosy was unknown in the new world given that armadillos are native to the new world at some point they must have acquired the disease from oldworld humans 16 18the armadillo is also a natural reservoir for chagas disease 19the ninebanded armadillo also serves science through its unusual reproductive system in which four genetically identical offspring are born the result of one original egg 20 21 22 because they are always genetically identical the group of four young provides a good subject for scientific behavioral or medical tests that need consistent biological and genetic makeup in the test subjects this is the only reliable manifestation of polyembryony in the class mammalia and exists only within the genus dasypus and not in all armadillos as is commonly believed other species that display this trait include parasitoid wasps certain flatworms and various aquatic invertebrates 21armadillos mainly dasypus are common roadkill due to their habit of jumping 3–4 ft vertically when startled which puts them into collision with the underside of vehicles wildlife enthusiasts are using the northward march of the armadillo as an opportunity to educate others about the animals which can be a burrowing nuisance to property owners and managers 20as musical instruments  editmain article charango armadillo shells have
