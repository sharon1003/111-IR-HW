disbelief if youre not you might feel fear or disappointment not to mention utter confusion if you know theres no way you could be pregnant the fact is though many women automatically think of pregnancy anytime they miss a period it could be that — or one of many other possibilities heres a rundown of the 11 most common reasons for a late period pregnancy stress illness weight excessive exercise change in schedule breastfeeding medication hormonal imbalance thyroid disorder perimenopause pregnancy sometimes a late period means exactly what you think youre pregnant because early pregnancy symptoms like cramping bloating nausea spotting fatigue breast tenderness and even aversion to certain foods are similar to what you may experience in the days before menstruation it can be difficult to tell if your cycle is simply off by a few days or youre pregnant consider this athome pregnancy test the fastest and easiest way to find out if pregnancy is the cause of your missed period is to take an athome pregnancy test these tests detect human chorionic gonadotropin better known as h cg the hormone released during pregnancy in your urine these tests are most reliable the day after your missed period but some tests can detect a pregnancy up to 5 days before you’ve missed your period stress you already know stress can have a number of unpleasant side effects like headaches weight gain and acne — and it can also affect your menstrual cycle when youre under physical or emotional stress your body produces the stress hormones adrenaline and cortisol elevated levels force the brain to decide which bodily functions are essential and which are nonessential until the anxietyinducing event is over things like blood flow to the muscles and oxygen to the lungs increase part of the “fightorflight” response youve likely heard of while others like digestion and the reproductive system may stop temporarily in extreme cases when the reproductive cycle is delayed so is your period illness think back to the time you should have ovulated if you were sick whether with a simple cold or something more serious the stress could have put your body into that “which function is most important” phase mentioned above so ovulation could have happened later than usual or not at all meaning your period will also be late or nonexistent if illness around the time of ovulation is what caused you to be irregular aunt flo will likely return once things are back to normal weight your weight can affect your hypothalamus a gland in your brain responsible for regulating various processes in the body — including your menstrual cycle extreme weight loss a low caloric intake or being very underweight stresses the hypothalamus and your body wont release the estrogen needed to build the lining of the uterus the same happens with eating disorders like bulimia and anorexia which also cause estrogen levels to dip too low on the other hand being overweight or gaining a lot in a short amount of time can cause your body to produce too much estrogen the overload may cause you to go for months without ovulating or cause the endometrial lining to overgrow and become unstable resulting in heavy irregular or missed periods usually gaining weight if youre underweight or losing if youre overweight should help your periods to return to normal excessive exercise of course working out is good for you however when you overdo it and possibly also restrict meals to lose weight your body doesnt produce enough estrogen to complete the menstrual cycle some women — such as ballet dancers gymnasts and professional athletes — are at greater risk for amenorrhea missing a period for three or more months in a row but you dont have to be a pro for exercise to mess with your system working out excessively without taking in enough calories can cause disruptions some signs that youre overdoing it include extreme or rapid weight loss decreased physical performance or forcing yourself to work out through injury illness or severe weather slowing down a bit and gaining a little weight if needed should get things back on track change in schedule believe it or not switching things up — for instance working the night shift instead of the day or vice versa or travelling across the country — can throw off your body clock which regulates your hormones sometimes this results in a missed or late period but it should return when your body gets used to the change or your schedule goes back to normal breastfeeding if youre breastfeeding you may not see your period for some time since prolactin — the hormone responsible for breast milk production — also suppresses ovulation many moms dont have a period for months or at all while breastfeeding but a lapse in your cycle doesnt mean you cant get pregnant remember ovulation occurs before you get your period its possible for you to ovulate and then get pregnant before you ever see your period so if you dont want backtoback babies use protection your period should return within about six to eight weeks after weaning your child if you havent gotten it three months after you stop breastfeeding talk to your doctor medication probably the most common medication to cause menstrual changes is birth control hormonal contraceptives such as the pill or patch work by stopping the body from ovulating — and no ovulation means no period but what about that monthly bleeding you have while using one of these methods what youre really experiencing is withdrawal bleeding a “fake” period caused by the drop in hormones when you take the placebo pills in your pack or go patchfree during the fourth week of your cycle sometimes though the birth control suppresses the hormones so much that you have very light bleeding or no period at all during that week off and some pills are even designed to stop your period for a longer amount of time three months or more other hormonal birth controls such as the depoprovera shot or the mirena iud thin the lining of the uterus to such a degree that there may be no lining to shed monthly emergency contraception or the “morning after pill” can also affect when or if you ovulate so if youve taken it recently you may experience a late or skipped period bring this up with your doctor some other medications that can cause you to be irregular are antidepressants some antipsychotics corticosteroids and chemotherapy drugs if youve recently gone off the pill in the hopes of getting pregnant you may notice that it takes a month or so for your cycle to regulate itself — in which case a skipped period might just be your system getting back on track if youre not sure whether it means youre expecting visit your doctor hormonal imbalance polycystic ovarian syndrome pcos is a condition where the female sex hormones are out of balance it can cause cysts on the ovaries and prevent ovulation from occurring regularly in addition to missed or irregular periods pcos can also cause excess hair growth acne weight gain and possibly infertility your doctor can do a blood test to check your hormone levels if you think pcos may be the reason for your menstruation problems if pcos is the cause your doctor may recommend birth control to regulate your periods thyroid disorder when the thyroid the gland responsible for your bodys metabolism doesnt
