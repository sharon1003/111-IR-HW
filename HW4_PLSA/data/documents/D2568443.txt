moms can be deadbeats too published august 09 2002 fox news facebook twitter email single dads are sick and tired of being labeled deadbeats when it comes to paying child support and data suggest they have good reason to be upset advertisementthe percentage of deadbeat moms is actually higher than that of dads who wont pay even though mothers are more consistently awarded custody of children by the courts census figures show only 57 percent of moms required to pay child support  385000 women out of a total of 674000  give up some or all of the money they owe that leaves some 289000 deadbeat mothers out there a fact that has barely been reported in the media that compares with 68 percent of dads who pay up according to the figures men who are due child support are also getting tired of deadbeat moms excuse that they cant pony up the money and some courts have responded california lawyer eudene eunique in february was denied a passport because she was 30000 behind in childsupport instead of spending money on visiting her family in mexico and on business contracts the appeals court ruled eunique’s money should go to her kids meanwhile warrant officers in southwest florida earlier this summer dubbed an effort to list the area’s top deadbeat moms who owed up to 19000 in support as operation father’s day included on the list were trudi dana 43 who owes 19001 and 29yearold mary mahadie friar who owes 16493 of course the problem of deadbeat dads remains a serious one many more men than women have to pay child support making the overall number of deadbeat dads much greater the statistics show 43 million moms out of 63 million who are supposed to receive child support actually get it that leaves the alarming figure of about 2 million deadbeat dads putting them more in the media spotlight than deadbeat moms but men also still pay much more in child support the census bureau last month also released numbers showing fathers paid an average of 3000 to custodial moms in 1997 women paid little over half that moms also get about 60 percent of what they are owed whereas dads only get 48 percent not only are the dads paying up more when they don’t have custody but when the court does hand the kids over to dads they work more than moms who have custody while 7 percent of custodial moms work more than 44 hours a week 245 percent of single custodial dads work more than 44 hours and only about half as many custodial dads get government help than moms some dads say it’s not for a lack of laws that moms are getting away with not paying up bill henry is head of dads against discrimination of west virginia and a single dad in 1983 his first ex was ordered by the court to pay 25 a month in child support – which he did not start actually receiving until 1987 – even though the state minimum then should have been 75 a month henry said dads are often discouraged from pursuing custody battles by attorneys and often don’t like to make waves in the system as long as they get to regularly see their child or get complete custody a lot of men are afraid to ask for child support simply because they think if they’re asking for child support they won’t get a chance to get custody henry said california dad scott downing has also experienced childsupport snafus and said courts continue to give dads the short end of the custody stick the laws are there but it’s the way the courts interpret those laws he said single dad david wood of north carolina has similar concerns my frustration … is not so much there’s any biases in me getting child support … it’s just the whole system needs a lot of work if you don’t get aggressive with it … you have to really work to get it if someone doesn’t want to play the game and pay up wood whose exwife has had trouble in court said there are four men he knows of just at his workplace who are currently or are going to be single dads or are grandparents of kids who had deadbeat moms it’s not the exception anymore wood said adding that before he became a single dad two years ago i would have almost bought into that stereotype the dads are usually the deadbeats but that philosophy is just 3040 years out of date but more moms that don’t have the kids simply can’t afford to pay child support since they are poorer said geraldine jensen president of the association for children for enforcement of support studies show the average income for noncustodial moms is only 15000 a year whereas noncustodial dads average about 40000 a year and moms who don’t have custody of the kids often remarry and have more kids and often choose to not work but that’s certainly no excuse jensen said it doesn’t matter if you’re a mom or dad you should meet your child support obligations
