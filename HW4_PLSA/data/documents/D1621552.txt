evidence indicating a fetuss ability to respond to auditory stimuli research at zhejiang university china indicates that fetuses of 33–41 weeks gestational age can not only hear but also distinguish their mothers voices from others 1 2 see also a uk study on childs hearing and listening in the womb 3 and uk material on how babies develop hearing 4prenatal pain  editpregnancy timeline the hypothesis that human fetuses are capable of perceiving pain in the first trimester is not supported by science the scientific consensus is that a fetus is not capable of feeling pain until the third trimester 5 6 7 which begins at about 27 weeks of pregnancy in march 2010 the royal college of obstetricians and gynecologists submitted a report 8 concluding that current research shows that the sensory structures are not developed or specialized enough to respond to pain in a fetus of less than 24 weeks pg 22 the neural regions and pathways that are responsible for pain experience remain under debate but it is generally accepted that pain from physical trauma requires an intact pathway from the periphery through the spinal cord into the thalamus and on to regions of the cerebral cortex including the primary sensory cortex s1 the insular cortex and the anterior cingulated cortex34 fetal pain is not possible before these necessary neural pathways and structures figure 1 have developed pg 3the report specifically identified the anterior cingulate as the area of the cerebral cortex responsible for pain processing the anterior cingulate is part of the cerebral cortex which begins to develop in the fetus at week 26  citation neededresearchers from the university of california san francisco in the journal of the american medical association concluded in a metaanalysis of data from dozens of medical reports and studies that fetuses are unlikely to feel pain until the third trimester of pregnancy 6 9 there is a consensus among developmental neurobiologists that the establishment of thalamocortical connections at weeks 2234 reliably at 29 is a critical event with regard to fetal perception of pain as they allow peripheral sensory information to arrive at the cortex 10electroencephalography indicates that the capacity for functional pain perception in premature infants does not exist before 29 or 30 weeks a 2005 metaanalysis states that withdrawal reflexes and changes in heart rates and hormone levels in response to invasive procedures are reflexes that do not indicate fetal pain 6also in 2005 david mellor and colleagues reviewed several lines of evidence that suggested a fetus does not awaken during its time in the womb mellor notes that much of the literature on fetal pain simply extrapolates from findings and research on premature babies he questions the value of such data systematic studies of fetal neurological function suggest however that there are major differences in the in utero environment and fetal neural state that make it likely that this assumption is substantially incorrect he and his team detected the presence of such chemicals as adenosine pregnanolone and prostaglandin d 2 in both human and animal fetuses indicating that the fetus is both sedated and anesthetized when in the womb these chemicals are oxidized with the newborns first few breaths and washed out of the tissues allowing consciousness to occur if the fetus is asleep throughout gestation then the possibility of fetal pain is greatly minimized 11 a fetus mellor told the new york times is not a baby who just hasn’t been born yet 12 nonetheless recent studies show that the neuromediators supposed to anesthetise the fetus in the womb can give just a slight sedation as their levels in some cases overlap those in adults blood 13fetal anesthesia  editdirect fetal analgesia is used in only a minority of prenatal surgeries 14some caution that unnecessary use of fetal anesthetic may pose potential health risks to the mother in the context of abortion fetal analgesia would be used solely for beneficence toward the fetus assuming fetal pain exists this interest must be considered in concert with maternal safety and fetal effectiveness of any proposed anesthetic or analgesic technique for instance general anesthesia increases abortion morbidity and mortality for women and substantially increases the cost of abortion although placental transfer of many opioids and sedativehypnotics has been determined the maternal dose required for fetal analgesia is unknown as is the safety for women at such doses 6anesthesia researcher laura myers has suggested that fetal pain legislation may make abortions harder to obtain because abortion clinics lack the equipment and expertise to supply fetal anesthesia currently anesthesia is administered directly to fetuses only while they are undergoing surgery 15wendy savage press officer of doctors for a woman’s choice on abortion pointed out that the majority of surgical abortions in britain are already performed under general anesthesia which also affects the fetus in a letter to the british medical journal in april 1997 she wrote that peter mc cullagh and p j saunders link the theoretical possibility that the fetus may feel pain albeit much earlier than most embryologists and physiologists consider likely with the procedure of legal abortion doctors for a womans choice on abortion consider this to be unhelpful to women and to the scientific debate 16 17 in a letter to the editor glover and fisk have stated that a further indication of acute stress in fetuses is blood flow redistribution to the brain as shown by doppler studies of human fetuses from 18 weeks undergoing invasive procedures 18united states legislation  editfederal legislation  editin 2013 during the 113th congress representative trent franks introduced a bill called the  paincapable unborn child protection act  h r 1797 it passed in the house on june 18 2013 and was received in the u s senate read twice and referred to the judiciary committee 19in 2004 during the 108th congress senator sam brownback introduced a bill called the  unborn child pain awareness act  for the stated purpose of ensur ing that women seeking an abortion are fully informed regarding the pain experienced by their unborn child  which was read twice and referred to committee 20 21state legislation  editsubsequently 25 states have examined similar legislation related to fetal pain andor fetal anesthesia 15 and in 2010 nebraska banned abortions after 20 weeks on the basis of fetal pain 22 eight states – arkansas georgia louisiana minnesota oklahoma alaska south dakota and texas – have passed laws which introduced information on fetal pain in their stateissued abortioncounseling literature which one opponent of these laws the guttmacher institute founded by planned parenthood has called generally irrelevant and not in line with the current medical literature 23dr arthur caplan director of the center for bioethics at the university of pennsylvania said laws such as these reduce the process of informed consent to the reading of a fixed script created and mandated by
