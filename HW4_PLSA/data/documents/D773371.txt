fiorinal with codeine add info fiorinal with codeine recall get an alert when a recall is issued ask a question questions  answers add info side effects  adverse reactions death related to ultrarapid metabolism of codeine to morphine respiratory depression and death have occurred in children who received codeine in the postoperative period following tonsillectomy andor adenoidectomy and had evidence of being ultrarapid metabolizers of codeine ie multiple copies of the gene for cytochrome p450 isoenzyme 2d6 or high morphine concentrations deaths have also occurred in nursing infants who were exposed to high levels of morphine in breast milk because their mothers were ultrarapid metabolizers of codeine some individuals may be ultrarapid metabolizers because of a specific cyp2d6 genotype gene duplications denoted as 11x n or 12x n the prevalence of this cyp2d6 phenotype varies widely and has been estimated at 05 to 1 in chinese and japanese 05 to 1 in hispanics 1 to 10 in caucasians 3 in african americans and 16 to 28 in north africans ethiopians and arabs data are not available for other ethnic groups these individuals convert codeine into its active metabolite morphine more rapidly and completely than other people this rapid conversion results in higher than expected serum morphine levels even at labeled dosage regimens individuals who are ultrarapid metabolizers may have lifethreatening or fatal respiratory depression or experience signs of overdose such as extreme sleepiness confusion or shallow breathing children with obstructive sleep apnea who are treated with codeine for posttonsillectomy andor adenoidectomy pain may be particularly sensitive to the respiratory depressant effects of codeine that has been rapidly metabolized to morphine fiorinal with codeine is contraindicated for postoperative pain management in all pediatric patients undergoing tonsillectomy andor adenoidectomy  see contraindications  when prescribing fiorinal with codeine healthcare providers should choose the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time and inform patients and caregivers about these risks and the signs of morphine overdose therapeutic doses of aspirin can cause anaphylactic shock and other severe allergic reactions it should be ascertained if the patient is allergic to aspirin although a specific history of allergy may be lacking significant bleeding can result from aspirin therapy in patients with peptic ulcer or other gastrointestinal lesions and in patients with bleeding disorders aspirin administered preoperatively may prolong the bleeding time in the presence of head injury or other intracranial lesions the respiratory depressant effects of codeine and other narcotics may be markedly enhanced as well as their capacity for elevating cerebrospinal fluid pressure narcotics also produce other cns depressant effects such as drowsiness that may further obscure the clinical course of patients with head injuries codeine or other narcotics may obscure signs on which to judge the diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions butalbital and codeine are both habitforming and potentially abusable consequently the extended use of fiorinal with codeine is not recommended results from epidemiologic studies indicate an association between aspirin and reye’s syndrome caution should be used

derived from 2 multiclinic trials that compared patients with tension headache randomly assigned to 4 parallel treatments fiorinal with codeine codeine fiorinal butalbital aspirin and caffeine capsules usp and placebo response was assessed over the course of the first 4 hours of each of 2 distinct headaches separated by at least 24 hours fiorinal with codeine proved statistically significantly superior to each of its components fiorinal codeine and to placebo on measures of pain relief evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of fiorinal with codeine in the treatment of multiple recurrent headaches is unavailable caution in this regard is required because codeine and butalbital are habitforming and potentially abusable common uses for this drug number of users
