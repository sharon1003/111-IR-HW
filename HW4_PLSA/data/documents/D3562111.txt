all my reviews well the only reason that people are hating on this show so much is the fact that they continue to compare it to the likes of family guy and possibly american dad this show isnt bad it is entertaining and the humour is smart as a fan of seth mcfarlane i knew i would enjoy the show anyway yes the family structure is the same as family guy and american dad and may lack some ambition but needless to say i dont laugh at much shows these days buy this manages to squeeze quite a few giggles out of me no its not better than family guy but if people watched it with an open mind and stopped comparing it i reckon it would be enjoyed a lot more than what it is16 of 26 people found this review helpful was this review helpful to you yes no report this review this title  see all 97
