2823obama remembers kings legacy by washington post staff august 28 2013president obama delivered the following remarks at the “let freedom ring” ceremony to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the march on washington on aug 28 2013 at the lincoln memorial president barack obama to the king family who have sacrificed and inspired so much to president clinton president carter vice president biden jill fellow americans five decades ago today americans came to this honored place to lay claim to a promise made at our founding we hold these truths to be selfevident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness in 1963 almost 200 years after those words were set to paper a full century after a great war was fought and emancipation proclaimed that promise those truths remained unmet and so they came by the thousands from every corner of our country  men and women young and old blacks who longed for freedom and whites who could no longer accept freedom for themselves while witnessing the subjugation of others across the land congregations sent them off with food and with prayer in the middle of the night entire blocks of harlem came out to wish them well000copy commemorating the 50th anniversary of the march on washington view photos thousands attended the event on the mall where president obama and others spoke with the few dollars they scrimped from their labor some bought tickets and boarded buses even if they couldnt always sit where they wanted to sit those with less money hitchhiked or walked they were seamstresses and steelworkers and students and teachers maids and pullman porters they shared simple meals and bunked together on floors and then on a hot summer day they assembled here in our nations capital under the shadow of the great emancipator to offer testimony of injustice to petition their government for redress and to awaken americas longslumbering conscience we rightly and best remember dr kings soaring oratory that day how he gave mighty voice to the quiet hopes of millions how he offered a salvation path for oppressed and oppressors alike his words belong to the ages possessing a power and prophecy unmatched in our time but we would do well to recall that day itself also belonged to those ordinary people whose names never appeared in the history books never got on tv many had gone to segregated schools and sat at segregated lunch counters had lived in towns where they couldnt vote in cities where their votes didnt matter there were couples in love who couldnt marry soldiers who fought for freedom abroad that they found denied to them at home they had seen loved ones beaten and children fire hosed and they had every reason to lash out in anger or resign themselves to a bitter fate and yet they chose a different path in the face of hatred they prayed for their tormentors in the face of violence they stood up and sat in with the moral force of nonviolence willingly they went to jail to protest unjust laws their cells swelling with the sound of freedom songs a lifetime of indignities had taught them that no man can take away the dignity and grace that god grants us they had learned through hard experience what frederick douglas once taught that freedom is not given it must be won through struggle and discipline persistence and faith that was the spirit they brought here that day that was the spirit young people like john lewis brought that day that was the spirit that they carried with them like a torch back to their cities and their neighborhoods that steady flame of conscience and courage that would sustain them through the campaigns to come through boycotts and voter registration drives and smaller marches far from the spotlight through the loss of four little girls in birmingham the carnage of edmund pettus bridge and the agony of dallas california memphis through setbacks and heartbreaks and gnawing doubt that flame of justice flickered and never died and because they kept marching america changed because they marched the civil rights law was passed because they marched the voting rights law was signed because they marched doors of opportunity and education swung open so their daughters and sons could finally imagine a life for themselves beyond washing somebody elses laundry or shining somebody elses shoes applause because they marched city councils changed and state legislatures changed and congress changed and yes eventually the white house changed cheers applause because they marched america became more free and more fair not just for africanamericans but for women and latinos asians and native americans for catholics jews and muslims for gays for americans with disabilities america changed for you and for me and the entire world drew strength from that example whether it be young people who watched from the other side of an iron curtain and would eventually tear down that wall or the young people inside south africa who would eventually end the scourge of apartheid applause those are the victories they won with iron wills and hope in their hearts that is the transformation that they wrought with each step of their wellworn shoes thats the depth that i and millions of americans owe those maids those laborers those porters those secretaries  folks who could have run a company maybe if they had ever had a chance those white students who put themselves in harms way even though they didnt have to  applause  those japanese americans who recalled their own interment those jewish americans who had survived the holocaust people who could have given up and given in but kept on keeping on knowing that weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning  cheers applause  on the battlefield of justice men and women without rank or wealth or title or fame would liberate us all in ways that our children now take for granted as people of all colors and creeds live together and learn together and walk together and fight alongside one another and love one another and judge one another by the content of our character in this greatest nation on earth to dismiss the magnitude of this progress to suggest as some sometimes do that little has changed  that dishonors the courage and the sacrifice of those who paid the price to march in those years applause medgar evers james chaney andrew goodman michael schwerner martin luther king jr they did not die in vain applause their victory was great but we would dishonor those heroes as well to suggest that the work of this nation is somehow complete the arc of the moral universe may bend towards justice but it doesnt bend on its own to secure the gains this country has made requires constant vigilance not complacency whether its by challenging those who erect new barriers to the vote or ensuring that the scales of justice work equally for all in the criminal justice system and not simply a pipeline from underfunded schools to overcrowded jails  applause  it requires vigilance cheers applause and well suffer the occasional setback but we will win these fights this country has changed too much applause people of good will regardless of party are too plentiful for those with ill will to change historys currents applause in some ways though the securing of civil rights voting rights the eradication of legalized discrimination  the very significance of these victories may have obscured a second goal of the march for the men and women who gathered 50 years ago were not there in search of some abstract idea they were there seeking jobs as well as justice  applause  not just the absence of oppression but the presence of economic opportunity for what does it profit a man dr king would ask to sit at an integrated lunch counter if he cant afford the meal this idea that  that ones liberty is linked to ones livelihood that the pursuit of happiness requires the dignity of work the skills to find work decent pay some measure of material security  this idea was not new lincoln himself understood the declaration of independence in such terms as a promise that in due time the weights should be lifted from the shoulders of all men and that all should have an equal chance dr king explained that the goals of africanamericans were identical to working people of all races decent wages fair working conditions livable housing old age security health and welfare measures  conditions in which families can grow have education for their children and respect in the community what king was describing has been the dream of every american its whats lured for centuries new arrivals to our shores and its along this second dimension of economic opportunity the chance through honest toil to advance ones station in life that the goals of 50 years ago have fallen most short yes there have been examples of success within black america that would have been unimaginable a halfcentury ago but as has already been noted black unemployment has remained almost twice as high as white employment sic latino unemployment close behind the gap in wealth between races has not lessened its grown as president clinton indicated the position of all working americans regardless of color has eroded making the dream dr king described even more elusive for over a decade working americans of all races have seen their wages and incomes stagnate even as corporate profits soar even as the pay of a fortunate few explodes inequality has steadily risen over the decades upward mobility has become harder in too many communities across this country in cities and suburbs and rural hamlets the shadow of poverty casts a pall over our youth their lives a fortress of substandard schools and diminished prospects inadequate health care and perennial violence and so as we mark this anniversary we must remind ourselves that the measure of progress for those who marched 50 years ago was not merely how many blacks had joined the ranks of millionaires it was whether this country would admit all people who were willing to work hard regardless of race into the ranks of a middleclass life applause the test was not and never has been whether the doors of opportunity are cracked a bit wider for a few it was whether our economic system provides a fair shot for the many for the black custodian and the white steelworker the immigrant dishwasher and the native american veteran to win that battle to answer that call  this remains our great unfinished business we shouldnt fool ourselves the task will not be easy since 1963 the economys changed the twin forces of technology and global competition have subtracted those jobs that once provided a foothold into the middle class reduced the bargaining power of american workers and our politics has suffered entrenched interests  those who benefit from an unjust status quo resisted any government efforts to give working families a fair deal marshaling an army of lobbyists and opinion makers to argue that minimum wage increases or stronger labor laws or taxes on the wealthy who could afford it just to fund crumbling schools  that all these things violated sound economic principles wed be told that growing inequality was the price for a growing economy a measure of the free market  that greed was good and compassion ineffective and those without jobs or health care had only themselves to blame and then there were those elected officials who found it useful to practice the old politics of division doing their best to convince middleclass americans of a great untruth that government was somehow itself to blame for their growing economic insecurity  that distant bureaucrats were taking their hardearned dollars to benefit the welfare cheat or the illegal immigrant and then if were honest with ourselves well admit that during the course of 50 years there were times when some of us claiming to push for change lost our way the anguish of assassinations set off selfdefeating riots legitimate grievances against police brutality tipped into excuse making for criminal behavior racial politics could cut both ways as the transformative message of unity and brotherhood was drowned out by the language of recrimination and what had once been a call for equality of opportunity the chance for all americans to work hard and get ahead was too often framed as a mere desire for government support as if we had no agency in our own liberation as if poverty was an excuse for not raising your child and the bigotry of others was reason to give up on yourself all of that history is how progress stalled thats how hope was diverted its how our country remained divided but the good news is just as was true in 1963 we now have a choice we can continue down our current path in which the gears of this great democracy grind to a halt and our children accept a life of lower expectations where politics is a zerosum game where a few do very well while struggling families of every race fight over a shrinking economic pie thats one path or we can have the courage to change the march on washington teaches us that we are not trapped by the mistakes of history that we are masters of our fate but it also teaches us that the promise of this nation will only be kept when we work together well have to reignite the embers of empathy and fellow feeling the coalition of conscience that found expression in this place 50 years ago and i believe that spirit is there that true force inside each of us i see it when a white mother recognizes her own daughter in the face of a poor black child i see it when the black youth thinks of his own grandfather in the dignified steps of an elderly white man its there when the native born recognizing that striving spirit of a new immigrant when the interracial couple connects the pain of a gay couple who were discriminated against and understands it as their own thats where courage comes from when we turn not from each other or on each other but towards one another and we find that we do not walk alone thats where courage comes from applause and with that courage we can stand together for good jobs and just wages with that courage we can stand together for the right to health care in the richest nation on earth for every person applause with that courage we can stand together for the right of every child from the corners of anacostia to the hills of appalachia to get an education that stirs the mind and captures the spirit and prepares them for the world that awaits them applause with that courage we can feed the hungry and house the homeless and transform bleak wastelands of poverty into fields of commerce and promise america i know the road will be long but i know we can get there yes we will stumble but i know well get back up thats how a movement happens thats how history bends thats how when somebody is faint of heart somebody else brings them along and says come on were marching cheers applause theres a reason why so many who marched that day and in the days to come were young for the young are unconstrained by habits of fear unconstrained by the conventions of what is they dared to dream different and to imagine something better and i am convinced that same imagination the same hunger of purpose serves in this generation we might not face the same dangers as 1963 but the fierce urgency of now remains we may never duplicate the swelling crowds and dazzling processions of that day so long ago no one can match kings brilliance but the same flames that lit the heart of all who are willing to take a first step for justice i know that flame remains applause that tireless teacher who gets to class early and stays late and dips into her own pocket to buy supplies because she believes that every child is her charge  shes marching applause that successful businessman who doesnt have to but pays his workers a fair wage and then offers a shot to a man maybe an excon whos down on his luck  hes marching cheers applause the mother who pours her love into her daughter so that she grows up with the confidence to walk through the same doors as anybodys son  shes marching cheers applause the father who realizes the most important job hell ever have is raising his boy right even if he didnt have a father especially if he didnt have a father at home  hes marching applause the battlescarred veterans who devote themselves not only to helping their fellow warriors stand again and walk again and run again but to keep serving their country when they come home  they are marching applause everyone who realizes what those glorious patriots knew on that day that change does not come from washington but to washington that change has always been built on our willingness we the people to take on the mantle of citizenship  you are marching applause the story must be told your subscription supports journalism that matters try 1 month for 1and thats the lesson of our past thats the promise of tomorrow that in the face of impossible odds people who love their country can change it and when millions of americans of every race and every region every faith and every station can join together in a spirit of brotherhood then those mountains will be made low and those rough places will be made plain and those crooked places they straighten out towards grace and we will vindicate the faith of those who sacrificed so much and live up to the true meaning of our creed as one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all cheers applause more to come transcript courtesy of federal news service comment s
