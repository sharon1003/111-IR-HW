plot the thing that moves your story the plot is the main plan of your story it is the engine that drives the story forward on course it is the hook or mystery or engaging what if that interests the viewer the interest grabbing plot of the example story prom date is shauns desire to date laura his desire for a date and his shyness make him do all the things he does this part will be more understandable if you read the example story the plot extends to include all the things that make the story work tims deceitful ways are part of the plot daves knowledge is part of the plot colin is part of the plot plot is the most important part of a screenplay and is an integral part of the story you can write out the plot or you can weave the tangled web in your head but you should know the basic plot the easiest way to plot a story is to know two things what your characters want and what the situation is when the characters are put in a situation they are going to start working to get what they want for example if shaun wants a date for the prom and tim wants a date for the prom and theyre both interested in the same girl what are they going to do shaun goes directly for the girl through tim but tim takes the indirect deceitful route complicate things by throwing in some obstacles like dave and colin and you have a story plotting a story can be a lot of fun you keep asking yourself what would this character do in this situation or what would happen if this happened and you continue throwing your characters into worse and worse situations until they finally cave in or conquer the problem its fun to ask others what they think someone would do youll find by discussing it with others youll get a lot of ideas and write a more believable screenplay start getting your ideas on paper as soon as possible this helps solidify them so they dont drift around in space forever part of the problem with plotting is that once you have planned your story through to the end you know the ending and the thrill of discovery is finished for you the way to avoid this is to remember that each scene is a little story in itself so you have several little stories to write for your screenplay hint the mad rush to get it written can work in your favor instead of writing full scenes write brief paragraphs about what is going to happen in the scenes or acts so you get a brief sketch of the entire story on paper there are always some great scenes you will want to write right away so do it this way the characters motivations can still drive the story but not get out of control i use this method because its more fun for me and works well for me this form of writing is called a treatment and is used by many writers then the challenge is to make each scene develop into a powerful scene subplot the subplot is like the plot but not as important it intertwines with the plot and helps develop it in the prom date dramatic structure with prom date illustration story the model airplane contest was a subplot it made shaun frustrated in act i it got him talking to dave in act ii in act iii it was part of the denouement hint romance is a very typical subplot review questions1 a plota has something to do with cemeteriesb is the main conflict that makes everyone tensec flies airplanes and cant get the wing size rightd is b above plus everything that makes the story go and twist and turn2 a subplota is beneath a casket in the cemeteryb is a smaller parallel story that helps the main story developc sits beside the main plot in an airplaned both a and c are correct this answer deserves a story  write it3 an easy way to plot is toa know what your characters wantb put your characters in a situationc put in a good mysteryd a and b are correct and i might have read about c earlier4 elements you could use to make your story more interesting area a romance subplotb mysteryc discoveryd life affirminge these are all true providing i develop the talent to actually do it5 a screenplay outlinea follows a formal numerical format like these questionsb may be brief paragraphs describing scenes and character interactionc may keep me from wasting many hours and getting frustrated and quittingd may include exciting scenes i cant wait to writee wont be the least bit interesting to other readerse b c d and e are correct
