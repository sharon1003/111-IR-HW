human culture bio anthropology  study of biology and evolution linguistic anthropology  study of human communication what is material culture material culture is what humans make interact with can tell human behaviors why is archaeology an important field of study  its interesting public interest funds it  heritage management archaeological record can be destroyed its non renewable  concern with origins provides origins about humans  provides time depth for social sciences only source of info for ancient people  its important archaeology can influence modern world what are the four common goals of archaeological research  stewardship conserve and manage archaeological sites for future  culture history reconstruct past life ways of human history  documentdescribe human variability study cultural phenomena in time and space to document the full range of human diversity  investigate cultural process explain how cultures changeremain the same over long periods of time  contribute to social sciences examine issues relevant to important issues in contemporary society what are the four main prerequisites for the existence of archaeology as an academic discipline recognition that the past exists interest in the past recognition of the antiquity of humanity assumption that past is knowable through research what is the principal of uniformitarianism and why is it relevant to archaeology the theory that the processes happening to the earth now are the same geological processes that have happened throughout all the past important to archaeology because  how did thomas jefferson contribute to the moundbuilder controversy how did he address this problem why was his research cutting edge excavated mound in his backyard to find truth of mound builders research methods mapped earthworks conducted axial excavations excavations by stratigraphic levels cutting edge contributed to modern excavation and documentation methods what were the main goals of archaeological research during the antiquarian phase of the discipline  establishing chronologies and cultural sequences dating human history what is the three age system three epochs based on technology stone age bronze age iron age method of relative dating what were the six fundamental concepts that were incorporated into unilineal evolutionary models  theory of evolutionary three age system uniformitarianism antiquity of man recognition of cultural diversity notion of progress what were the three main stages or types of human societies in these models  savagry hunting  barbarism farming  civilization cities how did spencer tylor and morgan envision this process working in different social and historical contexts based on the three age system living cultures as analog for the past victorian england as pinnacle how did unilineal evolutionary theorists incorporate analogy between living and ancient societies into their models  what were some negative extensions of this idea  historical particularism how did these theories fit within broader political and historical developments during the time they were proposed  what is historical particularism how did this concept represent a rejection of unilineal evolutionary theory  each society is a collective representation of its unique historical past different societies can rech the same destination through different paths rejects unilineal evolution because unilineal is about progressing at the same pace through different time periods and each society reaches their highest peak at the same time why is franz boas a key figure in the history of archaeology what was his approach to research how were his ideas adopted by archaeologists  father of american anthropology focuses on documentation of diversity against scientific racism multilinear evolution what were the main goals of archaeological research during the culture history phase of the discipline how did the culture historical approach contribute to archaeology  what were some of the limitations of the culture history approach  what is a culture area how were archaeological cultures defined culture area is an area of the same culture geographically based on linguisitic areas and ethnographic areas what are the archaeological concepts of traditions and horizons  tradition area where artifacts remain the same over a long period of time often technological  artifact or trait found over large area over short time period what is the concept of diffusion in archaeology as an explanation for change in the archaeological record  invention diffusion migration what are the main mechanisms for similarities and differences in material culture in diffusionist models  what is one major weakness of this concept in understanding the past  how did cultural ecologists define culture  focuses on commonalities  environment is a critical variable that shapes culture  similar adaptations found in different cultures in similar environments no culture develops an adaptation that remains unchanged over long period changes can result in increasing complexity or completely new cultural forms what was the main determinant of human social organization from this perspective  changes can result in increasing complexity or completely new cultural reforms how did cultural evolutionary models account for similarities and differences in human societies  multiple adaptive solutions to different environmental contexts what was the main catalyst of cultural change in these models  name three ways that multilinear evolutionary models differed from earlier unilineal evolutionary schemes  regulartities based on environment technology and ecological adaptation why was walter taylor a key figure in archaeological theory what were his main critiques of previous research  he upset the boys club model of archaeology he wanted more explanations main critiques were classification over behavior called for functional interpretation closer ties to anthropology holistic conjunctive approach scientific epistemology what was the new archaeology how did it differ from the culture history approach  more optimistic argued against the data driven culture history approach that wrote counterfeit history archaeology could determine social and economic aspects and explain rather than describe how were neoevolutionary models like multilineal evolution incorporated into archaeological research  elman services neoevolutionary theory bands tribes chiefdoms states why was lewis binford a key figure in major developments in archaeology theory during the new archaeology movement  he rejected culture history and diffusion wrote articles with his collegeaus that opened up archaeology to scientific testing and not merit of the scientist how did binford think archaeologists should approach archaeological research  they should relate artifacts to human behavior and human behavior to cultural systems quantitative vs qualittative what did binford view as the main goals of archaeological research  to link archaeology with human behavior to explain what the different details meant instead of describe  how did binford and other processual archaeologists view the relationship between anthropology and archaeology  they should be similar in that they explain total range of physical and cultural similarities  what is ethnoarchaeological research  lives among the people conducting ethnographic fieldwork to establish firm correlations between behavior and material culture what is systems theory and why was it useful in archaeological research  systems theory has lower middle and upper range theory going from highest to lowest in details about how to explain cultures how did processual archaeologists challenge and often contradict wellaccepted models of the ancient world  what were the main critiques of processual archaeology outlined by postprocessual theorists  too much attention to science of decay not enough on gender culture etc the processualists had too much of a positist view on culture and archaeology cannot be objective because personal bias exists in archaeologists nothing can be completely objective  what did postprocessualists view as the main goals of archaeological research  a more humanistic approach more subjective bring the actions and thoughts of people in the past to the central focus how do processual and postprocessual archaeologists differ in their views on the nature of archaeological data  what postmodern concepts were incorporated into postprocessual theory  emphasized the subjective nature of knowledge and embraced extreme relativism and idealism what types of new methodological approaches did postprocessual archaeologists try to integrate into their field research  what is the relationship between culture and material culture  culture is how we make sense of the world interact with each other and adapt material culture is what we make and is based off of human culture can determine human behavior walter taylors approach culture unobservable nonmaterial behaviors structured by culture observable nonmaterial objectifications of behavior artifacts architecture etc observable material what is material culture  any and all objects that people have created or modified as well as any identifiable human modifications of the natural environment accumulates where people live is patterned due to human behavior and can be decoded to determine the nature of that behavior what is the archaeological record  the more or less continuous distribution of material culture over the earths surface occurs in variable quantities what are the four main categories of material culture in the archaeological record what are the distinguishing attributes of each artifact  any portable object created or modified by humans feature  any non portable object or disturbance in environment created by humans ecofact  any natural object related to human activity site any location where artifacts features andor ecofacts cooccur indicating the presence of past human activities what are context and association and why are these concepts important to archaeology  context is where is is located association is how its related to the finds around it found within same matrix be able to define these concepts related to position of artifacts matrix  material surrounding a find sediment gravel etc provenience also spelled provenance  horizontal and vertical position within the matrix law of superposition  stratigraphy the lower layer of sediment is the one that was deposited first therefore giving timeline principal of association things that are found in same deposits are potentially related what is the archaeological record body of physical evidence about the past human activity can destroy this grave robbers  what are archaeological data what are the two main components of archaeological data  archaeological data is the combination of evidence of human activity and context human activity  artifacts sites etc context  matrix superposition etc
