people already think youre crazy for running marathons and now you tell them you want to run an ultra an ultra marathon is defined as anything longer than a marathon although many ultra runners would argue the distance starts at 50k and that timed events dont count a successful first ultra is one where you1 finish 2 dont get hurt 3 have fun here is how you can accomplish that the preparation1 enter and pay for your ultra give yourself at least three months to prepare if youve already signed up for the race thats a great motivator2 lose weight for every pound you lose you can gain about two minutes in an ultra if you are lean skip to the next step imagine running 50k while carrying a 10 to 20 pound weight you can train harder without those extra pounds3 do backtoback long runs once a week estimate your time for finishing the ultra and build up to running those total hours over two days you want to run the full distance combining backtoback days at least three or four times before the race for example if you think you will finish in six hours run three hours on saturday and three hours on sunday or four hours on saturday and two hours on sunday or five hours and one hour mix it up sunday will be painful at first but after you get warmed up it will feel easier a great free program to follow is the santa clarita ultra training program4 practice your nutrition during training and find out what works best for you quick tip start drinking before you get thirsty5 practice running efficiently with as little wasted motion as possible try to keep your head as still as possible and raise your feet as little as necessary however if the trail is extremely technical it may be necessary to raise your feet quite a bit to avoid stumbling and tripping try to always run quietly6 find socks clothes and shoes that you love for training and racing you want to be comfortable buy multiple pairs because you can be sure they will be discontinued7 train on the terrain youll be racing if its a hilly technical trail train on hilly technical trails if its a flat ultra on pavement train on that at least some of the time do a 10k tempo run once a week at a faster pace run hills once a week to get strong8 if you need them take recovery days a typical week could be monday  off tuesday  10k tempo wednesday  off thursday  1 hour hill workout friday  off saturday  3 hour long run sunday  3 hour long run or a four hour and two hour or five hour and one hourlets say your ultra is at the end of june you want to be able to run your distance over two days by the end of april give yourself time to work up to that in may you can run the distance three times and take it easy on the last weekend in june you can run it the first two weekends taper the third weekend and run your ultra the fourth weekend
