votefavorite3in the early days magic had crazy subpar mulligan rules you could shuffle up and draw a new 7 if your hand had no lands or all lands otherwise you were out of luck a long time ago the paris mulligan rule was introduced and it seems to have stuck if you dont like your hand throw it back and draw 6 if you dont like that one try again drawing 5 and so on this seems like a pretty good rule and i didnt question it but recently ive been playing duels of the planeswalkers on xbox incidentally if anyone else has that and wants to challenge me let me know the mulligan rule there is a little different you can throw your hand back and draw a new 7 once for free after that paris rules are in force every subsequent time you mulligan your hand size goes down by one it seems to me that this lenient mulligan rule is really good for the game magic is a game with a large element of randomness from the shuffle quite often players will draw a 7card hand thats basically unplayable and have to throw it back unless theyre crazy gamblers with nothing left to lose if your opponent keeps and you mulligan to 6 youre at a significant disadvantage already if you have to mulligan to 5 or fewer youd better hope somebody up there likes you does anyone know or have an informed idea why magic retains a mulligan rule that allows unbalanced games to happen as often as they do it just feels like the xbox mulligan would allow players to play their decks as they were meant to work more often and have to battle against long odds much less often what is the defence for the continued predominance in the magic world of the paris mulligan rulemagicthegathering variantsshare improve this questionedited oct 20 12 at 1431user1873338k 3 66 167asked feb 14 11 at 2058thesunneversets339k 6

different if you are playing competitively or casually competitive magic should encourage good deck building and make it as fair as possible to each player paris mulligan vs lenient paris mulligan isnt going to drastically change the fairness between the two players at the table and adds more complexity to an otherwise already complex game learning when to mulligan is actually a very useful skill in magic making it easier to stomach doesnt necessarily make it a better mechanic designing and testing decks with 7 6 5 card hands is very important likewise when playing against particular decks some decks struggle against a 1 card advantage some decks shrug it off and keep pounding real life magic mulligan problems can often be solved by shuffling properly people can get lazy in their shuffles and tournament nerves can make it worse take the time to adequately shuffle your deck each time you draw a hand this is especially true after a mulligan simply cutshuffling a few times will result in you drawing the exact same cards you just threw back when playing casually i recommend players just draw back up to 7 after a mulligan i would rather play against a decks best chance than roll over someone with a 5 card start casual games should be fun more than fair if the lenient paris mulligan is more fun for your play group then that is how you should playshare improve this answeranswered mar 7 11 at 2225mr hen993 6 14i agree with the spirit of your point 1 but i disagree in specific with paris mulligan vs lenient paris mulligan isnt going to drastically change the fairness insofar as lenient mulligan rewards decks that are explosive but inconsistent for example twocard monte and to a lesser extent dredge – daenyth apr 5 16 at 15162strategy bias isnt the same thing as unfairness – mr hen apr 5 16 at 1521add a commentup vote28down vote im old and tired and i havent played magic much in the last 15 years with that as a caveat my recollection is that the harsh penalty for declaring a mulligan was to prevent excessive gaming of declaring a mulligan part of the point of mt g was to create a deck that was playable despite the fact that the order of the cards would be random being able to mulligan out of a bad hand lets players create a less balanced deck that needs a specific start hand to succeed in other words playing decks as they were meant to

are vague in memory good link – allen gould feb 3 15 at 2121add a commentup vote11down vote informed idea the problem with a more open mulligan rule is striking a balance between fair randomization and how a deck is supposed to work its fairly easy to construct a deck in which the correct 68 cards being in your starting hand gives you a nearguaranteed win in 13 turns preventing this is the reason decks have a minimum size and individual cards have a quantity limit but if players could freely reshuffle and redraw they would over and over until they got that perfect hand which won the game the concept of how a deck is supposed to work would morph into perfect 7card combos to prevent this and create more options in deck design mulligans are very very costlyshare improve this

to shuffle other card games take alternate routes to make it work with less mulligans needed universal fighting system to mulligan you remove your hand from the game and draw a new one only one mull is allowed magination depending on your starting magi you search through your deck and pick out 23 cards and then draw the rest of your hand afterwards commander mtg variant partial mulligans you set aside any number of cards and draw that many from your deck you may do this again drawing one less card than you set aside until you are happy with your hand or run out of cards then you shuffle all of your set aside cards into your deck note that commander or edh has a 100 card deck size and no duplication rule so this might not work as well for regular magic now im not suggesting that time saving is the only reason for less lenient mulligan rules but i would posit that it is a factorshare improve this answeredited oct 21 12 at 1535answered jul 30 11 at 555aslum3234 14 30add a commentup vote5down vote one element that i havent seen in any of the answers yet a lenient mulligan rule advantages some deck archetypes over others some decks are built on the concept of redundancy for a monored aggro or burn deck for instance there may be minor differences amongst its various onemana creatures or its burn spells — maybe this spell does an extra point of damage but only hits players maybe creature x has a modest downside but creature y has one less point of toughness — but for the most part theyre indistinguishable just eg 12 copies of guy who costs 1 mana and has 2 power etc for a deck like this absent issues with drawing the right number of lands one 7card hand is going to look like any other on the other hand a combo deck — lets say the splinter twin decks in modern — is looking for a very specific set of cards often to the point where almost all the rest of the deck will be some combination of card draw and selection with just enough control elements to keep the deck alive while it assembles its combo this sort of deck wants a very specific set of cards in its opening hand it would for the most part much rather have its combo pieces than have to find them and so it often has to mulligan aggressively to find them getting a free sevencard mulligan is worth much much more to a deck like this than a red aggro deck and so decks like this become much more viable in the presence of a freemulligan rule this can actually be seen in action in many casual edhcommander environments where people tend to be very lenient in their mulligan rules and so wacky combo decks are often the order of the dayshare improve this answeranswered jan 23 15 at 2320steven stadnicki4621 1 16 331so this does explain one consequence of a free mulligan rule but you still need to link that back to why magic chose to use paris mulligan and not free mulligan – doppelgreener jan 24 15 at 020doppelgreener i thought that was implicit in the above  one reason and there are certainly several is that its a gamedesign decision made to balance the power level of different archetypes – steven stadnicki jan 24 15 at 124doppelgreener paris mulligan was selected first as a general principle i support not changing rules unless there is something to be fixed as this answer points out a more lenient mulligan rule doesnt fix a problem it just changes some aspects of the metagame – hao ye jan 24 15 at 335another way to look at this that might make it more obvious to some people the more free the mulligans the closer youll get to the best possible hand with the deck for some decks the best possible hand is incredibly good way better than average and so lenient mulligans favor those decks and make them unreasonably good – cascabel ♦ jan 24 15 at 4151doppelgreener i second your concern stating how the metagame would be affected is not enough to answer the question the questions was not why you would choose one over the other but why wizards chose one over the other to answer that you either need to be able to read minds or you need to read this article that does a great job explaining why wizards settled on paris mulligans i am having trouble figuring out when that article was posted it may have been after the question was asked – rainbolt jan 26 15 at 1537add a commentup vote5down vote there is an excellent article up by one of the magic developers that discusses the issues with various mulligan types and why they upgraded to the new vancouver scry 1 mulligan a quick summary the cheaper it is to mulligan the more likely you are to do it on digital this is instantaneous in paper properly shuffling takes a lot longer as does deciding whether to keep the hand the more control you have over your mulligan eg the way hearthstone works where you select cards to replace the more likely it is that certain powerful decks that are currently kept in check by their reliability issues will simply become broken they want to have the same mulligan rules for all the major 1v1 formats stuff thats fine in limited can be bonkers for constructed one interesting point in the article is that it agrees with you that it would make casual games a lot more fun so if you want to casually agree to do it outside of ranked events like fnm go for it but be aware that its not how cards are balanced and so as you progress certain decks may be more powerful than they should beshare improve this answeranswered oct 12 15 at 1346deworde1233 9 21add a commentup vote3down vote in a welldesigned deck the possibility of a truly unplayable hand is small the possibility becomes vanishingly small after a single mulligan thus there really should never be a need to mulligan more than once unless youre fishing for your golden starting hand being down a single card is not a significant disadvantage  its relatively minor the current mulligan rules are established in such a way to discourage fishing for gold while not preventing a relatively fair start for each playershare improve this answeranswered feb 18 11 at 1855jeff252 1 32actually id argue this isnt true for example in a 40 card deck with 17 land above average there is about a 10 chance of drawing only one land or less assuming a single mulligan back to 7 cards youve got a 1 chance per game of pretty much losing at the start in a 16 round tournament youd play between 32  48 games so basically half the players would be hosed with a single mulligan at least once without a mulligan 10 loses due to poor luck is unacceptable – aslum mar 20 15 at 1820add a commentup vote0down vote in any card game a person who draws a bad hand will always be at a disadvantage against someone who draws good cards thats just the nature of the game an exception might be someone who draws a mixed hand a technically inferior hand with good chances of improving such a hand might be four to a flush or straight versus one or two pair in draw poker if you get a redraw you actually have an advantage maybe not against the gooddrawing player but against a random player magic tries to compensate for this fact with the paris mulligan rule the second draw costs you a card the third two cards etc then its up to you to determine whether your starting hand is so bad that its worth paying the penalty for a redrawshare improve this answeranswered jul 29 11 at 1644tom au123k 5 33 101add a commentup vote0down vote the best solution would be to increase starting hand size the  of games that are decided by initial bad drawsmulligans is very high especially when considering how much meticulous thought and planning deck building requires this is why having an autolose from bad luck is frustrating to people because most of the effort is acquiring cards and building the deck and then they get to the actual game and someones fate in a match or tournament can and will given enough games be completely sealed by luck of the draw even the pros do not have that high of a win although still higher than everyone else by at least several  what they do have is the patience and temperament to keep chugging along despite the bad beats that no one can avoid no matter how clever or skilled they at this card game there is only a very small number of competitive decks in standard at any given time this is because deck options are extremely limited due to the incredibly high level of consistency needed this also makes competitive magic very expensive as the need for consistency leads to only several  of the most powerful efficient cards worth playing and it also makes mana bases extremely expensive as every free card that gives you more consistency will lead to more wins in summation mulliganing well isnt just about hand analysis or deck building skill avoiding the pitfalls of bad starting hands is more about having the small clump of cards that will actually give consistent powerful results given that a deck size is pretty large and any one nonbasic land can only make up 67 of the cards in the deck note how powerful tutors of almost all kinds are just because they let you bypass randomness for that single instanceshare improve this answeredited sep 11 11 at 1151answered sep 11 11 at 1145levgre9 21 increasing the hand size actually improves the chances of extremely strong situational cards which can in fact reduce the number of competitive decks because once you remove inconsistency fast decks that work because they take advantage of their opponents inconsistency go away and slower decks become stronger for example with 10 cards many combo decks have the reliability to break the format so you end up with just those decks in the format – deworde oct 12 15 at 1328add a commentup vote2down vote truly the best solution to poor opening hands is creating a balanced deck within a deck every card that searches for other cards or draws a card s can be considered a subtraction from the deck count if the mana cost is low enough the card itself mathematically is replaced with the card s it drawssearches for thus creating the external deck now the internal deck should consist of the cards you need to play such as mana sources basic lands for example or versatile useful cards imagine now that you have a 60 card deck opening hand you draw a fetch land play it and pass your turn on your next turn it will untap and allow you to search for a land of the appropriate color that means the fetch has been replaced by a basic land and a basic land has been removed from your deck lowering your chances of drawing it if you run 12 fetch lands pretty high number but this is the extreme example 20 of your deck count has been shaved this correlates to 1 fifth of your deck leaving you with 48 cards left to amass now 4 in 48 1 in 12 chance of drawing any given card as opposed to 4 in 60 1 in 15 you would have had without the fetches and that doesnt include all the other searchers you might fit in there it is possible in modern format to make a deck with 30 searchersdraw cards 20 basic lands and 10 cards that produce various desired effects and be an efficient killershare improve this answeranswered jan 23 15 at 710overdrive games69 1

i can kind of see where you were going with it but i think you stopped writing before you established your point – rainbolt jan 23 15 at 1514it was meant to be in response to what was said previously people say that decks are 60 cards and that large number can validate a more generous mulligan but with the large number of cards that allow for low cost searching at least in modern format the mulligan would be over powered if given more generosity i suppose if i were to add on to my answer i would add the following and this is why the paris mulligan was chosen over the free mulligan –
