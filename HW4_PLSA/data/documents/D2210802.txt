asthma who were inadequately controlled despite the use of inhaled corticosteroids with or without the use of other controller asthma medications during the first 24 weeks of treatment steroid doses remained constant from baseline this was followed by a 28week period during which inhaled corticosteroid adjustment was allowed the primary efficacy variable in this study was the rate of asthma exacerbations during the 24week fixed steroid treatment phase an asthma exacerbation was defined as a worsening of asthma symptoms as judged clinically by the investigator requiring doubling of the baseline inhaled corticosteroid dose for at least three days andor treatment with rescue systemic corticosteroids for at least three days 4 at 24 weeks the xolair treatment group had a statistically significantly lower rate of asthma exacerbations compared to the placebo treatment group 045 vs 064 respectively representing a 31 percent relative rate reduction rate ratio 069 95 percent ci 053 090 p0007 4 during the entire 52week treatment period the difference in asthma exacerbation rates between the xolair and placebo treatment groups 078 vs 136 respectively represented a 43 percent relative

asthma is a chronic condition with inflammation and narrowing of the airways as well as tightening of the muscles around the airways the symptoms of asthma and allergic asthma are the same—its the triggers that are different what makes allergic asthma a unique type of asthma is the cause of its symptoms exposure to yearround allergens in the air such as pet dander and dust mites if you have allergic asthma allergens like these can bring on your allergic asthma symptoms and attacks when an allergen enters your body your immune system identifies it as something harmfulyour immune system responds by releasing a substance called immunoglobulin e or ig eig e plays a key role in the development of allergic asthma symptoms it binds to allergens which causes the release of chemicals that can lead to swelling inflammation in and around the lungs this can trigger an allergic asthma attack people with allergic asthma may have higher levels of ig e because of the way their immune system reacts to allergens for some blocking ig e which xolair is designed to do has been shown to be a helpful part of their allergic asthma treatment plan if you think you may have allergic asthma ask your doctor about how much ig e is in your body about xolair xolair ® for subcutaneous use is an injectable prescription medicine used to treatmoderate to severe persistent asthma in patients six years of
