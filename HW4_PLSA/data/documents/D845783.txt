from wikipedia the free encyclopedia redirected from ice pack therapynavigation search cryotherapy is the local or general use of low temperatures in medical therapy cryotherapy is used to treat a variety of benign and malignant tissue damage medically called lesions 1 the term cryotherapy comes from the greek cryo κρύο meaning cold and therapy θεραπεία meaning cure the most prominent use of the term refers to the surgical treatment specifically known as cryosurgery or cryoablation cryosurgery is the application of extreme cold to destroy abnormal or diseased tissue and is used most commonly to treat skin conditions cryotherapy is widely used to relieve muscle pain sprains and swelling either via soft tissue damage or postoperative swelling it can be a range of treatments from the very low technology application of ice packs or immersion in ice baths generally known as cold therapy to the use of cold chambers whole body or partial body cryotherapy and or face masks or body cuffs with controlled temperature sometimes called hilotherm while cryotherapy is widely used there appears to be little evidence as to its efficacy that has been replicated or shown in large controlled studies also its long term side effects have not been studied 2 3 commonly reports regarding cryotherapy suggest further research is needed 4contents  hide 1 cryosurgery2 ice pack therapy3

cryosurgery cryosurgery is the application of extreme cold to destroy abnormal or diseased tissue the application of ultracold liquid causes damage to the treated tissue due to intracellular ice formation the degree of damage depends upon the minimum temperature achieved and the rate of cooling 5 cryosurgery is used to treat a number of diseases and disorders most especially skin conditions like warts moles skin tags and solar keratoses liquid nitrogen is usually used to freeze the tissues at the cellular level the procedure is used often as it is relatively easy and quick can be done in the doctors surgery and is deemed quite low risk if a cancerous lesion is suspected then excision rather than cryosurgery may be deemed more appropriate 6ice pack therapy  editice pack therapy is a treatment of cold temperatures to an injured area of the body though the therapy is extensively used and it is agreed that it alleviates symptoms testing has produced conflicting results about its efficacy 7 8 9 10an ice pack is placed over an injured area and is intended to absorb heat of a closed traumatic or edematous injury by using conduction to transfer thermal energy the physiologic effects of cold application include immediate vasoconstriction with reflexive vasodilation decreased local metabolism and enzymatic activity and decreased oxygen demand cold decreases muscle spindle fiber activity and slows nerve conduction velocity therefore it is often used to decrease spasticity and muscle guarding it is commonly used to alleviate the pain of minor injuries as well as decrease muscle soreness the use of ice packs in treatment decreases the blood flow most rapidly at the beginning of the cooling period 11 this occurs as a result of vasoconstriction the initial reflex sympathetic activity ice is not commonly used prior to rehabilitation or performance because of its known adverse effects to performance such as decreased myotatic reflex and force production as well as a decrease in balance immediately following ice pack therapy for 20 minutes 12 however if ice pack therapy is applied for less than 10 minutes performance can occur without detrimental effects if the ice pack is removed at this time athletes are sent back to training or competition directly with no decrease in performance 13cold spray anesthetics  editmain article freeze spray in addition to their use in cryosurgery several types of cold aerosol sprays are used for shortterm pain relief ordinary spray cans containing tetrafluoroethane dimethyl ether or similar substances are used to numb the skin prior to or possibly in place of local anesthetic injections and prior to other needles small incisions sutures and so on other products containing chloroethane are used to ease sports injuries similar to ice pack therapy whole body cryotherapy  editcryo chamber at −110 °ccryotherapy patients during preparation of treatment of c 3 minutes a cryosauna used in partial body cryotherapy whole body cryotherapy wbc is an alternative to cold water immersion or ice packs 14 while further studies to determine the efficacy of the treatment are recommended a review of the available data does not show that this treatment has a greater impact than simple ice pack therapy or ice bath 2 15 14this treatment involves exposing individuals to extremely cold dry air below −100 °c for two to four minutes to achieve the subzero temperatures required for wbc two methods are typically used liquid nitrogen and refrigerated cold air during these exposures individuals wear minimal clothing which usually consists of shorts for males and shorts and a crop top for females gloves a woollen headband covering the ears and a nose and mouth mask in addition to dry shoes and socks are commonly worn to reduce the risk of coldrelated injury the first wbc chamber was built in japan in the late 1970s but wbc was not introduced to europe until the 1980s and has only been used in the us and australia in the past decade 14whole body cryotherapy was initially intended for use in a clinical setting to treat patients with conditions such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis wbc is provided in over 50 european hospitals and medical clinics and it has now been used in many spas and athletic training facilities as well 16 17 elite athletes have reported using the treatment to alleviate delayed onset muscle soreness doms after exercise 18 19 and recreational athletes have started to emulate elite athletes in using these treatments after exercise reductions in muscle and skin tissue temperature after wbc exposure may stimulate cutaneous receptors and excite the sympathetic adrenergic fibres causing constriction of local arterioles and venules 20 21 22 there has been a study that suggests that wbc stimulates the autonomic nervous system ans with a predominance of parasympathetic tone activation after exposure but it does not appear to have been duplicated 23adverse effects  editsystematic reviews of whole body cryotherapy have repeatedly called for research studies to implement active surveillance of adverse events which are suspected of being underreported 14 24 if the cold temperatures are produced by evaporating liquid nitrogen there is the risk of inert gas asphyxiation as well as frostbite 25partial body cryotherapy  editpartial body cryotherapy pbc devices or cryosaunas are cylindrical chambers typically having an aperture at the top with the patients head remaining outside and not subjected to the cold stimulus these devices are commonly used throughout united states and are erroneously referred to as offering whole body cryotherapy a further key difference between pbc and wbc is the usage of injection of evaporated liquid nitrogen into the pbc chamber with the potential adverse effects as listed below 26adverse effects  editif the cold temperatures are produced by evaporating liquid nitrogen there is the risk of inert gas
