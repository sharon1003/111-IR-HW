basics the spacing of stops and stations posted on november 5 2010 in 3newbasic basics pedestrians san francisco stop spacing the unglamorous but essential struggle over the spacing of consecutive stops or stations on a transit line is an area where there’s a huge difference in practice between north american and australian agencies for reasons that have never been explained to me as anything other than a difference in bureaucratic habit in australia and in most parts of europe that i’ve observed localstop services generally stop every 400m 14 mile 1320 feet some north american agencies stop as frequently as every 100m about 330 ft already i can hear someone asking “but how many blocks is that” well it depends on how long your city’s blocks are even in san francisco where block length is wildly variable i’ve heard people insist on asking for a standard in blocks which is complete nonsense living on a short block doesn’t make you more entitled to a bus stop near your house san francisco is at it again trying to rationalize its stop spacing on some of its most frequent lines so i thought i’d take the occasion to lay out some stop spacing basics the geometry of stop spacing works like this every stop or station has a walk radius the area from which most people would be willing to walk to a stop in the most idealized world which is where some planning happens this radius defines a circle around each stop how big is the walk radius actually different people are comfortable walking different distances so a truer view of these circles would be very fuzzy gradually dissapating further out from the stop you don’t want to look at that though and it’s hard to do geometry with it so transit planners generally observe that the walking distance that most people seem to tolerate — the one beyond which ridership falls off drastically — is about 400m around 14 mi for a localstop service and about 1000m around 35 mi for a very fast frequent and reliable rapid transit service i personally will walk further than this you may not be willing to walk even this far but as an approximation the 400m rule for local service seems to work pretty well but of course the circle is what the walk radius would be if you could walk absolutely anywhere in the area including diagonally through buildings etc in the real world we walk along some kind of network of streets and paths the design of that network is therefore a crucial element of walking distance which means that it’s also relevant to stop spacing consider these two drawings from this post these happen to both be in the seattle area but your city probably contains examples of both of these network types the caroriented network on the left is full of obstacles to the pedestrian so the actual area you can walk to the blue network is less than a third of the ideal radius red on the other hand in a dense grid of streets and other pedestrian links like the one on the right maximizes the possible walking distance the actual area within walking distance is diamond shape ie a square rotated 45 degrees from the transit line almost two thirds of the ideal radius is in walking distance in such a network note how these things are connected in chains street network determines walking distance walking distance determines in part how far apart the stops can be stop spacing determines operating speed so yes the nature of the local street network actually affects how fast the transit line can runhow do we decide about spacing consider the diamondshaped catchment that’s made possible by a fine street grid ideal stop spacing is as far apart as possible for the sake of speed but of course people around the line have to be able to get to it in particular we’re watching two areas of impact the duplicate coverage area is the area that has more than one stop within walking distance in most situations on flat terrain you need to be able to walk to one stop but not two so duplicate coverage is a waste moving stops further apart reduces the dupicate coverage area which means that more unique poeple and areas are served by the stops the coverage gap is the area that is withing walking distance of the line but not of a stop as we move stops further apart the coverage gap grows we would like to minimize both of these things but in fact we have to choose between them close stop spacing means smaller coverage gaps but larger duplicate coverage area wide stop spacing means the opposite if we are doing a localstop service and we assume that people will walk 400m then the diamonds are 800m wide if we then set the stop spacing at 400m the diamond on the left will touch the one on the right in other words every point on the line will be in a duplicate coverage area the coverage gap meanwhile gets smaller in fact if the stop spacing is the same as the walking distance standard the coverage gap’s area and the duplicate coverage area are the same play with this yourself until you believe it so does that make this the right answer not necessarily for two reasons which is worse creating duplicate coverage area or leaving a coverage gap it depends on what you’re trying to do in fact this is arguably connected to the tension between designing for ridership and designing for coverage generally to meet social service needs if you care mostly about the latter you want to minimize the coverage gap so that everyone has access and you don’t care that much of the resulting line is slower and therefore less attractive to other riders on the other hand if you want to maximize ridership you’ll worry more about the duplicate coverage gap because in addition to representing wasted coverage closer stop spacing means slower operations both more expensive to operate and less attractive riders so you’ll tend to want to push stops further apart if this is like most urban fabric there’s more stuff residents jobs activities close to the transit line than far from it which means that there’s more stuff in the duplicate coverage area than in the coverage gaps so if that’s true then we’re facing again the eternal danger of maps they invite us to misread pure area as though it represents the stuff that matters if we set the stop spacing at 400m the duplicate coverage area is the same as the coverage gap area but if there are more residents jobs and activities in the duplicate coverage area the two aren’t really in balance if you valued duplicate coverage and coverage gaps equally you’d ideally plot the actual locations of residents jobs and activities and then push the stops just far enough apart so that the amount of this stuff in the duplicate coverage area was the same as that in the coverage gap though again as per point 1 there’s no particular reason that these two things should be the same you can strike a balance anywhere based on your goals in running the service so that’s the geometric tradeoff that governs stop spacing in flat terrain with wellconnected street networks you can see how variations in terrain would shift the calculation if the transit line is climbing a steep hill you can make a case for stops closer together walking downhill is usually easier than walking uphill so some people will value having two stops so that they walk downhill to one to depart and walk downhill from the other one as they’re returning that’s why stop spacing is often a bit closer when going uphill or downhill in general though we always want to push stops as far apart as possible while still providing enough access both for speed and because the fewer stops we have the more infrastructure we can afford to provide at each but the limits of our ability to widen stop spacing is defined by the geometry i’ve outlined finally while i’ve been talking about local stop service with a walk distance of about 400m the entire calculation is exactly the same for any distance for example if we are placing rapid transit stops and we think that the maximum walk distance to them is about 1000m we can set the stops 1000m apart thus we end up with the duplicate coverage area that’s the same size as the coverage gap then we can argue about whether in the given situation we should push wider or narrower of course there are all the other kinds of access parkandride kissandride cycling etc still the walk is the dominant factor in transit access potential because even if you use a vehicle for access you’re likely to be a pedestrian at the other end of your trip of course many people are pedestrians at both ends the exception is when you take your bicycle on board which will always be a problem at crowded times sooner or later we are all pedestrians finally here’s a fun question to think about if you had two parallel transit lines how might the stop locations on one of them affect the logical locations of stops on the other what’s the furthest apart that the lines can be in terms of multiples of the maximum walking distance for this consideration to matter think about it before you look at the comments because someone’s probably written the answer thererelated postswalking in america undercounting the transit constituency guest post policy canberra public radio interview on transit in australia’s capital46 responses to basics the spacing of stops and stations m1ek november 5 2010 at 506 pm first the 14 mile rule was defined up to 12 mile for ‘rapid transit’ and now you’re trying to pull 35 mile gmab the time commitment required for 12 miles of walk with associated waits at intersections is more than the vast majority of anzus choice commuters would ever consider outside possibly nyc when i see this kind of defining up it’s really an admission that serving choice commuters is hard so we have to pretend that they’re lazy capn transit november 5 2010 at 530 pm the main issue i want to raise is that different pedestrians have different ranges a transit line that serves a large number of elderly or disabled passengers should have closer spacing forget parallel lines there is also the issue of localexpress lines here in queens we have the 7 train that stops every 67 blocks 13 mile and two frequent buses that run on queens boulevard below two years ago the mta changed the bus stops from about 1 12 blocks apart to roughly three blocks and people were not happy it didn’t help that they moved one of the stops further from the senior center engineer scotty november 5 2010 at 536 pm a few comments living on a short block doesn’t make you more entitled to a bus stop near your house living on a short block may make the time to get to the bus stop longer or more treacherous if the shorter blocks mean more crossings to cover the same distance this is especially true if the crossings are busy and you can expect to wait for the light to change or the traffic to clear regarding the difference between social service and ridership lines–another important issue you left out is stopping policy most rapid transit lines stop at every stop regardless but many local bus routes in the us only stop when there’s a passenger waiting or when someone on board explicitly signals the need to get off many “social service” lines here in portland have very short distances between stops 200m and in some cases 100m but the “effective” stop distance for a given run is much larger than that because most stops are skipped on a given run and indeed when converting a social service line to a ridership line one of the challenges frequently is stop consolidation–the short stop distances on the social service line become inappropriate for the highridership line and many rural service or latenight services–including on some tri met runs–adapt an even looser stopping policy of “anywhere along the line wherever it is safe” some rural transit agencies i can think of will even deviate from the planned route to drop off passengers at their front door–effectively acting more like jitneys or sharetaxis than like scheduled bus service david marcus november 5 2010 at 822 pm since nobody’s yet answered jarrett’s extra credit question i’ll take a stab the first part where should the stops be located on the second parallel line is easy they should be spaced exactly between the stops on the first line to maximize the coverage area for the second line filling in the coverage gaps from the first line as to how far apart the lines can be before this stops mattering…if we take the 400m maximum walking distance with the stops ever 400m per the australianeuropean standard then a parallel line spaced 600m from the first line would perfectly fill in the coverage area gaps as the line gets further away the overlap diminishes until by 800m the lines aren’t working together at all the biggest learning to me from the last part is that any closer than 600m and the lines are wastefully covering the same area that would mean crosstown buses in manhattan are optimally spaced about 7 or 8 blocks apartmikef0234 november 5 2010 at 833 pm where buses operate on an arterial grid the buses must stop at least at each intersecting arterial to facilitate transfers on a halfmile 800metre arterial grid typical in western north america stops spaced at 400 metres should be located once half way between intersecting arterials and once at intersecting arterialsmikef0234 november 5 2010 at 846 pm just to clarify parallel routes should be twice the walking distance and stops on parallel routes should all be lined up with each other stops on perpendicular routes will fill in the remaining gaps which would fill a social service requirement for coverage i suspect the arterialgrid spacing of many cities was chosen to maximize the development potential around a minimum number of streetcar lines resulting in the present halfmiletwice walkingdistance arterial grid alon levy november 5 2010 at 851 pm with rapid transit the difficulty of building it means that it’s there to last so there’s more tod around it this means that development clusters more around stations allowing transit agencies to push interstations further out that’s why you usually see rapid transit interstations substantially longer than a kilometer among the world’s largest systems the distances cluster around 1213 km when you have parallel lines usually you have to put the stops on the same cross streets instead of offset by half the reason is that development tends to cluster along streets so the most useful destinations tend to be on the same cross street you get bigger coverage gaps this way but at least the stops are right where people want to goanonymouse november 5 2010 at 1036 pm engineer scotty raises an important point walking time is not directly proportional to distance if you have to cross big streets with nontrivial wait times and more importantly this increases the variance of walking time meaning you have to leave earlier especially if the bus you’re trying to catch runs infrequently it’s very frustrating when the bus stop is on the opposite side of a very wide street and you’re waiting at a light that takes 3 minutes and watch the bus come and go while you wait to cross the street i’d postulate that there’s some relation between walking distance and standard deviation of walking time and line frequency and i’d also guess that there’s some “average trip speed effect” in that people are willing to walk further to get to faster services jarrett november 5 2010 at 1053 pm all david marcus’s answer is the one i was after when you just have two parallel lines and are not dealing with frequent intersecting services it’s logical to put stops on one street offset with the other this will be relevant whenever the distance between the lines is less than twice the maximum walking distance so that the point of the diamonds on one street fit into the coverage gaps between the diamonds on the other yes when you have frequent intersecting streets this consideration is superseded by the need for stops at the transfer points but there are plenty of cases where that doesn’t apply finally to commenters who want to attack the assumptions used to construct this exercise fine there’s plenty of room for disagreement about walking distances as i’ve said in the post but when it comes to designing service we can’t serve everyone’s pleasure in this regard so we end up selecting reasonable median values for walking distance and planning to those and yes as we all know there are also plenty of variations based on the quality of the walk experience and obstacles to it but i will continue to emphasize that transit does have an intrinsic geometry and that understanding this geometry is important if we’re going to make good decisions about it the geometry becomes visible only if you make simplifying assumptions eg uniform distribution of development flat terrain etc all of the posts in this “basics” category have done that in other contexts i’ve seen important people quibble over the simplifying assumptions because the don’t like implications the underlying geometry beware this slippery slope of endless assumptionquestioning because as i said in the “field guide to transit quarrels” the facts of geometry tend to prevail in the end alon levy november 5 2010 at 1147 pm jarrett you didn’t make those simplifying assumptions very clear on the contrary you posed this exercise after warning of the “eternal danger of maps” and talking about practical development distributions m1ek november 6 2010 at 820 am jarrett i have no problem with the assumptions but rather the definingup over the years of ‘acceptable walking distance’ from 14 to 12 and now 35 of a mile that directly contradicts actual trends in the population leo november 6 2010 at 924 am when rapid transit stops are spaced 1km apart you need a bus in the same corridor to provide local service for spaces inbetween stations for example toronto runs a local bus parallel to the yonge subway north of downtown because the subway stops are not within walking distance bus stops on toronto’s legacy bus and streetcar network tend to be 200m apart 400m stops would be more of a brt thing when we vacationed for several weeks in riga latvia my wife found the 400m stop spacing there very surprising it conflicted with our habit of walking to the next stop when there was nothing coming capn transit november 6 2010 at 1122 am i find it a bit sad that so much of this discussion comes from a point of view of scarcity yes it’s true that if all your routes are heavily subsidized by stingy motorists who see transit riders as lazy welfare cheats you need to economize on stops but not every town is scottsdale some of us live in places where the majority of people take transit and where we could indeed serve just about everyone’s pleasure if we weren’t wasting so much money and public space serving the pleasure of the wealthy minority who drive on fifth and madison avenues in manhattan we’ve got local buses limitedstop buses and express buses and about 450m away there’s the subway with parallel local and express services and even the commuter rail line if you want to go faster or farther in some sections the entire curb is one long series of bus stops in those cases it is absolutely appropriate to have stops less than 200m apart to serve not just the elderly and disabled but people who don’t want to walk further than that for any reason or for no reason at all in a soup kitchen or an institutional cafeteria sure you don’t have the resources to accommodate everyone’s wishes so you make a big batch of slop and everyone gets their scoop of slop or else they go hungry but you take a very different approach at the four seasons or even at burger king capn transit november 6 2010 at 1254 pm i don’t mean to suggest that there’s anything wrong with the specific assumptions that you’re making jarrett but i would appreciate if you could be a bit more clear when you’re assuming something that isn’t necessarily the case elsewhere i also appreciate that your post is relatively free of the moralizing tone that i often hear when transit planners discuss stop spacing when you have an abundance of transit you don’t have the people who want short walks fighting over the scraps with the people who want speedy trips and the bean counters who want to save on gas and wages when the pie is small we can at least refrain from judging people who want one or another and just try to find an arrangement that everyone can live with transit planner munich november 6 2010 at 402 pm in 2009 i attended a conference where a presentation from researchers from the state university portland oregon was given conclusion the ideal bus stop spacing is 1200 feet 360 meters httpwwwvtbvtumdeexternmobil tum2009abstracts4a20public20transportmobil tum2009abstractspdf the same team from portland had published one year before a paper saying 930 feet – about 280 meters – as ideal spacing httpwwwitspdxeduuploaddocs1248894217rwae wsdyz9pdf obviously the ideal distance keeps growing even in the u s – especially when they mention that for boston an ideal spacing of 400 meters was the result of a different study i would prefer a more practical approach what is your target group if you aim at “captive riders” then you could expect your “clients” to walk walk walk probably your transit system will be heavily subsidized so why make it easy for people to board a bus 400 meters 500 meters – who cares on the other hand when your transit agency serves a city in the u s walking could be seen as something unamerican or when you are in new york you assume that people with healthy legs will walk anyways to the next subway station who rides a bus there is obviously seen as mobility impaired in any way maybe even without a driver’s licence so those people will be happy so move with pedestrian speed in a bus and a bus stop every other block or shorter will be perfect if you want to offer an alternative for the car then you should have a spacing allowing the bus to go with a more decent speed but also to limit the walking distance “aus den augen aus dem sinn” – what translates into “out of sight out of mind” is also true for transit and no one except some transit enthusiasts and people scared of driving will voluntarily decide to walk much more than 5 minutes to any transit stop to a bus stop regardless of all brtenthusiasm even shorter the maximum walk to a bus stop is for those people usually about 300 meters to a metrosubway stop about 500 meters and that is not the spacing between the stations but includes the walk from the side streets i made a calculation in the past for my professional use and the result was an ideal bus stop spacing of 400 meters between the stops a compromise of acceptable speed and acceptable walking distance if the distance between the stops is larger the bus will be faster but every rider also at one point has to walk to and from the stop and loses then more time heshe needs extra for walking than heshe saved before by the faster bus ride the same is true if the distance between the stops is shorter – you are faster at the bus stop but lose more time when riding the bus you can easily calculate this delicate balance down to the minute for your city taking into consideration the average lenght of a bus ride in your city by the way if your buses have a headway of 20 minutes or more forget all this then anyways everyone with a driver’s license will ignore your lines this is true even for metrosubway lines the munich metro sytem has a station every 700 to 900 meters within the city limits outside the spacing is larger but the trains are long and a typical platform about 120 meters – 400 feet including the escalators mezzanine and stairs to both sides on a typical station for example in northsouthdirection there is usually a distance of 250 meters 800 feet from the most northern access stairs of a station to the most southern access stairs of a station so when you have every 800 meters a station then the distance between the most northern stairs of the first station to the most southern stairs of the next station to the north is more likely 600 meters the maximum walk for a person living between those metro stations to the next station entrance is 300 meters and – psychologically for a rider the moment counts when heshe reaches the stairs not the platform or the train and the long platforms and trains make it possible to have larger spacings between the stops and a higher average travel speed but still an attractive walking distance to the next station a hidden secret of success of metrosubway systems a secret that brt cannot imitate except when jarret comes up with some chinese 200metersbusmonsters called “people eater dragon” or so but believe me they only would exist in his wet dreams reality check also for jarrett’s bonus question in my neigborhood there are two metrosubway tunnels running parallel south to north one with a headyway of 5 minutes during peak time the other tunnel with a train every 25 minutes the distance beween those parallel metro tunnels is 1200 meters 4000 feet capacity per train over 900 passengers still there is a very high demand on a parallel running northsouth tram line – situated just in the middle 600 meters 2000 feet away form each tunnel for a lot of transit planners the tram would be not neccessary still demand is so high that a headway of 75 minutes with vehicles with a capacity of 200 riders is not sufficient anymore and in the metro tunnels the trains reach also their maximum capacity already by the way there are now also two bus lines in eastwestdirection in operation in a distance of 250 meters both really successful conclusion no one likes to walk more than 200 meters to a bus stop or 300 meters to a metro access entrance or a tram stop but also no one wants to sit in a bus that stops every 100 meters so try to make stop distances of 400 meters between bustram stops and 800 to 900 meters to metrosubway stops on paper and then have fun with reality when you discover that you have enough points of interests schools etc or important intersections maybe just demands from politicians so that you end up placing stops 300 meters away from each other the fate of a transit planner and before you get depressed try it with priority at traffic lights to speed up your buses againian november 6 2010 at 404 pm “in general though we always want to push stops as far apart as possible while still providing enough access both for speed and also because the fewer stops we have the more infrastructure we can afford to provide at each” yes–while this is true for infrastructure and in general terms for speed the speed relationship is certainly not linear for a typical suburban bus route assuming a ‘hailstop’ situation the bus only stops where someone indicates they wish to get on or off as the number of bus stops is increased the numbe of stops where the bus is actually required to stop on any given trip will also increase but at a continually slower rate hence the effects on overall route speed will be diminishingly small hence compared with ‘conventional’ thinking for suburban bus routes we should perhaps go for more stops rather than fewer and keep a lot of them basic to minimise the infrastructure costs we should not worry much about duplicate coverage area but should more focus on minimising the coverage gaps the problem would seem amenable to rational analysis examing a range of reallife route situations and the tradeoffs involved in having more or fewer stops this seeems like an ideal ph d topic–but i assume someone must have already been there and done that jjj november 6 2010 at 1006 pm i think picking a number like 400 meters is not a good strategy unless you’re in manhattan and even then as others have mentioned above there is enough demand that there are various overlapping services it makes more sense to design stop distances on a line by line basis every other city has changes in elevation and changes in density it’s not uncommon to have a few apartment blocks then a ginormous school then a car dealership and then a busy commercial center so instead of placing stops equally apart you might have two in the apartment region one by the front door of the school and then nothing by the athletic fields maybe one by the car dealership and then 2 in the busy commercial district and on top of land use and density you need to take into account connecting lines grade changes and cross streets a rule of thumb may be more harmful than useful someone might say “hey these stops are 1300 meters apart we need something in the middle” even if there’s nothing worth stopping for so a minimum stop distance would definitely be more helpful then a maximum but even then you may want to make exceptions for senior centers and school and hostile pedestrian regions now what makes too many stops a problem dwell time there are better ways to speed up a line than eliminating stops eliminating bus pull outs so buses do not have to merge back into traffic all door boarding pop fare system signal priority bus lanes and a transfer program that allows for localexpress service on the very same lane nothing wrong with a bus stopping every 100 meters if you can ride the express that stops every 1000 meters transfer almost immediately and get taken the next 3 blocks alon levy november 6 2010 at 1019 pm the problem with flag stop operation is that it kills reliability people need to know with as much certainty as practical that the bus will arrive at a specific time if it leaves early or if it’s late because it stopped too much then people learn that the buses are unreliable and choose other modes of transportation if the stops are basic without shelter then it’s even worse all it takes is one downpour and anyone above the poverty line will decide that it’s better to buy a car than wait an unknown number of minutes in the raindavid vartanoff november 7 2010 at 1223 am in a study of delay factors on a major route ac transit oakland et al stop elimination was thought to save 20 to 30 seconds dip swipe fare media wasted far more at the busy stops bottom line more time can be saved by pop or at a minimum flash passes than stop elimination depending on the characteristics of the route a far more useful strategy night be a localexpress mix in base day in another ac case where there is express service during daylight evening locals tend to be faster than daytime expresses but often skip “express” stops as much as “local” stops because ridership is more random as most riders are homeward bound rather than heading to commercial centershallamjon november 7 2010 at 202 am hey in answer to the question the parallel lines should be 400m apart such that when the stop spacing on both lines is also 400m the covered area will be complete and without overlap i’ll also note that whilst this abstract view is a good starting point local issues will demand adjustment as jarett acknowledges approaches like this especially for more rapidtransitlike systems are where public bicycle hire schemes such as paris’s velib are so powerful by turning that walk radius into a much larger cycle radius yours hallamjonhallamjon november 7 2010 at 211 am edit current estimates from such schemes indicate people are willing to cycle a length about three times as far as they’d walk since accessible area goes up by the square of linear length this makes your rapid transit system a factor of nine more useful almost a whole order of magnitude improvement the ‘extreme’ cost of these schemes – transport for london will spend 140m over six years for about 5000 bikes estimated at 100000 daily users to be redeemed by usage fees – should therefore be compared to the build cost of the two additional parallel transit lines that would otherwise be required the expense of which could also be redeemed by the cost of tickets ps sorry for the double post yours hallamjon transit planner munich november 7 2010 at 223 am in munich we have – boarding on all doors with 4 doors on the articulated 18metersbuses – most trips made by monthly passes popsystem – ticket machines inside all buses no tickets sold or checked by the driver – signal priority – bus stops built as curb extensions even elevated for faster and easier access still i would not like to have each 100 meters a stop – even if you have express stops every 1000 meters most passengers will not board on the express stops and also not leave the bus on an express stop so they need then to take a local bus first maybe transfer then to an express and if they are unlucky also transfer again to a local bus to reach their destination – or transfer again to a different line what a torture also in what frequency can you run express buses and local buses parallel on the same line most systems offer not more than a 10minutesfequency for matter of costs if you have then a local bus every 20 minutes and an express every 20 minutes you lose me as a rider already – i am only not sure if i will buy a bike or car instead also in an urban environment inside a city usually an average trip by bus is about 2 kilometers often less you do not want to change between local and express on this distance if you have every 100 meters a bus stop chances are high that during peek hours there will be a rider waiting for you at each of those stops the bus will indeed by stopping boarding accelerating again lose about 25 seconds no matter how smart the system is including the time needed to reach normal speed on the average 2 km of a bus trip made by a rider the bus would stop 20 times losing over 8 minutes with a stop every 400 meters the same distance will be made by the bus 6 minutes faster cause only 2 minutes are lost at bus stops you have to walk in average 75 meters more to and from the stop so 150 meters in total given that the distance to walk from the side streets to the street carrying the bus line will be the same cause with 400 meters stop spacing the maximum walk is 200 meters the average 100 meters minus the average 25 meters you need in comparison for the alternative bus stop spacing of the 100 meters spacing system those 150 meters extra in comparison to the 100meterssystem translate in about 23 minutes extra walking time but you save 6 minutes on the bus so you win in total about 4 minutes and you have on board of the bus the feeling it is moving and not crawling any objections8dave november 7 2010 at 804 am the diagram with nonoptimally overlapping diamonds assumes – falsely – that transit must follow the grid lines transit can be made to run 45 degrees off the grid either by running below eg subway or above eg gondola this leaves optimal corridors with no overlap and no coverage gaps capn transit november 7 2010 at 908 am planner munich i’m talking about an existing system that works on fifthmadison the limited buses stop roughly every 650 meters the limited stops are all at major transfer points or destinations so they have more passengers in practice there is very little transferring from limited to local or vice versa if people at a local stop are in a hurry they’ll walk to the limited bus stop if people at a limited stop are in a hurry they may take the first bus that comes along depending on how far they’re going as far as frequency there are four overlapping services each with about tenminute headways so that in any tenminute period you’re likely to get one limited and three locals you’re welcome to browse the schedules and ridership data for the m1 m2 m3 and m4 jarrett at human transitorg november 7 2010 at 1217 pm  hallamjon no 400m is way too close for parallel lines in most cases geometrically if you want zero duplicate coverage and for the diamonds from one line to completely fill the coverage gaps of the other youd do lines 400m apart but a stop spacing of 800m so that the diamonds of coverage on each route touched only at the points nobody does that however in the real world because its usually more efficient and necessary given street grid for parallel lines to be much more than 400m apart jarrett at human transitorg november 7 2010 at 1219 pm  8dave no transit system not even subways has complete freedom to go anywhere that ideal geography might dictate so youre right that in this case i was stipulating parallel lines because configurations of surface streets and rail lines often requires it transit planner munich november 7 2010 at 1232 pm cap’n transit 650 meters seem quite reasonable for an express but when i calculate it right the “express” obviously a kind of substitute for a nonexisting subway under madison has an average speed of under 12 kilometers per hour opposed to about 8 kilometers per hour for the local service so it is slow versus very slow within munich’s city limits the bus lines have a speed of 15 kilometers per hour to 20 kph there is nothing slower despite a high density in the core city the tram makes about 20 kph i wonder what makes new york buses so slow still i remember crosstown buses that crawled with pedestrian speed along after 10 minutes still the same person outside the window was walking in the same direction as the bus that was depressing and made you feel paralyzed the ridership data itself is really interesting still why are the costs so high in a city here i would expect to have operational costs for a bus line of in average 60 to 120 cents us per rider total costs including investment on some lines lower and germany is not a poor country bus drivers seem to make a lot of money in the us…capn transit november 7 2010 at 113 pm things like this and this are what make new york buses so slowhallamjon november 7 2010 at 137 pm hey oops my mistake i got confused between the ‘diameter’ and the ‘radius’ of the diamond i’m having a brain issue if those are the spacings for the ‘horizontal’ route stops forming a grid pattern is it better for the ‘vertical’ route stops to sit on the same grid so a transfer can be immediate to a horizontal line or is it better to offset them so they fall in the gaps so that a choice of two horizontal lines are available hallamjon yours hallamjon transit planner munich november 7 2010 at 231 pm cap’n transit yeah i especially like the “walls of buses” cutting off residents from medical service probably food supply and education too cause they will be unable to cross the street with this horrible transitway the same fears were existing regarding a tram project in munich no one will ever be able to cross a street anymore cause of the constant stream of trams pouring down the street all empty of course the transit agency loves to spend huge sums to operate empty trams just to be mean to the people alon levy november 7 2010 at 501 pm new york’s buses do not have signal priority they rely on signal optimization which gives priority to northsouth traffic traveling at 40 kmh when i’m in a taxi late at night on one of the oneway avenues i go multiple tens of blocks without hitting a single red light of course during the daytime or on a bus it’s impossible to keep up so you always hit red lights once every few blocks eastwest buses are even worse because there’s no optimization at all driving or taking a bus on such a street you can expect half the lights you hit to be red engineer scotty november 7 2010 at 1106 pm they should just connect all the trams together in one long circular loop like a giant amusement park ride in brisbane november 8 2010 at 204 am what about bicycles in cities with lots of cycling would it be justifiable to have a slightly larger spacing transit planner munich november 8 2010 at 315 am in brisbane even if you have a high proportion of cycling it does not mean that people would like to ride with their bike to the next bus stop some would but the population is diverse most people who like to go by bike would use the bike then rather for the complete distance if they cannot reach a stop by walking especially when the bus has an average speed of 10 kph or so it makes public transport even more difficult if you have to take care of your bike in addtion to the bus trip and not everyone can ride a bike or wants to ride a bike even if he has no car making bus stop spacing very wide like every 1000 meters and telling then the people to use a bike to get there sounds like a bad excuse for bad service as if your local supermarket would put 5metersshelves everywhere saying it cuts costs and you do not need so much floor space to cross until you come to the product you want and then offers you ladders to climb up to reach your favorite cereal maybe adding that climbing ladders is also healthy and a good compromise for everyone a winwinsituation to sum it up if the distance to my next bus stop is so large that i need a bike i personally would ride the complete way by bike or buy a car alan robinson november 8 2010 at 618 am i’ve seen several comments here advocating for reduced stop distance on suburban routes i find on these routes that drivers then have to accelerate and decelerate between each one of these stops in order to be able to both see and stop for a potential rider this is made worse when where parked cars reduce the line of sight to the stop at night with poorly illuminated stops drivers are unfamiliar with the route this makes for both a uncomfortable ride and a feeling that the bus is going slower than it should alon levy november 8 2010 at 1212 pm re suburban stops here’s an illustrative story on what’s wrong with them i was waiting at a bus stop in hamden connecticut to go to new haven union station the bus comes every half an hour and was scheduled to arrive within 3 minutes at the scheduled time it didn’t arrive it started raining and the bus stop had no shelter so i had to go about 30 meters back to wait outside a store that offered outdoor shelter about 15 minutes late the bus ran through the stop at full speed i got to union station – by hitchhiking ben smith november 8 2010 at 857 pm this is easily your best piece regarding stop spacing if you map out stop spacing on most metro or lrt systems it comes to about a kilometer – give or take also it is a shame that here in north america we seem to afraid to expand stop spacing on local routes since we could use the exercise and most would appreciate the extra speedcalwatch november 8 2010 at 932 pm interestingly transit planner munich’s comment is exactly why los angeles is cancelling half of its rapid buses when you have a local bus running every 20 minutes and a rapid bus running every 20 minutes or worse a local bus every 25 and a rapid every 30 it hurts ridership dramatically better to start running rapid buses as needed once the local headway is more frequent than say every 12 or 15 minutes and forgo the rapid buses during the other dayparts if local service drops below every 15 minutes zoltán november 9 2010 at 603 am “interestingly transit planner munich’s comment is exactly why los angeles is cancelling half of its rapid buses when you have a local bus running every 20 minutes and a rapid bus running every 20

a high headway will clearly extend most journey times as even for passengers at rapid stops the faster journeys won’t come close to cancelling out the extra average wait m1ek november 9 2010 at 1033 am “also it is a shame that here in north america we seem to afraid to expand stop spacing on local routes since we could use the exercise and most would appreciate the extra speed” ben that attitude is why in so many na cities transit is the last resort of the carless and infirm you don’t call your potential customers stupid and lazy if you want more of them it turns out there are very good objective reasons why walkstostop over a certain amount turn off most people and it has nothing to do with laziness nick november 9 2010 at 116 pm zoltan and m1ek additionally the la rapid buses are often no faster than the locals most riders waiting at a rapid stop will take the rapid slowing it down as the fares are processed allowing the local to skip that stop speeding it up i have often ridden in a rapid that would pass and be passed by the same local bus many times in heavy rush hour trafficdavid vartanoff november 10 2010 at 1115 am signal priority is often mentioned but at least in san francisco and the east bay oakland berkeley et al the implementation has been slim and none even where deployed it mostly is disabled or out of service see p 61 here httpwwwactransitorgplanningfocusprojectsintheworksprojectsintheworks3 for a discussion of maintenance issues as a regular rider of the line in question the system seems entirely broken gd november 11 2010 at 620 am two comments from the point of view of a transit user who doesn’t know a localrapid differentiation from his home system or for that matter alternating stops on routesharing lines these services add complexity to the system and thus create problems attracting new customers or being legible for otherwise transitliterate visitors i know it’s kept me from using buses in several systems i used as a visitor isn’t increased frequency one of the ideas perks of having several lines sharing parts of their route if so that advantage just left the building if they don’t serve the same stops or are my infamously horrid mathskills keeping me from understanding this properly ben smith march 1 2011 at 1123 am m1ek i’m referring to having local bus stops every 400m like jarrett suggests instead we have stops about half this distance which does more to slow service to a crawl than to make the route more accessible and once along a local bus route if walking an extra 200m to the stop is a deal breaker then you are fat andor lazy not to mention that you are probably just looking for an excuse not to use transit and if it did stop extra close then you’d probably still not take it because it is too slow which is what happens anyways this does not include those with mobility problems which is why most transit operators also offer a separate handicap service annonymous march 6 2011 at 912 pm i’m skeptical of socalled “threshold” models that assume a hard maximum walking distance for example if the model assumes a walking threshold of 14 mile but the bus you need is 12 mile away it assumes one would prefer to take a perpendicular for 12 a mile and transfer rather than simply walk above the threshold to the direct bus any reasonable ablebodied person however would realize that it’s far faster to simply walk 12 mile to the direct bus and go that way what this means is that the thresholdmodel is not really how people make decisions people simply want to get where they are going as quickly and reliably as possible and if an extra 5 minutes of walking saves 10 minutes of waiting at bus stops then so be it walking also offers the advantage that it is far more reliable than any bus can ever be as almost nothing out of your control can delay you furthermore if you are in a hurry or are cold and need to warm up you always have the option to run all or part of the way when you think at the problem from a time minimization standpoint rather than a walkingdistance standpoint the optimal stop spacing becomes dictated by simple math weighing the time saved by stops being further apart against the extra time walking to a stop are there exceptions to this of course in some cases extra walking can impose a safety risk in addition to a time cost particularly along roads with highspeed traffic and no sidewalk or highcrime areas late at night for these cases a walking threshold is indeed the best way to go as it reflects how people would actually think there is also the case of disabled people who have strict limits in how far they are able to walk fortunately each of these cases are relatively uncommon and are not the type of markets a transit system that wants to boost ridership should be going after anyway disabled people will always place a higher than normal value on the doortodoor aspect of private car transportation and will never consider using transit anyway unless they absolutely cannot afford to get around any other means including bumming rides off friends similarly when a route has stops positioned on streets for which it is unsafe to walk no one will ride it who doesn’t absolutely have to for the common case – ablebodied people walkable streets safe neighborhoods people are simply looking to get where they’re going the fastest and are not going to consider a stop out of reach because it’s 100 feet past the “threshold” max schneider march 4 2012 at 424 pm this is exactly the reason why trams are so great even though you do not like them because the necessary infrastructure for rail is so high tram lines tend to follow mayor streets and tend to go in a straight line towards the destination which means that they actually take the short route which makes them faster than most buses buses on the other hand take the scenic route because everyone and his dog want a stop right in front of their buildingschoolold people’s homewhatever and because they have political clout they get waht they want which is lots of stops on winding circuitous roads – and that’s why buses take forever to arrive furthermore choice riders do get annoyed if the bus doesn’t follow the logical ie short route but goes for the scenic route because they compare bus service to their car trams on the other hand usually take the same short route
