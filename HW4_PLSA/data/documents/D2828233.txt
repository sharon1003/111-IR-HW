the kidney computed tomography ct scan or cat scan is a noninvasive diagnostic imaging procedure that uses a combination of xrays and computer technology to produce horizontal or axial images often called slices of the body a ct scan shows detailed images of any part of the body including the bones muscles fat and organs ct scans are more detailed than standard xrays in standard xrays a beam of energy is aimed at the body part being studied a plate behind the body part captures the variations of the energy beam after it passes through skin bone muscle and other tissue while much information can be obtained from a standard xray a lot of detail about internal organs and other structures is not available in computed tomography the xray beam moves in a circle around the body this allows many different views of the same organ or structure the xray information is sent to a computer that interprets the xray data and displays it in a twodimensional 2d form on a monitor ct scans may be done with or without contrast contrast refers to a substance taken by mouth or injected into an intravenous iv line that causes the particular organ or tissue under study to be seen more clearly contrast examinations may require you to fast for a certain period of time before the procedure your doctor will notify you of this prior to the procedure ct scans of the kidneys can provide more detailed information about the kidneys than standard kidney ureter and bladder kub xrays thus providing more information related to injuries andor diseases of the kidneys ct scans of the kidneys are useful in the examination of one or both of the kidneys to detect conditions such as tumors or other lesions obstructive conditions such as kidney stones congenital anomalies polycystic kidney disease accumulation of fluid around the kidneys and the location of abscesses other related procedures that may be used to diagnose kidney problems include kub xrays kidney biopsy kidney scan kidney ultrasound renal angiogram and renal venogram click image to enlarge how do the kidneys work the body takes nutrients from food and converts them to energy after the body has taken the food that it needs waste products are left behind in the bowel and in the blood the kidneys and urinary system keep chemicals such as potassium and sodium and water in balance and remove a type of waste called urea from the blood urea is produced when foods containing protein such as meat poultry and certain vegetables are broken down in the body urea is carried in the bloodstream to the kidneys two kidneys a pair of purplishbrown organs are located below the ribs toward the middle of the back their function is to remove liquid waste from the blood in the form of urine keep a stable balance of salts and other substances in the blood produce erythropoietin a hormone that aids the formation of red blood cells regulate blood pressure the kidneys remove urea from the blood through tiny filtering units called nephrons each nephron consists of a ball formed of small blood capillaries called a glomerulus and a small tube called a renal tubule urea together with water and other waste substances forms the urine as it passes through the nephrons and down the renal tubules of the kidney what are the reasons for a ct scan of the kidney a ct scan of the kidney may be performed to assess the kidneys for tumors and other lesions obstructions such as kidney stones abscesses polycystic kidney disease and congenital anomalies particularly when another type of examination such as xrays or physical examination is not conclusive ct scans of the kidney may be used to evaluate the retroperitoneum the back portion of the abdomen behind the peritoneal membrane ct scans of the kidney may be used to assist in needle placement in kidney biopsies after the removal of a kidney ct scans may be used to locate abnormal masses in the empty space where the kidney once was ct scans of the kidneys may be
