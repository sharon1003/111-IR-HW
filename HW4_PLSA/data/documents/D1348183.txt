america emigrated mostly because of religious motives as religious society of friends and haugeans organized norwegian immigration to north america began in 1825 when several dozen norwegians left stavanger bound for north america on the sloop restauration often called the norwegian mayflower under the leadership of cleng peerson to a great extent this early emigration from norway was borne out of religious persecution especially for quakers and a local religious group the haugianerne 4cleng peerson the ship landed in new york city where it was at first impounded for exceeding its passenger limit after intervention from president john quincy adams the passengers moved on to settle in kendall new york with the help of andreas stangeland witnessing the opening of the erie canal en route many of these immigrants moved on from the kendall settlement settling in illinois and wisconsin cleng peerson became a traveling emissary for norwegian immigrants and died in a norwegian settlement near cranfills gap texas in 1865 5in 1825 during a period of particularly fierce religious strife in norway in july of that year a group of six dissenting families seeking a haven from the official norwegian state church set sail from stavanger in an undersized sloop the restaurationen when it arrived in new york harbor after an arduous 14week journey the restaurationen caused a sensation and the local press marveled at the bravery of these norwegian pilgrims local quakers helped the destitute emigrants who eventually established a community in upstate new york today their descendants are still known as sloopers 6organized immigration  editwhile about 65 norwegians emigrated via sweden and elsewhere in the intervening years no emigrant ships left norway for the new world until the 1836 departures of the den norske klippe and norden in 1837 a group of immigrants from tinn emigrated via gothenburg to the fox river settlement near presentday sheridan illinois but it was the writings of ole rynning 1809–1838 who traveled to the u s on the ægir in 1837 that energized norwegian immigration 7 8throughout much of the latter part of the 19th century and into the 20th century a vast majority of norwegian emigration to both the united states and canada followed a route commonly shared by most swedish danish and finnish emigrants of the period being via england by means of the monopoly established by the leading shipping lines of great britain primarily the white star line and the cunard line both of which operated chiefly out of liverpool england 9 10 these lines negotiated with smaller feeder lines primarily the wilson line which was based out of the port city of hull on englands east coast to provide emigrants with passage from port cities such as christiania presentday oslo bergen and trondheim to england via hull 11 steamship companies such as cunard and white star included fares for passage on these feeder ship in their overall ticket prices along with railway fares for passage between hull and liverpool and temporary accommodations in numerous hotels owned by the shipping lines in port cities such as liverpool 12 most norwegian emigrants bound for the united states entered the country through new york city with smaller numbers coming through other eastern ports such as boston and philadelphia other shipping lines such as the canadian pacific line 13 which also operated chiefly out of liverpool and the glasgowbased anchor line 14 operated routes to ports in eastern canada primarily quebec city montreal and halifax because canadianbound routes were slightly shorter lines which disembarked at canadian ports often provided quicker passages and cheaper fares the canadian route offered many advantages to the emigrant over traveling to the usa directly they moved on from quebec both by rail and by steamer for another thousand or more miles 1600 km for a steerage fare of slightly less than 900 steamers from quebec canada brought them to toronto canada then the immigrants often traveled by rail for 93 miles to collingwood ontario canada on lake huron from where steamers transported them across lake michigan to chicago milwaukee and green bay not until the start of the 20th century did norwegians accept canada as a land of the second chance this was also true of the many americannorwegians who moved to canada seeking homesteads and new economic opportunities by 1921 onethird of all norwegians in canada had been born in the u s norwegian settlers in front of their sod house in north dakota in 1898 norwegian immigration through the years was predominantly motivated by economic concerns compounded by crop failures norwegian agricultural resources were unable to keep up with population growth and the homestead act promised fertile flat land as a result settlement trended westward with each passing year early norwegian settlements were in pennsylvania massachusetts and illinois but moved westward into wisconsin minnesota and the dakotas later waves of norwegian immigration went to the western states such as washington and oregon and utah through missionary efforts of gaining norwegian and swedish converts by the mormons additionally craftsmen also immigrated to a larger more diverse market until recently there was a norwegian area in sunset park brooklyn originally populated by norwegian craftsmen data from the u s office of immigration statistics showing trends in norwegian immigration to the u s from 1870 to 2016between 1825 and 1925 more than 800000 norwegians immigrated to north america—about onethird of norways population with the majority immigrating to the usa and lesser numbers immigrating to the dominion of canada with the exception of ireland no single country contributed a larger percentage of its population to the united states than norway 15 data from the u s office of immigration statistics of the number of norwegians obtaining lawful permanent resident status in the usa from 1870 to 2016 highlights two peaks in the migration flow the first one in the 1880s and the second one in the first decade of the 20th century it also shows an abrupt decrease

assisted by the kindly services of american quakers went to orleans county in western new york state and settled in what became kendall township in the mid1830s the kendall settlers gave impetus to the westward movement of norwegians by founding a settlement in the fox river area of illinois a small urban colony of norwegians had its genesis in chicago at about the same time immigrant settlements now stood ready to welcome norwegian newcomers who beginning in 1836 arrived annually from illinois norwegian pioneers followed the general spread of population northwestward into wisconsin wisconsin remained the center of norwegian american activity up until the american civil war a war in which a number of norwegian americans fought for the union such as in the 15th wisconsin volunteer regiment in the 1850s norwegian land seekers began moving into both iowa and minnesota and serious migration to the dakotas was underway by the 1870s the majority of norwegian agrarian settlements developed in the northern region of the socalled homestead act triangle between the mississippi and the missouri rivers the upper midwest became the home for most immigrants in 1910 almost 80 percent of the one million or more norwegian americans—the immigrants and their children—lived in that part of the united states in 1990 517 percent of the norwegian american population lived in the midwest minnesota had the largest number minneapolis functioned as a norwegian american capital for secular and religious activities in the pacific northwest the puget sound region and especially

landing place a town where language and way of life so unmistakably remind him of his native land svein nilsson a norwegian american journalist in billedmagazin may 14 1870 this sentiment was expressed frequently as the immigrants attempted to seek acceptance and negotiate entrance into the new society in their segregated farming communities norwegians were spared direct prejudice and might indeed have been viewed as a welcome ingredient in a regions development still a sense of inferiority was inherent in their position the immigrants were occasionally referred to as guests in the united states and they were not immune to condescending and disparaging attitudes by oldstock americans economic adaptation required a certain amount of interaction with a larger commercial environment from working for an american farmer to doing business with the seed dealer the banker and the elevator operator products had to be grown and sold—all of which pulled norwegian farmers into social contact with their american neighbors in places like brooklyn chicago minneapolis and seattle norwegianamericans interacted with the multicultural environment of the city while constructing a complex ethnic community that met the needs of its members it might be said that a scandinavian melting pot existed in the urban setting among norwegians swedes and danes evidenced in residential and occupational patterns in political mobilization and in public commemoration intermarriage promoted interethnic assimilation there are no longer any norwegian immigrant enclaves or neighborhoods in

language in the united states was at its peak between 1900 and world war i then declined in the 1920s and 1930s over one million americans spoke norwegian as their primary language from 1900 to world war i and more than 3000 lutheran churches in the upper midwest used norwegian as their sole language there were hundreds of norwegianlanguage newspapers across the upper midwest decorah posten and skandinaven were major norwegian language newspapers the northfield independent was another notable newspaper the editor was andrew rowberg who collected massive numbers of norwegian births and deaths in u s the file he created is now known as the rowberg file maintained at st olaf college and is commonly used in family research across the usa and norway over 600000 homes received at least one norwegian newspaper in 1910 however use of the language declined in part due to the rise of nationalism among the american population during and after world war i during this period readership of norwegianlanguage publications fell norwegian lutheran churches began to hold their services in english and the younger generation of norwegian americans was encouraged to speak english rather than norwegian when norway itself was liberated from nazi germany in 1945 relatively few norwegian americans under the age of 40 still spoke norwegian as their primary language although many still understood the language as such they were not passing the language on to their children the next generation of norwegian americans some sources stated that today there are 81000 americans who speak norwegian as their primary language however according to the us census only 55475 americans spoke norwegian at home as of 2000 and the american community survey in 2005 showed that only 39524 people use the language at home 25 still most norwegian americans can speak a common norwegian with easy words like hello yes and no today there are still 1209 people who only understand norwegian or who do not speak english well in the united states in 2000 this figure was 215 for those under 17 years old whereas it increased to 216 in 2005 for other age groups the numbers went down for those who are from 18 to 64 years old went down from 915 in 2000 to 491 in 2005 for those who are older than 65 years it went drastically down from 890 to 502 in the same period 25 the norwegian language is likely to never die out in the u s because there is still immigration of course on a much smaller scale but they emigrate often to other areas like texas where the number of norwegian speakers increase many lutheran colleges that were established by immigrants and people of norwegian background such as luther college in decorah iowa pacific lutheran university in tacoma washington and st olaf college in
