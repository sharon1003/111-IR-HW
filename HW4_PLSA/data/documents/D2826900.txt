are you threatened with eviction whether a landlord has mentioned the possibility in passing told you to get out by sundown or served you legal notice to quit leave the premises you need to pay attention eviction is the last resort of a landlord to recover control of his or her property from someone who is not authorized to continue possession are you entitled to possession read your lease every lease should have a section specifically focused on termination of the lease and another on remedies for breaking the lease if you have a valid signed lease that still has time to run—until the end date—you have the right to retain possession if you have paid your rent in full and on time you have the right to retain possession if you are not doing anything prohibited by the lease you have the right to retain possession if you are doing everything required of you by the lease you have the right to retain possession get the idea follow the rules spelled out by the lease and for as long as the lease runs—you will have the right to retain possession of the property in fact by law you have the right to quiet enjoyment of the property you leased this means that the landlord is not allowed to kick you out without reason threaten or harass you regarding your possession of the property shut off the electricity or water to force you to leave or change the locks to keep you out of the apartment it also means that a landlord cannot threaten harass or intimidate you or your guests to force you to leave the apartment of course if your conduct or that of your guests violates the lease or the law a landlord is allowed to complain and confront you and your guests and may try to evict you for that conduct all right so this is getting serious a landlord has given you a written notice of eviction—it looks like a legal document—that orders you to move out of your apartment by the 15th of the month if you accept the notice and move out you have been evicted do you get your security deposit back what about the rent you already paid for the rest of the month if you simply move out you may need to take legal action to get your money back unless you simply give up and walk away poorer and not much smarter if you do not want to move out you are not required to unless a court of law after a hearing of the facts orders your eviction if the court orders you evicted you must be gone by the date specified in the court order or a deputy sheriff will arrive and physically place you and your belongings into the street that is the ultimate eviction if a landlord wants you leave he or she must either convince you to leave voluntarily—without threat harassment or intimidation—or ask a local court to hear the case and decide whether you must leave involuntarily going to court is troublesome irritating and inconvenient for pretty much everybody involved except the judge or magistrate in oakland who gets paid to be there and will not tolerate foolishness or obstruction from you or a landlord what happens is that a landlord must go to the court and file a request for a hearing asking the judge to order your eviction the court prepares a notice of the date and place of the hearing and what the hearing is about and sends you notice if you ignore the notice and the hearing date the court almost certainly will decide the issue in favor of the landlord and issue a court notice ordering you to leave the premises by a specific date that notice usually assigns to you the responsibility of paying the court costs and legal expenses of the hearing that you ignored it may assign all or part of your security deposit the rental balance and even future rent payments to the landlord if you ignore this notice from the court the deputy shows up and you are evicted don’t think you did anything wrong want to fight the eviction first find out what has caused the landlord to want you out loud parties cars parked on the lawn beer cans in the hall unpaid rent nerf balls in the toilet an arrest for drug possession false information on the rental application panhandlers sleeping on the porch a business being run out of the apartment rent checks bouncing your own locks on the door a pit bull puppy garbage dumping in the alley threatening harassing or intimidating your neighbors—these are behaviors for which a landlord may try to evict you if you are doing any of these things talk to the landlord ask forgiveness promise not to do it again get rid of the puppy clean the garbage pay the rent etc and agree to resume the positive relationship that should exist between landlord and tenant this may work the first time but subsequent problems are less likely to end as happily fine if you are going to be like that  let’s go to court the landlord is required to give you a notice to quit before filing with the court unless you waived that right in your lease read the lease carefully ten to 30 days after the notice to quit a request for a hearing can be filed with the court and a date set if you waived your right to notice the hearing notice could be the first document you receive you must receive notice of the hearing and should attend do you need an attorney no but it is a good idea to talk to one about your problem and how to proceed at a minimum you should have a copy of your lease carefully note and read the relevant sections your notice from the court and any correspondence or notes relevant to your relationship with the landlord as a college student you should be able to frame a reasonable argument and be articulate enough to present it to the judge experience in debate or parliamentary proceedings may be an asset as long as you avoid a clumsy or combative lawyerlookalike impersonation a judge can order a landlord’s request to evict to be ignored or followed a judge can assign court costs and legal expenses if any to be paid by one or both of the parties the judge can order you to pay rent penalties or even the entire amount of rent due for the entire term of your lease the judge may order any or any combination of penalties he sees fit it is important to understand that the worst case may include lost of deposit loss of apartment immediate payment of the entire amount due under the lease agreement costs and expenses you do not want to experience that level of retribution for violating the lease or the law nor is it unreasonable to expect that by following the lease and the law you will be free from harassment threat intimidation or legal action you may choose or an attorney might recommend to file a counterclaim against your landlord to be adjudicated simultaneously with the eviction hearing your claim might include court costs legal expenses recovery of security deposit and rent payments termination of the lease and penalties and would be based on the landlord’s failure to honor the terms of the lease or the law you may also be able to settle an outstanding obligation – unpaid rent or damages —anytime prior to eviction and the action will be stopped this depends upon the ruling by the magistrate that’s the story eviction is a legal process by which a landlord reclaims his or her property from a tenant who has violated the terms of the lease or the law the landlord has rights and responsibilities in undertaking to evict a tenant the tenant also has rights and responsibilities under the lease and the law that protect him or her from unreasonable or discriminatory conduct by the landlord in a hearing with a judge the rights of both parties to the dispute are protected and responsibilities are assigned win or lose both parties have their day in court the judge’s decision is final yes there is an appeal process but that is another story for more information review the pennsylvania
