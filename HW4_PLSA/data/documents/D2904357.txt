guess how much americans plan to spend on christmas and halloween this year…by michael snyder on october 27th 2014it is that magical time of the year for retailers the period between midoctober and late december can often make the difference between success or failure in the retail industry and this year will be no exception as you will see below it is being projected that americans will spend a massive amount of money this holiday season in fact what americans plan to spend on christmas this year is greater than the yearly gdp of the entire nation of sweden so isn’t this good economic news shouldn’t we be happy that americans are opening up their wallets so eagerly well it depends how you look at it even though our spending is increasing our incomes are not as i discussed the other day 50 percent of american workers make less than 28031 dollars a year and incomes have been stagnant for years that means that any increases in spending must be funded by more debt and that is not good news at all in 2014 approximately 70 percent of all americans will participate in halloween it seems like with each passing year this dark holiday become even more popular and before it is all said and done it is being projected that americans will spend a whopping 74 billion dollars this time around…kicking off the end of year spending season is halloween just how much do americans spend on t rickortreating and other halloween festivities the national retail federation nrf forecasts total halloween spending—including candy costumes and decorations— to come in at 74 billion this year that 74 billion dollars includes 2 billion dollars for halloween candy and 350 million dollars for pet halloween costumes yes you read that correctly we are collectively going to spend 350 million dollars on halloween costumes for our cats and dogs overall spending on halloween has risen by more than 55 percent since 2005 it just seems like americans can’t get enough of this particular holiday but of course what americans spend on halloween is not even worth comparing to what americans spend on christmas according to the national retail federation more than 90 percent of americans celebrate either christmas kwanza or hanukkah and christmas in particular has become virtually synonymous with materialism this year the national retail federation is projecting that americans will spend more than 600 billion dollars just on christmas that represents a huge chunk of our gdp as a nation most of that money will be spent on christmas gifts according to a gallup survey that was just released the average u s adult plans to spend 781 dollars on christmas gifts this year which is significantly up from last year…americans’ initial estimates of the total amount they will spend on christmas gifts this year point to an aboveaverage holiday season for the nation’s retailers while gallup’s october spending forecast is a warmup to its key measure in november it finds americans expecting to spend 781 on average up from 704 last november of course holiday spending does not end there there are trees to put up packages to send out and decorations to buy the following numbers are from a forbes article about what an average american typically spends during a christmas season…christmas tree 4150cards and postage 3243floral arrangements 2261food and candy 9504decorations 5143travel 96050so where is all of this money coming from that is a key question if our incomes were going up all of this spending might be good news but as the following chart from the federal reserve demonstrates that is not the case…our incomes are stagnant at best but americans always like to party as if it were the best of times so they will pull out their credit cards and spend what they feel they need to spend in order to feel happy once again this year but deep down most people realize that this debtfueled party cannot last forever deep down most people realize that we have some incredibly serious longterm problems that need to be fixed sadly no matter which political party occupies the white house and no matter which political party controls congress our longterm problems only seem to get even worse as our problems have multiplied over time americans have become angrier and angrier and right now is election season and so that is very bad news for democrats …nearly 7 in 10 americans are angry at the direction the country is headed and 53 of americans disapprove of president barack obama’s job performance two troubling signs for democrats one week before the midterm elections a new cnnorc international poll shows democrats are battling to try and save the senate majority while hoping to prevent more losses in the house which the gop controls by a 234 to 201 margin in the senate republicans need a net gain of six seats and several state polls in the past month of contested races show that democrats are in danger of losing control of the majority and thus congress if the republicans do take control of both houses of congress will that fundamentally change the direction of the country i wish that i could believe that but at this point most republicans are virtually indistinguishable from most democrats in other words it is very hard to tell them apart as a nation we are steamrolling toward a date with oblivion but everyone is trying to put such a happy face on things well enjoy this time of relative stability while you can because it is going to end way too soon october 27th 2014  tags christmas debt debts economic news good economic news good news
