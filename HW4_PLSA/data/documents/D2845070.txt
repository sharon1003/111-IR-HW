thanks for your time addressing this reply kim wormwood has been used since ancient times but each person reacts differently to it  there isn’t significant clinical evidence for dosing recommendations erowidorg published a collection of guides covering wormwood the dosing information not only depends on a person’s size  make up but also depends on what a person means by “a drop” as well as how concentrated the solution is here are some other online sources with dosing recommendations  drugscom “traditional use for treating dyspepsia was dosed at 3 to 5 g daily as an infusion or 2 to 3 g daily as the herb”  how stuff works “take 18 teaspoon before meals”  new way herbs “use 612 drops” of their proprietary extract  richard whelan “around 1020 drops”if you are new to something then it is typically better to be cautious with the dosing amount and you can see some of the further potential complications listed on the drugscom website further please feel free to contact your doctor
