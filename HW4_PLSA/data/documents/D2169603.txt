why is my pregnancy test still positive 2 weeks after an abortion 111011i had a surgical abortion when i was 7 weeks pregnant it is now my second week after the abortion but still my home pregnancy test hpt shows positive why my doctor says that i could have an ectopic pregnancy but there are no such symptoms of it also i had a clear usg of the entire abdomen please explainthe pregnancy test remains positive for a while after an abortion the following information is from the new 20thedition of contraceptive technology pregnancy testing and assessment of early normaland abnormal pregnancy mary fjerstad np mhsalison edelman md mphh cg l evels a fter p regnancy c ompletionafter a pregnancy ends in delivery or by abortion h cg levels gradually decrease figure 23–3 represents the h cg

h cg after fullterm delivery is quite rapid so that a h cg level following the delivery will have dropped to less than 50 m iu within 2 weeks and h cg will be undetectable after 3 to 4 weeks

surgical treatment of ectopic pregnancy pregnancy testing and assessment contraceptive technologyif firsttrimester vacuum aspiration or medication abortion successfully ended the pregnancy h cg clears normally from the bloodstream as expected and the h cg level declines steadily halving at least every 48 hours after vacuum aspiration and after medication abortion or halving within 2 to 4 days of taking misoprostol when patients have medication abortion h cg continues to increase following mifepristone but then declines precipitously after administration of misoprostol however since h cg levels are near their peak at about 10 to 12 weeks lmp h cg levels may still be high enough 2 weeks following an abortion that pregnancy tests—both bloodbased and urine—will still be positive sensitive pregnancy tests including commonlyused office or home use urinetest kits are likely to be positive between 16 to 60 days by the first followup visit 6 to 18 days after taking mifepristone h cg levels drop to 20 of the initial value measured on the day of mifepristone intake in 985 of successful medication abortions howeverit is possible for some successful medication abortion patients to have h cg levels decline with a lengthy plateau patients who require uterine evacuation intervention less than 15 days after medication abortion due to prolonged bleeding or pain generally have higher absolute and relative h cg values than women with normal courses whose h cg valuesdrop sharply unfortunately due to overlap of h cg levels between those with a successful medication abortion and those who require uterine aspiration no clinical decisions regarding uterine evacuation can be made based on h cg levels alone in the case of a continuing pregnancy h cg levels will demonstrate an upward trend over 2 days a mean rise of 124 and a minimum rise of 5325 if an ectopic pregnancy continues to evolve after medication or vacuum aspiration abortion h cg values can behave erratically thesepatterns are discussed in more detail in the section managing problems in early pregnancy research has demonstrated the expected fall of h cg following successfulmedication abortion the outcome of medication abortion can be followed by quantitative h cg instead of ultrasound and this may save a woman from returning to the clinic for an inperson examination especially if she travels great distance to receive mifepristone and plans to selfadminister the misoprostol at home draw a quantitative h cg on the day the woman receives mifepristone in the clinic the level is expected to drop by 50 within 4 days of receiving mifepristone if the pregnancy aborted if h cg is tested 6 to 18 days after receiving mifepristone a drop of 80 has a very strong predictive value in confirming successful
