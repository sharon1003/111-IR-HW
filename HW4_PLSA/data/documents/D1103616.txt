pharmacologybutalbital acetaminophen caffeine and codeine phosphate capsule is a combination drug product intended as a treatment for tension headache butalbital acetaminophen caffeine and codeine phosphate capsule consists of a fixed combination of butalbital 50 mg acetaminophen 325 mg and caffeine 40 mg the role each component plays in the relief of the complex of symptoms known as tension headache is incompletely understood pharmacokinetics the behavior of the individual components is described below codeine codeine is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract it is rapidly distributed from the intravascular spaces to the various body tissues with preferential uptake by parenchymatous organs such as the liver spleen and kidney codeine crosses the bloodbrain barrier and is found in fetal tissue and breast milk the plasma concentration does not correlate with brain concentration or relief of pain however codeine is not bound to plasma proteins and does not accumulate in body tissues the plasma halflife is about 29 hours the elimination of codeine is primarily via the kidneys and about 90 of an oral dose is excreted by the kidneys within 24 hours of dosing the urinary secretion products consist of free and glucuronide conjugated codeine about 70 free and conjugated norcodeine about 10 free and conjugated morphine about 10 normorphine 4 and hydrocodone 1 the remainder of the dose is excreted in the feces at therapeutic doses the analgesic effect reaches a peak within 2 hours and persists between 4 and 6 hours see overdosage for toxicity information butalbital butalbital is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is expected to distribute to most tissues in the body barbiturates in general may appear in breast milk and readily cross the placental barrier they are bound to plasma and tissue proteins to a varying degree and binding increases directly as a function of lipid solubility elimination of butalbital is primarily via the kidney 59 – 88 of the dose as unchanged drug or metabolites the plasma halflife is about 35 hours urinary excretion products include parent drug about 36 of the dose 5isobutyl5 23dihydroxypropyl barbituric acid about 24 of the dose 5allyl5 3hydroxy2methyl1propyl barbituric acid about 48 of the dose products with the barbituric acid ring hydrolyzed with excretion of urea about 14 of the dose as well as unidentified materials of the material excreted in the urine 32 is conjugated the in vitro plasma protein binding of butalbital is 45 over the concentration range of 0520 mcgm l this falls within the range of plasma protein binding 20 – 45 reported with other barbiturates such as phenobarbital pentobarbital and secobarbital sodium the plasmatoblood concentration ratio was almost unity indicating that there is no preferential distribution of butalbital into either plasma or blood cells see overdosage for toxicity information caffeine like most xanthines caffeine is rapidly absorbed and distributed in all body tissues and fluids including the cns fetal tissues and breast milk caffeine is cleared through metabolism and excretion in the urine the plasma halflife is about 3 hours hepatic biotransformation prior to excretion results in about equal amounts of 1methylxanthine and 1methyluric acid of the 70 of the dose that is recovered in the urine only 3 is unchanged drug see overdosage for toxicity information acetaminophen acetaminophen is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is distributed throughout most body tissues the plasma halflife is 125 – 3 hours but may be increased by liver damage and following overdosage elimination of acetaminophen is principally by liver metabolism conjugation and subsequent renal excretion of metabolites approximately 85 of an oral dose appears in the urine within 24 hours of administration most as the glucuronide conjugate with small amounts of other conjugates and unchanged drug see overdosage for toxicity information indications and usagebutalbital acetaminophen caffeine and codeine phosphate capsule is indicated for the relief of the symptom complex of tension or muscle contraction headache evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of butalbital acetaminophen caffeine and codeine phosphate capsule in the treatment of multiple recurrent headaches is unavailable caution in this regard is required because codeine and butalbital are habitforming and potentially abusable contraindicationsthis combination product is contraindicated under the following conditions– hypersensitivity or intolerance to acetaminophen caffeine butalbital or codeine– patients with porphyria warningsin the presence of head injury or other intracranial lesions the respiratory depressant effects of codeine and other narcotics may be markedly enhanced as well as their capacity for elevating cerebrospinal fluid pressure narcotics also produce other cns depressant effects such as drowsiness that may further obscure the clinical course of the patients with head injuries codeine or other narcotics may obscure signs on which to judge the diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions butalbital and codeine are both habitforming and potentially abusable consequently the extended use of butalbital acetaminophen caffeine and codeine phosphate capsule is not recommended precautionsgeneral butalbital acetaminophen caffeine and codeine phosphate capsule should be prescribed with caution in certain specialrisk patients such as the elderly or debilitated and those with severe impairment of renal or hepatic function head injuries elevated intracranial pressure acute abdominal conditions hypothyroidism urethral stricture addisons disease or prostatic hypertrophy ultrarapid metabolizers of codeine some individuals may be ultrarapid metabolizers due to a specific cyp2d62x2 genotype these individuals convert codeine into its active metabolite morphine more rapidly and completely than other people this rapid conversion results in higherthanexpected serum morphine levels even at labeled dosage regimens individuals who are ultrarapid metabolizers may experience overdose symptoms such as extreme sleepiness confusion or shallow breathing the prevalence of this cyp2d6 phenotype varies widely and has been estimated at 05 to 1 in chinese and japanese 05 to 1 in hispanics 1–10 in caucasians 3 in african americans and 16–28 in north africans ethiopians and arabs data is not available for other ethnic groups when physicians prescribe codeinecontaining drugs they should choose the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time and should inform their patients about these risks and the signs of morphine overdose see precautions  nursing mothers  information for patients butalbital acetaminophen caffeine and codeine phosphate capsule may impair mental andor physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery such tasks should be avoided while taking butalbital acetaminophen caffeine and codeine phosphate capsule alcohol and other cns depressants may produce an additive cns depression when taken with butalbital acetaminophen caffeine and codeine phosphate capsule and should be avoided codeine and butalbital may be habitforming patients should take the drug only for as long as it is prescribed in the amounts prescribed and no more frequently than prescribed for information on use in geriatric patients see precautionsgeriatric use caution patients that some people have a variation in a liver enzyme and change codeine into morphine more rapidly and completely than other people these people are ultrarapid metabolizers and are more likely to have higherthannormal levels of morphine in their blood after taking codeine which can result in overdose symptoms such as extreme sleepiness confusion or shallow breathing in most cases it is unknown if someone is an ultrarapid codeine metabolizer nursing mothers taking codeine can also have higher morphine levels in their breast milk if they are ultrarapid metabolizers these higher levels of morphine in breast milk may lead to lifethreatening or fatal side effects in nursing babies instruct nursing mothers to watch for signs of morphine toxicity in their infants including increased sleepiness more than usual difficulty breastfeeding breathing difficulties or limpness instruct nursing mothers to talk to the babys doctor immediately if they notice these signs and if they cannot reach the doctor right away to take the baby to an emergency room or call 911 or local emergency services laboratory tests in patients with severe hepatic or renal disease effects of therapy should be monitored with serial liver andor renal function tests drug interactions the cns effects of butalbital may be enhanced by monoamine oxidase mao inhibitors butalbital acetaminophen caffeine and codeine phosphate capsule may enhance the effects of– other narcotic analgesics alcohol general anesthetics tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide sedativehypnotics or other cns depressants causing increased cns depression druglaboratory test interactions codeine codeine may increase serum amylase levels acetaminophen acetaminophen may produce falsepositive test results for urinary 5hydroxyindoleacetic acid carcinogenesis mutagenesis impairment of fertility no adequate studies have been conducted in animals to determine whether acetaminophen codeine and butalbital have a potential for carcinogenesis or mutagenesis no adequate studies have been conducted in animals to determine whether acetaminophen and butalbital have a potential for impairment of fertility pregnancy teratogenic effects pregnancy category c animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with butalbital acetaminophen caffeine and codeine phosphate capsule it is also not known whether butalbital acetaminophen caffeine and codeine phosphate capsule can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity butalbital acetaminophen caffeine and codeine phosphate capsule should be given to a pregnant woman only when clearly needed nonteratogenic effects withdrawal seizures were reported in a twodayold male infant whose mother had taken a butalbitalcontaining drug during the last 2 months of pregnancy butalbital was found in the infants serum the infant was given phenobarbital 5 mgkg which was tapered without further seizure or other withdrawal symptoms labor and delivery use of codeine during labor may lead to respiratory depression in the neonate nursing mothers caffeine butalbital and acetaminophen is excreted in breast milk in small amounts but the significance of its effects on nursing infants is not known because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from caffeine butalbital and acetaminophen a decision should be made whether to discontinue the drug taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother codeine is secreted into human milk in women with normal codeine metabolism normal cyp2d6 activity the amount of codeine secreted into human milk is low and dosedependent despite the common use of codeine products to manage postpartum pain reports of adverse events in infants are rare however some women are ultrarapid metabolizers of codeine these women achieve higherthanexpected serum levels of codeines active metabolite morphine leading to higherthanexpected levels of morphine in breast milk and potentially dangerously high serum morphine levels in their breastfed infants therefore maternal use of codeine can potentially lead to serious adverse reactions including death in nursing infants the prevalence of this cyp2d6 phenotype varies widely and has been estimated at 05 to 1 in chinese and japanese 05 to 1 in hispanics 1–10 in caucasians 3 in african americans and 16–28 in north africans ethiopians and arabs data is not available for other ethnic groups the risk of infant exposure to codeine and morphine through breast milk should be weighed against the benefits of breastfeeding for both the mother and baby caution should be exercised when codeine is administered to a nursing woman if a codeinecontaining product is selected the lowest dose should be prescribed for the shortest period of time to achieve the desired clinical effect mothers using codeine should be informed about when to seek immediate medical care and how to identify the signs and symptoms of neonatal toxicity such as drowsiness or sedation difficulty breastfeeding breathing difficulties and decreased tone in their baby nursing mothers who are ultrarapid metabolizers may also experience overdose symptoms such as extreme sleepiness confusion or shallow breathing prescribers should closely monitor motherinfant pairs and notify treating pediatricians about the use of codeine during breastfeeding see precautions – general  ultrarapid metabolizers of codeine pediatric use safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established geriatric use clinical studies of butalbital acetaminophen caffeine and codeine phosphate capsules did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients in general dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious usually starting at the low end of the dosing range reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic renal or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy butalbital is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function care should be taken in dose selection and it may be useful to monitor renal function adverse reactionsfrequently observed the most frequently reported adverse reactions are drowsiness lightheadedness dizziness sedation shortness of breath nausea vomiting abdominal pain and intoxicated feeling infrequently observed all adverse events tabulated below are classified as infrequent central nervous headache shaky feeling tingling agitation fainting fatigue heavy eyelids high energy hot spells numbness

vomiting drowsiness lightheadedness constipation pruritus several cases of dermatological reactions including toxic epidermal necrolysis and erythema multiforme have been reported for butalbital acetaminophen and caffeine tablets drug abuse and dependencecontrolled substance butalbital acetaminophen caffeine and codeine phosphate capsule is controlled by the drug enforcement administration and is classified under schedule iii abuse and dependence codeine codeine can produce drug dependence of the morphine type and therefore has the potential for being abused psychological dependence physical dependence and tolerance may develop upon repeated administration and it should be prescribed and administered with the same degree of caution appropriate to the use of other oral narcotic medications butalbital barbiturates may be habitforming tolerance psychological dependence and physical dependence may occur especially following prolonged use of high doses of barbiturates the average daily dose for the barbiturate addict is usually about 1500 mg as tolerance to barbiturates develops the amount needed to maintain the same level of intoxication increases tolerance to a fatal dosage however does not increase more than twofold as this occurs the margin between an intoxication dosage and fatal dosage becomes smaller the lethal dose of a barbiturate is far less if alcohol is also ingested major withdrawal symptoms convulsions and delirium may occur within 16 hours and last up to 5 days after abrupt cessation of these drugs intensity of withdrawal symptoms gradually declines over a period of approximately 15 days treatment of barbiturate dependence consists of cautious and gradual withdrawal of the drug barbituratedependent patients can be withdrawn by using a number of different withdrawal regimens one method involves initiating treatment at the patients regular dosage level and gradually decreasing the daily dosage as tolerated by the patient overdosagefollowing an acute overdosage of butalbital acetaminophen caffeine and codeine phosphate capsule toxicity may result from the barbiturate the codeine or the acetaminophen toxicity due to the caffeine is less likely due to the relatively small amounts in this formulation signs and symptoms toxicity from barbiturate poisoning include drowsiness confusion and coma respiratory depression hypotension and hypovolemic shock toxicity from codeine poisoning includes the opioid triad of pinpoint pupils depression of respiration and loss of consciousness convulsions may occur in acetaminophen overdosage dosedependent potentially fatal hepatic necrosis is the most serious adverse effect renal tubular necroses hypoglycemic coma and thrombocytopenia may also occur early symptoms following a potentially hepatotoxic overdose may include nausea vomiting diaphoresis and general malaise clinical and laboratory evidence of hepatic toxicity may not be apparent until 48–72 hours postingestion in adults hepatic toxicity has rarely been reported with acute overdoses of less than 10 grams or fatalities with less than 15 grams acute caffeine poisoning may cause insomnia restlessness tremor and delirium tachycardia and extrasystoles treatment a single or multiple overdose with butalbital acetaminophen caffeine and codeine phosphate capsule is a potentially lethal polydrug overdose and consultation with a regional poison control center is recommended immediate treatment includes support of cardiorespiratory function and measures to reduce drug absorption vomiting should be induced mechanically or with syrup of ipecac if the patient is alert adequate pharyngeal and laryngeal reflexes oral activated charcoal 1 gkg should follow gastric emptying the first dose should be accompanied by an appropriate cathartic if repeated doses are used the cathartic might be included with alternate doses as required hypotension is usually hypovolemic and should respond to fluids the value of vasopressor agents such as norepinephrine or phenylephrine hydrochloride in treating hypotension is questionable since they increase vasoconstriction and decrease blood flow however if prolonged support of blood pressure is required norepinephrine bitartrate levophed® may be given i v with the usual precautions and serial blood pressure monitoring a cuffed endotracheal tube should be inserted before gastric lavage of the unconscious patient and when necessary to provide assisted respiration if renal function is normal forced diuresis may aid in the elimination of the barbiturate alkalinization of the urine increases renal excretion of some barbiturates especially phenobarbital meticulous attention should be given to maintaining adequate pulmonary ventilation in severe cases of intoxication peritoneal dialysis or preferably hemodialysis may be considered if hypoprothrombinemia occurs due to acetaminophen overdose vitamin k should be administered intravenously naloxone a narcotic antagonist can reverse respiratory depression and coma associated with opioid overdose naloxone 04–2 mg is given parenterally since the duration of action of codeine may exceed that of the naloxone the patient should be kept under continuous surveillance and repeated doses of the antagonist should be administered as needed to maintain adequate respiration a narcotic antagonist should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or cardiovascular depression if the dose of acetaminophen may have exceeded 140 mgkg nacetylcysteine should be administered as early as possible serum acetaminophen levels should be obtained since levels 4 or more hours following ingestion help predict acetaminophen toxicity do not await acetaminophen assay results before initiating treatment hepatic enzymes should be obtained initially and repeated at 24hour intervals methemoglobinemia over 30 should be treated with methylene
