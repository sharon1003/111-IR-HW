understanding melanoma diagnosing melanoma skin biopsy if the physical examination shows evidence of a suspected melanoma your doctor will recommend a skin biopsy a procedure to remove all or part of the mole for evaluation under a microscope the biopsy provides important information whether the mole is benign or malignant if malignant how deeply the tumor has penetrated the skin and whether there are associated signs of ulceration a skin biopsy is quick and about as uncomfortable as having blood drawn the physician will clean the area to be biopsied with alcohol and then inject a small amount of local anesthetic because the anesthetic makes the skin swell and has a low p h it burns for about 5 to 10 seconds it is similar to the anesthetic used by dentists once the anesthetic has taken effect the doctor will use a scalpel a razor blade or a small circular blade called a “punch” to free a small piece of skin because the skin is numb the patient can feel pressure but no pain during this part of the procedure if a deep biopsy is taken 1 or 2 stitches are used to close the wound if the biopsy is superficial the wound is left open to heal like deep scrape the whole process usually takes about 5 minutes often skin samples are sent to a dermatopathologist types of biopsies different methods can be used to do a skin biopsy doctors will choose the type of biopsy depending on the size of the affected area and the location on the body excisional biopsy the doctor cuts out the entire suspicious lesion this is the preferred method for small lesions description typically this would happen in the doctor’s office as an outpatient procedure under a local anesthetic what you’ll feel you will feel a needle stick and about 10 seconds of burning when the doctor anesthetizes the lesion once the spot is anesthetized you may feel pressure but no pain from the surgery as the doctor cuts though the skin and removes the tumor the doctor finishes by sewing the wound together how long does it take the procedure usually takes less than an hour afterwards some overthecounter pain medication will ease any pain coming from the site of the surgery you’ll probably need a return visit for the doctor to remove stitches and check your healing incisional biopsy the doctor may recommend taking just a portion of the lesion this may occur because the lesion is too large for an excisional biopsy or because taking it all would destroy important tissue as on the face or hands or leave scars description incisional biopsies are performed in the doctor’s office under local anesthetic one type called a punch biopsy uses an instrument that resembles a tiny round cookie cutter with a diameter of 3 4 or 6 millimeters 18″ 16″ or 14″ incisional biopsies can also be made with a scalpel which will give you a more elliptical wound what you’ll feel while it is a surgical procedure you won’t experience much pain you’ll feel a needle stick and a little burning with some pressure when you receive the anesthetic but as it takes effect you won’t feel any pain from the surgery as the doctor removes a portion of the lesion with the tool the doctor finishes by sewing the wound together how long does it take the procedure usually takes less than an hour afterwards some overthecounter pain medication will ease any pain coming from the site of the surgery you’ll probably need a return visit for the doctor to remove stitches and check your healing superficial shave biopsy this is a process used for superficial skin disease when a deeper tissue cut is not required such as melanoma in situ skin tags or seborrheic keratoses description in a shave biopsy the doctor numbs the area with a local anesthetic and then “shaves” off the top layers of the skin the epidermis and a part of the dermis with a surgical blade what you’ll feel a needle stick and a little burning with some pressure when the anesthetic is injected it is usually about as uncomfortable as having one’s blood drawn once the anesthetic takes effect you may feel pressure but no pain as the physician shaves off of the top layers of skin superficial shave biopsies are discouraged for suspected melanomas other than melanoma in situ suspected melanomas require biopsies of the full thickness of the skin and underlying fat superficial shave biopsies may not go deep enough to give an adequate tissue sample in order to determine tumor depth ulceration or mitotic index other superficial techniques such as freezing and cauterizing tissue samples are also not recommended for similar reasons deep shave biopsy saucerizationthis biopsy technique is like a superficial shave biopsy but is used to obtain a deeper specimen and is often used when biopsing lesions suspected of being melanoma description saucerization procedures are performed in the doctor’s office under local anesthetic a doctor uses a surgical blade to “scoop out” the suspicious lesion and a sufficient depth of skin beneath it to be able to stage the cancer what you’ll feel while it is a surgical procedure you won’t experience much pain you’ll feel a needle stick and a little burning with some pressure when you receive the anesthetic but as it takes affect you won’t feel any pain from the surgery as the doctor removes a portion of the lesion the wound is not usually sewn closed but is left to heal from the inside out how long does it take the procedure usually takes less than 10 minutes afterwards some over the counter pain medication will ease any pain coming from the site of the surgery what to ask your doctor before a biopsy you may find it helpful to print out these questions and bring them with you to your next doctor’s visit diagnosis questions your notes what information do you hope to gain from the biopsy what is the likelihood that the biopsy will establish a diagnosis can the diagnosis be established by any other methods treatment questions your notes how is the biopsy done is the procedure painful is a local or general anesthetic involved how safe is the biopsy procedure can the biopsy be performed in your office or must the procedure be done in a hospital will you be removing the entire lesion or a part of the lesion why how many samples will be removed how large is the tissue fragment to be removed how long will the procedure take can i go about my normal daily activities afterward side effect quesetions your notes will i have pain or scarring afterward will i need stitches how do i take care of the biopsy site what should i do if i think i have an infection what does an infection at a biopsy site look like are there any complications that might arise as a result of the biopsy procedure if complications develop what should i do or whom should i contact you should also ask your notes who will explain the results of the biopsy to me how long will i wait until a result is available how will i be informed about the result of the biopsy related content pathology
