boxing’s poet laureate composing verses in which he taunted opponents and praised himself his iambic pentameter was so popular that columbia records released a 1963 spoken word album called “i am the

hit “stand by me”ali has irish roots perhaps not surprising given ali’s gift of gab but his greatgrandfather abe grady was an irishman who emigrated to the united states and settled in kentucky in the

won the light heavyweight gold medal in the 1960 summer olympics ali wrote in his 1975 autobiography that after returning to louisville he threw his gold medal off a bridge and into the ohio river to protest the racism that he still encountered in his hometown the account has been disputed however and it is believed that ali lost the medal instead during the 1996 summer olympics at which he lit the cauldron in the opening ceremonies ali received a replacement gold medal the gloves he wore to defeat liston earned him more money than the victory itself almost 50 years to the day after ali captured the heavyweight championship for the first time an anonymous buyer purchased the gloves he wore to defeat liston in the seventhround technical knockout for 836000 ali only earned 630000 for the victory itself
