back to index stanford university the future of the hoover institution education following long discussions the hoover institution is about the undergo a major transformation this may not be clear from the official announcement the key phrase in it is renewed emphasis on its founding mission since i have been associated with the hoover institution far longer than anyone at stanford my account should be of some significance in this regard i knew the hoover institution before the tower was built when in the 1930s it was just a big storage room in what is what is now green library in the care of ralph lutz and harold fisher both historians i came to know harold fisher well he was to use an oldfashioned expression a gentleman and a scholar i remember him with gratitude for the warmth with which he treated me such warmth seems to have declined as the university has grown i saw herbert hoover frequently since we live near the presidents house but i talked with him only once in his office in the hoover tower he had become very taciturn really i knew the second herbert hoover since there were two the first was the young idealist the most respected indeed popular man in america full of the ideal of bringing about world peace and solving the problems which cause revolutions hence the name the hoover institution on war revolution and peace it was the creation of the first herbert hoover the second herbert hoover whom i knew was a bitter man crushed by defeat and generally unbeloved he was blamed unfairly for the depression and for the shooting of the veterans in washington really the work of douglas mac arthur poor people lived in hoovervilles the hoover tower was known as hoovers last erection there was talk of abolishing the hoover institute to make it clear that it was not an institute in the american sense eg summer institute the name was changed to hoover institution and it was given an active political party role which it did not have before hoover was so resentful of the way stanford treated him that he left and went home to west branch iowa where he and his wife sleep in peace respected and unmolested whatever one may think of his policies the american public and the stanford community in particular were ungracious and unkind to him indeed the stanford faculty often seems at odds with public opinion the similar scorn heaped later on ronald reagan showed how badly most of my colleagues had assessed him i was on the first committee which tried to clarify the relationship between the hoover library and the main library even then it was a thorny problem this is the issue which has now led to a decision which is really a victory for the aim of the history department which has always wanted the hoover library to be a repository of primary materials for research there was talk of making hoover stanford´s center for international studies but that fell through and the center for international studies is in adjoining encina hall the hoover institution began an interdepartmental teaching program and cosponsored my seminar on latin america harold fishers own history department fought this development too and the sponsorship of seminars was dropped because of my affiliation with the hoover institution i donated to its archives all the documents i had collected they now fill a room in the archives this the first of three reports will deal with hoover and education the others will describe hoovers mission and its research the hoover institution program in education was started by paul hanna of the school of education with whom i had close ties hoover recently launched an important journal education matters the summer 2001 issue of which i have in front of me paul hannas great interest was in international education and he traveled around the world studying it the new journal is concerned mostly with the reform of u s education but the title education matters applies to international studies too one of the articles by a member of the faculty of the university of notre dame university is entitled speaking in many tongues but tongues refers here to the languages of religious groups in this country however it can also apply to the hoover institution which has a library staff with an unusual competence in a variety of languages this is important for the proposal enunciated here education matters in forming the international attitudes of the children who carry into adult life the unkind stereotypes they have learned in schools war begins in the hearts of men the french perception of germans as the erbfeind the hereditary enemy was nourished by the teaching children received see la dernière classe of alphonse daudet describing tearfully the last class in french in an alsace school after the germans took over in 1870 now germanfrench relations have changed completely and the textbooks too which came first the hen or the egg answer the egg and the chick history textbooks used around the world can feed or poison the minds of children and we should know what they are saying there are three problems collecting the textbooks reading them and storing them stanford faculty travel widely and now under amos nur there are stanford campuses around the world stanford could collect the textbooks reading them as noted the hoover staff master a wide variety of languages storing them most libraries are short of space this was the reason the library of congress gave for discarding a collection of nazi textbooks which were a treasure for historians since large numbers of books will be moved from hoover to green library hoover is now in the privileged position of having lots of space the hoover institution was inspired by president hoovers concern about world war i and the soviet revolution as a result it has always had a special interest in materials about the soviet union and russia in line with this priority special attention could be paid to soviet and russian history textbooks stanford students could study the way history is now being taught in russia a course based on a textbook could be a joint enterprise of the history department and the russianlanguage teachers if successful similar courses could be started using french spanish german italian brazilian chinese and japanese textbooks such cooperative courses would be effective in breaking down the barriers between the history department andin view of the crisis in the language departments which will be the subject of another article i do not know what word to use because of courses in comparative education the school of education could also become involved a world collection of history textbooks would literally be worldclass it would attract scholars in many fields from around the world i have stressed the importance of this project to several librarians around the world they look blank or groan because of the magnitude of the task nowhere is such a collection being assembled what will be the response of stanford officials to this proposal will they look blank or groan perhaps perhaps not hope springs eternal in the human heart ronald hilton  52501webmaster
