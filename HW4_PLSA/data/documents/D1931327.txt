drtchiro i cannot stress highly enough that all chiropractors are not the same most people are not aware of this as a chiropractor there are several ways to conservatively treat sciatica however the treatment must be based on what the cause is and there are multiple causes of sciatica sciatica as a diagnosis only describes pain going down the leg therefore further investigation by examination and possibly diagnostic testing xray or mri may be necessary i have an article on my website about sciatica here dr t on sciatica in cases where the sciatica is severe i will usually cotreat with an md so medication and chiropractic care is used at the same time to control the symptoms the cause could be a disc herniation disc bulge inflammation irritation of the nerve itself multiple causes piriformis syndrome just to name a few and can only be found by exam and confirmed by diagnostic testing its possible that you gave up on your chiropractor too quickly or maybe the technique used was not treating the cause if one way is not working because there are multiple ways of treating sciatica tell your chiropractor it’s not working and a good chiropractor has an arsenal of things to use unfortunately some chiropractors are “stuck” in their ways of diagnosing and treating which may not resolve the condition another way all chiropractors are not the same if heshe is not listening to you find another chiropractor most chiropractors have multiple techniques from low force to aggressive to deal with sciatica but not all chiropractors do some are philosophically opposed to therapy others are not some use one technique only others use multiple traditional chiropractic will treat subluxation and depending on what that doctor of chiropractic believes subluxation is will determine the course of treatment modern chiropractic deals with function and the bodys ability to distribute stress here is something about chiropractic techniques i personally use several i have many things on my website in the health topics section on chiropractic and chiropractors that you may not see on another chiropractic website as my take on subluxation is the modern version of it httpwww dr tchirocom based on what is causing the sciatica some of the treatments a chiropractor will do is myofascial releaseif its at the piriformis or somewhere in the lower back or leg which is like massage mobilization depending on what you can handle which can be as much as an adjustment where it cracks or adjusts sometimes a table or instrument is used to induce motion—restoration of normal motion is the key sometimes we use therapies like electrical muscle stimulation or intersegmental traction also depending on the cause we may also use a flexiondistraction which is a form of decompression by taking pressure off of the disc by literally pulling your back apart lightly which is to tolerance and begins gently until the patient and doctor believe you can tolerate more if it feels like someone just needs to pull your back or stretch you this is exactly what flexiondistraction does again this all depends on what we find after examinationwhich is likely the same as what an orthopedic surgeon or a neurologist would evaluate by the way sometimes our exam is more than an md would do as many patients tell me that their doctor didn’t even touch them or even ask them to bend forward after the evaluation we can begin to address the problem also not all chiropractors will approach it this way but many if not most will treatment may be a quick fix or a few treatments again depending on the cause sometimes xrays are takenwhen necessary but i prefer not to radiate someone as i believe that the fewer xrays you have in your lifetime the better unless i believe it will result in a significant gain of information because the treatment may be the same or until i believe further investigation is necessary i may not do xrays initially sometimes an mri is warranted if we believe it to be a disc problem when conservative treatment is not completely effective sending to pain management for injections is in order again depending on the cause which we find by examination based on xrays and other examination findings if conservative treatment is not effective depending on the severity we may refer to an orthopedic surgeon for a surgical consult the surgeon may elect to do injections or medication at that time—which is common usually that is not the preferred course by most patients which is why most patients seek out a chiropractor some surgeons are quick to recommend surgery which may be necessary after everything else fails but not the first choice of most patients most md’s will usually prescribe antiinflammatory medication andor muscle relaxants andor pain killers for symptomatic relief medications may be effective however will not likely fix your problem but may deal with the symptoms if your body can return itself to normal function while taking meds it may “self correct” adequately but not always if medication alone is not effective i highly recommend seeking out a competent chiropractor again not all chiropractors are the same md’s may also refer to a physical therapist—usually because they don’t know of a good chiropractorwhich also may be helpful but chiropractic treatment will also significantly overlap what a pt would do pt’s focus primarily on weakness of muscles and exercise and utilize therapy as well which may be effective if pt it is not effective it is because the cause which is dysfunction of the area usually movement and the adaptive response to that dysfunction is not addressed this is exactly what chiropractic addresses as mentioned in the other comment acupuncture has also been found to be effective and i have recommended acupuncture in the past as well has had referrals from acupuncturists to me when their patients have not responded completely some states have chiropractors who also are allowed to do acupuncture and may also be licensed acupuncturists sometimes treating sciatica is a team effort depending on the cause and severity and the specialists that treat those given causes chiropractic may not work for everyone but chiropractors have a pretty good success rate with sciatica usually if you havent already gathered this is a modern chiropractic treatment methodology that some chiropractors may not embrace and in fact would say its chiropractic heresy however most modern chiropractors would utilize a similar protocol and know when a problem is within or out of their scope i hope that
