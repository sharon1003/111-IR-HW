chapter 8 foundations of group behavior what are you responsible to learn· differentiate between formal and informal groups· compare two models of group development· explain how group interaction can be analyzed· identify the key factors in explaining group behavior· explain how role requirements change in different situations· describe how norms exert influence on an individual’s behavior· define social loafing and its effect on group performance· identify the benefits and disadvantages of cohesive groups· list the strengths and weaknesses of group decision making· contrast the effectiveness of interacting brainstorming nominal and electronic meeting groups defining and classifying groupsn groups– two or more individuals interacting and interdependent who have come together to achieve particular objectives• formal groups  those defined by the organization’s structure with designated work assignments establishing tasks• informal group – a group that is neither formally structured nor organizationally determined natural formations in the work environment that appear in response to the need for social contact• command group – a group composed of the individuals who report directly to a given manager• task groups  also organizationally determined representing those working together to complete a job task• interest group  people not necessarily aligned into common command or task groups who affiliate to attain a specific objective• friendship group – those brought together because they share one or more common characteristics stages of group development model 1

the transition toward explaining work group behavior why are some groups more effective than others see page 223 group behavior modelexternal conditions imposed on group group member resources group structure group processes group tasks outcome performance and satisfaction let’s look at each one of these…external conditions imposed on the group groups are a subset of a larger organization consisting of the following· organization strategy· authority structures· formal regulations· organizational resources· human resource selection process· performance evaluation and reward system· organizational culture· physical work setting group member resources a group’s potential level of performance is to a large extent dependent on the resources that its members individually bring to the group– knowledge skills  abilities  set the parameters for what members can do and how effectively they will perform in a group– personality characteristics  the magnitude of the effect of any single characteristic is small but taking personality characteristics together the consequences for group behavior are of major significance group structure groups are not unorganized mobs they have a structure that shapes the behavior of members– formal leadership– roles psychological contracts are important in organizations what did you think about zimbardo’s prison study p 228229– norms– status– size social loafing– composition diversity group demography– cohesivenessunderstand the relationship between group cohesiveness performance norms and productivity  highly cohesive groups with high performance norms are bestgroup processes synergy – a term used in biology is an action of two or more substances that result in an effect that is different from the individual summation of these substances potential group effectiveness  potential gains  process losses actual group effectiveness social facilitation effect  performance tends to improve or decline in response to the presence of others interesting stuff group tasks consider when to use large vs small groups what type of task simple routine or complex nonroutine tasksgroup decision making strengths  groups generate more complete information increased diversity of views higher quality decisions increased acceptance of a solution weaknesses  time consuming conformity pressures dominating members ambiguous responsibility so…should we use groups or individuals to make decisions p 240241groupthink  individuals may feel pressure to suppress withhold or modify true feelings groupshift  usually shift towards greater risk in decisions made by groups group decisionmaking techniques ways to make decisions include interacting groups brainstorming nominal group technique  electronic meetings summary and implications for managersn performance– work groups are part of a larger organization and can provide a favorable or unfavorable climate for operations– structural factors show a relationship to performance– there is a positive relationship between role perception and an employee’s performance evaluation– norms control group member behavior by establishing standards of right and wrong– status inequities create frustration and can adversely influence productivity– the impact of size on a group’s performance depends upon the type of task in which the group is engaged– a group’s demographic composition is a key determinant of individual turnovern satisfaction– most people prefer to communicate with others at their own status level or a higher one– large groups are associated with lower satisfaction chapter 9 understanding work teams what are you responsible to learn· explain the growing popularity of teams in organizations· contrast teams with groups· identify four types of teams· describe conditions under which teams are preferred over individuals· specify the characteristics of effective teams· explain how organizations can create team players· describe the advantages and disadvantages of diversity to work teams· explain how management can keep teams from becoming stagnant and rigid why have teams become so popular teams typically outperform individuals when the tasks being done require multiple skills judgment and experience teams vs groups – what’s the difference work group – the goal is to share information neutral synergy individual accountability random and varied skills work team – the goal is collective performance greater than the sum of individual inputs positive synergy individual and mutual accountability complementary skills four types of teams· problemsolving teams  usually 512 members from same department meeting to improve quality efficiency and work environment· selfmanaged work teams  usually 1015 members who take on responsibilities usually associated with management· crossfunctional teams  members come together from different work areas or departments to accomplish a task· virtual teams – use online technology to tie together members in different geographic areas they are made up of physically dispersed employees who use computer technology to achieve a common goal note teams aren’t always the answer· can the work be done better using more than 1 person· is there a common goal for all members which is greater than the sum of each individual’s goal· are the members interdependentex the sac state women’s basketball team needs interdependence the golf team does not they just add all the scores of each individualcreating effective teams the value of teams can be powerful consider these four general categories…§ work design autonomy skill variety task identity task significance§ composition abilities personality roles  diversity size flexibility preference for teamwork§ context adequate resources leadership climate of trust performance evals and rewards§ process common purpose specific goals team efficacy conflict social loafingturning individuals into team players be sure to understand cultural difference and prior reward systems ie are individual achievements valued prior to introducing teams into your organization if you do introduce teams consider…selection care should be taken to ensure that candidates can fulfill their team roles as well as technical requirements training a large proportion of people raised on the importance of individual accomplishment can be trained to become team players rewards reward systems needs to be reworked to encourage cooperative efforts rather than competitive ones q if you had a choice would you rather work on your own or in a team environment why contemporary issues in managing teams teams and total quality management– tqm requires management to give employees the encouragement to share ideas and act on what they suggest teams and work force diversity– diversity typically provides fresh perspectives on issues but it makes it more difficult to unify the team and reach agreements§ reinvigorating mature teams– teams don’t automatically stay at the “performing stage” familiarity breeds apathy success can lead to complacency and maturity brings less openness to novel ideas and innovation– mature teams are particularly prone to groupthink and as a result team members become reluctant to express their thoughts and less likely to challenge each other summary consider the idea that “teams benefit both employees  the organization” …do they really  point teams are greatthe value of teams is now well known the following are benefits that can result from the introduction of work teams§ increased employee motivation§ higher levels of productivity§ increased employee satisfaction§ common commitment to goals§ improved communication§ expanded job skills§ organizational flexibility counter point teams are not so greata critical look at four assumptions which seem to underlay this team ideology mature teams are task oriented and have successfully minimized the negative influences of other group forces what about apathy infighting individual group and organizational goals can all be integrated into common team goals  what about competition stress frustration individualistic personality traits participative or shared leadership is always effective some people need leadership the team environment drives out the subversive forces of politics power and conflict that divert groups from efficiently doing their work what about special deals favoritism enemies teams cant stop this  understand both sides of this debate q which do you agree with and why
