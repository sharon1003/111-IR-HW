full answer maltose is a disaccharide or sugar made up of two monosaccharides it is the rarest naturally occurring disaccharide and it occurs primarily in sprouted grains high in starch it is a product of starch breakdown and glucose caramelization maltose is also known as malt sugar maltose is found naturally in malt potatoes and cereal grains and it is added to processed foods and beverages as a sweetener maltose also occurs in beer and pasta due to the ingredients used to make them humans are able to digest maltose in their food with the help of the enzyme maltase individuals who are deficient in maltase may suffer from maltose intolerance maltose intolerance causes gas bloating diarrhea or vomiting when maltose is ingested since starch breaks down into maltose as part of the digestion process avoiding maltose alone is not sufficient enough to prevent symptoms intolerance to another disaccharide sucrose is caused by the same genetic defect that leads to maltose intolerance in a similar manner to maltose sucrose is produced when more complex carbohydrates are digested which makes it equally difficult to avoid learn more about chemistry sources rscorg enwikipediaorg elmhurstedu ghrnlmnihgov
