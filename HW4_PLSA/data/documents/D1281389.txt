marcus garvey presiding at the 1922 unia convention liberty hall new york city courtesy the marcus garvey and unia papers project uclamarcus garvey and his organization the universal negro improvement association unia represent the largest mass movement in africanamerican history proclaiming a black nationalist back to africa message garvey and the unia established 700 branches in thirtyeight states by the early 1920s while chapters existed in the larger urban areas such as new york chicago and los angeles garveys message reached into small towns across the country as well later groups such as father divines universal peace mission movement and the nation of islam drew members and philosophy from garveys organization and the unias appeal and influence were felt not only in america but in canada the caribbean and throughout africa garveys philosophy and organization had a rich religious component that he blended with the political and economic aspects considering the strong political and economic black nationalism of garveys movement it may seem odd to include an essay on him in a web site on religion in america however his philosophy and organization had a rich religious component that he blended with the political and economic aspects garvey himself claimed that his declaration of rights of the negro peoples of the world along with the bible served as the holy writ for our negro race he stated very clearly that as we pray to almighty god to save us through his holy words so shall we with confidence in ourselves follow the sentiment of the declaration of rights and carve our way to liberty for garvey it was no less than the will of god for black people to be free to determine their own destiny his organization took as its motto one god one aim one destiny and looked to the literal fulfillment of psalm 6831 princes shall come out of egypt ethiopia shall soon stretch forth her hands unto god garvey was born in 1887 in st annes bay jamaica due to the economic hardship of his family he left school at age fourteen and learned the printing and newspaper business he became interested in politics and soon got involved in projects aimed at helping those on the bottom of society unsatisfied with his work he travelled to london in 1912 and stayed in england for two years during this time he paid close attention to the controversy between ireland and england concerning irelands independence he was also exposed to the ideas and writings of a group of black colonial writers that came together in london around the african times and orient review nationalism in both ireland and africa along with ideas such as race conservation undoubtedly had an impact on garvey however he later remembered that the most influential experience of his stay in london was reading booker t washingtons autobiography up from slavery washington believed african americans needed to improve themselves first showing whites in america that they deserved equal rights although politically involved behind the scenes washington repeatedly claimed that african americans would not benefit from political activism and started an industrial training school in alabama that embodied his own philosophy of selfhelp garvey embraced washingtons ideas and returned to jamaica in 1914 to found the unia with the motto one god one aim one destiny initially he kept very much in line with washington by encouraging his fellow jamaicans of african descent to work hard demonstrate good morals and a strong character and not worry about politics as a tool to advance their cause garvey did not make much headway in jamaica and decided to visit america in order to meet booker t washington and learn more about the situation of african americans by the time garvey arrived in america in 1916 washington had died but garvey decided to travel around the country and observe african americans and their struggle for equal rights what garvey saw was a shifting population and a diminishing hope in jim crows demise african americans were moving in large numbers out of the rural south and into the urban areas of both north and south as world war one came to an end disillusionment was beginning to take hold not only was the optimism in the continuing improvement of humanity and society broken apart but so was any hope on the part of african americans that they would gain the rights enjoyed by every white american citizen african americans had served in large numbers in the war and many expected some kind of respect and acknowledgment that they too were equal citizens indeed world war one was the perfect opportunity for african americans to fulfill booker t washingtons requirement for equality and freedom through dedicated service in the armed forces they could prove their worth and show they deserved the same rights as whites however as black soldiers returned from the war and more and more african americans moved into the urban areas racial tensions grew between 1917 and 1919 race riots erupted in east st louis chicago tulsa and other cities demonstrating that whites did not intend to treat african americans any differently than they had before the war after surveying the racial situation in america garvey was convinced that integration would never happen and that only economic political and cultural success on the part of african americans would bring about equality and respect with this goal he established the headquarters of the unia in new york in 1917 and began to spread a message of black nationalism and the eventual return to africa of all people of african descent his brand of black nationalism had three componentsâ€”unity pride in the african cultural heritage and complete autonomy garvey believed people of african descent could establish a great independent nation in their ancient homeland of africa he took the selfhelp message of washington and adapted it to the situation he saw in america taking a somewhat individualistic integrationist philosophy and turning it into a more corporate politicallyminded nationbuilding message in 1919 garvey purchased an auditorium in harlem and named it liberty hall there he held nightly meetings to get his message out sometimes to an audience of six thousand in 1918 he began a newspaper negro world which by 1920 had a circulation somewhere between 50000 and 200000 membership in the unia is difficult to assess at one point garvey claimed to have six million members that figure is most likely inflated however it is beyond dispute that millions were involved and directly affected by garvey and his message to promote unity garvey encouraged african americans to be concerned with themselves first he stated after world war one that  the first dying that is to be done by the black man in the future will be done to make himself free and then when we are finished if we have any charity to bestow we may die for the white man but as for me i think i have stopped dying for him black people had to do the work that success and independence demanded and most important they had to do that work for themselves if you want liberty claimed garvey to a meeting held in 1921 you yourselves must strike the blow if you must be free you must become so through your own effort but garvey knew african americans would not take action if they did not change their perceptions of themselves he hammered home the idea of racial pride by celebrating the african past and encouraging african americans to be proud of their heritage and proud of the way they looked garvey proclaimed black is beautiful long before it became popular in the 1960s he wanted african americans to see themselves as members of a mighty race we must canonize our own saints create our own martyrs and elevate to positions of fame and honor black men and women who have made their distinct contributions to our racial history he encouraged parents to give their children dolls that look like them to play with and cuddle and he did not want black people thinking of themselves in a defeatist way i am the equal of any white man i want you to feel the same way garvey organized his group in a way that made those sentiments visible he created an african legion that dressed in military garb uniformed marching bands and other auxiliary groups such as the black cross nurses marcus garvey with potentate gabriel m johnson of liberia supreme deputy g o marke of sierra leone and other unia leaders review the parade opening the 1922 unia convention new york city courtesy the marcus garvey and unia papers project uclahe was elected in 1920 as provisional president of africa by the members of the unia and dressed in a military uniform with a plumed hat at the unias first international convention in 1920 people lined the streets of harlem to watch garvey and his followers dressed in their military outfits march to their meeting under banners that read we want a black civilization and africa must be free all the pomp brought garvey ridicule from mainstream africanamerican leaders but it also served to inspire many african americans who had never seen black people so bold and daring while racial pride and unity played important roles in garveys black nationalism he touted capitalism as the tool that would establish african americans as an independent group his message has been called the evangel of black success for he believed economic success was the quickest and most effective way to independence interestingly enough it was white america that served as a prime example of what blacks could accomplish until you produce what the white man has produced he claimed you will not be his equal in 1919 he established the negro factories corporation and offered stock for african americans to buy he wanted to produce everything that a nation needed so that african americans could completely rely on their own efforts at one point the corporation operated three grocery stores two restaurants a printing plant a steam laundry and owned several buildings and trucks in new york city alone his most famous economic venture was a shipping company known as the black star line a counterpart to a whiteowned company called the white star line garvey started the shipping company in 1919 as a way to promote trade but also to transport passengers to africa he believed it could also serve as an important and tangible sign of black success however the shipping company eventually failed due to expensive repairs mismanagement and corruption with all his talk of a mighty race that would one day rule africa it would have been foolish for garvey to underestimate the power of religion particularly christianity within the africanamerican community the churches served as the only arena in which african americans exercised full control not only did they serve as houses of worship but also as meeting places that dealt with social economic and political issues pastors were the most powerful people in the community for they influenced and controlled the communitys most important institution garvey knew the important place religion held and he worked hard to recruit pastors into his organization he enjoyed tremendous success at winning over leaders from almost every denomination one of those clergymen george alexander mc guire an episcopalian was elected chaplaingeneral of the unia in 1920 mc guire wrote the unias official liturgy the universal negro ritual and the universal negro catechism that set forth the teachings of the unia he attempted to shape the unia into a christian blacknationalist organization garvey however did not want the organization to take on the trappings of one particular denomination for he did not want to offend any of its members mc guire left unia in 1921 to begin his own church the african orthodox church a blacknationalist neoanglican denomination that kept close ties with the unia the unia meetings at liberty hall in harlem were rich with religious ritual and language as randall burkett points out in his book black redemption churchmen speak for the garvey movement for even though garvey rejected mc guires effort to transform the unia into a blacknationalist christian denomination he blended these two traditions in his message and in the form of his unia meetings a typical meeting followed this order the hymn shine on eternal light written specifically for the unia by its music director a reading of psalm 6831 princes shall come out of egypt ethiopia shall soon stretch forth her hands unto god the official opening hymn from greenlands icy mountains stating a commitment to the christianization of africa recitation of the official motto one god one aim one destiny the lords prayer and other prayers spoken by the chaplain a sermon or some brief remarks the business meeting the closing hymn either onward christian soldiers or the unias national anthem the universal negro anthem garveys black nationalism blended with his christian outlook rather dramatically when he claimed that african americans should view god through our own spectacles if whites could view god as white then blacks could view god as black in 1924 the convention canonized jesus christ as a black man of sorrows and the virgin mary as a black madonna garvey used that image as an inspiration to succeed in this life for african americans needed to worship a god that understood their plight understood their suffering and would help them overcome their present state garvey was not interested in promoting hope in the afterlife success in this life was the key achieving economic cultural social and political success would free african americans in this life the afterlife would take care of itself perhaps garveys greatest genius was taking that message of material social and political success and transforming it into a religious message one that could lead to conversion one that did not challenge the basic doctrines of his followers but incorporated them into the whole of his vision one of garveys top ministers gave witness to the powerful effect of that message when he claimed in 1920 i feel that i am a fullfledged minister of the african gospel garveys message of black nationalism and a free black africa met considerable resistance from other africanamerican leaders w e b du bois and james weldon johnson of the naacp and chandler owen and a philip randolph of the publication messenger had their doubts about garvey by 1922 his rhetoric shifted away from a confrontational stance against white america to a position of separatism mixed with just enough cooperation he applauded whites who promoted the idea of sending african americans back to africa he even met with a prominent leader of the ku klux klan in atlanta in 1922 to discuss their views on miscegenation and social equality that meeting only gave more fuel to his critics in 1924 du bois claimed that marcus garvey is the most dangerous enemy of the negro race in america and in the world owen and randolph whose paper saw the race issue as one of class more than skin color called garvey the messenger boy of the klan and a supreme negro jamaican jackass while labeling his organization the uninformed negroes infamous association the federal government also took an interest in garvey and in 1922 indicted him for mail fraud he was eventually sentenced to prison and began serving his sentence in 1925 when his sentence was commuted two years later garvey was deported to jamaica with his imprisonment and deportation his organization in the united states lost much of its momentum garvey spent the last years of his life in london and died in 1940 guiding student discussion in my experience with undergraduates i find that students know little if anything about marcus garvey the simplest way to get their attention is to tell them that garveys unia was bigger than the civil rights movement which most of them do know something about telling them that garveys influence extended well beyond the borders of the united states to the caribbean canada and africa may also pique their interest pointing out that garveys message had a tremendous influence on later groups such as the rastafarians and the nation of islam is also important much of what he said concerning racial pride and the potential for great racial success can be heard in later figures such as malcolm x and even stokely carmichael leader of sncc student nonviolent coordinating committee garvey malcolm and carmichael are all considered more radical than the mainstream civil rights protesters yet it was booker t washington someone considered quite conservative by most scholars who had a profound influence on garvey exploring that connection between the accommodationist philosophy of washington and the black nationalism of garvey and the other leaders might generate the most interest and help the students see the important place that garvey holds in american history you might also bring up garveys insistence that african americans should see god jesus and mary as black what is garvey trying to do here why not throw out the religion of christianity which was used as a rationale for keeping slaves and viewing blacks as inferior people and form a new religion that could communicate the hopes and desires of people of african descent why not do as the later group the nation of islam and remove all white influence you might talk about christianity itself how blacks identified with so many of the stories of the bible the people of israel the suffering of jesus and how african americans understanding of christianity in many ways may already have been black you might also talk about the role religion plays in a group such as garveys why is religion so important here why does it play any role at all why couldnt garvey simply preach black nationalism in economic political and social terms what does religious expression do for people in an organization like the unia historians debate scholars have debated the influence and relevance of garvey with assessments ranging from garvey as little more than a demagogue whose uniqueness points to his irrelevance to garvey and his organization as earlier embodiments of the political battles of the 1960s this debate is partly due to the fact that until quite recently sources for any study of the garvey movement were difficult to obtain many were destroyed when the government deported garvey and some were lost in the air raids in london where garvey spent the last years of his life e david cronons black moses the story of marcus garvey and the universal negro improvement association 1969 is an example of a more negative assessment of garvey tony martins marcus garvey hero a first biography 1983 and race first the ideological and organizational struggle of marcus garvey and the universal negro improvement association 1976 along with theodore vincents black power and the garvey movement 1971 are much more positive about garvey and his influence vincent provides some valuable information about later groups that were influenced by garvey for example elijah poole later known as elijah muhammed was a garveyite in chicago and later became leader of the nation of islam judith stein in the world of marcus garvey race and class in modern society 1986 attempts to occupy some middle ground in the debate not seeing garvey and the unia as a precursor to the politics of the 1960s but also not dismissing garvey as irrelevant an article that present a good summary of garvey and his movement is lawrence levins marcus garvey and the politics of revitalization in black leaders of the twentieth century edited by john hope franklin and august meier 1982 for the religious aspects of the garvey movement in the united states look to randall k burketts black redemption churchmen speak for the garvey movement 1978 and garveyism as a religious movement the institutionalization of a black civil religion 1978 the most important contribution to studies on garvey is robert a hills the marcus garvey and universal negro improvement association papers 1983 hill essentially brought the garvey archive together by traveling the world and collecting every piece of paper he could find that had something to do with garvey he covers the unias activity in the united states the caribbean and africa he explores the influence of ireland and its struggle for independence on garveys thinking and suggests that new thought may have had some influence on garvey as well his general introduction and his more specific introduction which are available online see links are outstanding and provide a concise summary of garvey and the unia links
