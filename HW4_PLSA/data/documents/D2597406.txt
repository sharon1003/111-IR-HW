youre on an app like credit karma you possess a healthy concern for your credit and it would seem that open lines of credit that youre not using should be closed to avoid any sort of fraud when you read enough pr emails from stores who had data breeches like target it feels a little unsettling to have open lines of credit out there for no reason some people will tell you to keep those lines of credit open but you should do what makes you feel comfortable yes closing useless credit card accounts will increase your credit utilization ratio and in turn lower your credit score but its not as terrible as it sounds with good credit and less accounts open you can probably get your useful credit lines a boost by calling to increase the limit as long as you dont spend more this will undo the damage you did to your credit utilization ratio try not to get too caught up in the score anyway  remember that your score isnt everything its only a part of your credit overview when you want to open a mortgage or buy a car or anything important using credit theyre going to look at a lot more than your beacon score what they want to see is 1 does this person have enough income to pay this bill 2 does this person already have too much money tied up in other bills or commitments 3 does this person pay their bills on time 4 does this person have any other accounts with this bank your credit score cant really cover all this info and a bank wont turn you away if youre smart with your money just because you closed a few department store cards i hope this helpskevinpfootesresponse was

month retail or department credit cards often have some of the highest interest rates in the market also id never encourage anyone to pay interest in the hopes of improving their credit score using the cards is enough keep them active in the eyes of the credit bureaus and credit score models the question of closing is tricky closing old accounts can lower your credit score since they help establish the length of your credit history on the other hand department credit cards are generally more expensive and less versatile than traditional credit cards here is what i would do if you have other traditional credit cards and your department credit cards are relatively new you can close one every 45 days start with the most recent card first track your credit score before you close every one to make sure the last closure didnt have a material impact on your credit score if there is a big credit score drop on the first closure you probably have a thin file little to no credit history and you should keep them all open if you only have the department store cards or if your credit score is low you should probably keep them open to help your credit score when your score is high enough 650 apply for a more versatile card and follow the methodology above overall department credit cards are not bad for building credit history but they will often cost you more and encourage you to overspend graduate to traditional credit cards when the opportunities ariseryansresponse was helpful not helpful jun 08 2010 reply response bystevedaytona3 contributions9 people helped helpful to 1 out of 2 people this is an interesting question for me my latest equifax score stated the percentage of department store accounts or charge cards to all of the accounts in your credit file i have yet to discover exactly what this means since it doesnt say whether my percentage is too high or too low but i am assuming too high i have three open accounts classified as charge card plus another closed account total accounts in my file is 14 of which 9 are open i have 11 revolving accounts of which 7 are open so which percentage is too high and what can i do about it open more traditional credit card accounts stevedaytonasresponse was helpful not helpful feb 15 2010 reply results 16 of 6results per page 5  10  25page 1 of 1 previous  next your credit scores should be free and now they are
