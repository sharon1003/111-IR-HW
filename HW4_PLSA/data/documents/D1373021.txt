sports lists20 things coaches always say david levin december 4 2012sometimes coaches say the craziest things whether it is in a press conference following a huge loss or right after practice when he wants to rave about how great his team was during drills coaches are never short on commentary they call it coach speak from the moment a coach is hired to the moment they are fired from their post a coach is just as much responsible for satisfying the masses with comments cliches and damage control and some of the stuff that comes out of their mouths i just downright funny this is a list made up of things we hear coaches say from week but it is also a play of some of the greatest rants we have heard on television these moments make us love the game even more and hearing some of the things that come out of coachs mouths are the stuff of legend please enjoy20 it was time to make a change1 of 21never has this been so true as with the case of the new york jets mark sanchez has not been the model of inconsistency this year for the new york jets after his first two seasons of hope where he helped the team to two straight afc championship games the thought was he could be the savior that jets fans have been waiting for since joe namath sanchez has been anything but namath and he hasnt even been close to richard todd or ken obrien sunday sanchez was benched for greg mc elroy sorry tebow fans which brings about a whole other can of worms that head coach rex ryan has now opened only in new york could a soap opera be this good19 we have to learn to stop the run2 of 21the jacksonville jaguars could make a team montage about this statement after giving up over 250 yards on the ground against the buffalo bills this past weekend and proving they have had trouble stopping the likes of arian foster and adrian peterson this season it is times like these that could drive a coach insane has jaguars head coach mike mularkey gotten to that point yet18 im proud of the way we performed in practice today3 of 21coaches are always proud of their teams especially when they have to block against themselves arent as intense as real speed in a game and the coverage in passing situations is not as tight as it is in gametime situations it does not matter what team we are talking about in the nfl practice makes average players like pro bowl performers teams like the atlanta falcons have been able to take what they have been successful at in practice and make it translate to wins on game day even with a change at the offensive coordinator position the falcons have shown they can get better by sticking to what was successful for them in the first place17 whether he plays or not will be a game time decision4 of 21the best cat and mouse game has been going on for years will he play is his injury that serious is he hurt or is he injured whatever the case and the question you know coaches do not want to tip their hat too soon and give the opponent a chance to make adjustments that could mean a win on sunday bill belichick is famous for playing the injury game and using his smug monotone appearance to keep everyone guessing16 im proud of the fact we kept fighting out there5 of 21this is another way of saying the team got its butt kicked but no coach would admit to that teams like new england baltimore and the new york giants have all put their cleats on the throat of their opponents and caused a bit of pain coaches who have to grin and bear the consequences cannot always go before the media and proclaim their team was awful although it would be refreshing is they did i am sure teams like philadelphia kansas city jacksonville and cleveland feel this way on a weekly basis15 we did not score enough points to win the game6 of 21this is as easy to understand as a simple addition problem if one team scores 20 and the other scores 10 there is one winner and one loser plain simple easy and this is one of the easiest things for a coach to explain its a matter of execution lack of effort or just plain being outplayed if the opposition cannot score they in almost every case they will be defeated14 weve got to keep chopping wood7 of 21i added this one because it is something i had never heard before until it was used in terms of football and the mantra is great and means something when trying to motivate a team but it also has some awful consequences in 2003 then jacksonville jaguars coach jack del rio used the mantra to motivate his team he emphasized this with the use of a tree stump he placed in the middle of the teams locker room he also placed an ax there for players to chop wood punter chris hanson took del rios words to heart and tried to chop the stump in the middle of the room but missed causing him to injure himself after his teammates had been taking swings at the wood with the ax hanson followed and ended up seriously wounding his nonkicking foot he was placed on injured reserve keeping him out the rest of the 2003 season so much for a motivational tool13 one game at a time8 of 21its so true in the nfl there are only 16 games in a regular season making it the shortest season of any professional sport every game is important each team baseball and basketball have a distinct advantage in this respect coaches cant look ahead on the schedule or decide which games they know they will win and every game is about winning never about losing teams that tend to look at the schedule and not the team generally tend to miss out on the playoffs12 our team gives 110 percent every time we are on the field9 of 21isnt that what they are supposed to do seriously it is one of the most overused cliches in all of sports not only is it used in terms of team concepts but players use it to tell everyone that they are committed to playing hard and giving maximum effort it is still something we expect every coach to say on a daily basis11 we protected out home field10 of 21this is such a football comment football players tend to be more possessive and homefield advantage is critical maybe more so than any other sport maybe it has something to with the fact football players have a take no prisoners attitude in the trenches and it happens to be the most physical of contact sports10 the better team won today11 of 21another one of those comments made by a coach trying to put a positive spin on the loss if you are behind and cannot make up for time key injuries or even better play then most likely your team is going to lose coaches also seem gruff when they speak about the better team or how they lost it just comes with the territory and now for some great rants12 of 21the second half of this slider will be some of the great rants and comments made by coaches the comments are stuff of legend and events we as sports fans still talk about hopefully there will be more comments rants and incidents that will surprise us even this season and become the stuff of legend that our children will talk about months and years from now enjoy9 you got sucked right in13 of 21your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available click here to visit our frequently asked

there smug as he can be it may not be one of his alltime classic rants but it speaks to his ability to take command of the media in a news conference and control the situation8 the dumbest team in

awesome video and a great way for harbaugh to prove he is one of the great players coaches in the nfl in a league where being a players coach has not worked in the past for some former head coaches mike singletary jack del rio this one works so well and if he can keep his ship headed toward the harbor he should be a major contender for a super bowl berth5 they were who we thought they were17 of

the dennis green snatched defeat from the jaws of victory and his postgame rant was something we remember like it was yesterday green was a head coach in the nfl with the cardinals and the vikings before that he worked with the likes of cris carter and randy moss on some highscoring teams in the nfl but this rant may be his signature move and the one he is most remembered by4 anything by steve

himself steve spurrier is to college football what vince dooley used to be and when he opens his mouth there is always something to write home about while spurrier is as honest as the day is long and when he speaks he can trash talk with the best of them and insult his opponents in the nicest way just ask phil fulmer how many times spurrier has gotten into his head3 vince lombardi what it takes to

god and a good southern boy raised on the principles of good living you never heard him swear and he while he got mad at the way things went he used what we at fsu called bowdenisms dad gum it was the most critical thing he could say at any one time and whether it was in a game in press conference or in some other social setting when you heard bobby say it you knew he meant business1 playoffs21 of 21it is the single most poignant moment in rant lore jim mora the coach of the indianapolis colts at the time and someone who had been feeling the sting of how poorly his team had played finally let loose and spoke his mind sometimes that is not the best thing to do as it eventually led to his downfall with the team moras rant has been played over and over again on radio talk shows and on sports center highlights for years it just goes to prove how disgusted a coach can get with the play of his team especially when he thinks that have given up on the season this rant is 11 years old and still makes me laugh every time i hear it comments
