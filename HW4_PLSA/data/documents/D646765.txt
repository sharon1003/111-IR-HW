external links history  editthe netherland dwarf breed was first produced in the netherlands in the early 20th century small polish rabbits were bred with smaller wild rabbits 3 after several generations the resulting animal was a very small domestic rabbit available in a wide variety of colors and patterns netherland dwarfs were first imported into the united kingdom in 1948 3 in the 1960s and 1970s the united states imported its first netherland dwarf rabbits the breed was accepted by the american rabbit breeders association in 1969 using a modification of the british standard 3early dwarfs even into the 1970s and 1980s had fearful and sometimes aggressive temperaments this was a result of breeders selecting wild breeding animals for their size the first dwarf rabbits behaved more like these wild rabbits than domestic animals and were not good pets however through generations of selective breeding the modern netherland dwarf has become a gentle friendly pet rabbit though it still can retain a more energetic disposition than larger breeds11weekold netherland dwarf rabbit vienna marked black otterappearance  edityoung blueeyedwhite netherland dwarf eating timothy

netherlands dwarfs often do not make good pets for children although suitability will vary between individual rabbits there is often a mismatch with small children because they like to play with the pet or pick it up to cuddle with it dwarf rabbits dont like to be picked up or held tightly and they can bite scratch or struggle wildly if the child does so this often leads to accidents if the child drops them out of fright leading to major injuries because a rabbit has very fragile bones larger breeds of rabbits are recommended for children because they have fewer issues with temperament however it should be taken into account that a rabbit is never a lowmaintenance pet it requires several hours a day of supervised exercise and human interaction this serious commitment may prove too much for the child and often the child is disappointed that the rabbit doesnt want to play however dwarf rabbits can make excellent pets for adults even for people with a disability they thrive in a quiet stable house hold with plenty of human interaction they are trainable quiet and clean because of their small size dwarf rabbits are easily handled when necessary grooming needs are minimal but the rabbit definitely enjoys a daily brushing time is needed to bond with the rabbit and to build trust because dwarf breeds are often more nervous and aloof than larger breeds its important that new rabbit owners educate themselves on rabbit behavior and how to gain their trust however when the rabbit has bonded with their owner they make very affectionate pets they will seek out their owner for cuddles and grooming behavior  editthis section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed

breeds  editan adult female netherland dwarf black self main article dwarf rabbit rabbit breeds derived from breeding larger rabbits with the netherland dwarf or any rabbit with a dwarf gene are known as dwarf breeds most smaller breeds like the mini rex the jersey wooly and the holland lop are results of such breedings generally dwarf breeds are slightly larger than the typical netherland dwarf not growing larger than 4 to 5 lb 18 to 23 kg most have shortened faces compared to larger rabbits and some even preserve the rounded head large eyes or small ears of the netherland dwarf these features make them look little specifically the netherland dwarf body should be round compact and equally broad from front to back dwarf rabbits also have short legs and a large head in relation to the body their foreheads are broad and they have well developed muzzles furthermore the eyes are large and prominent their ears are erect and close together reaching between one and three inches in length they have to be shorter than 2 inches and a half arba if not this is a disqualification from competition in the netherland dwarf breed dwarf rabbits typically weigh 2 to 25 pounds according to

states during the beginning of the 20th century when two true dwarfs both buck and doe are bred the genetic pattern which makes them true dwarfs dwdw ensures that 25 percentage of their offspring will inherit the lethal genetic combination dwdw these offspring often called peanuts by rabbit breeders are destined to struggle with life for up to three weeks and then to die reasons behind the death are unknown but it is believed that peanuts have underdeveloped digestive tracts the condition is 100 fatal although if fed by hand every hour and kept warm it is possible for a peanut to survive even though it will be handicapped for its entire life many ethical breeders humanely euthanize peanuts upon finding them soon after birth peanuts are easily distinguished from nonpeanuts they have extremely pinched hindquarters a bulbous head and their ears are often set further back than normal sometimes almost onto the neck if two true dwarfs are bred the statistical result will be 25 fatal 25 false and 50 true the actual numbers of truefalsepeanuts in a real litter varies false dwarfs tend to have longer bodies longerlarger ears longer faces and are mostly heavier than the 25 pound maximum weight for showing while false dwarfs referred to as bud s by breeders bud meaning big ugly doe do not make good show rabbits does from a good background are vital to a breeders program they have the same good genes as a true dwarf and are capable mothers possibly even having larger and more successful litters than true dwarfs also false dwarfs are unable to produce peanuts their litters will be 50 false dwarfs and 50 true dwarfs if they are bred to a true dwarf buck false dwarfs are easily judged for quality as the traits are generally the same only bigger ear thicknessshape fullness of hindquarter topline and other traits are the same it is common practice among netherland dwarf breeders to breed a proven show quality true dwarf buck to a quality false dwarf doe this eliminates the chance of peanuts and yields quality offspring the chances of false dwarfs is higher but those offspring generally go toward breeding some false dwarf bucks have proven themselves valuable to a breeding program or are sold as pets usually false dwarf bucks are not kept by breeders see also  editrabbits and hares portal dwarf rabbit list of rabbit breeds references  edit a b arba recognized
