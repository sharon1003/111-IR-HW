crispy and crunchy again how to make stale cereal crisp breakfast cereal especially the cold cereal variety can be difficult to store and keep fresh according to the purdue university department of foods and nutrition readytoeat cereal can stay fresh for 6  12 months unopened if the package liner is refolded tightly after each use the opened cereal can stay fresh for 2  3 months if the liner is not properly refolded the cereal will stay fresh and crunchy for less than a week wouldnt it be nice if everyone in the family always carefully and tightly folded the package liner every time they got a bowl of cereal a few days ago as i was rearranging boxes of cereal and crackers in a kitchen cabinet i pulled out a box of cereal that had gotten hidden in the back of the shelf it was a little less than half full i thought it should still be good since it was a moderately recent purchase when i tasted a bit of it though i found that it had lost the newboxofcereal crispiness now that it was slightly stale i knew that it would not get eaten yet i hated to throw it out while i could have used the cereal to bake cookies i decided to see if i could make it crisp and fresh again it was worth the experiment to see if i could save money on breakfast cereal the process was simple quick and easy since i was already heating up the oven for cooking i used the oven method of refreshing and recrisping stale cereal first preheat the oven to 425 degrees after the oven reaches 425 degrees spread the cereal in a single layer on a cookie pan it is important to be sure that the cereal is spread thinly on the pan if the cereal is too deep on the pan the underlayer of cereal will not crispen properly if you have a lot of cereal to recrisp you may need to use two or more cookie sheets or pans put the cereal in the oven and set the timer for 5 minutes after about 23 minutes open the oven and gently shake the cookie pan to slightly rearrange the cereal if you are using a pan without edges do not shake the pan at this time also check to make sure that the cereal is not browning in any way keep watch on the cereal watching for any sign that the cereal is starting to overheat or is turning brown from overcooking be especially alert for the smell of overheating cereal at 5 minutes remove the cereal from the oven and set it out still in the pan to cool remember that the pan is very hot so do not set it directly on your counter sink or table at this point as soon as the cereal cooled a bit i tasted a bit of the cereal and it was as crispy as new if it had still been stale i would have returned it to the oven for another 1  3 minutes while closely monitoring it visually and by smell for signs of overheating the cereal now needs to completely cool neither the pan nor the cereal should have any warmth to the touch when it is completely cool this took less than 30 minutes for my cereal once completely cool the cereal should be transferred to a storage container if possible use a pancake turner or large spoon so that you do not touch the cereal with your hands put the cereal in a container with a good seal this could be a lidded container or zipper plastic bag i used a lock and lock plastic storage container the newly fresh cereal should remain crisp for weeks if kept tightly sealed after each use the cereal shown in the steps above was post fruity pebbles it was mildly stale and just a few weeks old when recrisped five 5 minutes at 425 degrees was perfect for recrisping i also tested the steps with general mills lucky charms cereal the lucky charms which was also mildly stale and had been open for just a few weeks started to overbrown within about 3 minutes another sign that the cereal was beginning to overcook was that the cereal bits looked a little sweaty and had the scent of overcooking i immediately took out the pan and let the cereal cool to my delight these turned out excellent also even the marshmallow bits were crisp as new this was a relief since the marshmallows are my favorite partso for lucky charms start expecting the cereal to be done at about two and one half 212 minutes at 425 degrees note that i had fewer lucky charms cereal on the cookie sheet which could also have contributed to the cereal taking only 3 minutes to crispen cost savings cost to heat the oven to 425 for 5 minutes estimated at less than  10 to 20 ten to twenty cents for maximum savings try this when you are already preheating the oven for another dish if you already have the oven heated then this method will cost just pennies average cost of a 15 20 oz box of ready to eat cereal  300 to 400 depending on size brand and before any coupons or special sale prices recrisping one third of the box would save 100 to 133 net savings to recrisp 13 of a box of cereal 80 to 123 depending on the cost of energy not bad for such a quick and easy process thats the fat dollar way this assumes a 15 minute preheating and 5 minutes of heating ive estimated this because the energy charts that i found are based on an average of 350 degrees and estimate the usage cost at 07 gas to 16 electric per hour see consumer energy link below resources consumer
