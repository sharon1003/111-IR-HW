thats an accomplishment in itself you gotta be out there hustling if youre not youre not gonna make it  everything has an expiration date im a realist do i think im pickin jesus no thats ridiculous on his first bike it was a kawasaki 100 a little enduro it was sitting in a friends garage kind of beatup and rundown he had a couple older brothers who had moved on and left the bike i traded him my stereo speakers for it i never took it home though because my mother would have absolutely killed me if she knew i owned a motorcycle so i kept it in different friends garages motorcycles keep me on the road all the other stuff is gravy on racing bikes competitively i started racing pretty heavy from like 89 until 98 i did road racing and criteriums i was a cat 4 rider and then i moved up to a cat 3 for a little while and then i kind of got out of it when you run a bike shop you never really get out of it though because youre around it so much  i liked the italian stuff i rode bottecchias my first really highend bike was a viner and that was my first handmade frame and i always rode campagnolo even when i was in high school i had a super record campy bike which was a very expensive bike back then i had an atala which is another italian bike i raced that quite a bit did really well on that one when the balloontire craze was hot i was buying phantoms and panthers anything with a horn tank i love the schwinn stuff but i was a purist i grew up watching these pros and they were all riding handmade italian colnagos and medicis and all that stuff and everything was campagnolo and it was all exotic and amazing and beautiful i wanted that so when i started racing and had my own shop those were the kind of bikes i rode on his first pick i was walking to school one day and saw all these bikes in the garbage i was just amazed because i didnt have one and i found it incredible that anyone was throwing them out so i gathered up as many as i could and put them all in our garage they were mostly bananaseat bikes from the 60s maybe one was a schwinn there was a girls balloontire bike too that was the first bike i learned to ride because there was no bar in the middlei was little so i would ride it almost right above the cranks  then i sold one it didnt take much to get it going i put air in the tires and cleaned it all up and stuff and then i sold it to an older kid down the street i think i was six then i was always fascinated with bikes because when i was young i was very small and slow but i could go fast on a bike on seeing a motorcycle for the first time i was 13 when i saw my first motorcycle i was walking down the sidewalk when this guy who was like the high school champion studhe was the team quarterback got all the chicks everythingdid this incredible burnout on his honda 900 i can remember the day so clearly how warm it was and him looking at me as i walked by i thought oh man that is the coolest thing in the world thats what started me on my journey of wanting a motorcycle
