your peace of mind knowing that i am capable of getting his shots i just have no idea the prices of even a regular vet visit1 following 20 answers answers relevance rating newest oldest best answer i found your question because i was looking for the answer myself i cannot believe the answers you have gotten from some very rude people god bless you for trying to look after this little puppy i myself am trying to find information on deworming a 3 week old puppy the mother rejected it and it has been bottle fed some people think that a baby puppy should be killed rather than given a chance at a life with someone who will love and care for it as you and your boyfriend are doing i am a pet mommy i have 2 dogs  2 cats of my own i also could afford to take puppy to the vet if i thought it were warranted vets are outrageously expensive why should i take them to the vet to help pay for someone elses school loans if its an emergency you betcha im right there vaccinations im all over them but i dont take my daughter to the dr every time she gets a cut or a sniffle i look it up online or ask if it is something to worry about the first time it happens but i am not going to take a puppy to the vet for what is the canine equivalent of a cold heartworms are the truly bad ones they are checked for with a bloodtest i know i have paid for many of them regular worms it says on the bottle all puppies should be wormed at 2 3 4 weeks etc the reason i was looking up the answer is that i am also trying to find out how long to expect the pooing to last which i believe is also your question so come on  why doesnt someone give us a good answer i think its because they dont really know i think the worst of it should be over by now i just am looking for someone to back that up if puppy starts getting lethargic or otherwise acting off ill take him to the vet so before yall try to beat me up i am an experienced pet owner parent collegeeducated upper middle class woman trying to do the best i can for a puppy that would otherwise die the shelters who will take puppies will put them to sleep in my area the ones who wont are full so its me or the death chamber i dont think me is all that bad everyone tells me my dogs are the happiest sweetest dogs they have ever seen if reincarnation were actually true i would want to die and come back as one of my dogs so stop being judgemental

length this is least concerning most puppies get them vet will give deworming medication and dog will poop it all out there are hookworms which is more serious it can go through human skin and be harmful to dog n people there are other wormsbut any kind u need to take to vet to get rid of problem vets charge high prices i found a vet that charges 13 the price i recommend looking on internet for affordable vets because they still provide same care and look up what average cost ids on internet because it will give you idea if its expensive or not hope this helps god blessesther · 2 years ago0 0 comment i also cannot believe some of the answers people have given i am a college student that just got a puppy no i am not a millionaire with thousands of dollars available to spend on my dog but i doubt most of you who answered are either just amazes me how rude people are anyway i called a bunch of vet offices and told them that my puppy who is 8 weeks has worms they told me which treatmentsvaccines were necessary for my pup and which ones take priority since i dont have too much money currently available with the wormer the 5 in 1 shot and the exam it was a total of 63 not cheap but doable it takes about half an hour for the dewormer to kill the worms afterward its just a matter of getting them out i think it really varies on the situation as to how long it will take for the puppy to poop them all out anywhere from 2448 hours to a few weeks i am going back for the follow up dose in three weeks but he already seems to be better even though he was pooping out a ton of worms with mucus which means the large intestine is inflamed due to the worms hope this helped anyone and best of luck dasha · 4 years ago5 0 comment this post originated a long time ago but you describe exactly what i m seeing my dog is 9 years old and has some sort of parasite my suspicion is it s some sort of blood parasite he gets heartworm tests every year and they re always negative yet any time i give him monthly heartworm meds ivermectin praziquantel or even a bath now with generic fleatick shampoo his immune system goes into overdrive lymph nodes swell general swelling lumps not hives hot skin flinches when touched and belches that parasite smell all night guaraneed the next morning first poop of the day has white crumbly bits for the first 1  1 12 i don t feed rice and they do digest rice i feed nature s logic and right now he s on beef and millet grain free turns out to have too much starch and dogs still get yeast overgrowth took the poop sample to the vet clinic and the particular one i ended up is a jackass that never listens he said he saw nothing under the microscope then sent the sample to a vet down the road for a fecal float no microscope needed so he obviously missed what i was talking about i suspect strongylus vulgaris and mr jackass wasn t even curious he had no out his mouth before i finished saying the word lesson learned  only take in the white crumbly bits and not the entire stool and change vets regarding worms and puppies  puppies are born with worms i have a show quality rhodesian with an impressive pedigree and his breeder knows her  she worms her pups two times before sending them home once at 4 weeks once at 8 no test all puppies get them from mom sorry that some of these people don t know what they re talking aboutskiier gal · 3 years ago0 0 comment i recommend checking with your vet i know it can be expensive but it can be even more expensive if you or your family are also infected from the cdc there are certain types of worms that can be transmitted to human this is why i recommend a vet that would do blood and stool collections to find out what type of worms your pup has the length of time of getting rid of worms depends on the type of worm and what you are doing to cure and prevent it from reinfecting your pup the true test to tell how well the pup is doing or if the worms have been completely eliminated is by keeping up with routine vet check ups i have my dog checked every 6 months to yearly with the vet this ensure the health of your dog prevention is the best cure anonymous · 2 years

you should be looking forhttpssyimgcomtri1dc5a030bcba4ad3bdf5ad316fc0f254ajpeg chance · 3 years ago1 0 1 comment i completely understand where youre coming from i just adopted a puppy as well she is 7 weeks old but we got her at 5 weeks she was being sold for 15 bucks with her brothers and sisters in a walmart parking lot i was told that it was an accidental litter and they wanted nothing to do with the puppies  they could care less what happened to the puppies because they were just going to cost them money that they didnt have im a very experienced dog owner and i have been shadowing at our local vet for years and years ever since i was only about 14 years old i know very well that puppies should not leave their mothers until theyre older but once i saw the condition these poor puppies were in i knew i needed to step in what a lot of these judgmental people dont realize is when there are these situations you cant really make the decision to keep the puppy with her mother for a few weeks longer because the owner isnt going to just let the puppy stay with the mom if nobody adopts it no they are going to find any way to get rid of those puppies so yes i bought one i knew that i could afford to give her regular veterinary treatment and i could give her a comfortable stable home with a family who knew what they were doing i wouldve bought 2 puppies if i could have but of course in the long run i could only afford one dog i just found out that we will be having our first baby so i made the responsible decision to only take one we got her home and when we did i saw that she was covered in fleas thats terrible because at 5 weeks old you cant use the normal flea shampoos medicine etc so i did something else tip if your puppy has fleas and is too young for normal treatment dawn dish soap is what you need to use animal shelters use this on young puppies the dish soap suffocates the fleas and if you just massage the soap into the puppys fur and let it sit for a few minutes once you rinse it you can go through with a flea comb and comb out most of the dead fleas it takes a few times but its effective i also figured that she had worms based on the look of her stomach yes a puppys stomach will be very round when they have worms although puppies do tend to have those cute little round bellies cute a little pot belly or bloated feeling is a common symptom of worms so i totally see where youre coming from with the belly appearance echo my puppy does have worms and a lot of them we got her to the vet and she got some dewormer and now shes getting rid of them it wont get rid of all of them immediately but just give it a little time and continue deworming the puppy regularly we will be taking her to the vet in 2 weeks again for another treatment of course be careful not to touch your hands to your mouth after handling the feces or your puppy and dont let the puppy lick your face all very hard for me haha im completely on your side 100 what a lot of people fail to realize is how we are actually saving these puppies lives by adopting them yes they are too young but its better that they go to a home that cares and is willing to give them the care and attention they need than to be given to a less suitable home or allow them to be neglected by said home you may not have the money to bring them to the vet all the time but as long as you are trying and researching ways to help your puppy im on your side as long as you bring the puppy to the vet if its condition worsens way to go and i hope that some of this information helps others in our situation musicluvver · 3 years ago3 0 1 comment1 2 3 next maybe you would like to learn more about one of these graphic design degrees get a masters degreee online explore digital home security want
