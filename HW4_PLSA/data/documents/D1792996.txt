neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation 1 nbia1 also called hallervorden–spatz syndrome 1 2 3 is a degenerative disease of the brain that can lead to parkinsonism dystonia dementia and ultimately death neurodegeneration in pkan is accompanied by an excess of iron that progressively builds up in the brain contents  hide 1 signs and symptoms2 genetics3 diagnosis31 neuropathology4 treatment5 prognosis6 epidemiology7 history8 references9 external links signs and symptoms  editsymptoms typically begin in childhood and are progressive often resulting in death by early adulthood symptoms of pkan begin before middle childhood and most often are noticed before ten years of age symptoms includedystonia repetitive uncontrollable muscle contractions that may cause jerking or twisting of certain muscle groupsdysphagia  dysarthria due to muscle groups involved in speech being involvedrigidity stiffness of limbstremorwrithing movementsdementiaspasticityweaknessseizures raretoe walkingretinitis pigmentosa another degenerative disease that affects the individual’s retina often causing alteration of retinal color and progressive deterioration of the retina at first causing night blindness and later resulting in a complete loss of vision25 of individuals experience an uncharacteristic form of pkan that develops post10 years of age and follows a slower more gradual pace of deterioration than those pre10 years of age these individuals face significant speech deficits as well as psychiatric and behavioral disturbances being a progressive degenerative nerve illness pkan leads to early immobility and often death by early adulthood death occurs prematurely due to infections such as pneumonia and the disease in itself is technically not life limiting genetics  editpkan is an autosomal recessive disorder the parents of an afflicted child must both be heterozygous carriers for the disease and therefore must carry one mutant allele as it is an autosomal disorder those heterozygous for the disorder may not display any atypical characteristics that are considered suggestive of the disorder however there have been reported cases of compound heterozygosity in which heterozygous individuals do develop the classic form of the disease 4 5the disorder is caused by a mutant pank2 gene located at the chromosomal locus 20p13p123 pank2 is responsible for coding the protein pantothenate kinase 2 pank2 encodes the enzyme pantothenate kinase and mutations in the gene lead to an inborn error of vitamin b5 pantothenate metabolism vitamin b5 is required for the production of coenzyme a in cells disruption of this enzyme affects energy and lipid metabolism and may lead to accumulation of potentially harmful compounds in the brain including iron pank2 encodes a 185kb transcript which is derived from seven exons covering a total distance of approximately 35mb of genomic dna the pank2 gene also encodes a 505k da protein that is a functional pantothenate kinase an essential regulatory enzyme in coenzyme a co a biosynthesis and catalyzing the phosphorylation of pantothenate  vitamin b 5  npantothenoylcysteine and pantetheine omim mutant pank2 gene coded proteins are often caused by null or missense mutations most notably a 7bp deletion in the pank2 gene coding sequence this disorder has been reported in specific communities based on intracommunity marriages where both parents of the child are carrying the same mutation one of the communities reported is agrawal agarwal community mainly based in northern part of india the known mutation in agarwal community is pathogenic mutation 1c215216ins a in pank2 gene this is also coded as chr2038702923870293ins a by some labs it results in a frameshift and premature truncation of the protein 47 amino acids downstream to codon 183 p arg183glufs ter47 enst00000316562 6 7diagnosis  editmri image shows iron deposits in the basal ganglia the socalled eyeofthetiger sign t2w grase sequence a neurological examination would show evidence of muscle rigidity weakness and abnormal postures movements and tremors if other family members are also affected this may help determine the diagnosis genetic tests can confirm an abnormal gene causing the disease however this test is not yet widely available other movement disorders and diseases must be ruled out individuals exhibiting any of the above listed symptoms are often tested using mri magnetic resonance imaging for a number of neurorelated disorders as pkan is a disease prominently evident in the brain mris are very useful in making a sound diagnosis an mri usually shows iron deposits in the basal ganglia development of diagnostic criteria continues in the hope of further separating pkan from other forms of neurodegenerative diseases featuring nbia neuropathology  editmicroscopic features of pkan include iron granules spheroid bodies lewy bodies within neurons treatment  editphosphopantothenate has been shown to treat pkan in a human and also in a mouse model of the disease pantethine  a precursor of pantetheine has been studied and shown effective in a mouse and fruit fly model of the disease 8 9 10 11prognosis  editsurvival rates for those diagnosed with typical pkan and left untreated is 1118 years with a standard deviation of 78 years a study reporting good outcomes in a single patient with late onset pkan has been performed 12epidemiology  editprevalence data regarding this disorder remains incomplete however it is estimated that anywhere between 1 in 1000000 to 3 in 1000000 individuals will be afflicted with this disorder based upon observed cases in a population but once again this is only an estimate as the disease is so rare it is difficult to statistically and accurately ascertain history  editpkan was first described by hallervorden and spatz 1922 their discovery was brought about by a diagnosis of a family of 12 in which five sisters exhibited progressively increasing dementia and dysarthria autopsies revealed brown discolorations in different areas of the brain particularly of interest were the globus pallidus and substantia nigra regions further investigation and description was brought about by meyer 1958 who diagnosed 30 separate cases of pkan meyer 1958 was followed by elejalde et al 1978 who described 5 affected family members and hypothesized that the disorder originated in central europe backing up his hypothesis with clinical and genetic analysis further investigation and insights were provided by malmstromgroth and kristensson 1982 13 and jankovic et al 1985 14diagnosis of pkan hit a milestone with the availability of mris as well as the indepth descriptions of those mris provided by littrup and gebarski 1985 15 tanfani et al 1987 16 sethi et al 1988 17 angelini et al 1992 18 casteels et al 1994 19 and malandrini et al 1995 20 the gene was localized to chromosome 20p by taylor et al 1996 21 who suggested that this disorder should be referred to as neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation nbia1 to avoid the objectionable eponym of hallervordenspatz the disease was named pantothenate kinaseassociated neurodegeneration or pkan by zhou et al 2001 4 who suggested the name to avoid misinterpretation and to better reflect the true nature of the disorder most recently pellecchia et al 2005 published a report of 16 patients afflicted with pkan confirmed by genetic analysis 22references  edit the use of this eponym is somewhat discouraged due to hallervorden and spatz s affiliation with the nazi regime and the ethically questionable manner in which they acted bazelon emily nov 6 2013 the nazi anatomists slate magazine webbased the washington post company retrieved nov 7 2013 doctor535 at who
