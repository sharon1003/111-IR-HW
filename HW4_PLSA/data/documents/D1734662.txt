20180219rated 2 out of 5 by don bon from very disappointed even though there were only a few cars in the parking lot when we arrived we were given a room i would consider not up to choice standards tile in bathroom grout cracked and discolored grout around tub needed to be replaced huge water stain and many other small ones in our ceiling and also our tub didnt drain and we had to get someone to fix it on the last night of our stay came back to a dirty room and emptied our own garbage and had to have someone get us clean towels we have stayed here before but never had this bad experience date published 20180216rated 1 out of 5 by anonymous from needs a good cleaning top to bottom do to the dirty conditions i will not stay there again if my wife would of been with me we would of found
