love firefight its so simple capture an objective  your team respawns now there is a metagame at play with setting a strategy for capturing objectives and respawning your team at opportune times dont want to capture objective back to back because then youve wasted a respawn its a great twist on territory control id say push is my second favorite but not on sinjar why do people like that map its extremely one sided24 comments share save hide reportall 24 commentssorted by best want to add to the discussion post a commentcreate an account – infectios 7 points 3 years ago cooppermalink embed save – deleted 1 point 3 years ago coop with brutal bots and good communication is my jampermalink embed save parent – deleted 1 point 3 years ago seriously i think the coop in insurgency is some of the best in any game ive played the bots arent complete retardspermalink embed save parent – lackattack8600 6 points 3 years ago skirmishi love the explosives object adds an extra element to each game teamwork is actually noticeable bizaar is my steampermalink embed save – sgtzig zag 5 points 3 years ago skirmish because games dont end in a few minutes lots of capture points and objectives to destroy which are usually very hard to get topermalink embed save – masoe specialist 3 points 3 years ago push is becoming my new favorite i like the idea that the map opens up a bit and it actually feels like we are pushing back the enemy it also has some of the best firefight not the gamemode momentspermalink embed save – thunder clap001 3 points 3 years ago currently i like coop i found a server that i like a lot and its a great way to relieve stress by just mowing down waves of enemy aipermalink embed save – aaipod 2 points 3 years ago i like strike because lives are worth morepermalink embed save – skidd chung noob tuber 2 points 3 years ago push on sinjar is too one sided the defender has all the advantage of height and also almost no cover for attackers to advance which allow them to be sniped from range maybe ive played with too many people who arent familiar with the map but its normally very one sided and unless the defenders has many players unfamiliar with the map or mode the attackers are at a complete disadvantage personally i like skirmish mode where the team not only need to attack but also to defend their cache and capture point to prevent enemy from gaining additional reinforcement waves there are multiple spawn waves which keeps everyone playing even if they died too early push is my other favourite but not on sinjarpermalink embed save – pentoast 1 point 3 years ago my strategy for sinjar is to use the mini14 with a suppressor fore grip and ap rounds right out of the gate go through the door right then left through the next door go around the right of the wall and head straight for the building under the hill while spotting the top of the hill once you hit the building run full speed to the right while spotting go around the far right then up the second dirt ramp on your left from here i spot to the left occasionally to get snipers hitting my peeps and keep moving a little right and straight across the map until you get to the cars on the highway by the time you get there you should be in a restricted area from here hug the right side of the cars and busses once youre near the fence you should be out of the restricted area the insurgents cant shoot through the bus which is nice just pick them off as the come to a and dont get greedy bravo same strategy as above run around the right and instead of going up the ramp go up the hill in the back at the top youll enter a restricted area turn left and you should exit it fairly quickly mind their respawn time if youre unsure just wait for the next one you can pick a few off as theyre jumping down from the building but be careful as it could give away your position once youre in the clear run to b go upstairs and clear it out then jump down and into the back of b if you need to the best defense while capping b is to go prone on the balcony to the right of the back stairs once they respawn go prone in the doorway facing the far balcony where they spawn from pick off 23 of them then quickly crawl back to the balcony charlie go to the highway and go under the bridge and around the back left turn right at the end of the building go up the hill then up the stairs turn left but mind the hallway as the stairs to the back left leads to their spawn go to those stairs pick a few off when they respawn ten turn around and go to c upstairs is usually clear but just be mindful this one is fairly easy to take hopefully that helpspermalink embed save parent – skidd chung noob tuber 1 point 3 years ago thanks for the tips i follow that route as well instead of the highway to hell on the left unfortunately if you fail your first run the defenders normally will start guarding that area i believe a proper team can do it well with coordinated suppression and smokes public servers really depend on luck as a defender i normally guard our left flank by running down the hill to the humvee and basically pick off attackers trying to get up the hill when they are below the defending hills viewpermalink embed save parent – the focused one 1 point 3 years ago i like push but some maps have the objectives too close to one another itd be neat if after an obj capture the defending force had ample time to set up defensive positions before the next wave of attackers is upon the objectivepermalink embed save – burnf4ce 1 point 3 years ago puuuuuusshhh permalink embed save – gpellis87 1 point 3 years ago push but i need to play the others more extensively be cool to play with folks from herepermalink embed save – erbazzone 1 point 3 years ago conquestok no im joking  dskirmish permalink embed save – wanderer11 rifleman 1 point 3 years ago i like both skirmish and firefight the same really every mode is good except flashpointpermalink embed save – glitchedstupidity flanker 1 point 3 years ago push on sinjar is awesome in my opinion at least for the side with the disadvantage security it forces the team to work together and use their mics they wont win but theyll lose togetherpermalink embed save – sgtzig zag 1 point 3 years ago you said dont capture an objective back to back because then youve wasted a respawn i dont follow the logic in this youre not wasting a respawn because you got one for free by capping secondly this is exactly how most games are won by back to back captures you dont give the enemy time to react and respawnpermalink embed save – h4xxor   nail 3 points 3 years ago op is actually right capping a point when nobody of your team is dead is just stupidpermalink embed save parent – skidd chung noob tuber 1 point 3 years ago only on skirmish mode does this have an effect where you cap a point you spawn reinforcement and also add an additional wave in firefight mode you only spawn wave of reinforcement when you cap a point but do not gain additional waves so the strategy is to fight the enemy and wither them down before capping a point to regain your losses the enemy already weaken cannot recover unless they cap a point to spawn back their dead fast capping and defending can also end the game early but what is the fun in thatpermalink embed save parent – the ra1der 1 point 3 years ago pushpermalink embed save – dong quixote1 0 points 3 years ago i like push but a few maps feel like its really easy to lose repeatedly if your team isnt quite up to par particularly sinjar that being said with two evenly matched teams push is the best i also really like ambush with a good team because coordinating the vip can be a shitload of fun and its very satisfying to help slip them past the enemy and to an extraction pointpermalink embed save – tubur perfect aesthetic presentations 2 points 3 years ago push on sinjar reminds me of dday for the security team people just go apeshit and sprint right up the hill to the left and get absolutely mowed downpermalink embed save parent – dong quixote1 3 points 3 years ago yeah its not inherently that unbalanced but it requires a lot more coordination than pub teams can typically muster gotta sync up smokes snipers and a group to move up the hillpermalink embed save parent
