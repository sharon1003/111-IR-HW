the common cold and the flu share many features they’re both caused by viral infections have similar symptoms and usually can be treated at home they also typically develop in stages with certain symptoms emerging as the infection progresses but there are differences in the onset severity and duration of the typical cold or bout of influenza what are the stages of a cold cold symptoms can differ from person to person but they generally appear about one to three days after exposure to a coldcausing virus in most cases cold symptoms will peak around day four and taper off around day seven the signs that you have a cold usually develop slowly the most common cold symptoms include fatigue sore or scratchy throat nasal congestion or stuffiness and a runny nose followed by sneezing and coughing fever is not typical with a cold but a lowgrade fever isn’t out of the question the mucus discharged by a runny nose may change color over the course of the illness starting out clear and becoming thicker yellow or green postnasal drip in which mucus accumulates or drips in the back of the throat can further aggravate a sore throat or cough the full life cycle of a cold is usually between a week and 10 days a cold may last longer or be more severe in people who have immune problems or other underlying health issues if your symptoms persist more than two weeks or keep coming back then something else may be going on such as allergies sinusitis or a secondary infection fever is an important sign says norman edelman md a professor of preventive medicine internal medicine and physiology and biophysics at the state university of new york at stony brook in long island adults with a fever of 102 f or higher and children with a fever of 103 f or higher should see a doctor the contagious period for the common cold has its own life span usually starting a couple days before cold symptoms kick in and continuing for a few days afterward what are the stages of the flu flu symptoms usually start within one to four days after infection unlike a common cold the effects of an influenza virus infection can come on very suddenly the first signs of the flu are often a fever or chills accompanied by headache sore throat dry cough runny nose muscle aches and fatigue as the illness progresses a person may have warm flushed skin watery or bloodshot eyes a severe cough that produces phlegm and nasal congestion nausea and vomiting may also occur especially among children a bout of the flu typically lasts one to two weeks with severe symptoms subsiding in two to three days however weakness fatigue dry cough and a reduced ability to exercise can linger for three to seven days how long is the flu contagious a 2013 survey conducted by the national foundation for infectious diseases revealed that 41 percent of people think the flu is only contagious after symptoms start  1 that’s not true an adult infected with influenza may be contagious from one day before symptoms start until five to seven days after becoming sick children may continue to be contagious for longer than seven days staying home until your contagious period has likely passed will help you avoid passing germs on to other people other simple steps can keep you from spreading infection to others or picking up a virus from other people around you at school work or at home“it’s really basic public health practices” says catherine troisi ph d an associate professor in the divisions of management policy and community health and epidemiology at the university of texas school of public health in houston “you should wash your hands stay home if you’re sick get enough sleep and eat well”what if a cold or the flu won’t go away when complications develop a person will likely be sick for longer than a week or two depending on the severity of the complication how quickly a person receives treatment for it and how well the patient responds to treatment signs of severe complications that should prompt you to seek medical attention include the following difficulty breathing or shortness of breath purple or blue discoloration of the lips pain or pressure in the chest or abdomen high fever sudden dizziness confusion severe or persistent vomiting seizures flulike symptoms that improve but then return with fever and worse cough even in healthy people who dont develop complications the flu can cause symptoms that persist for weeks including fatigue weakness low appetite dry cough airway irritation that affects how long you can be active loss of sense of smell which in rare cases becomes permanent how long does immunity last with some viral illnesses once you have been infected with it or have been vaccinated against it youre immune for life with the flu however immunity doesnt last that long a study published in march 2017 in the journal clinical infectious diseases confirmed that immunity declines over the months following vaccination or infection  2getting vaccinated every year is important to lower your likelihood of getting the flu it takes about two weeks to develop immunity to the flu and experts recommend getting vaccinated before flu season is in full swing to ensure adequate protection even getting a flu shot as late as january can help protect against the flu particularly if the season peaks in february or march“i think part of the problem with getting people vaccinated is people don’t understand how serious the flu can be” says dr troisi “they confuse it with the common cold but if you actually have the flu you can get very sick”additional reporting by george vernadakis resources we love family doctororg vaccine finderorg influenza research database kids health
