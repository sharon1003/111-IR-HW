what the symptoms of a cracked exhaust manifold are about three weeks ago the engine seemed to make a slight ticking sound when underpowered 5speed and climbing in rpms just lately i now hear the slight ticking in virtually every gear and at every speed in time with the engine its slight enough i could write it off and sometimes i have to try to hear it maybe its obsessive compulsiveness i dont know no other probs  no loss of power fuel economy etc havent been playing around in 4wd either at idle it sounds normal even when i apply a little gas though i am thinking i do hear it now when i apply enough rpms ideas its a 97 40 manual all stock with 43000 on it sandibar is offline quote quick replypost 2 of 23old 09072003 1022 pmtony tjregistered user2006 lj wrangler join date may 2002location illinois posts 386profile gallery classifieds my jeeps when mine cracked a while back it did the same thing as yours when i fired it up i got a ticking sound the sound was louder when i used gas also my noise went away after about 5 min or when the motor heated up if you have a warrenty on it still take it to the dealer and have them put a new one on if no warrenty i would buy a header banks or borla instead of a new manifold and have the motor breath a little better hth06 lj on 33s 12 wk2 limited qtii 57l 730n black with light ash interior 2004 gto 404 rwhp  396 rwtq tony tj

jeeps id say its remarkable it has lasted 43000 miles on it its very likely cracked by the time my 36000 mile warranty was up on my 97 tj with a 40l engine it was on its 4th and final exhaust manifold the dealer finally installed the new improved design just as the warranty was nearly over and its been fine since the symptoms you are having and hearing point to a cracked exhaust manifold theres a darned good chance thats what it is try to get the dealer or jeep to pick up part of the cost since it is extremely well known that the exhaust manifolds in all 97 tjs and firsthalf 98 tjs with 40l engines were cracking like crazy when you have a choice buy american made jerry bransford is offline quote quick replypost 4 of 23old 09072003 1031 pmrock paws registered user join date jun 2003location pahrump nvposts 830profile gallery classifieds my jeeps the jeep 40l exhaust manifold has been a real problem i have replaced them on all models back to 1989 almost all crack in the same area the new redesigned exhaust are susposed to be better  only time will tell its something you want to have replaced very soon carbon monxide gas can enter the vehicle which is dangerous most people dont realize this can happen so try and do it soon i would look into the banks headers redrock4x4com sell them i am looking into doing one on my 01 after the warrenty runs out01 jeep tj jeep 5 35 re

take picsplease post em the 01 is actually a different part from the sounds of it some people are having difficulty getting to a couple of the bolts after install to tighten them up other than that all sounds like it should be fine they replace just the header there is no downpipe replacement and it bolts right to the head and the donut gasket up to the factory downpipe hopefully have mine
