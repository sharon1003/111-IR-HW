to workers david roe a renowned minnesota union leader passed away monday at age 92 his contributions to our community are celebrated in obituaries published by the star tribune and the pioneer press roe was president of the minnesota aflcio from 1966 to 1984 he was instrumental in passing the public employment labor relations act the first statewide minimum wage and pay equity for women what did the labor movement mean to roe“oh everything” he said in an interview last summer “the greatest thing that’s happened to me outside of my marriage is the labor movement“the labor movement is respected but needs to be respected more” he added “the labor movement has given us the 40hour work week it’s given us social security it has so many progressive programs the labor movement does nothing but good not just for the workers but for all of our folks in general”bill mc carthy the current aflcio president called roe’s death a huge loss for our movement and our state“no minnesota labor leader loomed as large as david roe did” mc carthy said in a statement “his example as both a leader and a person is still the gold standard … under david’s leadership the minnesota aflcio became a strong voice both at the state capitol and at the voting booth david understood how vital it was for union members and all working people to be involved in the political process and his record proves it as president david led the labor movement in successful efforts securing collective bargaining rights for public sector workers and enacting minnesota’s first minimum wage”roe and seide share a long history as labor leaders in minnesota dating back to 1980 roe was a close mentor and friend to afscme council 5 executive director eliot seide who called him an inspiration“dave roe is a massive historical presence in the history of this state and our labor movement” seide says “he is one of the founders of the modern dfl at its best without davids leadership as president of the minnesota aflcio we would not have the public employment labor relations act among many other accomplishments his last contribution to minnesota workers was the memorial at the state capitol to workers’ sacrifices he spent his last 30 years fighting to make sure workers were recognized on the capitol lawn”in a statement gov mark dayton said “dave roe was a giant of a man and one of the most influential minnesotans of his generation his lifelong commitment to better wages and working conditions greatly improved the lives of thousands of hardworking minnesotans”roe was guided by a simple philosophy“i want to make sure my family is wellprotected and i want to make sure all workers are represented properly by the union movement” he said last summer roe came by that philosophy and his union involvement early he served in world war ii in the pacific quitting high school at 17 to join his brother who had gotten his induction notice“i said by golly if you’re going to the navy i will too” roe recalled “we helped win the battle of the pacific and brought about the defeat of the japanese”when roe returned from war he found it difficult to get a job without his diploma so he finished up at west high school then went to work as a lather hesoon was tapped as a business agent for his local union it was a quick climb from there to heading the state building trades council and then the state aflcio“one of the first things i did was mobilize our forces for the election of 1972” roe said the dfl party was in disarray over the vietnam war and republicans headed the legislature “it appeared very gloomy for the state but with the public employees we had the governor’s office wendell anderson and our office and we were able to mobilize folks turn that around in 1972 we decisively elected a dfl house for the second time in state history and elected a senate for the first time”with a workerfriendly legislature roe helped pass the public employment labor relations act better known as pelra which gave public employees the right to strike and move from “collective begging into collective bargaining”roe also helped win the first statewide minimum wage pay equity for women increases in workers’ compensation and unemployment insurance with an automatic costofliving mechanism and establish minnesota osha when air traffic controllers went on strike roe petitioned the national aflcio to call a national strike in support he worked closely with political greats like vice presidents hubert h humphrey and walter mondale roe took a trip to vietnam with humphrey in 1968 he flew to panama with mondale when the u s signed a treaty to turn over the canal the night humphrey was dying roe and his wife audrey got a phone call“my father wants to talk to you” humphrey’s son skip told roe “i talked to hubert humphrey for 10 minutes or so i said ‘hubert you’ve got many other calls to make i appreciate your calling me’ he says ‘i’m not going to hang up until i talk to audrey’ he talked to her 10 minutes more then he said goodbye” the next morning they learned humphrey had passed away back in the mid1980s roe began fighting to ensure workers’ contributions would be remembered gov rudy perpich appointed him to develop a labor interpretive center roe retired to commit himself to the effort the old science museum site was donated to house the center and roe won funding but jesse ventura who was governor at the time vetoed it“he mentioned one of the best things he had done as governor was to veto a labor history building because who wanted to go and look at labor history” roe said “that son of a bitch if you turn the clock back from today i think he was another trump”the workers memorial mural stands in a garden on cedar street just north of i94 with the capitol building rising behind it roe didn’t give up he started planning and raising funds with morgan fleming for the memorial for years the mural was a largely blank wall waiting to become art roe and his wife were frequent visitors“over the years the two of us and our daughters would come down here and look at the mural and say ‘this is going to be a reality someday’” he said roe and his allies finally collected enough money to hire artist craig david to build a powerful mosaic that depicts minnesota’s labor history and sacrifices in stone the completed wall opened last summer“it should impress young folks who go there and look at it” roe said “if they look at it long enough they can read the story of their folks their grandparents the trades everything that’s important to working folks it tells a tremendous story”mondale who spoke at the dedication said the workers’ wall wouldn’t have happened without roe“david is a tough old buzzard and a great labor leader” mondale said “it was my privilege over many many years of public life to work handinhand with david to try to develop laws here in minnesota and across the nation that made jobs safe that made them pay a decent wage and that put the broader interests of working americans before the interests of public policy makers here and in washington d c ”for roe the labor movement came second only to his family said daughter susie olson who retired from afscme council 5 his wife audrey his high school sweetheart passed away in october she was at the center of everything he did“he was passionate about people working men and women and that holds true today” olson said “minnesota was pretty lucky to have a david roe in its history i would say that even if i wasn’t his daughter”last summer roe offered what turned out to be parting advice for the movement he loved so dearly“just to continue to work for the people that they represent be passionate about the workers it’s so important that workers are represented properly in our society we’ve got to continue to work for our workers improve their lives and improve their environment that will carry over to others”visitation will take place sunday feb
