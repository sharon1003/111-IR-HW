gland or derived synthetically they are created from cholesterol and divided into two major groups glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids common glucocorticoids are cortisol hydrocortisone prednisolone dexamethasone and corticosterone an important mineralocorticoid in humans is aldosterone corticosteroids influence a wide range of physiological processes including stress response immune response regulation of inflammation carbohydrate metabolism protein catabolism blood electrolyte levels and behavior the secretion of these hormones increases during stress related to anxiety and severe injury corticosteroids are often prescribed for severe allergies skin problems asthma and arthritis they are also used to help prevent organ rejection in transplant recipients chronic overproduction of these substances is associated with various disorders such as cushing′s syndrome for researchers interested in corticosteroids and their effects sigmaaldrich has synthetic
