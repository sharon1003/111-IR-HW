from wikipedia the free encyclopedianavigation search alternating hemiplegia alternating hemiplegia is a form of hemiplegia that has an ipsilateral and contralateral presentation in different parts of the body the disorder is characterized by recurrent episodes of paralysis on one side of the body 1 there are multiple forms of alternating hemiplegia webers syndrome middle alternating hemiplegia and inferior alternating hemiplegia this type of syndrome can result from a unilateral lesion in the brainstem affecting both upper motor neurons and lower motor neurons the muscles that would receive signals from these damaged upper motor neurons result in spastic paralysis with a lesion in the brainstem this affects the majority of limb and trunk muscles on the contralateral side due to the upper motor neurons decussation after the brainstem the cranial nerves and cranial nerve nuclei are also located in the brainstem making them susceptible to damage from a brainstem lesion cranial nerves iii oculomotor vi abducens and xii hypoglossal are most often associated with this syndrome given their close proximity with the pyramidal tract the location which upper motor neurons are in on their way to the spinal cord damages to these structures produce the ipsilateral presentation of paralysis or palsy due to the lack of cranial nerve decussation aside from the trochlear nerve before innervating their target muscles the paralysis may be brief or it may last for several days many times the episodes will resolve after sleep some common symptoms of alternating hemiplegia are mental impairment gait and balance difficulties excessive sweating and changes in body temperature 1contents  hide 1 symptoms11 webers syndrome12 middle alternating hemiplegia13 inferior alternating hemiplegia2 causes3

syndrome also known as superior alternating hemiplegia has a few distinct symptoms contralateral hemiparesis of limb and facial muscle accompanied by weakness in one or more muscles that control eye movement on the same side 2 another symptom that appears is the loss of eye movement due to damage to the oculomotor nerve fibers the upper and lower extremities have increased weakness 3middle alternating hemiplegia  editmiddle alternating hemiplegia typically constitutes weakness of the extremities accompanied by paralysis of the extraocular muscle specifically lateral rectus on the opposite side of the affected extremities which indicates a lesion in the caudal and medial pons involving the abducens nerve root controls movement of the eye and corticospinal fibers carries motor commands from the brain to the spinal cord 3inferior alternating hemiplegia  editinferior alternating hemiplegia also known as medial medullary syndrome typically involves a “weakness of the extremities accompanied by paralysis of muscles on the ipsilateral side of the tongue seen as a deviation of the tongue on that side on protrusion these symptoms indicate a lesion in the medulla involving the corticospinal fibers in the pyramid and the exiting hypoglossal nerve roots 3causes  editthe cause of alternating hemiplegia is the mutation of atp1a3 gene in a study of fifteen females and nine males’ patient with alternating hemiplegia a mutation in atp1a3 gene was present three patients showed heterozygous denovo missense mutation six patients were found with denovo missense mutation and one patient was identified with denovo splice site mutation 4 de novo mutation is a mutation that occurs in the germ cell of one parent neither parent has the mutation but it is passed to the child through the sperm or egg 5diagnosis  editthere is no diagnostic test for alternating hemiplegia which makes it very difficult to diagnose also because alternating hemiplegia is extremely rare it is frequently missed and the patient is often misdiagnosed proper diagnosis however is critical for early treatment of the disorder there are many criteria that can help in the proper general diagnosis of alternating hemiplegia criteria for diagnosis  editfirst the symptoms must be observed before the patient is 18 months of age second there must be frequent episodes of hemiplegia involving either side of the body third other paroxysmal disorders including tonic attacks dystonia nystagmus strabismus dyspnoea and other uncontrollable disorders are noticed to occur although common the paroxysmal disorders involving the eye nystagmus and strabismus may not be apparent in older children and may not have been remembered in childhood so a lack of these symptoms does not rule out alternating hemiplegia fourth all symptoms clear up directly after falling asleep and usually come back after waking during an attack this occurrence is very indicative of alternating hemiplegia and as such those who display this are usually diagnosed with probable alternating hemiplegia fifth indications of developmental delays learning disability or neurological irregularities are present these issues may not be obvious in very young patients however it appears in almost all older patients 6 777 the final criteria before a diagnosis of alternating hemiplegia can be made is that all of these symptoms must not be due to another disorder if the symptoms can be attributed to another disease or disorder then a definitive diagnosis is difficult to make 6 778diagnosis of webers syndrome  editwebers syndrome is the only form of alternating hemiplegia that is somewhat easy to diagnose beyond the general criteria although webers syndrome is rare a child born with the disorder typically has a portwine stain on the face around the eye while the portwine stain does not necessarily mean the child has webers syndrome if the portwine stain involves the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve than the likelihood of it being webers syndrome greatly increases if a portwine stain around the eye is found the patient should be screened for intracranial leptomeningeal angiomatosis magnetic resonance imaging mrican be used to determine the presence and severity while computed cranial tomography can be used to determine the effect mri is the preferred diagnostic test on children presenting with portwine stain other imaging techniques can be used in addition to further determine the severity of the disorder the initial diagnosis is made based on the presence of neurologic and ophthalmic disease but the disease progresses differently in each patient so after initial diagnosis the patient should be monitored frequently in order to handle further complications resulting from the syndrome 7medical treatment  editmedical treatment of hemiplegia can be separate into several different categories 6 779prophylactic treatment by avoiding triggers and longterm drug treatmentacute management of the episodesmanagement of the epilepsysleep as a management technique seizure trigger include exposure to cold emotional stress fatigue bathing hyperthermiahypothermia and upper respiratory infection a drug called flunarizine which is a calcium channel blocker can help to reduce the severity and the length of attacks of the paralysis 1flunarizine  editmany children affected by alternating hemiplegia also suffer from epilepsy seizures may occur during an attack but more often occur between attacks antiepilepsy drugs are given to prevent or lessen the seizures but the drugs often don’t work and have severe side effects that require the patient to discontinue use flunarizine which blocks calcium channels is an antiepilepsy drugs used in 50 of patients and has been shown to shorten the duration of attacks as well as reducing the severity of the attacks while flunarizine does not stop the attacks it is most common drug prescribed to treat those suffering from alternating hemiplegia 6 779sleep and diet  editsleep is also used as a management technique an early indication of an episode is tiredness so medication such as melatonin or buccal midazolam can be administered to induce sleep and avoid the episode those suffering from alternating hemiplegia are often underweight and with the help of dietitians a meal plan should be developed for times of attack when consumption of food may be difficult 6 779–780see also  edithemiplegia alternating hemiplegia of childhood webers syndrome medial medullary syndrome familial hemiplegic migraine brain stem
