animal kingdom lodge is one of the best themed resorts at walt disney world capturing the essence of an african savanna lodge this resort is the perfect blend of nature and architecture through an ingenious barrier system zebras giraffes antelopes elks kudus gazelles wildebeests and exotic birds come incredibly close to the resort for the best views of the free roaming wildlife book a savanna view room there are common areas on the grounds where everyone can see the amazing menagerie animal kingdom lodge is divided into two main areas jambo house which is the main guest resort area and kidani village the disney vacation club villas to get back and forth between the two you can either make the 510 minute walk or use the disney bus system from jambo house the disney springs bus will stop at kidani village first and from kidani village any of the theme park buses will stop at jambo house first walking into jambo house at the animal kingdom lodge its tough not to be totally blown away the lobby alone induces the kind of awe and magic that disney is known for there are comfortable seating areas for relaxing and a large mud fireplace with a cozy fire always burning youll also find a number of televisions playing classic disney cartoons which makes it easy for families with children to rendezvous without the little ones getting bored one word continually comes to mind as you explore the animal kingdom lodge discovery everywhere you go youll find something new and interesting the presence of wild animals on the grounds of the resort adds a sense of unpredictability to what would otherwise just be a place to sleep in between visiting disney theme parks the glass lined back wall offers a breathtaking view of the arusha savanna and there are plenty of common areas that offer excellent views of the animals the outdoor areas have informational signage to teach you about the animals in the savanna and there are cast members straight from africa on hand to answer your questions most of the views in this resort are breathtaking offering looks at some amazing animals in a very naturallooking habitat unfortunately the chainlink fences that surround the grounds are a little jarring making some of the views seem like youre looking at a school recess yard instead of an african savanna i understand theyre necessary but i would have expected disney to find a creative way to hide them the resort is laid out like a horseshoe with the lobby in the center and hallways extending out on either side it can be a bit of a walk to get from the lobby to a room at the end of either hallway but its all indoors and airconditioned so its not too bad the walls are lined with artwork and there are displays of african masks and sculpture found throughout this resort skilled artisans were employed in hand crafting the furnishings making many items one of a kind by creating an authentic africa savanna experience you may notice that this resort tends to be dark the use of artificial exterior light at night is kept to a minimum in order to allow the animals their normal rest cycle get a no obligation vacation quote the animal kingdom lodge has an 11000 square foot zeroentry pool which features a small water slide a childrens pool and two hot tubs more impressive is the location of the pool alongside the uzima savanna here youll find a fascinating flock of flamingoes as well as the other animals that this resort is noted for nearby the pool is the hakuna matata playground and you can enjoy a refreshing drink at the uzima springs pool bar in this area you will also find zahanati the resorts full service spa and fitness center guests staying at the animal kingdom lodge can use the state of the art exercise equipment at no charge there are sauna and steam rooms available for a bit of pampering schedule a massage body treatment or facial the zawadi marketplace is one of the best resort gift shops around they sell original artwork inspired by the resort africanthemed sculptures and percussion instruments and even resortspecific tshirts something that has become increasingly rare of course theres also a section dedicated to all of the toiletries and nonprescription medication you may have forgotten while packing a concern thats often expressed about the animal kingdom lodge is its location theres no question that youll be at disneys animal kingdom theme park in minutes but the other parks arent all that far away dont discount this resort and all that it has to offer simply because it may take a few minutes longer to arrive at the magic kingdom our trip from the resort to magic kingdom took only 20 minutes total which isnt bad at all animal kingdom lodge dining jiko  the cooking place  is the finedining establishment in jambo house where prices range from 9 for an appetizer all the way up to 41 for a steak they have a fairly extensive and exotic menu including flatbreads wild boar tenderloin seared duck breast and wild striped bass as well as the typical fare including seared salmon beef short ribs and a filet mignon before we even got there friends of ours had recommended the filet mignon with mac  cheese which is no longer on the menu apparently the restaurant recently switched chefs and the new one decided to offer the filet with potatoes and green beans instead the part that bugs me is that everyone raves about the mac  cheese and theyll still prepare it if you order itwhich many people do including half of our party if its that popular of a dish wouldnt you want to put it back on the menu unfortunately i ordered my steak medium and it came out basically rare so i had to send it back to be recooked every other aspect of our meal at jiko was fantastic though so id highly recommend it reservations strongly recommended boma flavors of africa is a buffetstyle restaurant that serves breakfast and dinner while we didnt make it there for breakfast the consensus was that dinner was only soso especially considering the price the food certainly wasnt bad but at 3599 per person we expected more the meat selection included a nutcrusted salmon that i really enjoyed as well as roasted chicken and a carving station serving up freshcut strip loin new york strip the chicken was decent and the strip loin was nearly rare and fairly fatty which was a turn off for me the chef did offer to serve a more cooked piece of meat so if you prefer medium to well done take advantage also on the buffet was a salad station various soups including an incredible and unique peanut soup pasta rice couscous and a dessert station reservations strongly recommended the mara is their quickservice food court that serves some basics along with a few surprises you can get the typical burger or chicken nuggets but they also serve some really great sandwiches and flatbreads they also offer a number of quick options from the cooler premade ham sandwiches salads and fruit bowls as well as a few dessert options at the mara you can eat inside or take your food out to one of the tables near the pool a great option if youre on a food run for your little swimmers get a no obligation vacation quote over at kidani village is sanaa another full service restaurant offering unique african dishes with an indianinspired flare i ordered the burger for lunch just to see how unique it would beand i was not disappointed it was served on naan bread sort of like a pita with minted greens tomato onion and cucumberyogurt raita its a very interesting twist on a very traditional meal they also offer more exotic choices like a lamb kefta same as the burger but with lamb shrimp with green curry sauce and a fishoftheday with curry broth and thats just for lunch the dinner menu differs slightly lunch prices range from 1149 for a turkey club to 1899 for the fish while dinner ranges from 1799 for tandoori chicken to 2899 for a new york strip steak the victoria falls lounge is one of the most intimate youll find at any disney resort it opens at 400pm and features specialty coffees and teas in addition to being a full service bar one thing we noticed about dining at the animal kingdom lodge was that they seemed to recycle much of the food throughout the restaurants the vegetable pizza that i got at the mara was nearly identical to the kalamata olive flatbread we got as an appetizer at jiko we also got these little dessert balls at the mara called zebra domes which were also served on the buffet at boma and were on the menu at jiko each restaurant still had plenty of signature dishes so i wouldnt take off too many points for this obvious moneysaving technique inroom dining inroom dining is available 24hours daily choose from a variety of american favorites as well as specialty items particular to your resort hotel to place an order press dining options on your inroom phone an 18 gratuity 300 delivery charge and 65 sales tax will apply to all delivery orders a

for everything from a bluray player to an xboxthese are the things that set disneys deluxe resorts apart from the rest each guest room also has a private balcony the savanna view rooms have views of the 33 acre wildlife preserve for information on which rooms face which savannaanimals click hereother room amenities makeup mirror hairdryer coffeemaker ironironing board inroom safe ceiling fan free wireless internet newspaper delivery disneys animal kingdom lodge also has guest suites and concierge level accommodations the concierge level accommodations offer access to the kilimanjaro club lounge bathrobes turndown service and the ability to participate in two unique safari experiences for an additional fee this is a disney deluxe resort and offers the features you would expect at this level valet or selfparking room service bell staff and concierge desk are all here for the use of their guests by far the biggest draw to the kilimanjaro club upgrade is the opportunity to take the sunrise safari tour sundays and thursdays guests with concierge access have the option of taking this unique tour through animal kingdoms kilimanjaro safari ride the experience costs 65 for guests ages 10 and up 3250 for ages 310 and must be booked in advance guests meet their guides in the lobby of the animal kingdom lodge at 700 am and are taken by bus through the back gate of the park once there youre split up into two groups and are taken to the kilimanjaro safari ride rather than take the typical 15 minute themed ride through the safari trying to track down poachers and save the baby elephant youre treated to an hourlong ride with one of the animal trainers as he or she tells stories about their experiences and how they train the animals they take their time driving through the animal exhibits and theyll stop for as long as 10 minutes at a time so that everyone can get plenty of photos and watch the animals it was a really fun experience especially if youve done the safari ride a number of times and wish that you could just sit and watch the animals for a while instead of speeding past them heres some video from the sunrise safari special requests should be noted at the time of your reservation such as room view preference but you should be aware that these are not guaranteed overall after three amazing nights at the animal kingdom lodge i would easily give it a 95 out of 100 the only points lost were in the cleanliness of the room we had some minor dust problems and the recycling of certain dishes throughout the restaurants on the whole though and as trite as it sounds this place is magical the cast members were all friendly and inviting the common areas were comfortable and interesting the dining options were plentiful and unique and again the animals put this resort in a category of its own anyone looking to stay at a disney deluxe resort should consider this one but especially those of you who have had past disney vacations and are looking for something new and exciting get a no obligation vacation quote animal kingdom lodge recreation the primary source of recreation at animal kingdom lodge is its 11000 square foot pool located off the
