may 30 2009 712 pmhi wokersive been in july and august and although the wind on the east and south coasts is at its strongest then making it feel cooler at times the west coast is realatively sheltered from these south easterlies so it feels warmer sea temps are a bit cool though but once in its fine people sunbathe and swim 24c is not that cool i find the winter months better being more like a good english summer as the summer months are very hot very humid and rainy with high risk of tropical storms and cyclones a good site to compare and contrast weather

reply5 re weather in mauritius in julyaugust jun 1 2009 251 amhi yes that weather website is really good you mentioned as cool as 17 degrees  this would be night time temps and the evenings can get a bit cool once the sun goes down although must say no sign of it doing so on our very recent trip  back yesterday  the warmest evenings we have ever experienced there the worlds weather is changing and mauritius is no exception the locals tell us that winter is starting later and finishing earlier now best wishes mazza report inappropriate content6 re weather in mauritius in julyaugust nov 29 2009
