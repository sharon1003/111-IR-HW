of contact with the network of people boomers’ feelings and beliefs perceptions surrounding an individual” 23 in reference to concerning online social networking the purpose internet social networksonline social network was to establish on their perceived likelihood of sites sns boyd and ellison 10 define social participation on online social network sites network sites sns as golden baby boomers in this context refer to “webbased services that allow individuals to individuals that are specifically born between 1945 1 construct a public or semipublic profile and 1964 a qualitative research method and an within a bounded system 2 articulate a list of interpretive research philosophy were followed in other users with whom they share a connection the investigation and 3 view and traverse their list of results from the study exposed six main feelings connections and those made by others within the and beliefs which are lack of securityprivacy system the nature and nomenclature of these difficulties in adapting to culture too much connections may vary from site to site” 10 exposure to information lack of time inability to sns are classified under web 20 ie a recent set authenticate other users and the perception that of technology tools that transform the internet into social network sites provide no value to the a dynamic pervasive platform for elderly technologicallymediated informational a number of studies pertaining to social commercial and socialcommunicative actions networking focus primarily on the use of social 42 sns exist in various forms however a networks by young people and rarely focus on common feature among them is that they revolve elderly people the studies that do focus on older around the profile which is a depiction or folks concentrate on technology barriers that representation of users and their personal social hinder them from participation this study is circles or networks which other users can check therefore original hence valuable because the link with or be linked to others 19 snses are “a technology challenges that older folks face are category of web sites with profiles semipersistent excluded as we focus solely on computer literate public commentary on the profile and a traversable elderly people publicly articulated social network displayed in keywords theory of planned behaviour tpb relation to the profile” 10 the use of sns is baby boomers social network elderly people growing in popularity 35 notess and lorenzen older folks perceptions huber 31 found that 84 of internet users participate in online communities 695 issn22296093 edina susan farai nyemba et al int j comp tech appl vol 2 3 695703 there is however a noticeable gap drawn along with the diverse technologies such as mobile age group on sns usage 9 this growing technology photo and videosharing tools and popularity mainly applies to the younger blogging capabilities that sns afford generation because older individuals generally use golden baby boomers can benefit both social networks less than their younger counterparts sociallycommunicatively and commercially 9 it is also evident that the elderly people who commercially if they are still running businesses or have joined these networks do not fully utilise if they are still formally employed 38 functionalities of the sites 24 25 this sparked the interest to investigate why there is a lack of 121 business benefits participation on social networks by the elderly on the other hand gbb may venture into people and therefore led to the focus of this study business as sns providers and perhaps be influential in tapping into the lowly tapped market 11 focus of study of the elderly since they know exactly what they older individuals who this study refers to as would require of online sns while at the same time elderly people are individuals known as golden benefitting on the major exploitable capital of sns baby boomers gbb according to jones and fox ie user profiles and the association and connection 23 baby boomers are defined as those born information 39 as they work towards the between 1946 and 1964 they are a group of inclusion of other baby boomers the sns people born after the second world war who were providers can use such targeted information for part of the surge of births that took place after the advertisements that capture on golden baby war previous studies conducted on older adults‟ boomers‟ needs customers develop attitudinal lack of participation on social networks focused on loyalty toward business and its products and this how technological challenges inhibit participation attitudinal loyalty converts into actual loyalty by these challenges include lack of access to a the customer 35 the customers rate the computer or the internet and general low levels of experience when using product and service and this computer literacy will determine whether they will be using the in the context of golden baby boomers service again 36 computer literacy has been explained as comprising it is therefore essential to ensure that customers of “declarative and procedural computerrelated have a positive attitude about sns and also have a knowledge familiarity with computers and self positive experience when using them in order for confidence in using the computer” 3 although them to become loyal customers to achieve this these challenges are a reality there is growing understanding knowing how they currently feel is evidence that a remarkable number of golden baby a stepping stone towards catering for their needs boomers are now better educated than their therefore having baby boomers engage in online counterparts in previous generations 16 social network sites will be beneficial to sns therefore this study focuses on golden baby providers too boomers who have access to the internet and are computer literate but do not participate in social 122 social benefits networking osn has a significant potential to edify golden baby boomers‟ wellbeing 25 33 participation of 12 motivation for study the elderly people on social networks could also be social networking can provide a number of a solution to their social isolation by allowing them benefits for older folks participation on online to keep in touch with family relatives and friends social networking osn can improve golden baby 36 another benefit that a number of studies refer boomers‟ life satisfaction through their interaction to is social capital social capital as originally with their geographically dispersed children and defined by bourdieu and wacquant 33 is grandchildren 40 according to the world health „„the sum of the resources actual or virtual organisation who social ties with relatives and that accrue to an individual or a group by friends promote good health in elderly people 22 virtue of possessing a durable network of jones and fox 23 noted that elderly people more or less institutionalized relationships with heart problems who were socially isolated of mutual acquaintance and recognition‟‟ were frequently rehospitalised than those who 33 were socially connected sns come with diverse li 34 define social capital as the combination affordances to support a wide range of preferences of social links considered together with norms or interests and needs they allow strangers to link standards of the mutual exchange of goods with people of similar or same interests views and services favours or obligations especially a practices they also have the capability to unite mutual exchange of privileges and trustworthiness people basing of common identities such as religion race sex language or nationality 10 696 issn22296093 edina susan farai nyemba et al int j comp tech appl vol 2 3 695703 according to hanson 39 social capital is the 3 how do they keep updated of what investment in people in order to create a reciprocity their family relatives and peers are obligation which can be viewed as an asset the doing and how do they in internet through online social networks has the reciprocation keep them updated of potential to serve as a booster of social capital by their current state providing a platform for individuals to maintain 4 how do golden baby boomers know or and enhance social links among family and friends link with meet new friends people of 19 older folks can take advantage of the similar or same interests internet‟s social networking platforms and enjoy 5 what is golden baby boomers‟ the benefits of being in touch with relatives understanding views of online sns friends and peers who are dispersed around the 6 what factors influence golden baby world 13 boomers‟ views of sns previous studies show that at old age people the sample for the study was drawn from south prefer to maintain ties with people they have africa‟s western cape province the next section known over the years friends and their children is a brief literature review on barriers to the and grandchildren than establishing new ties 22 adoption of sns by gbbs the theory of planned it also shows that older folk generally have a lack behaviour tpb was adopted as the framework for of a large social networks offline 16 this the study we did not use the theory in its fullness generation focuses more on the creation of smaller but only relevant concepts of the framework were closeknit relationships within their respective considered the next section describes and explains offline communities that already exist 22 these tpb and how it is used in the study closeknit relationships serve as social capital for golden baby boomers 2 barriers to adoption of sns by golden therefore basing on this definition social baby boomers networks can assist in the accumulation of social whilst online social networking can be capital to realise these benefits golden baby beneficial to them golden baby boomers find sns boomers would have to participate in social to be timewasting and do not understand where networking however barriers to their adoption of the younger generation get the time to participate in the social networking technology have been noted social networking activities 28 the average in order to realise these benefits golden baby number of hours that social network users spend boomers would have to participate in social online is approximately three hours a day 27 the networking other noted reason for their nonadoption of sns revolves around trust and privacy baby boomers 13 objectives research questions and may fear the possible infringement of their privacy target sample because strangers can gain access to other people‟s the objective of this study is to investigate the networks 23 when communicating face to face golden baby boomers‟ perceptions and beliefs in trust is fundamental for building new relationships order to establish their perceived likelihood of and sharing information 6 trust is also critical participation on online social network sites this for thriving online communications 6 objective has the following key questions to be in related literature past research has addressed established that trust is strongly interconnected to 1 what are golden baby boomers‟ information disclosure 6 social exchange theory perceptions towards online social has trust as its central component 32 the social networking exchange theory gives a cost benefit analysis with 2 what are golden baby boomers‟ beliefs respect to social interaction when a social about online social networking interaction seems to be advantageous then an 3 how are golden baby boomers‟ beliefs individual has high chances of engaging into an about online social networking exchange relationship 6 if there is low trust that conceived would result in a perception of high cost and vice the following subquestions have been versa there are millions of people on social established to simplify the investigation meant to network sites and their profiles show their personal address the posed keyquestions information people who join social network sites 1 what is it that meets golden baby may not trust everyone on the network 5 boomers‟ social networking needs all interactions on online social network sites 2 how do golden baby boomers keep in are recorded and kept for potential future use this touch with family relatives and peers makes it difficult to guarantee online social privacy therefore clear policies and data protection means are thus required 5 697 issn22296093 edina susan farai nyemba et al int j comp tech appl vol 2 3 695703 another deterrent to the use of sns is perceived behavioural control refers to peoples harassment or bullying 37 a friend accepted by perceptions of their ability to perform a given one‟s friend to a site might use the opportunity to behaviour subjective norm is the perceived social send hateful messages people can also create false pressure to engage or not to engage in the identities as a way to harass others peers may also behaviour the behavioural intention can find belittle one another on sns there is also the issue expression in behaviour if the person performing of identity theft ie “the unlawful use of another‟s the behaviour decides at will to carry out or not to personal identifying information” 5 carry out the behaviour some behaviour may meet personal information on sns can be accessed this requirement well however its performance by third parties and that might result in online depends with the availability of resources and confidentiality risks such as identity theft online opportunities and physical stalking embarrassment price all together these factors give a person the discrimination and blackmailing 19 the other actual control over a person‟s behaviour the baby negative aspect of sns is crossing of personal boomers in this study have already expressed the public boundaries 41 the confidential intention to not participate on online social information supplied on sns can be used to infer networking despite having access to resources and other people‟s private information 11 for opportunities their attitudes and subjective norms example a study by griffith and jakobsson 17 towards this behaviour are what the researchers showed that people used public records such as investigated to explain the intentions which led to marriage data to infer individuals‟ mothers‟ maiden the behaviour names however although total security cannot be guaranteed measures have been taken and 4 methodology continue to be taken which deal with ssn users‟ a qualitative research method and interpretive concerns 26 research philosophy was followed the qualitative facebook has received criticisms on privacy and approach gave us researchers an opportunity to security concerns in previous years basing on interact with the subjects baby boomers on their these concerns they made efforts towards own terms 27 the research sought to understand addressing them to date measures continue to be the sensitivity of baby boomers on online social put in place in response to users‟ concerns 39 networking sites through their values opinions the fact that young people are engaging on online beliefs and behaviours sns and the networks are continuing to grow is an to achieve the research objective we followed indicator that benefits outweigh the negative side of myers 29‟s argument that qualitative research sns 39 other barriers to the adoption of sns are method assists researchers to understand people computerilliteracy and deterioration in mental and and the social and cultural contexts within which physical abilities at old age eg poor eyesight they live to gain conceptual understanding of the hearing problems and deficient of movement problem at hand from collected qualitative data we precision 16 physical and mental challenges followed the principal of klein and myers 17 for should not be ignored in the design of online social doing interpretive field study however some ideas network sites for golden baby boomers to be on how to conduct interpretive study in information accommodated however this study focused on systems were also borrowed from walsham 14 golden baby boomers who are physically fit computerliterate and have access to the internet 41 sample the selection of the sample was based on 3 the theory of planned behaviour purposive sampling technique the sample tpb constituted elderly people aged 45 years and above the theory of planned behaviour tpb is a a total of 12 respondents

susan farai nyemba et al int j comp tech appl vol 2 3 695703 the participants were functionally literate 432 implementation of the process of computer literate and had access to internet inductive coding facilities and related technologies this was to the interview scripts were made available to all ensure that only perceptions pertaining to sns are researchers the researchers read the transcripts dealt with the researchers selected participants independently several times to come up with relevant to the research question under multiple meanings inherently in raw data 38 the investigation only the baby boomers who were not interview responses were analysed manually participating in any online social networking without the use of any software this was done to constituted the participant group fully understand and correctly report on what was discovered the use of software could have led the 42 data collection researchers to be removed from the real data the primary method of collecting the data was collected 29 30 every researcher got an semistructured interviews the principals of myers opportunity to identify text segments in the and newman 30 for conducting qualitative interview transcripts and labelled the themes interviews were followed all the interviewees categories linked to the theory of planned provided convincing evidence of awareness of the behaviour were developed these categories were existence of online social network sites and their tied to the developed themes as the process of data ability to use computers and internet the analysis progressed the descriptions of meanings interviews were indepth and each interview took of each category were emerging after we approximately thirty minutes seven of the completed the coding process we compared the interviews were recorded while the remaining five results inevitably the differences in the results were not recorded but detailed notes were taken necessitated rereading of the transcripts all the down the interviews which were not recorded differences were resolved the resulting constructs were transcribed soon after the interview while the were used to create a theory that explains the conversation was vivid in the researcher‟s mind common reasons why baby boomers do not take the interviews took place in the offices of part in online social networks the process of data interviewees all the participants were assured of analysis gave rise to the following findings anonymity 5 findings 43 data analysis the following seven themes were established this study used a

appl vol 2 3 695703 and how do we know every 51 attitudes member is of our age and not a masquerade there were a few aspects of social networking authenticity of that is not what i like because sites that were positively valued by the participants people are not real on face book interviewees one positive was cost of getting up one never knows the authenticity todate information about an individual of common of the content interest although this was viewed as a positive it also negated the notion of showing one‟s 52 subjective norms commitment to a relationship by being willing to culture influenced participation through the pay to stay in touch security was mentioned by all phenomenon‟s conformance to acceptable interviewees as a problem area initially some behaviours 2 interviewees did not appreciate interviewees were not clear on security as opposed some of the conversations that took place on social to privacy on probing it came out that they were networking sites they felt that they might be two issues under security first the aspect of exposed to some content which violated social privacy how secure is the information provided norms comments like “we were not raised to from other users or hackers secondly the disrespect other people” were brought up in interviewees doubted sites owners‟ adherence to interviews friends and family‟s views on sns also the data protection acts exposure to unsolicited played a role in shaping golden baby boomers‟ content came up as an area of concern attitudes towards social networking sites esteem although most of the interviewees were not ie the value that baby boomers placed on the primarily concerned with how they felt about the effort one makes to communicate with friends and content in general they were concerned that they family one interviewee suggested that social would find something unpleasant about their networking sites are a “cheap” way to get in touch children they felt they need to respect their with people according to this interviewee one children‟s privacy authenticity of participants should be committed to pay to communicate with worried some of the interviewees they expressed people one values concerns on the genuineness of the content posted on the value of online and physical presence on participants‟ walls interaction theme the respondents placed high this view is supported by 2 when he found value in face to face or voice either telephonically that older baby boomers were of the view that or in the form of conferencing the golden baby people form superficial relationships table 2 boomers felt they could easily control this attribute portrays attitude themes security exposure and giving them the feeling of being much closer to the authenticity against respondents‟ verbatim natural or real environment of interaction baby responses boomers can easily choose the communication channel that suits their value system table 3 table 2 attitude themes and verbatim portrays these subjective norms culture esteem responses and value of online and physical presence interaction against the respondents‟ verbatim theme verbatim examples responses yeah but the security is not enough people can always hack table 3 subjectivenorm themes and security of verbatim responses my information participant can‟t trust website owners with all that personal information theme verbatim examples we would not want to be the older generation were groomed embarrassed because chances of with the culture of always valuing getting to know what we do not personal privacy want to know about them in their the other major thing is that social interactions with their peers are network sites are replacing formal culture high communication it‟s ok to use online social they are eroding the normal social exposure to network sites the participant was conduct and i don‟t like that kind of unsolicited hesitant but i don‟t want to see life content what my daughter is doing i am concerned about privacy i quite happy to pay for these on will be exposed as the father people we want to keep in touch face book can be quite intrusive with a written word is very different esteem they also email but we prefer to from a spoken word hear their voices than read 700 issn22296093 edina susan farai nyemba et al int j comp tech appl vol 2 3 695703 value of online i use skype another hindrance from adoption was security we have emails and mobile from a wide range of aspects especially from those and physical phones friends outside our in charge of securing the information 5 6 they presence profession are with us through feared that some of the companies providing online interaction skype and gtalk skype phone social networking platforms could abuse email visit sms telepathy information entrusted them by users 9 one of the sellingpoints for sns has been the 53 perceived behavioural control need to build a social network ie connect with old apart from the channel of communication time friends and create new relationships most of the is another attribute under the baby boomer‟s respondents felt they had no need to “artificially” control they all mentioned how time consuming expand their networks they felt they had enough social networking can be and for that reason they friends already through realworld connections opt not to use the sites this was true for all the the cost saving benefit did not particularly appeal respondents table 4 portrays the perceived to most golden baby boomers interviewed most of behavioural control theme of time against the the respondents were financially comfortable and interviewees‟ verbatim responses therefore could use the alternative channels of communication they felt cheap resources are for table 4 perceived behavioural control the young people who are still to make it in life themes and verbatim responses financially from the analysis it appears that the baby theme verbatim examples boomers perceived the price of using sns too high sns would disturb me from compared to the benefits they could potentially doing my work gain from the use the way the older community it takes up too much time and perceive the benefits and the costs of using sns time sometimes people get carried could be culturally driven and may be addressed away on such sites through training 7 conclusions 6 discussion of findings sns can potentially contribute towards the findings from this study show that there are acquisition and maintenance of social capital for baby boomers who despite of having physical people of different age groups however the usage access as well as intellectual access to sns will of such technologies amongst the golden baby choose not to engage on online sns the boomers is notably low this study investigated the respondents for this study included highly educated barriers to adoption amongst the baby boomers and people who use information technology for both hence contributed to the debate on the adoption and work and home life therefore lack of access and impact of sns amongst the older generation the technophobia do not come into question findings of the study has the potential of one of the reasons cited by the respondents is influencing the design of technology fear of exposure to content that violate their due to timeconstraints our target sample was cultural norms for example most respondents felt limited to south africa‟s western cape province there are certain things that should not be in the whilst this study is not comprehensive enough public domain eg not all aspects of one‟s considering the sample space and timeconstraints children‟s social life should be public most of this study has provided a foundation upon which them felt this was too high a price to pay and opted further research and practitioner effort can be made for alternative communication channels another towards winning golden baby boomers‟ to reason for not adopting is their sense of the conflict participate in snss and have a positive experience between culture as they know it on the one hand when using them in order for them to become loyal and as it is expressed on sns on the other hand participants most respondents felt that sns are eroding the social fibre 10 19 some expressed the view of a 8 references degenerative society coming up because of the way 1 a rabkin personal knowledge
