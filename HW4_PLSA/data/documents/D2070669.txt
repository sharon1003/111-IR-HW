pinterest stumbleupon email advertisement with less clutter and more convenience wireless products  wireless charging and wireless networking to name a couple are proving more and more popular in comparison to their older wired alternatives what you need to know about wireless charging what you need to know about wireless charging until our devices offer weeklong battery life charging on the go will remain a reality for us all read more yet when it comes to headphones cutting the cord is not always so straightforward headphones powered by bluetooth especially often get a bad rap they still offer benefits however once you know all the issues involved in this guide we’ll take a look at some of the most important things you need to know about wireless headphones1 types of wireless there are three main types of wireless headphones which can be split into two categories — those that require a separate transmitter and those that don’t in the first category are infrared and radio frequency headphones infrared is little used now but headphones that use it are still manufactured by companies such as sennheiser the sennheiser is410 pictured above infrared is best used for tv but it requires an unobstructed line of sight between the headphones and transmitter meaning there are limits on both the distance and angle you can use them radio frequency is more powerful wireless headphones that use radio frequency like the sony mdrrf985rk pictured above can work at ranges of up to 150 feet and the signal can pass through walls so is usable with a home stereo as well as a tv interference is an issue it increases with distance and other wireless devices that use the same frequency range typically 800900mhz can also cause it rf also isn’t secure in the way that bluetooth is bluetooth is your option if you want headphones without a transmitter and are your best bet for general use these require bluetooth technology to be incorporated into the source device phones laptops games consoles and many modern tvs will all have this bluetooth has a range of about 32 feet 10 meters2 bluetooth and sound quality the biggest argument against using bluetooth headphones used to be that they offered poor sound quality this was because bluetooth was not originally intended for streaming highquality music compression early versions of bluetooth compressed audio very heavily producing a harsh digital sound with growing demand greater focus was placed on making improvements in this area in subsequent versions this began with the introduction of the advanced audio distribution profile a2dp to enable streaming of highquality stereo audio via the sbc codec in 2014 a report by sound expert an audio quality testing site concluded that at its highest possible bitrate of 372kbps sbc was comparable to an aac file encoded at 192kpbs and that “most artifacts it produces are beyond human perception” further improvements have been made in bluetooth 30 and 40 as well as through the introduction of the apt x codec apt x promises cdlike performance and is appearing in a growing number of products the evolution of music consumption how we got here the evolution of music consumption how we got here the rise of the i pod the musicplaying mobile phone and a number of streaming media platforms all point toward a single simple idea music is important but how did we get here read more to benefit from it you’ll need both your headphones and audio player to support it samsung lg motorola and htc are among the smartphone manufacturers that support apt x apple currently does not it’s also important to remember that while bluetooth tends to get the blame for poor performance in bluetooth headphones there are a large range of other factors at play including the quality of the headphones themselves and the audio device being used latency another issue with bluetooth headphones is latency this is the short delay between an audio signal entering the headphones and when you can hear it you won’t notice this lag if you’re listening to music but if you’re watching a video the sound may be marginally out of sync latency varies depending on the hardware and software setups you have bluetooth 40 is low latency so will perform better than older versions and it’s another area that is being addressed by apt x3 battery life wireless headphones require their own power supply this will come in the form of either a builtin rechargeable battery or standard disposable batteries battery technologies that are going to change the world battery technologies that are going to change the world battery tech has been growing more slowly than other technologies and is now the long tent pole in a staggering number of industries what will the future of battery technology be read more for headphones that require a wireless transmitter the transmitter will often double up as a charging dock for bluetooth headphones you should look for battery life of around 812 hours this will give you all day playback some expensive pairs will fall well short of this while others far exceed it sony’s drbtn200 promises 40 hours of listening remember though that battery life is related to volume the louder your music the shorter the battery will last battery life quotes on manufacturers’ spec sheets tend to reflect optimum conditions rather than realworld use a battery will normally take around three hours to charge and uses a standard mini or micro usb cable4 nfcbluetooth headphones are straightforward to set up you need to pair them with your audio device — your smartphone tablet or laptop this is generally done via the builtin bluetooth software on the device you’ll need to enter a passcode during the setup phase this is found in the manual for your headphones though in almost all cases it will be 0000 some headphones also support nfc like the sony drbtn200  this is another wireless technology that enables devices to communicate just by holding them in close proximity to one another nfc is the technology that underpins many wireless payment systems everything you need to know about apple pay samsung pay and android pay everything you need to know about apple pay samsung pay and android pay android pay samsung pay apple pay all have their advantages and disadvantages lets take a look at exactly how each of them works and who can use them read more when used in conjunction with an nfcenabled device — including many android smartphones but not the i phone — you can pair the headphones with the device simply by tapping them against it this may cut out the need for the passcode for the initial setup and also speeds up the process of reconnecting5 remote control many wired headphones sport a wired remote on the cable this is used to start stop and skip music tracks as well as to take and reject calls — they often have a small microphone built in wireless headphones don’t have this option instead almost all sets will build some basic controls along with the microphone into one of the earpieces the accessibility of these controls is something you should always test when buying or choosing to keep new headphones it often seems that the button design and layout is determined more by aesthetics than practicality resulting in controls that are difficult to find by touch alone especially if you’re in the gym6 form factor and size wireless headphones come in the three standard styles overear onear and inear the first two look and function much the same as their wired counterparts the latter inear differ somewhat10 terms you should know to identify the best headphones 10 terms you should know to identify the best headphones in this guide well cut through the jargon and show you what the key headphone specifications actually mean and why — or if — they matter read more in order to fit the bluetooth radio and battery inear bluetooth headphones like the jay bird blue buds x either have physically larger earpieces with the two parts connected by a cable or are normalsized but have a thick rigid neckband to house the electronics the next generation of inear bluetooth headphones is tackling this through new manufacturers such as bragi and free wavz the dash from bragi are earbuds that sit directly in the ear without any adjoining cable or neckband they also include 4gb of storage for use without a smartphone the free wavz use a slightly larger earclip design both also incorporate fitness features including a heart rate monitor inevitably their smaller size means that the battery life of inear models is shorter than the larger alternatives wrapup almost all manufacturers now offer a full range of bluetooth headphones at all quality and price points alongside they’re traditional wired range how to make sure you buy the best headphones for your budget how to make sure you buy the best headphones for your budget how do you determine the best
