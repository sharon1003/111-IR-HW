enhanced sense of vision stems fromsolitary orangutans are an example of which residence patternthat this may be a species of old world monkey or ape as the space in the teeth of the mandible suggests the presence of a caninepremolar honing complex in your primate anatomy lab you are shown the mandible lower jaw bone of a species of primate while looking at the teeth you notice a large space between the canine and first premolar in your lab book you notegive birth to fewer offspring than do many other mammals primate femalescanine size the presence of a honing complex relates toboth b and c b male baboons are likely to compete regularly for resources including access to females c male baboons of this species disperse from their natal groups and are less likely to be related in your primate anatomy lab you are asked to observe the skulls of a male and a female baboon after examining each skull and making notes about the large difference in canine size you conclude thatare present only in some platyrrhines prehensile tailsis larger among humans than among other primates relative to body size primate brain size2  1  2  3 the typical catarrhine dental formula is they are the only primates known to depend on material culture for survival what trait makes humans uniquelemurs lorises galagos and tarsiers the suborder prosimians includesboth a and c a results in extended periods of nursing and development to accommodate increasing behavioral complexity c demonstrates the importance of intelligence in primate evolution the increased brain size observed in the order primates40005000 y bp chimpanzee material culture dates tothe lack of sexual dimorphism you see is due to decreased competition for mates in a monogamous social structure when observing primates at the zoo you notice a male and female gibbon quite similar in size unlike what you previously saw in the hamadryas baboon enclosure you know thathave better color vision anthropoids differ from prosimians in that theyto reinforce social structures and cement social bonds in nonhuman primates grooming relationships serve madagascar living lemurs are found only inpottos lories and other similar species a finger pad with primitive dermal ridges most likely belongs to which of the followingmuch of their time foraging for food primates spendthe researchers are relying on anatomical classifications of chimpanzees and humans as this is most appropriate when looking at adaptation and anatomy you are reading a scientific paper regarding the relationships of the anatomical and behavioral characteristics of chimpanzees and their implications for early hominid evolution you note that the authors refer to human ancestors as hominids this implies thatthis primate must be a species of prosimian as that suborder of primates still relies heavily on the sense of smell for many aspects of daily life in class your professor shows you an mri scan of a primate brain the professor points out the relatively large size of the olfactory bulb beneath the frontal lobe this suggests to you thatpassed this new behavior to relatives chimpanzees taught by humans to make simple stone toolsring tailed lemurs the rhinarium is present infour functionally distinctive tooth types primate dietary adaptation is facilitated bychimpanzees using spears to hunt for small primates jane goodalls observations of chimpanzee behavior in the wild documented all of the following exceptmonkeys apes and humans anthropoids includeopposite thumbs modern primates are characterized by arboreal adaptations includinga species of prosimian because they retain the rhinarium commonly found in other mammal species while at the zoo you see an exhibit with a small group of primates you have not seen in your textbook however you notice they have wet snoutlike noses similar to a dogs you tell your friend that this ishave specialized digestive anatomy for eating leaves colobine primatesboth b and c b capuchin monkeys c orangutans the use of different natural objects to obtain food similar to that observed in chimpanzees has been observed in prosimii the tarsiers belong to the taxonomic suborder ofall of the above a social transmission of learned behavior b a type of culture that is learned and passed between individuals c evidence of the cognitive capabilities of primates in studies of primate cognition and tool use researchers have taught chimpanzees to crack open nuts with stones later in life these chimpanzees have taught other young chimpanzees and offspring the same skill this could be considereda derived trait because it is present in only one or few species of a group humans are the only primates who lack a sectorial complex on the premolar this is an example ofincludes three subfamilies within hominids pongines gorillines and hominines the genetic classification for apes and humanslonger arms than legs suspensory primates generally have what type of body structurelemurs which of the following are prosimianshave a reduced sense of smell in comparison to prosimians anthropoidsis greater in societies where males compete sexual dimorphism in canine sizeorangutans all of the anthropoids live in social groups exceptnails instead of claws on all limbs because of the enhanced sense of touch most primate species havean individual that is fully quadrupedal such as a dog a skull with a foramen magnum located on the back which positions the skull in front of the body belongs toall of the above a the use of stick tools by chimpanzees b predatory behavior of chimpanzees c the enduring nature of the motheroffspring bond in chimpanzees jane goodall was the first to documentthat material culture is unique to humans chimpanzee tool use challenges the assumptionringtailed lemurs which of the following prosimians spend considerable amounts of time on the grounda canine that shows wear on the tip a feature unique only to human teeth and human ancestors teeth isall of the above a the presence of arboreal adaptations b increased parental investment c the presence of dietary plasticity which of the following were identified by sir william le gros clark as tendencies of primatesprosimians and anthropoids the two suborders of primates arechimpanzees the y5 molar morphology is present ina new world monkey because many of these species have a tail with grasping abilities similar to those observed in nonhuman primate hands and feet while observing primates at the zoo you notice that the particular monkey you are watching uses its hands feet and tail to move throughout the trees in its enclosure this is most likelygibbons suspensory locomotion is characteristic of which primategibbons monogamy is characteristic ofmasticatory muscles sagittal crests are pronounced in some primates with highly developed  2  1  3  3 the typical dental formula of lorises and lemurs ismales compete for access to females sexual dimorphism in body size is greater in societies wheregalagos lorises tarsiers and lemurs the suborder prosimians includesan enlarged olfactory bulb and enlarged scent glands relative to other primates prosimian adaptations include
