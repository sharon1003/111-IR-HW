mathematician often referred to as the father of geometry his elements is one of the most influential works in the history of mathematics serving as the main textbook for teaching mathematics from the time of its publication until the late 19th or early 20th century how much do we know about euclids life very few original references to euclid survive so little is known about his life the date place and circumstances of both his birth and death are unknown and may only be estimated roughly relative to other figures mentioned alongside him he is rarely mentioned by name by other greek mathematicians from archimedes onward where do the few historical references we have of euclid originate from the few historical references to euclid were written centuries after he lived by proclus c 450 ad and pappus of alexandria c 320 ad what does proclus state regarding euclid according to proclus euclid belonged to platos persuasion and brought together the elements drawing on prior work by several pupils of plato proclus believes that euclid is not much younger than these and that he must have lived during the time of ptolemy i because he was mentioned by archimedes 287212 bc  what is unusual about the lack of biographical evidence regarding euclid extensive biographies are available for most significant greek mathematicians for several centuries before and after euclid what is one theory on the reason for lack of biographical info on euclid because the lack of biographical information is unusual for the period some researchers have proposed that euclid was not in fact a historical character and that his works were written by a team of mathematicians who took the name euclid from the historical character euclid of megara why is the theory that euclid was a team of mathematicians not generally accepted it is not well accepted by scholars due to the fact that there is little evidence in its favor what is euclids elements a mathematical and geometric treatise consisting of 13 books written by the ancient greek mathematician euclid in alexandria it is a collection of definitions postulates axioms propositions theorems and constructions and mathematical proofs of the propositions many of the results in elements originated with earlier mathematicians considering this why was the elements so successful although this is true one of euclids accomplishments was to present them in a single logically coherent framework making it easy to use and easy to reference also it includes a system of rigorous mathematical proofs that remains the basis of mathematics 23 centuries later book 1 book 1 contains euclids 10 axioms and the basic propositions of geometry book 2 book 2 is commonly called the book of geometric algebra because most of the propositions can be seen as geometric interpretations of algebraic identities it also contains a method of finding the square root of a given number book 3 book 3 deals with circles and their properties inscribed angles tangents the power of a point thales theorem book 4 book 4 constructs the incircle and circumcircle of a triangle and constructs regular polygons with 4 5 6 and 15 sides book 5 book 5 is a treatise on proportions of magnitudes proposition 25 has as a special case the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means book 6 book 6 applies proportions to geometry similar figures book 7 book 7 deals strictly with elementary number theory divisibility prime numbers euclids algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor least common multiple propositions 30 and 32 together are essentially equivalent to the fundamental theorem of arithmetic book 8 book 8 deals with proportions in number theory and geometric sequences book 9 book 9 applies the results of the preceding two books and gives the infinitude of prime numbers proposition 20 the sum of a geometric series proposition 35 and the construction of even perfect numbers proposition 36 book 10 book 10 attempts to classify incommensurable in modern language irrational magnitudes by using the method of exhaustion a precursor to integration book 11 book 11 generalizes the results of books 16 to space perpendicularity parallelism volumes of parallelepipeds book 12 book 12 studies volumes of cones pyramids and cylinders in detail it concludes by showing the volume of a sphere is proportional to the cube of its radius by approximating it by a union of many pyramids book 13 book 13 constructs the five regular platonic solids inscribed in a sphere calculates the ratio of their edges to the radius of the sphere and proves that there are no further regular solids what is an axiom an axiom or postulate is a premise or starting point of reasoning as classically conceived an axiom is a premise so evident as to be accepted as true without controversy how many volumes does euclids elements contain 13what is a theorem a statement that has been proven on the basis of previously established statements in what language was euclids elements published in ancient greek when was euclids elements published 300 bcwhere was euclids elements published alexandria besides the elements does euclid have any other works in addition to the elements at least five works of euclid have survived to the present day they follow the same logical structure as elements with definitions and proved propositions what are euclids other works data on divisions of figures catoptrics phaenomena optics explain data data deals with the nature and implications of given information in geometrical problems the subject matter is closely related to the first four books of the elements explain on division of figures on divisions of figures concerns the division of geometrical figures into two or more equal parts or into parts in given ratios it is similar to a thirdcentury ad work by heron of alexandria explain catoptrics catoptrics concerns the mathematical theory of mirrors particularly the images formed in plane and spherical concave mirrors the attribution is held to be anachronistic however by j j oconnor and e f robertson who name theon of alexandria as a more likely author explain phaenomena phaenomena a treatise on spherical astronomy survives in greek it is quite similar to on the moving sphere by autolycus of pitane who flourished around 310 bc explain optics optics is the earliest surviving greek treatise on perspective in its definitions euclid follows the platonic tradition that vision is caused by discrete rays which emanate from the eye what is euclids lemma in number theory euclids lemma is a lemma that captures a fundamental property of prime numbers namely if a prime divides the product of two numbers it must divide at least one of those numbers the lemma is not true for composite numbers what are euclid numbers in mathematics euclid numbers are integers of the form en  pn  1 where pn is the nth primorial ie the product of the first n primes they are named after the ancient greek mathematician euclid no euclid number can be a square what is the euclidean algorithm in mathematics the euclidean algorithm or euclids algorithm is an efficient method for computing the greatest common divisor gcd of two numbers the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder how does the euclidean algorithm work the euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the greatest common divisor of two numbers does not change if the larger number is replaced by its difference with the smaller number since this replacement reduces the larger of the two numbers repeating this process gives successively smaller pairs of numbers until one of the two numbers reaches zero when that occurs the other number is the gcd of the original two numbers
