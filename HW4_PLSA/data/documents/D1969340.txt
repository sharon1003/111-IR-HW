plug and play grid tie inverters i got so excited when i read that you can buy a plugandplay grid tie inverter and pump the electricity from your solar panel directly into the grid for less than a hundred bucks that i snatched up the first one i saw on ebay the theory is sound and would make smallscale solar fit into the average persons price rangeif it wasnt illegal and potentially hazardous the dream is that you can simply plug a solar panel directly into one of these small inverters and plug the other end of the inverter into an electric socket in your house on the level im interested in theres no way youd actually be feeding energy back into the grid since continuous loads in your house like the computer fridge etc will suck up all the juice youve created but you would lower your electric bill and would also remove the most disposable part of a solar power system  the batteries without the repeated purchase of batteriesi figured even the solar panels you can buy at harbor freight for less than 200 would pay for themselves before they began to seriously lose efficiency the problem with the dream is that utilities require you to jump through such a series of hoops before tying into the grid that you might as well not even think about it unless youre willing to sink a few thousand dollars into the project i contacted our local electric company appalachian electric power and found out that in order to plug in a grid tie inverter wed need to1 sign an interconnection agreement 2 install a certified ul 1741 inverter s and 3 install a disconnect switch alternating current accessible lockable with visible open position near the meter the employee i emailed with who went to great lengths to make his emails understandable by the layman explained that the existing disconnect below the meter is not sufficient to fulfill step 3 in addition more extensive reading on the internet shows that a certified inverter costs around 2000 putting grid tiein completely out of our league the electric company has a few valid reason to squash cheap plugandplay inverters the biggest hazard from these inverters comes during power outages when the electric company shuts down the juice on a line so that it can be repaired without the proper precautions your solar panels would continue feeding electricity into what is supposed to be a dead line and you could fry the linemen who come to fix the problem granted even the cheap power jack grid tie inverter we found on ebay has antiislanding protection so presumably this problem wouldnt occur i read an excellent point on a forum that our grid tie inverter is inherently unsafe since it has live electricity on the male end of the plug rather than protected within a female plug this is where my very mild libertarian leanings come out  we live in a household of two adults who can remember to unplug the solar panel before yanking the inverter out of the wall were not going to fry ourselves many people buy these plugandplay grid tie inverters and surreptitiously put them to use in their own homes chances are no one at the electric company would ever find out although if you go the illegal route and have a fire in your home your fire insurance will probably refuse to pay for the damages unfortunately breaking the law would keep me up at night so weve wasted 90 on a useless grid tie inverter and will have to figure out a better way to harness the extra energy that doesnt go into charging our power packs looking for a cheap homestead gadget try our homemade chicken waterer that will never spill or fill with poop

power companies andor state may offer subsidies etc comment by irilyth livejournalcom — sun aug 22 113343 2010remove comment the other issue with using a cheap inverter theres another big danger that im surprised the utility representative didnt warn you about household electricity is of course ac  alternating current the instantaneous voltage varies from a positive to negative peak voltage usually in the form of a sine wave however theres no law of nature that will require all sine waves coming from different sources to be in sync in fact they will usually be out of phase so if you have a solar panel or a generator feeding an inverter it will likely be out of phase with the current feeding your house the least of your problems then would have a negative voltage add to a positive voltage and cancel out reducing your voltage which is bad for anything trying to run off it a bigger problem would be to have a positive voltage add to a positive voltage increasing your voltage which is worse for anything trying to run off it and can cause fires approved inverters will have circuitry that will detect the phase of the line current and create its current in phase with the line

shows the inductive and capacitive load banks used for antiislanding testing the size of the copper conductors between the capacitators and the size of the inductive coils gives me the impression were talking serious current here a search for that particular ul standard also turned up the xpxa1000 inverter that is ul 1741 approved and costs 350 the only drawback im seeing is that it needs a solar panel of 100 w minimum but that might be an excuse to get an extra solar panel no it also comes with an ethernet port to enable you to monitor it which sounds cool it would be nice to be able to jack

fault i think that i had already bought it when you got excited well have to see whether marks inventive side says gadget i want to find a way to turn this into something more useful or whether we resell it but youre right that its probably not a big loss either way edward  good points i think the electric guy was less interested in what would happen on my end than with what would happen on the grid but extra research elsewhere suggested the risk just wasnt worth it roland  well have to crunch some numbers and see whether that more expensive inverter is worth it i really do think that tying into the grid makes a lot of sense deleting all of those batteries from the system the other thing weve been considering is making our own virtual battery using one of your other suggestions  pumping water into tanks on the hill i havent looked into how much it would cost and how much height wed need to then turn that potential energy into electricity using some kind of hydropower setup but it certainly would be a cool batteryless arrangement and give us more water to use on the farm comment by anna — sun aug 22 164802 2010remove commentcomment 5considering your goal of having power in case of a powerline failure youre probably going to be needing those batteries anyway as for the hydro scheme on a small scale the efficiency is probably going to be small because of the size effect on pumps turbines and generators that weve discussed earlier but since your solar power is essentially free you might not care too much about that but with 50 w of power youre not going to pump a lot of water very high the power needed to pump up water equals ṁ·g·δh where ṁ is the mass flow in kgs g is the strength of the gravity field 981 nkg and δh is the height in meters with 50 watts you could eg transport 01 kgs or ls up 50 meters and that is without motor pump and friction losses so in practice it will be less when using the water in the reservoir suppose the pumpgenerator is 50 efficient which is optimistic imo and you want to sustain a load of 100 w for 8 hours knowing that 01 kgs of water dropping 50 m yields 50 w youll need 0205  04 kgs of water for 8·3600 seconds which is 1152 m³ 406 ft³ of water if you want to go with tanks thats 10 of those big 1200 l ibcs youve got to haul up a 50 meter hill or a reservoir of 12 by 12 feet and three feet deep youll have to dig and it would take only 32 hours of sunshine to fill up the reservoir so after a week your reservoir is full and then what are you going to do with the extra power if you build a big enough reservoir on a suitable location you might catch rainwater for extra power but be very careful when designing a water reservoir on higher ground i would consider that a job unsuitable for a layman consider that catastrophic failure is always an option at least put it someplace where a potential flood cant ruin your house or garden remember the 1985 stava tailings dam failure comment by rolandsmith — sun aug 22 191434 2010remove comment water tanks as batteries we dont mind being very minimal in the event of a power outage and we sized our battery system for that minimal use but we oversized the solar panels because well they were cheap and looked interesting i was thinking of the tanks being a one day energy storage setup to utilize the bit of extra juice the panels will put out that wont fit in the batteries during the day then every night wed let the water drain down perhaps into a lower tank or to water the garden or back to the source or whatever to power lights as we read the load im talking about is much less than what youre talking about  maybe 20 watts for two hours in that kind of setup i dont think wed be talking huge tanks  our thousand gallon tank alone might be sufficient the

think the best use of your additional solar output would be to invest in additional battery packs and go ahead and store the power then think of installing 12 volt lighting in your trailer and use car chargers for your laptops think camper trailer almost everything is 12 volt but uses a battery charger when plugged to charge the batteries anyway this removes the loss you experience trying to

how much water power you need lets assume a 25 efficiency of the pipesturbinegeneratorrectifier combo which doesnt sound too wildly optimistic so youll need 80 w of water power if you have a 20 m high hill around 04 kgs of water flow would give you around 04·981·20  785 w of water power with the assumed efficiency of 25 thats around 20 w of electrical power a completely filled 1000 gallon tank would then last for 378543600  263 hours say 25 hours according to my literature for small hydropower setups a socalled crossflow turbine aka michel ossberger or bankiturbine see below is best this is

comment by anna — mon aug 23 155551 2010remove comment don ive got a gut feeling that water at a couple of bars of pressure would make short work of your avarage squirrel cage fan its probably much too flimsy for starters a squirrel cage fan is usually a centrifugal fan which has a mounting point at one side only since the other side is open a crossflow turbine will probably need bearings on two sides the highpressure water is converted by a nozzle into a highvelocity stream of water which then hits the blades second for a crossflow turbine to work youll need curved blades the curved blades deflect the water stream twice going into the cage and coming out and the change in momentum impulse causes a force on the turbine blades this can generate significant forces on the turbine blades btw you can see the homemade steel crossflow tubine on this video its quite a bit sturdier than a squirrel cage rotor id say the steel blades are about 14 think and you can see a 10 bar jet of water

inverter you would have seen that the inverter actually only applies power when it senses that its plugged into the power grid through your plug in your house its called island protection and the inverter you got from ebay has it if the power on the grid goes out so does the inverter power on the note from the electronics guy about the sine wave not matching if you would have read about the inverter you would see that the inverter matches the sine wave before the power goes out i am an electronics technician with over 20 years expierence and get mad when i see people talking before they

certification im surprised cannada does not accept the enphase m215 inverter looking back at what others have said about grid tie inverters it is apparant most of us know little about how they work  first they do not generate voltage that is entered onto the grid just current to do that they must get voltage from the grid sync with the grid before allowing any current to flow onto the grid where some of these cheap plug and play units may not meet certification requirements by power companys is a requirement in us of a five 5 minute delay after a grid failure before turning inself back on

heater 1000 watts and a hair dryer 1200 watts that is 22 amps at 120 volts you now have a situation where you can run both of these devices because there is 2 power sources on the 14 guage wire this is an over load condition and will over heat the wire but will not trip the main panel breaker it only sees the power being drawn thru the breaker add it up power sources main 15 amp breaker plus 10 amps from the 1200 watt inverter that is 25 amp potential in the 14 guage wire normally those kinds of amps require a 10 guage wire to be legal and prevent wiring over heat conditions there is no

i havent had a single issue i have monitoring equipment attached to the inverter for information and records it matches the frequency wave form and voltage of the grid power exactly the worries about frying linemen in a outage are 999 wrong the inverter requires the grid power to turn on and match the power produced with the grid requirements without this grid template the inverter doesnt even allow electricity from the panel to even enter the device past the led fault indicator i wouldnt put 300 watts of solar into the 400w rated device because i would worry about over heating a simple form of insurance should the fan fail or cannot handle the amount of heat generated is to attach the inverter to a control boardthat is then attached to a wall or stud with the fansolar contact side placed so the heat is able to escape quicker and easier usually facing upwards this allows the heat to vent out the top easier and faster due to the fan and vent being on the upward side as heat rises this offers a buffer zone should the forced ventilation of the unit fail my inverter has been running consistently at 350w being since 700 this morning it is now 130 in the afternoon and the inverter

matches its own from the power company when the power goes out wall voltage dies it stops producing electricity automatically because there is not sinewave source from which to match this is called antiislanding even the most basic grid tie inverters do this the key word here is grid tie normal inverters should never be plugged in as they will cause the problems indicated in other comments i can see that a lot of people here are making comments with lack of knowledge in this area one comment noted that its not safe because if you unplug it it has a male plug and that someone touching this might be injured the reality is as soon as you unplug it it stops producing electricity since there is no sinewave source causing a fire well yes its true that there is a potential for this but so is there a potential for anything you plug into wall current to cause a fire you can think of these micro inverters as an electrical appliance something that does not work unless plugged in if your grid tie inverter has a circuit breaker fuse etc it will most likely trip its own breaker or fuse before anything bad can happen the same goes for the wall outlet its protected by a circuit breaker in your home sure there might be regulations in place to prevent legal use so sure you should check with your local area for what the regulations are and what certification is needed comment by damon — mon
