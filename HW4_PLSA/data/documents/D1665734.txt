movies  film reviewfilm reviewla cage aux folles but in south beach by janet maslin march 8 1996shaking a layer of dust off its wellworn marabou la cage aux folles returns to the screen as the birdcage an american remake with plenty of new pizazz this material still shows its age as it did even in the 1979 frenchlanguage version but it has been tarted up with giddy ingenuity staged by mike nichols in a tame aidsfree universe where homosexuality simply means wacky fashion sense it now features political satire robin williams in a devilishly debonair mode nathan lane in outlandish drag and plenty of dialogue in the irresistible voice of elaine may when a reporter from the national enquirer starts pestering these characters one of them has this to say about the news hound my god hes put on so much weight since the simpson trial the french film based on the stage play by jean poiret obviously didnt have that but to an astonishing degree the birdcage amounts to a linebyline copy though ms may often takes the original punch line and adds significantly more punch for instance when the storys transvestite character has a tantrum and refuses to perform at the drag nightclub of the title hes told in the french film that theres a large crowd waiting for him to go on new version set in south beach in miami instead of st tropez theres 150 people out there half of them are kennedys and theyre all waiting for you the plot as dizzyingly farcical as ever armand mr williams and albert mr lane are a gay couple who have together raised armands son val dan futterman now to their chagrin val wants to get married and to a girl  and a girl calista flockhart whose father is a prominent conservative politician the film makers have had great fun turning the father played with deadpan wickedness by gene hackman into a buffoonish pat buchanan who frets over which clergyman should marry val and his daughter the pope too controversial billy graham too liberal the film revolves around a single event the meeting of these colossally incompatible future inlaws senator keeley and his snobbish wife dianne wiest plays her hilariously wondering if south beach is anything like palm beach are hoping that vals family will be highly respectable since theyre trapped in the midst of a nasty political scandal armand and albert for their part want to do val a favor by temporarily straightening up their act that means purging their apartment of homoerotic bricabrac and bringing in new props like a nice set of books when mrs keeley takes a good look at them she wonders why theyre nancy drew meanwhile armand gives albert the obligatory lessons in hemanly behavior and albert who minces extravagantly is even taught how to walk like john wayne where the french film accepted the wayne stride as a masculine ideal this new version finds it interestingly peculiar mr nichols puts his film through these paces with dependable comic agility and rises to the requisite frantic pitch when the two families meet for dinner regrettably armand and alberts wildly campy houseboy hank azaria has set out the pornographic china why it looks like young men playing leapfrog sweetly exclaims mrs keeley is it greek watching get recommendations on the best tv shows and films to stream and watch delivered to your inbox sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special

military alexander the great is mentioned and some sneaky jabs at senator keeleys antisemitism it even presents gay characters who think bob dole is cute but it still has little footing in the real world the gay nightclub setting is watered down with shots of a heterosexual audience and armand and albert seem even less like actual lovers than their french predecessors did the subplot involving the biological mother played by christine baranski who abandoned val has gone from farfetched to vaguely appalling when the farce isnt fizzing these characters look several shades more dimwitted than they did before the birdcage might seem an odd occasion to find mr williams playing things straight but this is one of his most cohesive and least antic performances its also a mischievously funny one he does a fine job of integrating gag lines with semiserious acting all the while modeling a delirious silky wardrobe with the emphasis on nightmare prints mr lane in the campier role gives a solid but broad performance without the coy gentility that made michel serrault funnier in french but he has nice legs and looks good in pearls the birdcage is rated r under 17 requires accompanying parent
