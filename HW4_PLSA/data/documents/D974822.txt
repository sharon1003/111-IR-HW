thyroid problems  cruciferous vegetables katie  wellness mama 43 comments updated march 7 2018 this post contains affiliate links twitter facebook google pinterest reddit cruciferous vegetables are some of the healthiest foods on the planet and some of my personal favorites to eat when i was diagnosed with hashimotos i found out there was a lot of confusion on whether or not those with thyroid problems should continue eating them some sources claim cruciferous veggies should be avoided especially raw while others say they are fine to eat but recommend taking a natural iodine supplement to support the thyroid when eating cruciferous veggies i needed an answer to this question for myself when my doctor recommended eating broccoli sprouts i asked his opinion on cruciferous vegetables his answer and my research made me comfortable consuming these vegetables regularly… here’s why glucosinolates and goitrogens oh my cruciferous vegetables contain glucosinolates which are metabolized into isothiocyanates itc in the body research shows that these compounds are protective against various types of cancer  1 cruciferous veggies are also an excellent source of vitamins minerals and phytochemicals that support the body in various ways at the same time these veggies contain goitrogens which can inhibit the body’s uptake of iodine research in animals showed that this blocking of iodine uptake may contribute to the development of a goiter which is the reason that cruciferous veggies are often not recommended for those with thyroid disease so what is a person with thyroid disease to do in my opinion eat the greens iodine selenium and animal studies dr joel fuhrman explains animal studies suggested the hypothetical thyroid issue from eating very large amounts of cruciferous vegetables years ago however no human study has demonstrated a deficiency in thyroid function from consuming cruciferous vegetables only one such study seems to have been conducted as of yet in that study no effects on thyroid function were observed in subjects eating 150 grams of cooked brussels sprouts daily for 4 weeks raw cruciferous vegetables have not been investigated however the only case report relating cruciferous vegetables to thyroid harm suggests that it would be almost impossible to consume enough cruciferous to harm the thyroid this case was that of an 88year old woman who developed hypothyroidism after eating 115 kg 2233 pounds of raw bok choy every day for several months an excessive and unreasonable intake of raw cruciferous in other words a person would have to consume an insane amount of raw cruciferous to have a negative effect on thyroid function in fact the opposite is actually true in today’s world it is easy to have too much iodine which as i explained before can be just as detrimental to the thyroid and was for me this is especially problematic if there is a deficiency in selenium as well  2my doctor explained that if a person’s thyroid disorder is not caused by iodine deficiency the iodine blocking properties of cruciferous vegetables are nothing to worry about especially if the person is eating a nutrient dense diet that contains natural sources of iodine and selenium he estimates that over 90 of thyroid patients have autoimmune thyroid disease and not simply low thyroid function because of iodine deficiency so cruciferous vegetables are almost always a nonissue in fact too much iodine can actually be a factor in increased risk of autoimmune disease in countries where iodine was added to the food supply to combat thyroid disease rates of autoimmune thyroid disease increased  3an excess of iodine especially in supplemental form can increase autoimmune attack on the body by inhibiting the ability of an enzyme called thyroid peroxidase tpo in these cases the mild iodine inhibition from cruciferous vegetables can actually be helpful for those with thyroid problems additionally cruciferous vegetables may help the body produce glutathione an antioxidant that is important for thyroid health and for mitigating autoimmune disease broccoli and broccoli sprouts contain sulforaphane a cancerfighting compound that has been extensively studied for its anticancer properties  4bottom line cruciferous vegetables are healthy and provide a variety of benefits even and especially for those with thyroid disease of course anyone with thyroid disease or any other health problem should work with a qualified doctor or functional medicine practitioner to find the best diet medication and lifestyle answers but the existing medical evidence does not suggest that avoiding cruciferous vegetables is helpful in fact cruciferous vegetables may be especially helpful for those with autoimmune thyroid disease because of their iodinemitigating action consuming 23 pounds per day of raw green veggies would probably not be advisable but then again consuming 23 pounds of any single food group daily isn’t the best idea if you’re concerned or think you might have nonautoimmune lowthyroid just cook the veggies as this is shown to deactivate most of the goitrogens personally i eat a lot of green vegetables daily and consume about 75 of them cooked and only 25 raw i also make sure that my diet contains natural sources of selenium and don’t supplement with iodine“eat food not too much mostly plants” michael pollan
