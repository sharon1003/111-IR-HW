suit buying tips the alfani suit by admin posted on may 23 2016share tweet share email comments the alfani suit is a classic found at macy’s brick and mortar locations and multiple online retailers this suit was created to please bargain shoppers looking for something fashionable yet conservative designer alfani is a designer for macy’s inc and designs a lot more than just suits for men you’ll find jackets shirts pants and even shoes for both men and women made from this designer models this suit brand tends to sell a lot of suit separates you’ll find that this is fairly common with department store suit models although separates can be looked down upon by some suit buyers it is great for those with unusual sizes body builders that don’t want to spend the money on a bespoke suit will usually have to turn to suit separates to accommodate their thin waist sizes small pants and large chest sizes large jackets the only suit model i was able to find any information on was the alfani red label this suit seems to be a slim fit suit made of wool it it double vented and comes in both two and three piece suit models i found the red label in charcoal gray light gray black and blue however i noticed that all of the models i came across were 2 button suits also both striped and solid suit patterns were available in this model alfani suit example here is a picture of a two piece light gray red label suit this suit has notched lapels and is a two button suit although you can’t tell from the picture it has two vents in the back the pants are flat front pants and the bottom of the pant legs are uncuffed this is typical with flat front pants if the suit had pleats or double pleats it would probably need to have cuffs at the bottom style you’ll find a wide selection of two and three piece classics with mid range lapel sizes three button is much more common than two button but you will be able to find the latter if it suits you better material material is usually wool with a spin of around super 100’s or better quality for this suit isn’t considered luxury or cheap either color you won’t find anything over the top in this collection however blacks blues grays and tans are available on most models price price ranges from 150 to 500 retail but i have yet to see an actual list price of over 400 these can also be found at places like ebay for less than 150 dollars conclusion men looking for some decent cuts and stitches for a reasonable price should consider an alfani suit look for a different brand however if you want high quality materials facebook comments related items alfani suit share tweet share email most popular suit buying tips designer suits159kthe basics suit fabric144kfeatured how to buy a suit105kthe basics mens suit styles suit buying tips zoot suit rental suit buying tips pronto uomo suits suit buying tips calvin klein suit97kthe basics suit patterns suit buying tips ted baker suits suit buying tips how to pick the best business suit mens suits  right at your fingertipsmen’s suit – right at your fingertips copyright © 2008  2016  the guide to mens suits
