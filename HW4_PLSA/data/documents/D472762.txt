how much force can our bones handle before they break by karen wentworth  submitted on august 21 20121you have known all along that your bones are the strongest part of your body as they are assigned to give your body a structure to hold your posture up and to protect your internal organs your bones have to maintain their strength at all times of course you cannot prevent external and unexpected circumstances from damaging your bones but as much as you can you can prevent it from happening probably one of the best ways which you can protect your bones is to know just how much force they are capable of handling before they reach their breaking point your bones are really strong in fact sometimes they are even considered as stronger than steel but in principle if you divide your bones by cubic inch sizes each can handle the weight of any object equivalent to 19000 lbs or approximately 8626 kilos however considering force requires a different understanding as most experts say your bones can handle weight in various ways depending on the force with which they are delivered the more force you apply to a bone the easier it is to break it in some studies it was found out that bones can handle about 3300 newton of force if thrown into a rib and up to 4000 newton if released onto the femur the ribs can take a smaller amount of force because they are relatively thinner than the femur but these are only estimates of the force that can subject you to a fracture it does not mean that these calculations are the least amount of force that your bones can handle in fact they are simply estimates in between because it still depends on the density and strength of your bones of course your bones can handle less than 3300 newton of force if they are weaker and with lesser density therefore you have to check first the strength of your bones to prevent overexertion and possible fractures it is great to know the estimates of how much force your bones can handle before they reach their breaking point it is suggested that you consult with your doctor or osteopath first to ensure that your bones are in healthy condition they may be able to prescribe exercises to maintain bone strength or alert you to possible future conditions that may present problems your trusted osteopath is the right person you should talk regarding all bone problems hi im karen ever since my friend introduced me to osteopathy ive been a huge fan my osteopathy practitioner helps me get back on track when i visit this has inspired me to understand more about my body and how i can get the best from it article source httpezine articlescomexpertkarenwentworth1328232
