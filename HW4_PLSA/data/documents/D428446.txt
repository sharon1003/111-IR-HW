was a judge on pop idol wished to launch a show to which he owned the television rights 12 pop idol  s first series was massively successful and while the second series was also successful the viewing figures for its finale dropped 13 some – including cowells fellow pop idol judge pete waterman – 14 considered michelle mc manus an unworthy winner 14 in 2004 itv announced a new show created by cowell with no involvement from pop idol creator simon fuller – the x factor 12 the perceived similarity between the two shows later became the subject of a legal dispute 15at present the programme is contracted to run until 2019 16 17format categories unlike pop idol the x factor has no upperage limit groups can apply and contestants are also split into categories cowell said were trying to create a different competition hopefully were going to be able to appeal to somebody over the age of 35 who keeps saying to me there arent any artists i like in the competition its amazing but we havent catered for older record buyers who want to buy into the new cliff richard or whatever 12for series 1–3 the competition was split into three categories 16–24s solo acts aged 16–24 over 25s solo acts aged 25 and over and groups including duos in series 4–5 the minimum age was lowered to 14 creating a 14–24 age group with the addition of a fourth judge in series 4 this was split into separate male and female sections making four categories in all boys 14–24 males girls 14–24 females over 25s and groups for series 6 the minimum age returned to 16 meaning that the boys category became 16–24 males and the girls category became 16–24 females for series 7 the age group boundaries were changed and the over 25s became over 28s with the boys and girls categories becoming 16–28 18 it was changed back to over 25s for series 8 19 before reverting to over 28s in series 9 20 in series 10 it became the over 25s again 21 in series 11 the minimum age returned to 14 this then returned to 16 as of series 12 also in series 12 the over 25s category was renamed to overs in series 11 each judge chose a wildcard for another judge this could be any act who was given a chair at any point in the sixchair challenge in all series apart from series 12 the shows producers decided which judge mentored which category in the 12th series the public chose which judge mentored which category via a twitter vote novelty acts alongside the more serious acts who are contesting to win the competition or gain enough exposure to secure a future recording contract the x factor usually has at least one novelty act or joke act in the live shows 22 this helps to boost ratings and add some fun into the live shows although they tend to be controversial due to the show being primarily a singing competition some of the popular novelty acts to appear on the show include rhydian roberts johnny robinson rylan clark diva fever chico slimani wagner stevi ritchie seann miley moore honey g and jedward 23 these tend to be predominantly in the overs category and occasionally in the groups for series 9 of the x factor judge gary barlow reportedly had an issue with the overs category which he had been chosen to mentor a source stated gary doesnt like joke acts and the overs category is often full of novelty acts 24while mentoring what barlow called the joke category he showed strong support for selfconfessed pantomime villain christopher maloney right through to the grand final despite strong criticism from fellow judges louis walsh and tulisa for his cabaret performances 25 the format was changed for series 10 with no joke contestant in the final 12 writing for the telegraph olly mann felt that this change was unwelcoming he wrote the fact that the joke contestants made it through to the live shows used to be the most gloriously british part of the x factor we love an underdog it was a vital part of the format 26 however the joke act returned to series 13 with honey g 27 the rapper from harrow north london was described by isabel mohan in the telegraph as the biggest joke in x factor history 28stages there are five stages to the competition stage 1 producers auditions – these auditions are untelevised and decide who will sing in front of the judges stage 2 judges auditions – either in an audition room series 1–5 13– an arena series 6–9 12 or both series 10–11stage 3 bootcamp – a series of challenges and knockout rounds series 1–9 the sixchair challenge series 10–11 or both series 12–stage 4 judges houses – either prerecorded series 1–11 13– or live series 12stage 5 live shows finalsnote in series 10–11 the bootcamp round was shortened to only several minutes and was broadcast before the start of the sixchair challenge auditions this section is written like a personal reflection or opinion essay that states a wikipedia editors personal feelings about a topic please help improve it by rewriting it in an encyclopedic style july 2013  learn how and when to remove this template messagea round of first auditions is held in front of producers months before the show is aired either by application and appointment or at open auditions that anyone can attend these auditions held at various venues around the uk attract very large crowds the auditions themselves are not televised but shots of crowds waving and judges cars arriving are filmed and later spliced in with the televised auditions shot later in the year the production team supply the crowds with homemade signs 29 after waiting at the venue for hours and filming more inserts of screaming and waving candidates are given a brief audition by someone from the production team 29 should they pass that audition either for reasons of talent or for the potential of making entertaining television they are given a golden ticket that allows them to sing to a more senior production member 29 only candidates who successfully pass that second and third auditions are invited to perform to the judges 29 the televised version misrepresents the process by implying that the entire huge crowds all perform to the judges 29a selection of the auditions in front of the judges – usually the best the worst and the most bizarre described by louis walsh as the good the bad and the ugly 30 – are broadcast over the first few weeks of the show in the first five series each act entered the audition room and delivered a standup unaccompanied performance of their chosen song to the judges from series 6–9 the judges auditions were held in front of a live audience and the acts sang over a backing track if a majority of the judges two in series 1–3 or three from series 4 onwards say yes then the act goes through to the next stage otherwise they are sent home from series 10 the judges room auditions were brought back successful acts then later went onto the judges arena auditions 31 in series 12 the room auditions were axed with only the arena auditions taking place 32over 50000 people auditioned for series 1 33 around 75000 for series 2 34 and around 100000 for series 3 35 the number of applicants for series 4 reached 150000 36 182000 37 people auditioned for series 5 and a record 200000 people applied for series 6 9 series 7 applicants were given the opportunity to apply by uploading a video audition to the internet 38 in series 9 for the first time applicants could audition online via facebook 39 the shows producers also sent a mobile audition van to 18 locations throughout the uk and ireland so they can audition singers who cannot make the arena auditions 40bootcamp and judges houses the contestants selected at auditions are further refined through a series of performances at bootcamp and then at the judges houses previously judges homes until a small number eventually progress to the live finals nine in series 1 12 from series 2 to 6 16 from series 7–8 13 in series 9 and back to 12 in series 10 walsh revealed in october 2007 that the houses the contestants visit may not actually belong to the judges but are sometimes rented for the purpose 41 during these stages the producers allocate each of the judges a category to mentor in the early series this allocation took place after completion of the auditions and prior to bootcamp but from series 4 all four judges work together at the bootcamp stage they collectively choose 24 acts six from each category for the next round and only then find out which category they will mentor bootcamp has two stages in the first stage acts are allocated into groups and must perform a song to the judges in their groups with each act showcasing a few parts of the song solo those who pass this stage then must sing again on their own in the next stage in front of the judges a live audience was added to the second stage from series 4 onwards one exception in series 5 saw the live audience in the first stage instead and another in series 7 saw it being axed altogether due to coles and minogues absences and the performances at both stages now take place at wembley arena from series 7 onwards the first use of the live audience at the arena was in series 8 usually in both stages the judges do not give any feedback to the acts after performing and only deliberate on which acts to send through after all the performances at each stage are finished however in series 5 9 10 12 13 and 14 the judges give feedback to the acts in the first stage and immediately decide who to send through they also made the immediate decisions in the second stage in series 7 an intermediate stage was used inbetween the two stages in which the acts were taught to do a dance routine by the creative director but were not judged on performance in series 8 and 9 the judges reviewed the audition tapes of the acts and deliberated on who to send home before their arrival only revealing their eliminated acts to the contestants just before the first stage in series 13 the second stage of bootcamp was cut down and the judges made the decisions on who to send through to the next stage of the competition in series 4 6 and 8 the judges found out which category they would be mentoring at the same time that the contestants found out their mentor but in series 5 7 and 9 the contestants did not know who their mentor was until they revealed themselves at the house the judges then disband for the judges houses round where they reduce their six acts to three for the live shows 42 43 in series 7 and 8 a total of 32 acts went through to judges houses giving each judge eight acts instead of six 18in series 10 the format to bootcamp was changed the judges find out their categories before bootcamp starts and each judge will make decisions on who is performing in the sixchair challenge by eliminating the contestants this is up to each individual judge from series 11 onwards the judges do not know their categories before the bootcamp so they have to make the decisions together after the bootcamp round the mentor challenges their contestants through the sixchair challenge judges make decisions on who to put through to judges houses straight after each act has performed with those getting a yes taking a chair in the final six chairs on stage it is up to the mentor to decide which act they want to take to judges houses but once all six spots are full if the mentor wants to send another act through to the next stage it means they have to replace one of those who were previously given a yes this format was very poorly rated by many members of the british public 44 bootcamp still took place but only highlights were shown in the first episode of the sixchair challenge in series 12 all of bootcamp aired onscreen 45 a more brutal twist to the sixchair challenge was introduced in series 14 where the mentor is to sit at a smaller table at the side of the arena while making the decisions while the other judges remain at a larger table on the other side for series 12 the judges houses round was given a new tweak the contestants perform for their mentors in the scheduled destinations as usual but only find out whether or not they are through to the live shows during a live decider in front of a studio audience of friends and family judges houses returned to its previous format in being entirely prerecorded at the locations for series 13 the x factor house the selected finalists either 9 12 13 or 16 acts move into shared accommodation to take part in the show the house accommodates both contestants and tv production staff 46 and footage from the house is often used in spinoff show the xtra factor in 2009 the house in west heath avenue golders green 47 received significant press coverage when it was mobbed by fans leading to the police being called 48 this led to concerns by the neighbours of the 2010 house in hyver hill mill hill 49 that it would receive similar attention 50 with a local farmer worried his land would be damaged 51 but local businesses were said to be looking forward to increased trade 52 the 2011 residence connaught house in hertford heath had cameras installed for filming 53 in 2012 the finalists stayed at the corinthia hotel in london 54live shows entrance to fountain studios where the live shows were previously filmed the finals consist of a series of two live shows the first featuring the contestants performances and the second revealing the results of the public voting culminating in one or more acts being eliminated celebrity guest performers also feature regularly these live shows were filmed at fountain studios in wembley london from series 1 to 13 in series 1–5 both live shows were broadcast on saturday nights in series 6 the results show moved to sunday nights in series 1 nine acts were put through to the live shows increased to 12 in series 2 in series 7 following the addition of four wildcards it increased to 16 18 in series 8 the judges selected four acts each to go through the live shows without the inclusion of wildcards then in series 9 it reduced back to three each but one wildcard was added meaning there were 13 finalists series 10 reverted to 12 finalists series 11 initially did the same but the addition of four wildcards in the live shows brought it back up to 16 finalists but with the wildcards chosen by a different judge instead of their categorys mentor series 12 used the same format as series 9 in which each category had three acts before one wildcard was added for series 13 it returned to just 12 finalists with no wildcard twist like in series 10 although wildcard acts in each category were selected prior to judges houses each judge picking for another judges category series 14 also used the wildcard premise as series 7 and 11 but added a twist in which the public voted for one act in each category to progress to the live shows performances the show is primarily concerned with identifying a potential pop star or star group and singing talent appearance personality stage presence and dance routines are all important elements of the contestants performances in the initial live shows each act performs once in the first show in front of a studio audience and the judges usually singing over a prerecorded backing track dancers are also commonly featured acts occasionally accompany themselves on guitar or piano in the first two series acts usually chose a cover of a pop standard or contemporary hit in series 1 much was made of the idea that each performermentor combination was free to present the performance however they wanted including performer playing live instruments or the addition of choirs backing bands and dancers from the third series each live show has had a different theme each contestants song is chosen according to the theme a celebrity guest connected to the theme is often invited onto the show and clips are shown of the guest conversing with the contestants at rehearsal after each act has performed the judges comment on their performance heated disagreements usually involving judges defending their contestants against criticism are a regular feature of the show once all the acts have appeared the phone lines open and the viewing public vote on which act they want to keep once the number of contestants has been reduced to four series 1 and 3 five series 2 4 5 6 8 9 10 and 11 or seven series 7 the format changes each act performs twice in the first show with the public vote opening after the first performance this continues until only two series 1 and 3 three series 2 4 5 6 8 9 10 and 11 or four series 7 acts remain these acts go on to appear in the grand final which decides the overall winner by public vote in past series some of the more memorable failed auditionees from the early rounds have also returned for a special appearance in the final from its inception up to series 7 the final took place in the same studio as the live shows however from series 8 onwards due to the success of the arena auditions the final now takes place at wembley arena accommodating a larger stage and a much larger audience in series 9 however the final took place at manchester central as wembley arena was unavailable series 6 saw a change to the live show format since then the live shows on saturdays show just the contestants performances and sundays results shows reveal the results for the contestants giving viewers a much longer time span to vote series 9 completely changed the voting format lines now open for viewers to vote at the start of each show and then close during the results show for series 14 the format of the live shows was revised significantly the finalists are divided into two groups where the contestants in each group compete against each other on saturday or sunday to win that nights show the two winning contestants competing against each other to win a weekly prize the voting window has once again been shortened in that viewers only have a few minutes to vote for their favourite acts after all the contestants on the night have performed results before the results are announced there are live or prerecorded performances from one or more invited celebrities often with performers connected to the weeks theme from series 6 onwards the results show begins with a group performance from the remaining contestants however the song is prerecorded and the contestants mime due to problems with the number of microphones 55 the two acts polling the fewest votes are revealed both these acts perform again in a final showdown and the judges vote on which of the two to send home in the first four series the bottom two contestants reprised their earlier song but from series 5 they were able to pick new songs in series 3 a twist occurred where the act with the fewest votes was automatically eliminated and the two with the next fewest votes performed in the final showdown as normal ties became possible with the introduction of a fourth judge in series 4 in the event of a tie the result goes to deadlock and the act who came last in the public vote is sent home the actual number of votes cast for each act is not revealed nor even the order according to a spokesman we would never reveal the voting figures during the competition as it could give contestants an unfair advantage and spoil the competition for viewers 56once the number of contestants has been reduced to four series 1 3 7 8 and 9 or five series 2 4 5 and 6 the act which polled the fewest votes is automatically eliminated from the competition the judges do not have a vote their only role is to comment on the performances two occasions in series 7 and series 10 during the semifinal saw the judges instead vote to send one of the bottom two through to the semifinal in series 1 the eliminated acts also reprised one of their songs in the results show after being voted off this has become less common in other series instead being relegated to results shows with no final showdown in series 10 the flash vote was introduced where one contestant is revealed with the least flash votes on saturdays live show and the contestant with the second lowest votes from the remaining public vote is announced on sundays results show and therefore participates in the final showdown with the other contestant despite the flash vote eliminating all possibilities of deadlock it quickly drew criticism from viewers and was quickly dropped after several weeks however another variation of the flash vote has debuted in series 11 twice as part of a double elimination in this variation the act who polled the least votes on saturdays show is automatically eliminated the two acts with the next fewest votes on sunday then perform in the final showdown this double elimination variation was used once again in series 12 a lifeline vote was introduced within the first half of the series 13 live shows where the bottom three contestants are announced viewers are then given a few minutes to vote to save one of the bottom three with the winner of the lifeline vote avoiding the final showdown as of series 14 the contestants are split into two halves competing on saturday and sunday night respectively therefore each week is a double elimination as the results are announced the contestant who had the lowest viewer votes on each night is announced and leaves the show immediately the winning contestant is announced thereafter the two winning contestants of both saturday and sunday night then compete in a singoff to win their weekly prize once they have performed their singoff songs the lines then reopen and the public votes on which contestant to win the weekly prize after the x factor joe mc elderry winner of series 6 performing on the x factor live tour in 2010the winner of the x factor is awarded a £1 million recording contract with syco music in association with sony music in series 5 this deal consisted of a £150000 cash advance with the balance covering the costs of recording and marketing 7 other highly placed contestants may also be offered recording deals but this is not guaranteed 7 in series 1–3 the premise of the x factor was that the winner would be managed in the industry by their mentor on the show with cowell osbourne and walsh as judgesmentors any of the three would be qualified to do so following the appointment of singer minogue as a judge in series 4 the same principle could not universally apply in fact when minogue won series 4 with leon jackson a new outside manager was appointed the x factor live tour is a live show that tours the uk and ireland in the months following the conclusion of the series it features an array of finalists and other memorable contestants
