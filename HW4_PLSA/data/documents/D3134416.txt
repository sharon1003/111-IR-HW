from the got milk campaign to get people to drink more milk to the not milk campaign decrying the benefits of milk claims surrounding milk consumption are constantly debated milk producers advocate the benefits of calcium vitamin d and other nutrients while detractors mention possible links to cancer or other diseases humans place themselves in the odd position of being the only animals that consume milk after weaning milk is a familiar oneofakind beverage consumed by humans and other animals but humans place themselves in the odd position of being the only animals that consume milk after weaning moreover humans do not drink human milk but drink the milk of other species and do so commonly throughout their adult lives new alternatives to milk such as calciumenriched juices soymilk and rice milks have stormed the markets in asian markets powdered calcium is a popular commodity often spooned into a pot of rice or soup milk and other dairy products are large parts of many diets around the world but are they smart choices in our daily lives to answer this we need an increased awareness of this familiar yet everchanging substance the calcium content of milk a large part of the ongoing milk advertisement campaign seeks to persuade people to drink milk for its calcium content indeed calcium comprises a crucial aspect of human health not only is calcium needed for muscle contraction but calcium lends to our bone structure bone recovery recalcification and bone health as well human locomotion is made possible by rigid skeletons formed from calcium salts in the ground substance of bone less calcium therefore leads to weakened bones resulting in the serious condition known as osteoporosis inappropriate levels of calcium can also lead to kidney stones seizures and body spasms in addition neurotransmitters specifically rely on calcium ions to continue to relay chemicals to areas of the body that need them lastly calcium is an important factor in the blood coagulation cascade in short without calcium humans could not survive the recommended daily allowance of calcium is approximately 8001000 mg although 1200 mg is ideal according to the most recent update by the u s food and drug administration fda the fda also notes that the majority of americans consume only 500700 mg per day which is not enough this leads to the debate about milk milk contains calcium magnesium zinc proteins fat sugars and vitamins a and d what some call the perfect package however the fda reminds consumers not to capitalize on one source of nutrition it recommends a variety of foods the best choices being grains and vegetable sources according to a list proposed by the not milk campaign milk contains less calcium per given amount than other foods raw turnip greens or cooked turnips watercress and seeds such as sunflower or sesame all contain larger amounts of calcium compared to milk compare the 234 mg of calcium in a 100gram portion of almonds to the surprisingly low value of 3335 g of calcium per 100gram portion in a typical milk sample 2 milk fat from the store about 35 of one serving of milk typically 240 m l is calcium which is a significant portion of the serving but relatively calciumpoor when compared to most other sources of calcium especially green leafy vegetables and grains milk still has more calcium per glass than some calciumenriched juices yet the calcium benefit of milk is still debated lactose intolerance unfortunately milk and milk products cause an estimated 50 of the adult populations uncomfortable bloating gas cramping and diarrhea lactose intolerance can result from two things either through a natural enzyme deficiency which prevents the body from digesting milk sugars or through an allergy to milk itself the amount of lactase the intestinal enzyme responsible for the digestion of lactose the sugar found in milk typically declines naturally after weaning unless the body is genetically predisposed to produce more lactase after this decline the disaccharide lactose cannot be broken down continued avoidance of lactose can send a signal to the intestinal brush border that lactase is no longer needed for activity and decline can go further into completion than if the intestines were fed milk more often but again the natural tendency for the majority of world adult populations is the gradual lessening of enzyme activity one solution to the discomfort of lactose intolerance can be the consumption of dairy products predigested by lactase another simple solution is to take milk and dairy items out of the diet extensive cookbooks such as the milkfree diet cookbook cooking for the lactose intolerant are available for the lactoseintolerant other animal milks such as the sweeter goats milk contain lower levels of lactose making them easier to digest
