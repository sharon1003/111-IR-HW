of their average income at 88500 usd in 2004 a physicist with an average annual 2004 salary of 87450 usd is the twentyfifth highest earning professional of the 25 highest paid professions on the 2004 survey additional input one of the jobs that is generally considered to be one of the highest paying jobs is an actuary that is someone who works in the insurance industry who computes rates according to probabilities based on statistical records and various other factors one thing to keep in mind about actuaries is that when you see the median salary for an actuary this salary given is not accurate since you are not really an actuary until you obtain your associateship or fellowship in the professional society you are studying for if you are an actuarial analyst you are an actuarial student in training to become a certified actuary the median salary of certified actuaries associates or fellows in the society of actuaries etc would easily be among the top ten lists above it would be similar to including the salaries of medical residents 3455k per year into the salary of physicians were they to do this the median salary for physicians would be much lower in addition actuaries often get promoted to executive positions for the companies they work for which further elevates their salaries corporate attorneys at the nations top law firms have starting salaries of 180000 per year this would be a 25yearold directly out of law school by their 7th year they are making 320000 if they are elected to a partnership at the end of their 7th or 8th year they will make a respectable amount of money a partner a top firm is well worth 2000000 a year actuary once a fellowship has been obtained and after 10 years of experience someone in this field can earn 150000 and after 20 years one can earn 250000 it also depends on what type of actuary you are some consultants earn more than traditional actuaries see the related links below to see actual salaries for actuary positions currently available one high paying job that never makes a list due to the extremely competitive and relatively secretive nature of wall street is sales  trading  investment banking a starting salary out of collegeuniversity for is 75000 for the top investment banks with an annual bonus of 4000060000 by the time of your first promotion around 3 years you can earn 250000 top industry players make 1000000 per year ceo coo vps of companies the average ceos salary is 600k and an average coo makes about 300k and a vp makes over 200k according to the u s bureau of labour statistics as cited by forbes magazine the top five highest paying jobs are 1 physicians and surgeons 2 dentists 3 chief executives 4 airline pilots 5 podiatrists note that these are salaried jobs bonuses for some industries eg for wall street traders and profits in others eg entrepreneurs who start their own businesses can be much higher and dont forget movies music and sport i found that an actuary has a pretty high paying job for a starting salary less then 1 yr exp would be approx 40 20 yrs exp approx 250350k the president makes 400000 dollars a year however you must also consider the following they never pay a mortgage or rent never buy gasoline never buy food never pay for a car car insurance entertainment and a whole host of perks add all the free perks and youre talking a couple million bucksdefinitely actuaries an individual who belongs to the worlds highest paid profession can earn between 250000 to 500000 base salary within ten years of starting provided they pass all 8 exams swiftly to become an fsa in addition there are stock options and bonuses that could reach 100  300 of base salary entrepreneurs are deservedly the highest earners in the us people like bill gates or michael dell whose companies have become household names top the forbes list repeatedly while it is true that actuaries are well paid there are many other professions with equally impressive salaries many medical professionals earn large salaries though they also put in a decade or more of training after high school for instance experienced anaesthesiologists cardiologists and surgeons may make 500kyr or more in larger cities however the biggest salaries are usually the chief executive officers ceos or chief operating officers coos of large businesses they routinely achieve salaries that range into the multimillions annually not including incentives most people only dream of entrepreneurs who set out on their own can achieve large salaries as well though most of them probably fall under the category of ceo for their own company one more interesting fact while the president and members of congress do make impressive salaries 200k400kyr more than half of them took a pay cut to take a political office this is due to the fact that most of them held high positions within industry before they took office politicians are generally in it for the power not the money i would have to respectively disagree i say an anaesthesiologist i think professional sports players make much more money than the other professions listed here actors can make over 20 million per film thats maybe a couple of months of work for that much money its quite impressive quite frankly i do believe that surgeons have the highest paying jobs in the us cardiovascular surgeons can rack up to 500000 dollars per year as median pay david beckham gets 500000 per week you cannot give one example like bill gates and say ceo is the highestpaying job same goes for athletes and actors there are millions of actors in the us only a few dozen get paid in the millions there are thousands of ceos in the world only a few get paid in the millions or billions same goes for athletes however there are millions of doctors in the us and each one of them gets paid at least 100 k a year and most of them probably around 200 to 250 k on average medical doctors are the highest paid on a basis of consistency i think the highest paying job in the u s a leaving out an individual who is extremely wealthy for their special talent ie movie stars sports greats bill gates etc i would have to say the highest paying job in the u s a would be a c e o of a major corporation they make millions have stock options worth millions and retirement packages worth millions anesthesiologists welcome to the real world not everyone can be movie stars athletes or bill gates among regular professions the most lucrative in my opinion are ceo or other executive position surgeon some specialized sales such as of condo developments some stock brokers such as those who receive 10 commission and manage several hundred million or more some coordinators such as of celebrity weddings or rock band toursinterventionists cardiologists make between 60012 million a year in most places 850k is average car sales  real estate sales managers are routinely well into six figures sales person has six figure potential but most that stay in are 40k sales mgrs at competitive dealerships are 200kyear  some up to 500k real estate  in big cities you have bigger more expensive homes commission is usually around 3 million dollar home  30k commission not bad for selling a house again average yearly is probably closer to 4050 though playing third base for the yankees pays pretty well 25m a year some of the people here did state some very important facts however i am a real estate developer and investor from opening my company and doing 8 developments and property management i was able to net 683 million dollars for myself along with paying all my employees 100k a ups 747 captain with 10 years seniority makes 198 an hour working 20 hours a week pilots only get paid when the airplane is closed up with passengers on board and the brake is released no pay for time on ground between flights preflights drives to hotels time on the ground etc so 198 may look like a lot per hour but if you look at an average pilot who is gone from home an average of 75 hours per week and do the math you will find the highest paid pilots make about 50 to 60 bucks an hour a starting pilot after a 100000 dollar education and proper licenses makes about 1000 per month to start and about 8 bucks an hour based on time away from home check out the website airlinepilotcentralcom if you would like all the details and add three zeros to the hourly rate to get the annual rate basically in the past few years pilots have taken a 50 pay cut and are working at least a 45 day week away from home gone are the gravely days you might be surprised to know your pilot of small jets and prop planes make about 18000 a year to start military pilots and cargo pilots generally get paid more than commercial carrier pilots now i think actuary is the highest paying job of all my wife is a salaried dentist in california and makes 232k and gets 300k after bonuses we have seen oral surgeon specialty dentists job offers for 5000k per day mostly doing implants i agree with the averages because there are 300000 physician and dentists that make good money and few ceos that make crazy money i have an mba from a top 20 school and am the cfo of a midsize company and make 160k after bonuses people are obviously unaware of the salaries and wages in the car business a typical california business office manager for a medium to larger sized car dealership earns in the neighborhood of 100000 to 150000 per year 5000 to 7500 an hour this is for someone typically female there are relatively few male business office managers at car dealerships with no college training but 1015 years of business office experience the general manager of a new car dealership again usually very streetsmart but no formal education beyond high school can easily earn in excess of 300000 a year with salary and bonuses new car sales managers can easily earn 150000 to 200000 a year some earn even more in very highvolume dealerships the car selling business is something of a wonderland due to the outrageous salaries paid to relatively uneducated individuals the manager of the parts department at most new car dealerships earns substantially over 150000 per year between base salary and bonuses i am a pharmacist and i made 52hr working 7 days on and 7 days off on the night shift at a chain drugstore if i wanted to work more hours the week i was off i was more than welcome some pharmacists averaged 60 hours per week this can be accomplished right out of pharmacy school so they are 23 or 24 years old that is just retail chain pharmacy my wife works for a pharmaceutical company and with bonus gets just over 100k that is not including paid holidays unlimited sick days she spends most of her day searching the net works 95 and no weekends and gets 100k for it there is a lot of money in drugs most of the numbers mentioned above are pretty low by wall street standards i made over 1 million during my fourth year as a trader at investment bank goldman sachs gs paid out 16 billion in bonuses last year  most of the money went to roughly 6000 bankers and traders  which averaged out to be over 2 million per professional but even bankers and traders at gs envy the kind of money top hedge fund and private equity fund managers make at least fifty hedges made over 100 million last year two former colleagues from goldman who started their own funds each made over 25 million in a good year lower on the totem pole most moderately successful investment bankers and institutional traders made over 1 million last year from what ive seen the hours wall street bankers traders hedge fund managers analysts etc are not what most people would be willing to live with ive been in software sales for many years and this year ive made over 300000 and its only may 23rd im home most every night i travel out of town on average 12 nights a month and home every weekend the previous poster is correct if all you care about is making a lot of money but if you want balance in your life sales in any number of fields not just software can be very lucrative i think it is obvious that these numbers are either entry level andor in poor job markets all of these professions within 25yrs make a lot more in new york and california which by the way make up a large avg of salaries nationally in these listed professions successful oral surgeons who remove wisdom teeth and place dental implants make between 14 and 17 million dollars per year while working a 30 hour week with minimal hospital or weekend call heir apparent to the throne of england but i think
