convento mechanics lien alcalde book c5 sccr it was a one and one half story wooden saltbox with an outside stairway leading upstairs filoteo is said to have been sent to santa cruz by archbishop alemany then petitioning the u s government for the return of mission lands in california to the church it would not do for them to appear as abandoned parishes torchiana 1933378 starting in 1854 fr juan b comelias or comellas also administered the sacraments at santa cruz until 1856 when fr capdevilla replaced him a map of the lands claimed at mission santa cruz was prepared by g black in 1854 for the churchs claim showing the new rectory the old church and its rear extension and an adobe granary near the southwest corner of the quadrangle adobe walls formed enclosures to the west about the cemetery to the east and about the orchard to the north again the quadrangle walls are shown as 2375 feet from east to west and about 240250 feet north to south ruined adobe walls are indicated by dotted lines both inside and outside of the convento the convento or priests residence was probably maintained in better repair than the other rooms until the site was mostly abandoned two other maps of this era by bache for the u s coastal survey in 1853 and 1854 show the west and north portions of the quadrangle in ruins an adobe building on the 1854 black map is shown at the southwest comer of the square probably a granary is also visible in the 1856 miller sketch of the mission miller 1856 bl the cemetery the mission cemetery lay to the east of the old mission adobe church and was irregularly shaped it extended east from the front southeast comer of the church to a point where it angled to the north east at a point about 150 feet east a wall angled west to the church almost parallel with the front or southern cemetery wall comparing the 1854 black survey with a plot map of fallons land east of the cemetery surveyed by t w wright in 1851 it appears that the northern portion of the west line of fallons lot corresponds to the southern portion of the eastern cemetery wall fallons rear or northern boundary line appears as an extension of the eastwest cemetery wall the black survey shows a line possibly a wall shot to the northeast corner of the eastern wing of the quadrangle judging from the topography it would appear that this area north and rear of the cemetery lie down the hillside northeast of the church this area may have been used as a burial ground when the older original part was full in any case burials were discovered in the area northeast of the church in 1950 when the area was graded and they are shown in photographs of the 1920s era this observation is born out by newspaper references santa cruz sentinel september 2 1885 santa cruz daily surf september 16 1889 discrepancies exist between the fallon survey of 1851 the black survey of 1854 and the surveyor generals survey by john wallace in 1858 concerning the length of the old adobe cemetery wall running from the survey post south to a point at right angles to the front of the church scaling from the fallon map it was 150 feet long from black 125 feet long and from wallace 132 feet long the latter puts the rear line at 1386 feet at a scale of 20 chainsinch most importantly the wallace deputy u s surveyor general map of 1858 shows the old adobe church in relation to the new wood church of 1858 discussed below at this point in time very little of the old church other than the facade itself had fallen or been cleared away it appears it is important to note that the facade of the new wood church of 1858 was shown with the facade absolutely aligned with that of the old adobe church also a vestige of the adobe bell tower and front buttress was shown still in place on the southeast side of the adobe church facade eventually a new brick church was proposed for the site of the old mission church because the new church was to be substantially wider than the mission church about 25 feet it was necessary to excavate the graveyard west of the church an announcement was published in the daily surf july 23 1885 the old cemetery will be leveled to the grade of the rest of the ground and those who desire will remove the remains of friends buried there others will remain under the new church which however will cover only a portion of the ground devoted to the cemetery the new wooden church of 1858during the tenure of fr benito de capdevilla in 1857 the front portion of the mission church collapsed following a very wet winter an unprecedented frost and the ft tejon earthquake and its aftershocks the church was not demolished but almost immediately work began on a new church to the west of the wooden rectory located just west of the old adobe church it was built by waters and beck with the help of mr stevens plastering and mr lampee painting at this time it had a central belfry but lacked the twin towers erected later it measured 110 feet long by 36 feet wide and 27 feet in height pacific sentinel may 23 1857 in 1861 the old mission adobe church was remodeled at the instance of bishop amat for use as a girls school at a cost of 2000 the roof was shingled and raised the ruins cleared away at the front and the facade weather boarded pacific sentinel october 17 1861 the shingles are said to have been provided by waddel and bowles santa cruz sentinel october 31 1919 the end product of these activities was a building 180 feet long by 42 feet wide by 37 feet in height capable of accommodating 200 pupils since the length of this total wing approximated 250 feet in length it is possible that some 70 feet of the church portion was removed at this time if the 180 foot figure represents the entire building this school and orphanage were to be run by the sisters of charity coming from the east in 1861 fr capdevilla died and fr casanova came from monterey in 1862 to serve as pastor for the community the sisters of charity apparently preferred the premises of the old eagle hotel on emmet street to the former church building and purchased it in 1862 the old adobe church building was offered for rent in 1863 the sentinel august 24 1863 its eventual use is not known with any real certainty although accounts in the libro de cuenta or account book of the parish show the name of the renters and the amounts paid in the 1860s and 1870s libro de cuenta sbma bancroft recalled it as having been used as a stable apparently in the 1870s or early 1880s bancroft 1888208 in 1864 fr casanova spent 1900 to repair and complete the new wooden church of 1858 t beck constructed the twin bell towers which were in place when all known historical photographs were taken of the building santa cruz sentinel october 29 1864 it is not clear precisely when the old rectory of 1853 was moved to the rear of the lot between the new church and the old adobe one however the move may have been part of this effort photographs published in 1866 but taken when the towers were being constructed show the rectory situated well at the rear but forward of the end of adobe mission building lawrence and houseworth 1866 lc when fr adam took over as pastor in 1868 he refurbished the wooden church repairing and enhancing it several times in the 1870s he added a side chapel in 1870 dedicated to the blessed virgin de groote ms 1959 he introduced gas lighting to the church and was responsible for a new church pulpit and altar he brought the large crucifix from spain built the new entry stairs and may have been responsible for a new square two story rectory constructed at the rear of the lot on the site between the new church and the old adobe building this rectory sat somewhat farther back on the lot than the relocated saltbox of 1853 and its construction may have caused some mission building fabric to be destroyed because it sat close to or upon the quadrangle walls san francisco call supplement january 3 1884 it is not clear if the destruction was to the adobe church extension or to the remains of quadrangle walls or both however according to the cited newspaper the old mission stood until 1856 sic when a portion fell during mass sic since which time another large portion of the old building deemed insecure has been torn down the date is not specified but it is clear that between the photographs or the mid 1860s and the one with fr mc namee taken in the 1880s the rear of the adobe building was truncated the front or church nave portion had already been shortened considerably probably in 1861 as the mission orchard map of 1876 shows the front of the mission church no longer in line with the wooden church of 1858 the boys school in 1870 fr adam started a catholic school for boys in a new building constructed by j morrow and plastered by tom tierney at a cost of 985 he brought bro peter nolan o s f from the college of mission santa ines to teach santa cruz sentinel october 22 1870 december 3 1870 the one room school house measured 45 feet long by 25 feet wide and 15 feet at the gable end with a cloak room at the rear and gas lighting there were 20 double desks with room for 12 more the new school was built to the west and next to the wood church of 1858 its relationship to the other buildings is clearly seen in the map of mission orchard lots by thomas w wright prepared in 1876 lots in the old mission orchard were sold off for home sites apparently fr adam experienced difficulties running the boys school and closed it ca 1878 otto november 26 1939 he did not give up easily however and contacted the christian bros regarding its operation before he left the parish in 1883 in his farewell address he mentioned many but hardly all of his many accomplishments at holy cross including his prolonged

according to the article cited above father mc namee has placed the bones in the church and intends to put them in the new church under a stone floor apparently some people were upset by the destruction of the historic mission church but were reassured by newspaper articles insisting that it was not the church merely the sacristy and music and vestry rooms behind the church daily surf july 31 1885 the fact that the chancel was intact as it was located at the extreme rear of the church and described with its niches intact by a san francisco newspaper was not mentioned locally san

that the dead were interred on the slope of the hill back of the church another said that bodies were buried as many as three deep in the mission cemetery suggesting the possibility that more may remain beneath the church sacramento union october 1 1885 in 1888 the sanborn company mapped mission hill their map suggests that when the new square rectory was built the old one may have been used as an addition to the west side 1888 sanborn map ucsc the sanborn map of 1888 and historical photographs taken as late as the 1920s suggest that adobe and rock walls continued to exist at the rear of the church for some time these walls may have been remnants of the cemetery walls or the foundation stem walls of the rear extension off the rear of the old mission church about 60 feet was wall was supposed to have been photographed in 1907 patten 1974endpaper other early photographs taken from the northwest show adobe and stone walls that appear to be remains of the original quadrangle and

church ladies served libations for a fee in the small school house adjoining the old church these remarks in the daily surf of september 25 1891 indicate that the school house remained standing if not used for school purposes at the time apparently the public was thirsty for news about the original mission buildings the san francisco morning call of september 26 1891 informed them that a portion of the old church wall still stands directly behind the new buildings which has been built partly on the site of the old church and a portion of the old buryingground it appears from comparing the black map of 1854 referred to earlier and the wallace survey of 1858 with the mission orchard map of 1876 that this wall was actually a portion of the old adobe extension behind the church to the north it seems to have been a part of the eastern wall other structures that have come and gone the new boys school fr mc namee was determined to establish a catholic parochial school for boys to rival the

have moved a wing of the old rectory and attached it to the side of the school the 1905 sanborn map shows a wing missing and photographs of the school depict it looking like two gabled buildings put

of holy cross parish property on mission hill it is important to consider the potential early american period remains as well as those of the mission era it has become evident from the aerial photographs available of the site that the entire rear portion of the mission quadrangle approximately 40 was graded away ca 1950 however much of the convento or south wing and at least a portion of the monjerio in the west wing the mission church and cemetery may remain beneath the surface the mission church bell tower site may be able to be located with some certainty also the jail and the site of the mission cross in the cemetery may be able to be located and identified it may be possible to confirm the location of the wall fr real erected dividing the quadrangle in 1840 and something in the way of subsurface foundation may remain of the cross erected in the cemetery in 1831 all of the above await potential confirmation through archaeological testing bibliography© copyright edna e
