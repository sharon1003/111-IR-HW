definitions ionic bonding the formation of an ionic bond is the result of the transfer of one or more electrons from a metal onto a nonmetal covalent bonding bonding between nonmetals consists of two electrons shared between two atoms in covalent bonding the two electrons shared by the atoms are attracted to the nucleus of both atoms neither atom completely loses or gains electrons as in ionic bonding there are two types of covalent bonding1 nonpolar bonding with an equal sharing of electrons between identical non metals exception carbonhydrogen2 polar bonding with an unequal sharing of electrons between two different nonmetals the number of shared electrons depends on the number of electrons needed to complete the octet comparison of ionic polar and nonpolar bonding whereas nonpolar bonding involves the equal sharing of electrons between identical nonmetal atoms polar bonding is the unequal sharing of electrons between two different non metal atoms a proper understanding of polar bonding is gained by viewing the types of bonding on a continuum as in the diagram on the top left ionic bonding is on one extreme with a complete transfer of electrons forming charged ions nonpolar covalent bonding with equal sharing of electrons is at the other extreme somewhere in the middle but favoring the covalent side is polar bonding with unequal sharing of electrons and partial but incomplete transfer of electrons comparison of lewis diagrams of ionic polar and nonpolar bonding the best way to show and represent the unequal sharing of electrons would be by comparison with na cl and hcl and h2 using lewis diagrams the captions below correspond to the graphic on the bottom left ionic complete transfer of electrons therefore na becomes positive lost e and cl becomes negative gained e polar unequal sharing chlorine has a greater tendency to keep its own electron and also draw away hydrogens electron it is not completely successful as a result only partial charges are established hydrogen becomes partially positive since it has lost control of its electron some of the time h  chlorine becomes partially negative since it gains hydrogens electron some of the time cl  in summary a polar bond results when different atoms share electrons one atom will attract the bonding electrons more strongly than the other atom and will acquire more than a half share of these electrons this leaves the other atom with less than a half share and makes the electron distribution unsymmetrical on a timeaverage basis the electrons spending more time with one atom and cause it to have a partial negative charge the other atom deficient in electrons acquires a partial positive charge nonpolar equal sharing neither atom can dominate the other therefore the electrons are shared equally between them
