welcome to star trek answers what would you like to knowin borg star trek online pocket books conjecture was the borg destroyed after endgame edit share probably not completely th hub was wrecked and the queens unicomplex was destroyed but it seems unlikely that the whole collective is gone the borg have adapted to countless other setbacks such as the loss of billions during the 8472 war and every attempt to hit the collective with a virus or pathogen no matter how lethal always seems to be contained to the point of infection the loss of a queen is suggested not to be a showstopper either based on how picard reacts to her presence in first contactand how a queen shows up on voyager after that one was killed every indication therefore is that the borg were not destroyed however they have been dealt a very serious blow to their ability to traverse the galaxy at the very least they are unable to travel to the alpha quadrant with the ease they exhibited beforein first contact we saw that when the queen died all the borg around her also died that mayve been the case at unimatrix01 but borg that were not around her mayve continued to function normally despite here death this is supported by the fact that the borg sphere that was pursuing voyager continued to function and attack voyager weakening its armor even after the queen had died star trek online shows the borg being back and almost as bad as ever but the federation has technology to combat them now although starfleet disbanded its borg task force they reestablished a new one when the borg started appearing in the gamma orionis sector block the queen was supposedly killed four times in the official star trek canon st first contact states that she was on the first cube to attempt to invade the federation and of course she was killed on the cube in that film too in voyager she was killed in endgame as well as the episode dark frontier although the unimatrix was destroyed and possibly her clones another drone was probably choosen to replace her or they just assimilated someone to become the queen again in a novel i believe the borg attempt to assimilate janeway to become the new queen but she either gets killed or just assimilated then again thats only one of the many star trek novels categories borg star trek online pocket books conjecture add category
