13 answers answers relevance rating newest oldest best answer on weekdays we have a rule 30 minutes of tv and 30 minutes of computer per day they can also use the whole hour on computer but not watch tv at all or vice versa on weekends theyre allowed an hour on each per day my kids are younger than 10 so by the time theyre that age they will probably get more time but why dont you try this rule with him he has to read or do homework for as long as he watches tv or plays on the computer for example 45 minutes of reading45 minutes of tv  · 6 years ago0 0 comment this is a common issue in families today ill give you the answer you want then the one you need children need to use the computer in order to garner the skills they need in the future also they cant avoid needing the computer for homework so first all kids need access to do their school work sometimes my children spend hours doing their work secondly if the computer use is just for fun then your family needs to sit down and determine a reasonable amount of time for emails chatting and surfing the whole family should decide which content is acceptable use an hour usaly covers this type of need i have my computer set to revert to the password screen after a set interval no for the answer you need its very important for familys to interact some time every day should be spent in a joint activity that does not involve the tv dont get me wrong there is nothing wrong with family movie night but most people do it too often lots of people dont even eat dinner together any more or they sit infront of the tv its really important tto try to sit down and eat dinner together talk about eachothers day and reinforce values by talking about eachothers interactions try offering to help your brother with his homework if you can turn undesirable chores into positive brother sister time i know its harder than it sounds but it can be done people respond to attention of any sort even negitive attention your parents can read this book callledd the casden method its a book about how to use positive and negitive reinforcement to help their children to have better behavior and habbits you want your brother to have a better aditude and watch less tv and do his hw then find out what motivates him and when he does what you want or comes close to what you want then you reward him its important to have good dialogue with him and to have a set of totally expected and layed out rewards and consequences like for example he might be responsible for doing a chore each day and his hw so you would put that on a chart there would be a set of rewards and a set of punishments that would occure if he did one or the other if he does not do the chore he is punished he does the chore then he is rewarded the rewards and punishments should be resonable and keeping your temper is the most important thing no matter how mad you are you have to keep your temper be level and state what is going to happen then do it the other most important thing is consistancy no suprises or breakdowns no matter how much he whines dont break down stick to yur guns the rules are the rules even if you feel bad or guilty about the punishment carry the punishment out all the way if he gets love and attention when he is behaving and you are calm and level when he is spazing then that will go along way even screamign is attention and some kids would rather have negitive attention then none at all that is the whole basis of why some kids act out i hope this helps family time is precious families need to be ight and trust one another trust has to be earned if you know hes doing what he isnt supposed to do then try to talk to him calmly try to persuade him with love and attention that what he is doing is wrong be his friend and his sister dont just run off and tell your folks if you can get him to trust that you really just care about him and youre not just trying to get him in trouble then he will come to respect you and even listen to you if you earn his trust now when he is just whiney and watching too much tv then he may come to you later for advice and you can maybe keep him from making huge life altering mistakes like drugs or crime big problems start with little ones dont try to controll him just love him and guide him all will be well then good luck source s16 yrs of being a parent and the oldest of

above if it were my house i would ban both all together for a period of time then after a month of so i would add it back in in very small amounts maybe an hour during the week and 23 on the weekends

affects your grades if you have bad grades i would say 1 to 2 hours until you get better grades if your grades gradually increase gradually increase the time you get on the computer for his behavior
