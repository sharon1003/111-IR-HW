it create a free account maybe later sort what are external structures of a prokaryotic cells flagella fimbriae and pilli describe the glycocalyx what is it made out of the glycocalyx is a gelatinous sticky substance that surrounds the outside of the cell it is an extracellular polymeric substance eps it is made out of polysaccharides polypeptides and both what is the function of the glycocalyx it plays a role in pathogenicity protects the cell from desiccation and gives it the ability to survive and cause disease through biofilms where does the glycocalyx get polypeptides and polysaccharides the polypeptides and polysaccharides are produced inside the cell and extruded to the cells surface do all bacteria have the same amount of glycocalyx no cells with less glycocalyx are considered roughhow are slime layers and capsules similar they are both amorphous structures with phospholipid layers assist with classification k or vi antigens are found there and have specific markers this leads to serotypeshow are slime layers and capsules different capsules tend to be more organized and firmly attached to the cells surface slime layers are loose and watersoluble why are slime layers advantageous slime layers allowed for bacteria to attach to biofilms what is a biofilm aggregates of bacteria living together on the surface of something else ultimately contributes to pathogenicity of an organism biofilms help contribute to different strands of bacteria additionally biofilms can act as wires allowing electrical signals to be sent through cells 99 of bacteria in nature exist in biofilms in what way are capsules advantageous capsules can be similar to chemicals found in the body therefore it is not recognized and destroyed by the immune system capsules may also be used for carbohydrate reserves what are some examples of capsules being advantageous streptococcus pneumonia and klebsiella pneumonia capsules help to avoid elimination in the upper respiratory tract how are capsules and slime layers a virulence mechanism slime layers and capsules cover the outside of the cell which allows them to slip away from phagocytes and block receptor sites that viruses would use without these glycocalicies bacteria would succumb easily to phagocytosis what is a flagella flagella are long structures that extend beyond the surface of the cell and its glycocalax that propels the cell through its environment do all bacteria have flagella no flagella are most commonly found in bacillus shaped bacteria how is the stabilization of flagella different in gram and gram  bacteria gram  the flagella is stabilized by two rings that anchor into the cell gram  the flagella is stabilized by 4 rings because it has a thin peptoglycan so it needs extra support what structures compose a flagella long hollow filament a hook composed of amino acids and the basal body what is the filament the filament is long and hollow it extends into the cells environment it is composed of a protein called flagellin it grows at the tip reactes to external wetness has no membrane how are the filament hook and basal body all connected the filament inserts into a curved structure called the hook hand the basal body anchors the filament how so flagella play a role in serotyping differences in proteins associated with bacterial flagella allow for classifications into strains called serovars serotypes what types of arrangements are flagella in atrichous no flagella monotrichouspolar single flagellum at one pole lophotrichous tuft of flagella at one pole amphitrichous flagella at both poles peritrichous flagella all over amphilophotrichous tufts of flagella at both ends what is a spirochete a spirochete is a spiral shaped bacteria it has flagella that spiral tightly around the cell between the cytoplasmic membrane and the outer membrane called endoflagella  they form an axial filament that allows the bacteria to be motal how do flagella function flagella rotate 360 degrees and the circumferential slip pulls them through the environment what powers rotation of flagella a proton motor force pmf is created by the flow of na or h ions across near the basal body or cell membrane how does movement work with respect to flagella bacteria move in a series of runs and twittles movement of a cell in one direction is a run and rotation of a cell is a twittle flagella rotate both clockwise and counter clockwise when multiple flagella are present alignment occurs and flagella rotate as a bundle this is all in response to a stimuli what dictates what way bacteria move receptors to light and chemicals send messages to flagella increased runs and fewer twittles occurs when moving toward a stimuli decreased runs and fewer twittles occurs when moving away from a stimuli what are different types of pili 1 conjugalsexualfertility used to transfer dna from one cell to another 2 somaticbodyfinbriae depending on the environment they can bind to surfaces colonozation factor agents cfa the more piliated and organism is the more pathogenic it iswhat are fimbriae fimbria are rod like protein extensions that are sticky and bristle like they help bacteria adhere to their environment they can also be used to avoid elimination by ingestion contrast fimbriae with flagella fimbriae are shorter than flagella and there are hundreds of fimbriae per cell they can help with motion through a twitching motion occasionally fimbriae will attach to the surface and pull a fimbriae in like a rope which helps the bacteria move what is conjugation in relation to pili conjugation is the act of sharing genetic information between cells how do eukaryotic cells use flagella in eukaryotes there it a microtubual 92 arrangement the filaments ride against each other which results in a whipping like motion what is the importance of biofilms they help bacteria adhere to the enviroment then other bacteria stick to it this creates a mycocasam where bacteria behave abnormally and produce endotoxins what are entropathogens pathogens located in the intentional tract what is spirochetosis this is where spirochetes adhere and cause illness there are different kinds including treptnemtosis borreliosis and leptospirosis how does a motility test medium work the test medium is stabbed the motal bacteria will avoid the stab making the medium cloudy where nonmotal bacteria will leave the medium clear what are fimbiral systems fibrial systems are adherence mechanisms and allow bacteria to adhere in certain areas what is enterotoxigenic e coli etec adhere to the gi tract and produce toxins will be designated with an o antigen and a number using serotypes what is enteropathogenic e coli epec adhere to the gi tract and causes ulcers will be designated with an o antigen and a number using serotypes what is enteroinvasive e coli eiec invade the blood steam will be designated with an o antigen and a number using serotypes advertisement upgrade to remove ads features quizlet live
