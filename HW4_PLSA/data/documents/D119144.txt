health conditions selfaudits are performed by employers in order to reduce injury and illness rates within the workplace and reveal any hazards by conducting selfaudits employers reduce costs that may incur from workers compensation and sick leave and reduce manhours lost so that productivity can remain high in order to complete a thorough selfaudit use regulatory checklists for each work area and osharequired record keeping although there is not a standard format for checklists several key features should be included name of auditor and date inspected description and cfr cite for all pertinent regulations with a space to not deficiencies a feasible completion date for material deficiencies initials andor date when all corrections have been completed the following are highlights of osha
