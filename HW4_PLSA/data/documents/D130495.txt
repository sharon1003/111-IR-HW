proud of but thats it – yo feb 29 16 at 759add a comment5 answersactive oldest votesup vote21down vote this varies between countries my impression is that listing titles after the name is more common in the uk and australia and there may be fixed conventions as to the ordering but i cant address that what i can deal with is the u s and my advice in that context is simple dont do it in the u s if you list one title john smith ph d youll look a little pompous and like you are overemphasizing your degree leading to questions like gee is that ph d still his proudest achievement or does he worry people will think he didnt get a ph d  and if you list more than one it will look ridiculous in particular dont list titles after your name in academic job applications cvs signatures for letters of recommendation etc that are being sent to the u s of course conventions in other countries may be differentshare improve this answeranswered may 3 12 at 131anonymous mathematician121k 15 327 50613this also varies between fields apparently in direct correlation with how often people wear ties or whether their students and assistants use their first names almost none of my colleagues in computer science in any country in academia or industry ever write their degrees after their names but medical researchers always append their highest degrees to their last names to distinguish the mere ph ds from the real doctors – jeff e may 3 12 at 9015thanks thats a good point medical schools community colleges and perhaps some other cases are environments where people may be legitimately worried about being perceived differently based on their degrees md vs ph d vs mdph d ph d vs ma or whatever is the key distinction in a given context so i should have been less absolute even in the us if youre in an environment where degrees vary and these differences matter then its reasonable to highlight it but if youre not conveying information your target audience will care about then degrees after the name should be avoided – anonymous mathematician may 3 12 at 12293as an australian ive always thought the practise of putting letters after your name was an american thing in australia hed usually be dr brian ballsunstanton on his business card and formal email signature with no letters afterwards and would introduce himself simply as brian or brian ballsunstanton in the us ive been told that it is more common to omit the dr and instead list ph d after the name i agree though that even then youd normally only list the highest degree and possibly fellowships – significance feb 29 16 at 504add a commentup vote13down vote even in countries like germany where titles get stacked up only your highest degree in a given field is listed however in your case you have two different degrees in very different areas so it might be helpful to list both the masters and the doctorate in your title however the bachelors is superseded by the masters so it doesnt appear in any case but beyond that i think its a function of context whichever degree is most important for you in the situation should be right after your name and then the other degree if its a itrelated issue then the msc is probably more important than the ph d the ph d matters for philosophyrelated stuffshare improve this answeranswered may 3 12 at 1549aeismail ♦140k 27 318 6281 for using only the title which is most applicable the collection of all your titles can be found in your cv – fgysin feb 29 16 at 1405add a commentup vote9down vote as far as i know once you pursue a ph d you are encouraged to put only that achievement right after your name since it is more relevant that everything else i maybe wrong but its what ive seen for yearsshare improve this answeranswered may 2 12 at 2324ivan machado692 5 151in my experience it would be more common to use the title dr in appropriate contexts rather than adding ph d the obvious exception would be a medical doctor with a ph d who can then use both – jessica b feb 27 16 at 819jessica b it depends for instance on a cv in the czech republic i would list both my master and my ph d for the name the same would appear on academics business cards door labels etc – yo feb 29 16 at 7581yo on a cv i would never put the letters  your degrees should show up in the education section putting them on business cards and door labels i would consider pretentious in many contexts see the answer by anonymous mathematician – jessica b feb 29 16 at 801jessica b thats why i said in the czech republic i now see i wrote something wrong i personally wouldnt put the degree on the cv but some people would and do as for business cards again in the academic world here the titles are inevitable and you commonly see prof mgr john doe ph d yes someone with a full professorship still uses their masters title – yo feb 29 16 at 804add a commentup vote0down vote it depends on local custom around here chile titles are rarely used at all in neighbouring countries it is extremely

701guest1welcome to stack exchange sorry to say that but your answer is really bad it does not quite address the question how to list all titles properly the answer is vague and missing details or reasoning and i dont speak about the fact that calling someone an idiot is not a way to communicate this got you the highly negative score being wrong or not accustomed to the sites format is acceptable being this much rude is not – yo feb 29 16 at 753add a comment your answer sign up or log in sign up using google sign up using facebook sign up using email and password post as a guest
