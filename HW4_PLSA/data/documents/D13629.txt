the average cost of a rear view camera system is from anywhere from 200300 and average installation for rear view camera systems will cost an extra 500 you can always save yourself those extra 500 by doing the installation yourself most rear view camera systems come with installation instructions it also matters whether your backup camera system is wireless or wired i personally installed a wireless backup camera systems in my toyota corolla i found that it was a lot easier because i did not have to deal with running to many wires through my car now if you have a wired rear view camera system you might want to get it installed by a professional because sometimes the wires already in your car might get in the way of your installation advertisements share this twitter facebook like be the first to like this
