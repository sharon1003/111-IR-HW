local time while the system uses utcbased time internally your applications will generally display the local time which is the date and time of day for your time zone therefore to ensure correct results you must be aware of whether a function expects to receive a utcbased time or a local time and whether the function returns a utcbased time or a local time the current timezone settings control how the system converts between utc and local time you can retrieve the current timezone settings by using the get time zone information function the function copies the result to a timezoneinformation structure and returns a value indicating whether local time is currently in standard time or daylight saving time dst you can set the timezone settings by using the set time zone information function to support boundaries for daylight saving time that change from year to year use the get time zone information for year get dynamic time zone information and set dynamic time zone information functions to retrieve the local time use the get local time function get local time converts the system time to a local time based on the current timezone settings and copies the result to a systemtime structure you can set the system time by using the set local time function set local time assumes you have specified a local time and converts to utc before setting the system time when you call set local time the system uses the current time zone information including the daylight saving time setting to perform the conversion note that the system uses the daylight saving time setting of the current time not the new time you are setting therefore to ensure the correct result call set local time a second time now that the first call has updated the daylight saving time setting to convert a utcbased time to a local time use the system time to tz specific local time function to convert a local time to a utcbased time use the tz specific local time to system time function
