house but alone in an empty apartment and begin to shake i’d lie there feeling like something was crawling under my skin and shaking i am an introvert and the months following my divorce have been the only time where being alone far from providing peace or solace felt unbearable i surrounded myself with people paced around and contemplated suicide this is how i first learned that the answer to your question is yes i could have easily so easily died from a broken heart i experienced something similar in that it confirms that my answer to this question is yes  yet very different  a few years later when i witnessed the death of my father i called the medical examiner watched the men from the funeral home wrap up his body and take it away and strode over to my room looking for the list i had made of people to notify on the way to my room i doubled over in pain i am not referring to a sudden onslaught of sorrow i am talking about physical pain a pressure that went from my chest to my back and up my neck i thought “i’m having a heart attack” i considered alerting someone but decided my family had enough going on besides at the time dying did not seem like such a terrible option i took an 81 milligram aspirin and faced that awful night and the days weeks that followed for months after i felt the same ongoing physical symptoms pain in my chest a suffocating pressure and an inability to take deep breaths i spoke to a doctor who suggested running cardiac and pulmonary function tests this is how i learned that broken heart syndrome actually exists according to the mayo clinic broken heart syndrome is a temporary heart condition thats often brought on by stressful situations such as the death of a loved one people with broken heart syndrome may have sudden chest pain or think theyre having a heart attack in broken heart syndrome theres a temporary disruption of your hearts normal pumping function while the remainder of the heart functions normally or with even more forceful contractions broken heart syndrome may be caused by the hearts reaction to a surge of stress hormones the condition may also be called takotsubo cardiomyopathy apical ballooning syndrome or stress cardiomyopathy by doctors the symptoms of broken heart syndrome are treatable and the condition usually reverses itself in about a week i have heard that grief recedes over time i dont think this is entirely true it shifts initial feelings of release related to my father no longer suffering have been replaced with the ungraspable notion that i will never see him again but then as it so

answered can you die from a broken heart most often we think of heartbreak as a certain sense of sadness and longing when a relationship ends that can only be stifled with pints of ben  jerrys and the constant reassurance from close friends that youre better off honey but new research has shown that heartbreak is a real occurrence especially after the loss of a loved one and it can literally kill you put down the ice cream and allow us to explain researchers from the beth israel deaconess medical center found that a persons risk of suffering from a heart attack increases by 21 times in the first 24 hours after losing a loved one over the course of five years the researchers interviewed 2000 patients who suffered from heart attacks including asking them questions regarding triggering events the results showed that the risk of heart attack is eight times higher than normal during the week after the death of a loved one though it slowly declines that risk remains elevated for at least one month previous studies have shown that ones health declines after the death of someone close but this is the first study to discover this broken heart syndrome researchers are associating the increased risk with the feelings of depression anxiety and anger that come with grief these feelings lead to an increased heart rate and blood pressure which makes blood more likely to clot and can ultimately cause the heart attack the emotional sense of the broken heart may actually lead to damage leading to heart attack and a physical broken heart of a sort explains senior author murray

time i had an illusion that i was only steps away from the frontier of knowledge and i had no desire to make money and to support a family i was surrounded by powerful goodlooking aunts and in hindsight my standards for women were a little bit unusual i did not believe her character was strong enough for the kind of life adventure i had in mind i calculated that she would be better off without me and i would have peace of mind without herif you think of knowledge as the one ring i basically sacrificed love for powernot an admirable thing to do after i dumped my girlfriend my life immediately went downhill i thought i could use some will power to tough it out however a month after that i got drunk and whimpered like a dog i took it as a moment of weakness induced by alcohol and did not make much of it after i sobered up thus i ignored the warning sign i put on a steely appearance and moved on as time went by i slowly turned into a walking dead before i knew it i passed the point of no return i thought it would take no time for her to find someone else to replace me because there were always men buzzing around hera major source of her pride and my anguishand she wasted no opportunity to brag about it as it turns out her life trajectory is just as erratic as mine and her life is pretty much ruined also now i am convinced that we were made for each other it is a pity that i did not believe this sort of thing back then lessons learned1 i thought there were things better than love actually there isnt nothing in the world supersedes love not your parents not your career definitely not your fucking country2 i thought love could submit to the command of will as it turns out love is like alcohol against whose influence an iron will is powerless using strong will against love often leads to such unintended consequences as a twisted personality3 do seek guidance in knowledge not in morality i was unduly judgemental and utilitarian while totally unaware that i actually knew nothing i was an engineering student and didnt pay much attention to this kind of thing until my life turned upside down in hindsight a little literature and psychology which teaches the hygiene of the mind would have gone a long way4 know the signs indicating that you are in love love is a mental state once you are in love youve pass the point of no return never break up when you are in love one symptom of love is the overwhelming desire to be together and time flies when you are together breaking up at this stage will create an internal conflict you can never resolve love sickness can come back and bite you decades later in the middle of nowhere and debilitate you another symptom is the feeling that no other woman in the world is nearly as good looking as yours it follows that you cannot cure your sickness by finding a substitute  yet another sign is you are oblivious to some of her bodily functions that would otherwise disgust you i was a notorious clean freak but i gladly ate anything she spit out and passionately kissed her face anywhere even when she had a runny nose i cannot image i can do this to any other women5 never judge a womans intelligence when she is in love because even the most intelligent woman would become extremely dumb in these situations6 if you are a naturally monogamous man ie you dont see divorce if your life in your wildest imagination do not get sexual with your woman until youve decided to marry her sex triggers a series of physiological transform in you as a consequence of which you lose interest in other women and you are physically bonded to her and if her other qualities turn out to be unbearable to you it will cause you enormous emotional distress to tear yourself away—often times it ruins your life because you are no longer able to form similar bonds with other women bernard schlink in his the reader described a very similar experience i admitted to myself that a woman had to move and feel a bit like hanna smell and taste a bit like her for things to be good between us there is a chinese saying 一日夫妻百日恩，百日夫妻似海深 one days husband and wife are a hundred days love a hundred dayss husband and wife are deep like the ocean one can infer that sexual bonding is common among the chinese populace the love story told in dostoyevskys white nights can be explained by sexual bonding romantic mystical language had obscured the true nature of this kind of thing7 when the bard says it is the star to every wandering bark he is not speaking sentimental mystic it is actually a piece of empirical wisdom life is about choices if you value love above everything else you will choose well and most of your decisions will be spontaneous if you think there are things better than love your life will be one of endless calculation you calculate and still miscalculate because there is no reference the constant star in your system it happens so often that those who aim at love end up wealthy healthy and happy those who let go of love and aim directly at wealth and power end up in poverty and misery  according to bertrand russell who surveyed contemporary studies in his marriage and morals natural fidelity is a survival trait of anthropoid apes and savages the intelligent and imaginative are rather adulterous i myself definitely belong to the former category sex does not necessarily mean intercourse sexual behaviour in humans is no longer instinctive sexual desires only create a restless state of mind which leads to myriads of erratic behaviour it follows that consummation is whatever

everything you can think of to win back your ex yet you keep pushing him further away genius albert einstein once said insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results sound familiar why do we do this to ourselves the key to get over broken heart and win back your ex is to do something entirely different than what you have been doing change the game by taking on a new relationship strategy that will set you up for success instead of failure a brilliant strategy is to use a tip from the study of human nature when a person is feeling immense pressure he or she will back away the last thing you want your ex to do is to push further away from you so step one for you in your new game plan is to use your exs human nature to your benefit and backoffo stop the constant emails or texts o stop the constant phone calls o stop driving by his house or place of work o stop trying to force him to feel sorry for you when you stop these behaviors a natural consequence will be that you begin to get over broken heart because you arent focusing every moment of your day on your ex and the bonus is that your ex will stop feeling pressured so what can you do

game plan that will bring you success if you only work it the amazing thing is that while you are working on yourself and not contacting your ex he will begin to wonder what happened to you you start to fill his mind for a change this is the beauty of your new plan you are no longer smothering your ex so he will begin to miss your attentionhell begin to miss you you really are becoming an einstein when you follow this plan to perfection by using your exs human nature to your advantage and taking care of yourself you set up a solid foundation for restoring your broken relationship with the pressure removed your ex will begin to recall exactly why he loved you in the beginning in essence its playing a little game of slightly hard to get follow this plan and you will not have to wait long

was temporary  my heart is not but so my love towards my passion healed those cracks quickly point is what about you i read these words somewhere so i am sharing with you“ broken heart that must sound like such a mean thing but when you have lived a little more maybe a decade more you will know i am telling the truth today love seems like to be the heart of life you will soon realize that human love mundane love people love – is all just a part of life it is only the divine that lasts forever rest everything is palpably ephemeral in this speck of the universe that we call earth and where we occupy a microscopic area in comparison we are not that important we can’t be be it love marriage or arrange after 2 years and 2 kids – it looks alike because after the love and the honeymoon life happens to most relationships so fret not if your relationship couldn’t stand the test of time is it not better actually because now you will know this is one bridge you won’t be trapped under had it accidentally fallen while you were on it the larger goal in any humanly privileged life should be to be able to help those in need and live as righteously as possible a consummated love story is just a tiny speck in the larger realm of your purpose it doesn’t matter in the long run whether your heart suffered or not what matters is were you able to pull it up or not i am not trying to undermine the pain of a broken heart mental pain is so much more unbearable than physical pain because there is no instant pain killer fix available for it but what i am trying to say is – these motivational thoughts might help you or someone you think is in dire need find a way to fix your heart because there is a lot to do in this world in order to be able to do justice to this human form but always remember – a heartbreak is an avenue for opening new doors keep those doors of your heart wide open let the light come in and do not for a second believe that love is worthless the love in your heart takes you places and makes you do such grand things everything you feel is a manifestation of love even your passion towards your dreams and goals”signing off with two lines from sir alfred lord tennyson“i hold it true whatever befalls i feel it when i sorrow most ‘this is better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all” as usual i end with saying “ life is short ”898 views ·

the inquiry could be paraphrased as “in the case colloquially described as ‘she died of a broken heart’ can someone literally have died because their heart physiologically failed or was damaged”i am not a doctor but i am sure that in both the above cases stress and unhappiness over an extended period can compromise the physical health of one’s heart as well as other systems in the body no doubt genetic inheritance and personality differences will play a large part in individual cases the metaphorical ‘broken heart’ scenarios that i am imagining are effectively challenges to one’s self esteem ‘why did heshe reject me what did i do wrong’ loss of selfesteem or selfcriticism  which is the same thing on a psychological level  is highly stressful and in extreme cases may kill someone through secondary physiological effects a slightly different but related point i believe a number of small children abandoned by their families and put into state run nurseries  as was the case in some
