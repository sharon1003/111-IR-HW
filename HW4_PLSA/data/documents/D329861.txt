august 5 2014 updated 852014price keeping carbon fiber from mass adoption comments email print by bill bregar0sustainability bmw ag automotive bmw ag bmw ag developed its own inhouse production for carbon fiber for its i3 and i8 electric cars atlanta — today carbon fibers in automotive are still expensive and exotic known mainly for use race cars but the composites industry continues to seek the holy grail of carbon fiber parts in massmarket cars — and they’re getting closer carbon fiber reinforced parts are light strong and loadbearing structural parts cutting weight from cars is important as automakers push to hit corporate average fuel economy standards of more than 545 mpg by 2025 they’re looking at lightweight steels aluminum — which made big news this year as the body material for the next ford f150 pickup truck — and carbon fiber the problem boils down to high cost and slow processing times according to industry officials at jec americas a composites trade show held in midmay in atlanta according to a sampling of people at the trade show carbon fiber for automotive costs 10 to 12 a pound compared to less than a buck for steel that’s more than half the 35 price a decade ago but to see more widespread adoption it needs to get down to about 5 or 6 a pound they said even so automakers are taking notice faced with unrelenting fueleconomy standards much of the activity is happening in europe bmw ag’s new electric car the i3 uses carbon fiber for its body panels and frame — marking the most extensive use of carbon fiber in a “volume production” car so far the lamborghini urus made waves for extensive use of carbon fibers and the alfa romeo 4c sports car uses a onepiece monocoque chassis made of carbon fiber composites will we see major carbon fiber parts on massmarket car say a chevy malibu any time soon not likely but detroit is moving ahead as well the redesigned 2014 corvette has a standard carbon fiber hood and roof the dodge viper began using a carbon fiber hood roof and trunk lid in 2012 these are not mainstream cars but if every automaker had a highvolume car using the advanced materials the current carbon fiber industry could not make enough material experts said at jec americas“the big question they’re asking is can the composites industry develop the infrastructure and capacity” said sanjay mazumdar ceo of market research and consulting firm lucintel who worked at gm on lightweighting projects automotive composites should grow at about 6 percent a year through 2018 he said in a presentation at the atlanta conference glassfiber reinforced composites account for 92 percent of total plastics composites in cars today natural fibers are 76 percent carbon fiber a miniscule 06 percent carbon fiber has a good future mazumdar said since a car’s structural components are about 30 percent of the total vehicle by weight likely applications for carbon fiber are the chassis hood and trunk lid“but the cost of carbon fiber is eight times that of steel” he said to ensure future supply automakers and some major suppliers are forging appliances with glassfiber manufacturers bmw created a joint venture with germanybased sgl group for a carbon fiber plant in moses lake wash in may bmw and sgl announced they are investing 200 million to triple production at the factory to 9000 tons of fiber by early 2015 that would make moses lake the world’s largest carbon fiber plant the companies claim ford motor co is collaborating with dow chemical co on a research project on faster ways to bring carbon fiber to market gm formed a partnership with teijin ltd of japan to develop carbon composites for highvolume cars teijin has opened up a technical center in detroit other deals show the jockeying for position in a carbonfiber future toray industries inc took a minority stake in plasan carbon composites inc which makes the carbon fiber parts for the viper and other cars toray also bought zoltek cos inc a st louis carbon fiber producer for 584 million in a deal that closed earlier this year magna exteriors now makes carbon fiber smc at its plant in grabill ind the grabill plant is set to be sold to fellow composites maker continental structural plastics which is also moving into carbon fiber“there’s a lot going on around the supply chain” said claire michel communications manager at composites house cytec’s research and development center in derbyshire england “everybody is trying to secure their supply base because there is not enough carbon fiber one way of securing it is through acquisitions partnerships and strong alliances”cytec does not have any exclusive agreements in automotive she said cytec has expanded its carbon fiber plant in piedmont s c which makes polyacrylonitrilbased pan carbon fibers sold mainly for commercial and military aerospace cars and trucks are a much bigger pie“automotive wants the solution you’ve got to come to them with a finished product” said russ pancio business development manager for sigmatex ltd which displayed its woven carbon fiber mats at jec americas the mats are later turned into prepregs pancio who works out of the u kbased company’s u s office in benicia calif said the carbon fiber industry will need to get bigger to meet future demand from mainstream vehicles “the plants have to be able to handle it” he said push for lower costs automobili lambourghini sp a the lamborghini urus concept was designed for carbon fiber production carbon fiber is made by an energyintensive process of carbonization industry thinktanks have been trying to find cheaper alternatives to panbased fibers in europe a governmentindustry partnership launched last fall called news pec  is working to use polyethylene as a precursor at jec americas two officials of automobili lamborghini sp a explained the effort the italian luxury car builder has a long history of automotive composites starting with a prototype composite monocoque in 1983 said luciano de oto chief of the advanced composites division looking forward lamborghini will almost completely replace prepreg methods with its own advanced technologies such as forged composites thermoplastic composites and nanocomposites he said lamborghini is actively involved in news pec a consortium of 13 partner companies from seven countries in the european union carbon fiber is the lightest material available for cars even lighter than aluminum but the expense is holding it back said marco de luca project manager of the car maker’s advanced composite research center he also heads aerodynamics for race car programs“highstrength steel will reach maturity in 15 years’ time aluminum is growing but carbon fiber has lots of growth potential” de luca said in speech at jec america’s invitationonly automotive circle event on may 14 the goal of news pec is to reduce dependence on petroleumbased plastics the group says pe precursors can be derived from biopolymers from ethanol synthetic oilbased polymers and recycled plastics pebased carbon fiber can reduce the price by 30 percent compared to pan de luca said that includes lower energy needed to produce the fiber he said the goal is to set up a pilot plant in germany the consortium is looking at automotive parts such as structural components body panels interiors and brake rotors and pads other target areas are aerospace wind turbines and pipelines and pressure vessels for oil and gas in 2016 lamborghini hopes to build a monocoque chassis from pebased fibers followed a year later by body panels they will undergo testing in the united states oak ridge national laboratory has led development of reducing costs of carbon fibers ornl makes carbon fibers at a carbon fiber technology facility in oak ridge tenn ornl continues to study lignin derived from wood said cliff eberle technology development manager for the carbon and composites group lignin can vary widely depending on the species of tree the climate and the season so researchers are looking for lignin with specific molecular structures“we are still working to generate structural properties as far as we know no one has been able to make a competent structural fiber from lignin” eberle said ornl also has looked at variations of pan they also have studied polyolefins working with dow eberle said oak ridge officials consider carbon fiber to be an important national security issue and lightweight cars are a central part “our biggest target is widespread application in mainstream vehicles making a significant dent in our petroleum” consumption he said“the reason we work on carbon fibers is to change the nation’s energy equations” he said new technology cuts cycle time relatively slow manufacturing is the other part of the roadblock for carbon fiber — as well as for traditional glassfiber reinforced composites to get into highvolume automotive composites has to move past a crafttype of handwork to moreautomated mass production industry officials say mazumdar the lucintel market researcher said cycle times for composite part production are now approaching one two minutes it used to be an hour or more“they’re making good progress” he said plasan based in bennington vt has developed a rapidcuring molding process that is much faster than a traditional autoclave working with globe machine co of tacoma wash on the chevy spark electric car the battery enclosure is made of glassfiber reinforced vinyl ester prepreg made with a computerized layup pattern automatic die cutting and laser alignment of patterns the enclosure was developed by continental structural plastics inc in troy mich cytec industries inc of woodland park n j and battery maker a123 systems inc of livonia mich after three years of development with general motors the spark battery enclosure won the society of plastics engineers automotive division award for the electrical systems category last fall at the jec americas show glade gunther of cytec said general motors changed the material to go with a woven glassreinforced prepreg for the enclosure an important component since the lithiumion battery pack is near the rear bumper on the small car in a crash zone the part also had to meet fireresistance tests drop testing watersubmersion and vibrationshock testing“it was a very urgent tight timeline type of an application they had originally designed it to be used as a magnesium part they had all sorts of issues trying to make this complex geometry out of magnesium” said gunther business development specialist for industrial materials in cytec’s plant in tulsa okla the compression molded part is 40 percent lighter that a metal enclosure cytec said cytec and continental structural plastics dramatically reduced cycle time cytec developed a rapidcure vinyl ester resin system mtm 23 for compression molding the battery enclosures that material allows continental structural plastics to mold the parts in less 10 minutes at a 150° fahrenheit cure but cytec said mtm 23 could be rapidcured in less than three minutes the process uses automation to make the enclosures including a computerized layup pattern
