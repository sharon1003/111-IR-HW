irvine camarch 26 2007chow down at fogo de chao fogo de chao is a brazilian buffet with exquisite service the meal has two parts salad bar and a merry go round of meat the second part as seen in the other reviews is where fogo de chao excels serving 16 different typesvariations of meat it’s impossible not to find a meat you won’t like unless you’re vegetarian p  my favorite meats were the chicken leg parmesan beef filet mignon the plain version and the bacon wrapped version and the sausage they were all good though seeing as the meal is 50person the restaurant should and does go beyond just good food since the merry go round of meat relies on efficient walking around of waiters they come to your table with giant meat skewers and get you the meat in front of you that service and the normal waiting staff was beyond excellent they randomly pulled out my seat for me they refilled water almost instantly unlike most places and they replaced the side dishes quickly pilenta fried banana and mashed potatoes the fried banana is addicting and a nice change of flavor from meat all in all if you have the money to burn eat here dishes triedparmesan beef i doubt everyone would agree that this is a five star rating but i really enjoyed the quality beef with some parmesan cheese on top a little salty but it blended well the beef was also really soft and tenderfrango chicken legsamazing juicy and the best thing herefried banana mmmm sweet and softmashed potatoes another side dish silky soft you might feel guilty for eating more since you’re already powering down all types of fancy meats filet mignon the bacon wrapped version is especially juicy and soft probably not great for you but it tastes great the filet mignon itself is also goodspamiam new york nydecember 19 2006the best churrascaria i’ve tried several brazilian steakhouses and this is the best i’ve had so far more variety of meats and of better quality and taste as well it also has one of the best salad bars around ironic for a carnivore’s dream restaurant there was a vegetarian in our group and he didn’t mind being in a steakhouse because the salad bar was so good plus there is a discounted price if you just want to eat at the salad bar the preset price may seem high at first but if you think about it you’d spend just as much at any other higherendquality steakhouse further this is a buffet so you get more food for an even better deal go during lunch and it’s cheaper just don’t plan on being very productive the rest of the day dishes tried salad barone of the best salad barsfrango chickenchicken breasts wrapped in bacon mmm … baconbeef ancho my fave a rib eyejustin los angeles cajanuary 24 2007always a good meal even if you don’t want to totally stuff yourself a meal at fogo de chao is always a fine experience the service is amazing the decor is nice and food is great the salad bar is amazing and you can even just opt to eat that if you want or if you’re vegetarian but even the waiters will advise you not to eat too much salad the start once you eat a couple pieces of lettuce the fun starts and you turn your green disc up for the meat to start coming sometimes you’ll have to keep your hand near the disc because they come so fast you need time to eat all the meat on your platethe desserts and coffees are also really good if you have the stomach for it dishes tried dinner buffetso many tasty meats and great salad what else could you ask for it’s like your own little farm pork beef lamb and chickenfraldinha bottom sirloini like this cut it’s really tender and juicy filet mignon always a solid choice make sure you get it a little rare so its juicier…err bloodier frango chicken legsbacon around anything is good and this chicken is no exception it’s exceptionally juicy and tastycostela de porco pork ribswhile not totally fall off the bone soft they taste very good jdogg sunnyvale caaugust 9 2006meathow can you go wrong when waiters dressed as brazilian cowboys serve you a limitless supply and selection of freshly barbequed meat oh i guess the salad bar is pretty decent too the fried polenta is awesome but try not to fill up on that or else you won’t be able to eat all the meattulips500los angeles caaugust 28 2006great meal for carniesthe wide selection of meats is impressive and the brazilian cowboys serving them make for an even more impressive dining experience it’s a hefty 50pp so be prepared to eat your money’s worth and you won’t be disappointed i’ve been to a few other brazilian bbq restaurants nearby and fogo’s is definitely where i’ll be returning to when the craving for bloody goodness arisesfattiusthebear berkeley camarch 24 2007meat heaven this place isn’t for those who like to spend money on food each buffet is 50 which is not easy to make up for but it’s worth it for the experience and pure variety of food you get the restaurant is decorated very nicely with a salad bar in the middle it is a very extensive salad bar offering lots of different types of vegetables and good stuff while one might be able to eat a buffet on the salad alone that’s not what you are there for the meat here is generally very excellent and comes in unrelenting waves if you have your card flipped you get a card where if its on the green side servers will flood you for food while the red card tells them to stop but if one person has a green card chances are you are gonna get the meat there because it is way too tempting while the meats are great you also get fried banana polenta and mashed potatoes in the middle and you get a cheese bread thing which is super puffy and really good these dishes are a welcome change from the onslaught of meat it’s always cool to see the servers give you meat off a sword i thought the most memorable part though was the service i am not used to such good service where they constantly refill water give you new side dishes super fast and give you meat right when you want it it was ridiculous they are all also really nice and seem to have telekinetic links with each other if you have money to burn and want a new food experience i suggest that you go here dishes triedcheese bread this provides a nice beginning dish and a refreshing side from all the meatcostela de porco pork ribsthe ribs had good meat though some bites were a bit salty and the meat didn’t fall off the bone

steak form totally worth the  orgasm in allyoucaneat steak form totally worth the 25 for lunch or 50 for dinner if you do the anorexic thing for a day or two before venturing to the fogo definitely the best of any of the argentinianbrazilian steak buffets around… sal et carvao and texas  brazil do not even compare excellent cheesy bread and fried bananas and a buffet with maybe every kind of cheese and artichoke and antipasta ever invented there are really friendly waiters dressed in goofy gaucho pants catering to your every beefy desire and chicken and bacon and pork too they carry openpit roasted cows on swords it’s pretty much a merrygoround of steak excellencejinkwell los angeles cajanuary 30 2010meat is king come hungry really from the salad bar to the table everything is up for grabs in unlimited supply the salad bar has an amazing selection but my favorite is the asparagus they’re frickin huge and at the table fried bananas mashed potatoes and cheese breads are amazing especially when eaten with different cuts of meat alternate between crisp salad and tender meat and that’s quite a meal yeah…the price is pretty expensive but when you consider what you’re getting it’s not that bad especially if you’re hungry and eating platefulsandrewwu june 23 2007beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeefbeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeef barry rfrom judys book may 15 2013awesome
