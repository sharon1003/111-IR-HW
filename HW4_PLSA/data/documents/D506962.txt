package movements by agency table 23 provides information on the median movement of the total remuneration package trp at each classification by agency agency trp is used rather than base salary or total reward as it covers the two most significant elements of aps remuneration base salary and the employer superannuation contribution for a calculation to be made an agency must have employees substantively at a classification level in both 2012 and 2013 as a result the number of agencies for each classification will vary table 23 shows the agency trp median movement from 2012 to 2013 tended to be in the range of 2 and 4 this is lower than the 2011 to 2012 agency trp median movement which was in the ‘4 and less than 6’ range the reduction between the two year results is likely to be influenced by an increasing period of slowing employee mobility by slowing employee mobility a higher proportion of employees have reached the top of their pay range as a result fewer agency median movements are being affected by salary advancement within a salary span in addition to any general pay increase when employee mobility rates increase this trend is likely to be reversed table 23
