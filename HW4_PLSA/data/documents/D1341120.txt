a preview of the day ahead workers taking the most sick days michael b sauter samuel weigley and alexander e m hess247 wall st may 12 2013sick days are estimated to cost the u s economy 84 billion each year according to the latest data released in a joint study by gallup and healthways some professions miss substantially more time each month due to sickness than others doctors miss roughly one day every four months due to illness those working in the service industry on the other hand miss almost one day every two months these are the jobs in which workers take the most and least sick days it would make sense that americans miss work days because they are sick and to some extent that is true physicians who miss by far the least amount of work due to sickness are by far the healthiest however doctors appear to be an exception in fact some of the professions that rarely call in sick are among the least healthy more people working in the farming forestry and fishing industry have health problems preventing them from doing things appropriate for their age group than any other occupation according to the study despite their poor health they miss an average of just one day every four months the second least among the 14 job categories measured meanwhile nurses clerical workers and service workers report average or above average health but miss the most days from work due to illness more from 247 wall st companies that owe employees a raise unreliable salary also makes it less likely that workers will take time off many professions that miss relatively more days such as nurses and office workers are often salaried positions with allotted sick days workers in installation and repair jobs who miss relatively little time are much more likely to be paid per service roles

of responsibility to their patients making it very difficult for them to miss work physicians also tend to be in better health than any other profession less than 68 of doctors are considered above average weight or have a chronic health condition by far the lowest percentage among the professions surveyed this is likely in part because doctors have according to galluphealthways the best health
