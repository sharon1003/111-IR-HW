black and ivory white tricoat there are numerous stripes and optional wheels as well safety gizmos the 2015 dodge challenger is loaded with safety systems with new features including chrysler’s own lanechange and rear cross path alerts adaptive cruise control lane departure warnings and a forward collision warning system standard and optional features include assist call mirrormounted buttons for emergency services roadside assistance customer service and noncollision emergencies adaptive cruise controlplus can bring the vehicle to a full stop without driver intervention under certain conditions normally it provides a distancebased cruise control using forward sensors allrow fulllength sidecurtain air bags extend protection to all outboard front and rearseat passengers each side air bag has its own impact sensor that autonomously triggers the air bag on the side where an impact occurs antilock brakes detect rough roads by the oscillations in the wheel speed signals when rough roads or offroad driving is detected abs holds the brake pressure for longer pulses autodimming driver’s side and rearview mirrors automatic headlamps and automatic highbeam headlamps blindspot monitoring bsm uses dual radar sensors to notify the driver of vehicle s in their blind spot via lights on the sideview mirror andor a chime in an emergency brake situation the system applies maximum braking power based on research that in many accidents at least one driver didn’t hit the brakes with full force the brakethrottle override cuts enginepower output until the vehicle stops or the driver lifts their foot from the brakes to prevent runaways the brakelock differential system allows forward motion if one or two wheels lose traction by selectively and aggressively applying brakes to the spinning wheels brake tractioncontrol system keeps driving wheels from spinning during acceleration by applying individual brakes to the slipping wheel s electronic brakeforce distribution regulates braking pressure fronttorear electronic locking fuel filler doors prevent theft or tampering electronic stability control with roll prevention enhanced accident response system ears makes it easier for emergency personnel to see and reach occupants in the event of an accident by turning on the interior lighting and unlocking doors after air bag deployment it also shuts off flow of fuel to the engine forward collision warningplus uses radar and video sensors to detect whether the challenger is approaching another vehicle or large obstacle in its path too rapidly and warns or helps the driver to avoid the incident video sensors are new to the system front seatbelt adaptiveactive load limiters optimize chest loading in an impact event while impact sensors cause front seatbelt pretensioners to remove slack in an accident hillstart assist hsa keeps the brakes on briefly after the driver’s foot is moved from the pedal to easily allow “non rollback” on hills lane departure warningplus leverages electronic power steering eps to deliver a torqueinput to alert and assist the driver with corrective action led taillamps activate instantly and grab attention more readily than traditional bulbs rear park assist systems use ultrasonic sensors at low speeds in reverse to detect stationary objects rain brake support occasionally pushes the brake pads lightly against brake rotors in rainy conditions to keep rotors dry rainsensing wipers reactive head restraints deploy in the event of a rear collision minimizing the gap between the head restraint and the passenger’s head ready alert braking moves the brake pads closer to the rotors to allow faster braking when a collision is imminent rear cross path rcp detection warns drivers backing out of parking spaces when traffic is moving towards their vehicle tiltandtelescoping steering column by year demon • 2017 ta • gt awd201517 challenger • 201517 challenger srt197074 • 200810 • 201114 • 201114 srt •specialty
