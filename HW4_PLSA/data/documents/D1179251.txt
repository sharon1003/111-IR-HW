serial discussion why are we so quick to believe adnan syed is innocent by vivian kane  tv  november 10 2014  comments  76after the fourth episode of serial dustin posted a poll on this site to see which direction we were all leaning in our feelings toward adnan syed those who thought he was innocent were in the majority at 41 the no ideaers were close behind at 40 and only 17 of you thought he was guilty room for error there i suppose now adnan has a lot to see in his favor but there is evidence working against him at the same time koenig herself goes back and forth on believing adnan’s innocence multiple times within each episode but right from the beginning despite the holes in his story and jay’s testimony not that many of us put much stock in anything jay has to say we were on adnan’s side why is that i think we are quick to believe adnan simply because the question of his guilt was put forth just by the mere existence of a podcast about this case we assume it will end with koenig proving he was wronged we are used to this kind of story the slowly unfolding murder mystery with a surprise ending in the form of movies and books and tv so it’s tempting to listen to serial in the same way we watch a good movie we’re looking for clues predicting twists suspicious of red herrings this works against adnan as much as it works for him our image of how a wrongly convicted man should behave comes from carefully crafted characters so when adnan doesn’t follow the script we’re used to it’s suspicious why did he never call hae after she disappeared why isn’t trying more actively to prove his innocence to koenig why can’t he explain the nisha call we as viewers or listeners are used to having these questions put forth and then answered cleverly by our designated narrator whether that narrator is an omniscient being a desperate defendant the plucky detective— whoever it is it’s usually someone with more insight or more experience than we have but sarah koenig is admittedly out of her element with this story and that’s what makes serial so different and so exciting but it can also be really hard to wrap our minds around the fact that we may not get our answers that adnan’s behavior might not be full of clues and red herrings maybe he was just high school kid who smoked a lot of pot and had other girls he was interested in and didn’t have the benefit of i cal to remember what he’d done on a random day six weeks earlier that’s much less satisfying than an evil teenage genius this week’s episode was a burst of fresh perspective that for the first time allowed me to feel justified in my belief of adnan’s innocence suddenly it wasn’t just our svu ified brains that made us feel we know where this story would lead now there are actual professionals agreeing as a unified force that maybe they can’t say for sure that he’s innocent but there’s definitely not enough evidence to find him guilty the innocence project’s deirdre enright who in the movie version is played by cherry jones or i am boycotting is the anchor of pragmatism that for many of us endorses what we’ve been thinking all along but is simultaneously able to bring us down out of the shayamalan twistobsessed clouds one of the most satisfying moments from this week’s episode was when koenig was once again vacillating on her opinion of adnan musing that he may very well be a sociopath playing her perfectly to win her support enright immediately brings us back to reality reminding us that in real life a sociopath would be a dream case but more likely he’s just a normal guy we want adnan to be an innocent angel or an evil mastermind— he’s richard kimble or keyser sose and our movieloving brains don’t know how to recognize anything in between the addition of dierdre enright super badass helps keep us grounded what do you all think do you think he’s innocent just because that’s the path we’re used to seeing in movies did you think he was guilty before but the innocence project turned you around does anyone actually still think he is guilty get entertainment celebrity and politics updates via facebook or twitter buy pajiba merch at the pajiba store← felicitys amy jo johnson the original pink power ranger resurfaced wearing her old power ranger outfit  get ready the funniest crudest btches on television are on their way back →
