as well as nine big ten contests here is a full analysis of the rutgers schedule followed by a game by game listing steve pikiell returns 3 starters from a team that doubled its wins from two seasons ago rutgers mbb 201718 conference schedule ⬇️ pictwittercomvvkdhg ieup— rutgers on btn rutgers on btn august 16 2017potential to start strong the first six games of the season are against division iii ccny and five di teams that had an average ken pom ranking of 280 last season it is by far the softest part of the schedule and rutgers must take advantage hopefully the newcomers can get their feet wet and the team can build some chemistry ahead of what will be a challenging three game stretch versus florida state in the accbig ten challenge starting 60 like they did last year should absolutely be the goal big ten december games a look at a few differences in the b1gmbball conference schedule this season pictwittercomaryx ekpull— big ten network big ten network august 16 2017with the conference tournament taking place at madison square garden this season the event was moved up one week in order to avoid a scheduling conflict with the big east that means every conference member will play two big ten games between december 1st and 5th rutgers was given a tough two game slate as they play at minnesota before returning home to play michigan state two days later both teams will be picked to finish in the top four of the conference with the spartans a popular choice to win the league nonconference schedule must produce double digit wins there is no reason why rutgers shouldn’t reach at least ten wins in the nonconference portion of the schedule it’s a very similar slate from pikiell’s debut season but this time rutgers never leaves the rac before new year’s day with the one exception being the big ten contest at minnesota in early december i’m disappointed that there wasn’t one road game scheduled in nonconference play newcomers like geo baker souf mensah and myles johnson will be thrown into the deep end of the pool in conference play on the road which could be a detriment once rutgers is traveling for big ten games in terms of the two most challenging games in the noncon slate they come against teams that played in the ncaa tournament last season however florida state is a winnable game as they are replacing four starters this season seton hall has a chance to be ranked very high for their middecember visit to the rac overall the noncon schedule is extremely favorable which actually puts pressure on the scarlet knights to at least match last season’s 112 start anything less would mean that they failed to avoid a bad loss in nonconference play toughest stretch rutgers will ring in the 2018 new year with a brutal stretch that includes road games at the two favorites to win the big ten purdue and michigan state with wisconsin visiting the rac in between all three contests take place within one week with rutgers starting conference play in december on the road against minnesota and hosting michigan state that has to be the most difficult five game start of any big ten team this season best chance for conference winning streak rutgers will have a great chance to finish strong much like they did last year in wins over illinois in the regular season finale followed by beating ohio state in the opening round of the big ten tournament this season rutgers plays their last two games against those very same teams first on the road against the buckeyes followed by illinois at the rac for senior night for a second consecutive year rutgers could potentially head into the big ten tournament at the garden on a winning streak and have a chance to make some noise in new york city overall assessment the bottom line is that with one of the easiest nonconference schedules in the country and having six games against projected back end big ten teams ohio state illinois and nebraska all of whom rutgers beat last season this program has a legitimate chance to surpass their win total of 15 from a year ago while ryan dunleavy of nj advance media made a valid point that the soft nonconference schedule would hurt the team’s chances of making the nit i’m more worried about forward progress this season in my opinion certain steps need to be made first before worrying about a postseason berth while i disagree with not having a couple more challenging nonconference games mixed in i do understand the reason why steve pikiell scheduled the way he did with a strong veteran core of deshawn freeman corey sanders and mike williams leading this team rutgers has a real opportunity to produce the program’s first winning season since 2006 in only year two of pikiell in charge rutgers also has a good chance of finishing better than last place for the first time since they joined the big ten in the 20142015 season it won’t be easy for a program that hasn’t won more than three regular season games in conference play yet but i believe they can do it if they can accomplish both of those achievements two key steps in the rebuilding of this program will be accomplished and pikiell will have even more positive selling points to use on the recruiting trail after reeling in some exciting and highly rated 2018 recruits better days are most certainly ahead for rutgers basketball hopefully we will have
