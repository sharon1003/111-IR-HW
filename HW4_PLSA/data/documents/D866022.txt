the next solar midnight the day twilights civil nautical and astronomical and night are indicated by the color bands from yellow to gray humidity we base the humidity comfort level on the dew point as it determines whether perspiration will evaporate from the skin thereby cooling the body lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid unlike temperature which typically varies significantly between night and day dew point tends to change more slowly so while the temperature may drop at night a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night the chance that a given day will be muggy in siem reap is rapidly increasing during march rising from 79 to 91 over the course of the month for reference on june 26 the muggiest day of the year there are muggy conditions 100 of the

10 meters above the ground the wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages the average hourly wind speed in siem reap is essentially constant during march remaining within 01 miles per hour of 50 miles per hour throughout for reference on august 6 the windiest day of the year the daily average wind speed is 68 miles per hour while on october 6 the calmest day of the year the daily average wind speed is 45 miles per hour average wind speed in march the average

peak proportion of 43 on march 31 wind direction in march the percentage of hours in which the mean wind direction is from each of the four cardinal wind directions north east south and west excluding hours in which the mean wind speed is less than 1 mph the lightly tinted areas at the boundaries are the percentage of hours spent in the implied intermediate directions northeast southeast southwest and northwest growing season definitions of the growing season vary throughout the world but for the purposes of this report we define it as the longest continuous period of nonfreezing temperatures ≥ 32°f in the year the calendar year in the northern hemisphere or from july 1 until june 30 in the southern hemisphere temperatures in siem reap are sufficiently warm year round that it is not entirely meaningful to discuss the growing season in these terms we nevertheless include the chart below as an illustration of the distribution of temperatures experienced throughout the year time spent in various temperature bands and the growing season in march the percentage of time spent in various temperature bands frigid  15°f  freezing  32°f  very cold  45°f  cold  55°f  cool  65°f  comfortable

predict plant and animal development and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature discarding any excess above a maximum temperature in this report we use a base of 50°f and a cap of 86°f the average accumulated growing degree days in siem reap are very rapidly increasing during march increasing by 970°f from 1723°f to 2693°f over the course of the month growing degree days in

typical weather in siem reap year round based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from january 1 1980 to december 31 2016 temperature and dew point there is only a single weather station siem reap international airport in our network suitable to be used as a proxy for the historical temperature and dew point records of siem reap at a distance of 8 kilometers from siem reap closer than our threshold of 150 kilometers this station is deemed sufficiently nearby to be relied upon as our primary source for temperature and dew point records the station records are corrected for the elevation difference between the station and siem reap according to the international standard atmosphere and by the relative change present in the merra2 satelliteera reanalysis between the two locations please note that the station records themselves may additionally have been backfilled using other nearby stations or the merra2 reanalysis other data all data relating to the suns position eg sunrise and sunset are computed using astronomical formulas from the book astronomical tables of the sun moon and planets by jean meeus all other weather data including cloud cover precipitation wind speed and direction and solar flux come from nasas merra2 modernera retrospective analysis this reanalysis combines a variety of widearea measurements in a stateoftheart global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50kilometer grid land use data comes from the global land cover share database published by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations elevation data comes from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm published by nasas jet propulsion laboratory names

particular cautious attention to our reliance on the merra2 modelbased reconstructions for a number of important data series while having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness these reconstructions 1 are based on computer models that may have modelbased errors 2 are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates and 3 have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas especially small islands we further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of
