history of orders of chivalry a survey see also guy saintys chivalric orders this page benefited from his comments although i remain responsible for the opinions expressed here contents introduction1 1100 to 1291 the militarymonastic orders the crusades provided the conditions for the emergence of a new institution combining elements of monasticism with elements of chivalry it was soon imitated in spain and in eastern europe2 1335 to 1470 the monarchical orders of chivalry in partial imitation of the monastic orders kings created institutions designed to reward and bind subjects to them also at the same time a wide variety of associations came into being which are classified here3 1560 to present honorific orders the emergence of centralized states made monarchical orders unnecessary and they turned into honorific orders rewarding past behavior or conferring distinction rather than encouraging future loyalty new honorific orders many without nobiliary requirement start multiplying from 1693 references introduction orders of chivalry are primarily a historical phenomenon peculiar to western european christendom of the middle ages it is in that context that they are most easily defined and understood an order of chivalry is a certain type of institution in the category of orders of chivalry a number of institutions have been placed over time one can distinguish several phases in the history of that type of institution the original form during the crusades deserved its name of order since it consisted of individuals bound together by a permanent religious rule of behavior after the crusades were over in the 14th c monarchs used the trappings of these orders to create a new institution to serve their purpose of binding vassals to their person after the renaissance the old monarchical orders and some monastic orders became purely honorific orders and other honorific orders were created once more using the trappings of orders of chivalry as a result we have today such disparate institutions as the order of malta the order of the holy sepulchre the garter the golden fleece one of the two at any rate bath calatrava all using the name order of chivalry or order of knighthood even though they are all very different organizations in history form and purpose1100 to 1350 the militarymonastic orders origins orders of chivalry first appear in the context of western europes military activities against nonchristian populations and states starting in the 11th century western europe went into an aggressive expansionary phase leading it into conflict with nonchristian populations on two fronts in spain and in the middle east these wars were engaged in for a variety of motives but they were at least in some respects religious wars the first orders of chivalry inherit this dual aspect religious and military the first orders of chivalry were associations of individuals committing themselves to certain goals and regulated activities the commitment typically took the form of vows and the regulation of activities took the form of a rule and an institutional structure defined by statutes and managed by officers thus orders of chivalry were religious orders in the same sense that purely religious or monastic orders were created at the same time carthusians cistercians franciscans dominicans etc the goals were both the sanctification of their members through their devotional and charitable activities as well as participation in the fight against the infidels either by protecting pilgrims or actively taking part in defensive or offensive military operations a lot has been written about the origins of this new institution as with heraldry it seems difficult for some to accept that western europe could invent anything on its own but as in the case of heraldry no convincing evidence has ever been adduced to show that orders of chivalry were an imported concept rather this institution must be seen in the context of the 11th century when monks and clerics were trying to establish a code of conduct for the new professional class of knights by turning them into soldiers of christ during the crusades where religious fervor was at its peak and military skills at a premium it was natural that these religious and military components fused into the militarymonastic orders the first orders of chivalry in the middle east  templars founded as a military order ca 1119 saintjohn ca 1080 militarized ca saint lazarus ca 1100 teutonic knights founded ca 1190 were all created by private initiatives as were the orders in the iberic peninsula  avis in 1143 alcantara in 1156 calatrava in 1158 santiago in 1164 created in imitation of the orders in the holy land they typically saw their statutes confirmed or recognized by the pope after a few years organization orders of chivalry like the church in general were recipients of many donations often in the form of land eg a lord would become a knight and give his possessions to his order quickly the orders became large landowners throughout western europe far from their center of activity as a result structures were created to manage these estates which had been entrusted to them these estates became known as commendatoriae cf the english verb to commend and their managers commendatores  only later was the word corrupted into commander which gives it a semblance of military rank which it never was as religious orders these institutions naturally fell under the authority of the pope who typically approved the statutes of the order and thereby gave it a form of official recognition in practice the orders managed their own affairs but in times of crises or uncertainty the pope could and often did intervene directly either by abolishing an order merging it with another order which usually came down to a transfer of assets to the other order reforming its statutes appointing a grandmaster etc the large degree of autonomy that the orders had enjoyed for long periods of time sometimes led them to resent such outside interference however only the order of saintjohn and the teutonic order ever gained enough independence and territorial sovereignty to be thought of as sovereign orders and in both cases this only happened after the 14th century it should be kept in mind that the militarymonastic orders were before all religious orders they owned land in various countries their membership was international and they managed their own affairs but so did the benedictines and the jesuits and no one ever calls them sovereign the military aspect of these monastic orders explains why they are called orders of chivalry fighting was a professional activities and professionals were called knights entrance into the socialprofessional category of knighthood entailed a number of religious rituals which made the idea of a monkknight only an extension of the general idea of knight the orders simply recruited individuals who had attained or could attain the status of knight this connection became even stronger as time passed and knighthood became romanticized even as it was losing its professional aspect i call these orders militarymonastic to emphasize their dual nature which sets them apart from any other organization of the time while it may appear difficult for modernday christians to understand how one could sanctify oneself by killing this notion did not seem shocking in a time which took the expression milites christi quite literally some orders however did separate the tasks and had fighting knights alongside praying chaplains eg the order of saintjohn  in fact these orders reflected in their structure chaplains knights sergeants the three orders of feudal society clergy nobility and third estate at this point then orders of chivalry are an association of individuals typically members of the knightly class committing themselves through solemn vows to obey the rules and statutes of a religious order and to engage as professional soldiers in a permanent religious war but also in religious and charitable activities as religious orders these associations usually need the approval of the pope and fall to some degree under his authority lesserknown orders in the middle east the iberic peninsula and eastern europe include the sword founded by guy of lusignan king of cyprus in 1192

change occurred in 1291 when acre the last crusader stronghold in palestine fell to the arabs the remaining orders of chivalry had to find a new raison dêtre since the holy land was lost with little hope of regaining it some orders managed the transition skillfully the teutonic knights who had already settled in eastern europe and absorbed the native order of the swordbrethren transferred all of their activities to eastern europe where they engaged in colonization of stillpagan areas in poland and the baltic and later in fighting against orthodox russia and even catholic poland the order of saintjohn conquered rhodes in the early 1300s and transformed itself into a naval power pursuing the fight against arabs and later turks remnants of other orders found refuge in rhodes under the protection of the order of saintjohn the templars which by virtue of their vast network of fundcollecting had become bankers of sorts resisted attempts at a merger with the order of saintjohn a project the pope and other rulers insisted on to better marshal resources for new crusades impatient with this resistance irritated at the disorder and lack of morality which prevailed in the order and probably mindful of the temples riches the king of france arrested the templars had them tried on trumpedup charges and coerced the pope into pronouncing the dissolution of their order 1312 the order of saintjohn became the recipient of the templars estates two offshoots of the templars survived in the form of new orders the order of christ in portugal 1318 and the order of montesa in spain 1319 since the 18th century many other groups have sprung up claiming a filiation with the templars1335 to 1470 the monarchical orders of chivalry a new generation of orders as the crusades became a thing of the past the last one floundering in 1271 they became romanticized just as chivalry itself the aura of orders of chivalry was being actively maintained by the exploits of the knights of saintjohn ruling their kingdom of rhodes and fighting the turks but most of all by the popularity of the arthurian novels international bestsellers of the time detailing the glorious deeds of the knights of the round table indeed the knights of saintjohn alone in their kingdom of cyprus and fighting the nearby infidels seemed to many to be the epitome of the arthurian myth the emergence of this myth that of a group of loyal knights devoted to a monarch did not take place in a vacuum of by accident the 13th and 14th centuries saw the end of feudalism and the emergence of what would become the nationstates of modern europe centered on increasingly powerful monarchs however the glue of the feudal system personal fealty to ones immediate superior in the hierarchy needed a substitute until such time as the concept of absolute monarchy became fully developed monarchs seized on the concept of orders of chivalry they thus created institutions which recycled some of the trappings of the original orders of chivalry but with the aim to create a closeknit and devoted circle of noblemen around the person of the sovereign these were the monarchical orders of chivalry these were not the only associations to be called either at the time or later orders of chivalry the second generation of orders of chivalry which might be collectively called lay orders of knighthood  included a wide variety of institutions and associations it should be noted that at the time lay devotional confraternities were quite common these were lay institutions which grouped members for devotional activities met regularly and had some form of statutes one might think of them as the medieval and religious equivalent of clubs also princes and lords made a common use in the 14th century of badges and liveries which they distributed to their servants but also to their followers the fact that some confraternities and some orders of knighthood also began using insignia and outer marks of membership results in a great deal of confusion darcy boulton 1987 has proposed a classification of these associations monarchical orders organizations loosely modeled on lay devotional confraternities but whose presidential office and the control of membership was attached to a crown or dominion and whose main purpose was to foster loyalty to the president garter golden fleece confraternal orders these are like the first kind but with an elective presidence and cooptive membership boulton further distinguishes two classes princely orders founded by princes most were created after the golden fleece in 1430 these are similar to the monarchical orders but the presidency was not hereditary order of saint george founded by charles i of hungary in 13256order of saint catherine

of the name order and of insignia only four are known compagnie of the black swan created by 3 princes and 11 knights in savoy in 1350corps et ordre du tiercelet a kind of falcon founded by the

1416 for 5 years converted into a confraternal order of sainthubert in 1422 votive orders these were a form of emprise or association formed for a specific purpose and for a definite term on the basis of a vow hence the term votive these were chivalric games without the mutual pledges which characterized fraternal orders only three are known on the basis of their statutes emprise de lescu vert à la dame blanche enterprise of the green shield with the white lady created in 1399 by jean le maingre dit boucicaut and 12 knights for 5 yearsemprise du fer de prisonnier enterprise of the prisoners iron undertaken by jean de bourbon and 16 knights for 2 years in 1415enterprise of the dragon undertaken by jean comte de foix for 1 year the cliental pseudoorders these were not really orders in that they had no statutes no limited membership etc they were a group bound by a simple oath of allegiance to a prince who bestowed a badge or insignia these were in fact glorified retinues misnamed orders which makes them often confused with princely orders ordre de la cosse de genêt order of the broompod founded by charles vi of france ca 1388order of the camail or porcupine created by louis dorléans in 1394order of the dove castile 1390order of the scale of castile ca 1430order of the thistle of scotland honorific pseudoorders these bodies of knights required no specific obligations and were usually just an honorific insignia bestowed with knighthood upon a festive occasion or a pilgrimage they consisted of nothing else than the badge knights of the holy sepulchre bestowed by the custodian of the holy sepulchre to knights who made the pilgrimage starting in the 15th century it was formally organized into an order of merit by the pope in 1868 knights of st catherine of mountsinai bestowed in similar conditions from the 12th to the 15th century order of the golden spur a papal order many times reformed knights of the bath in england the name was used again for an order of merit created in 1725 boultons classification allows us to concentrate on the most complex longlived and influential of these associations the monarchical orders of chivalry the first example is perhaps the order of saintgeorge founded in 1325 by charles i of hungary although its statutes did not define a hereditary presidency it was clearly intended to function as a monarchical order another is the order of the sash banda founded in castile by alfonso xi in 1330 alfonso xi in 1330 which probably lost its formal character in the 1360s and by 1416 was merely a device or insignia persisting until the 1470s the english king edward iii formed the order of the garter in 1344 the best known of its kind the french ordre de létoile order of the star soon followed in 1351 other monarchs or powerful lords followed suit here is a partial list of these orders saintgeorge hungary 132595 sash or band castile 13301474 garter england 1344presentstar france 135164 knot naples 135262

monarchical and princely orders is not very sharp in fact boultons classification has been criticized as too rigid and detailed in germany in particular there were dozens of noble associations in the middle ages which combined various characteristics which span boultons categories see kruse paravicini ranft 1991 ein systematisches verzeichnis frankfurt am main  p lang 1991 the main lesson to be drawn from such studies include in the 14th and 15th centuries a large variety of associations of noblemen andor knights appeared which were then or later called orders or orders of chivalry these associations span a whole gamut of arrangements from rigidly controlled institutions with detailed statutes to informal associations limited in time a number were created by or organized around kings or powerful feudal lords while others were private initiatives their objectives varied some were designed to honor recipients as well as bind them to an individual or authority others were formed for a specific purpose military or devotional limited or indefinite in time almost all used some kind of badge insignia or protector saint by which they were known this common feature has led to the common denomination of order of chivalry and the term order of chivalry has thereby become confused and imprecise the last ones appear in the1460s and a handful survive beyond the 1530s new wine in old bottles these institutions were quite different in nature from the militarymonastic orders yet they have been placed in the same category the confusion was of course voluntary so that some of the prestige and fighting spirit of the famous crusading orders might be acquired by these monarchical creations to this end various outward elements of the militarymonastic orders were adapted for example the structure of the institutions were imitated by copying nomenclature of members and officers members were knights the head of the order always the sovereign whereas the militarymonastic orders typically elected their head was the grandmaster insignia were developed to be worn by members on their cloaks or in the form of badges suspended from collars or attached to vestments this was a direct borrowing from the militarymonastic orders but the insignia were not based on the cross anymore but on an emblem garter golden fleece or the figure of a patron saint saint michael members met regularly in chapters where matters pertaining to the order were discussed the orders were placed under the protection of a tutelary saint in imitation of the devotion of the order of rhodes to saintjohn the baptist and regularly held religious offices the knights swore oaths of allegiance but to the sovereign rather than to the rule of the order which was never monastic in nature the sovereign usually controlled the membership at least to some degree occasionally a crusading spirit was explicitly invoked as was the case originally for the golden fleece whose emblem recalled the quest of the argonauts from chivalry to honorific as time went by many of these orders simply disappeared precisely because they had been too closely tied to their founder or because of political changes such as the absorption of the founders domains in a kingdom those orders that did survive in 1525 only four orders survived garter in england annunziata in savoy golden fleece in spain and saintmichel in france began to change in nature because they had outlived their purpose with the 16th century the monarchs transition from powerful head of the feudal pyramid to absolute ruler of a modern state was complete and the need for binding a restless nobility to the sovereigns person became less pressing in fact there are no creations of monarchical orders between 1469 and 1578 due also to the fact that by that time most countries had at least one such order in existence and a number of dominions had been united obviating the need for different orders however the prestige which still surrounded these monarchical orders made them useful for other purposes namely honoring individuals or rewarding good behavior as a sign of this changing functions some of the elements borrowed from militarymonastic orders were abandoned for example the order of the golden fleece held its last chapter in 1555 restriction of membership to the knightly class became meaningless as the knightly class itself had already evolved from a professional class to a hereditary caste on the continent interestingly this did not happen in england and membership in the knightly class by itself became a reward granted by the sovereign to individuals who had no military training starting in the 15th century for some of the old militarymonastic orders the transition was at times abrupt the spanish orders which had lost their primary purpose with the end of the reconquista in 1492 were quickly brought under royal control each time with papal assent santiago in 1476 alcantara in 1474 calatrava in 1489 avis in 1550 christ in 1551 montesa in 1587 some orders alcantara calatrava were relieved of their vow of chastity similarly the pope approved the merger of the order of saintlazarus with savoies order of saintmaurice in 1572 this merger was effected only in italy however and the remaining estates of the order in france were joined with the newly created order of notredame du montcarmel in 1608 the pope accepted the transfer of assets but never recognized the grand master of the new order as grand master of saint lazarus the french king never made himself grand master of the order but did keep a close eye on it making himself protector in 1757 and appointing the grand master himself thus when a militarymonastic order had estates over several countries the fate of various parts diverged the teutonic order was all at once secularized by the elector of brandenburg in 1525 who embracing lutheranism dispensed with papal assent in england henry viii simply confiscated the assets of the order of saintjohn without any pretence of perpetuating the order restored by mary in 1557 it was finally abolished in england in 1560 but in german lands the bailiwick of brandenburg of the order of saintjohn had already acquired a degree of autonomy and some of its priories decided of their own movement to follow the local movement and embrace protestantism the situation was settled by the treaty of augsburg in 1648 and the evangelical order of saintjohn or johanniter order emerged with hohenzollerns as grand masters retaining some of its religious nature it has subsisted to this day with an interlude from 1812 to 1852 the transition from monarchical order to honorific orders proved disastrous in some cases the order of saintmichel in france was quickly devalued by being handed out too generously and lost all prestige within 100 years of existence it was replaced in its role as premier french order by the saintesprit in 1578 with a numerus clausus of 100 this order was the first purely political order only its strict nobiliary requirements distinguished it from the next generation of orders its insignia broke with the tradition of monarchical orders and set a precedent by borrowing from the order of saintjohn now malta and using a maltese cross albeit with a dove to represent the holy ghost in the middle this use of the maltese cross would be much imitated saintlouis bath etc also the saintesprit used distinctively colored blue ribbons and sashes again in imitation of the order of malta and again repeated by many later honorific orders1560 to present honorific orders new orders soon multiplied throughout europe to serve the new purpose devolved on some of the old militarymonastic orders or the more recent monarchical orders in reality they were honorific orders designed either as a reward for past services to the sovereign or as a way to confer prestige and distinction and entailing no real commitment to any course of action or any loyalty to the sovereign beyond what was required of any ordinary subject in this fundamental respect they were different from earlier orders whose possibly honorific character derived from their history and activities but was not the raison dêtre in the case of orders without nobiliary requirements the distinction between an order and a decoration especially for 20th century creations becomes almost arbitrary some of the orders maintained nobiliary requirements and limited membership saintesprit in france black eagle in prussia saintandrew in russia passion in saxony san gennaro in sicily but many orders followed a pattern set by louis xiv when he created the order of saintlouis with a maltese cross and red ribbon and sashes he also imitated maltese nomenclature with three ranks grandcross commander and knight these ranks would be imitated by many later orders the order of saintlouis was awarded for military merit it had no nobiliary requirement no limited membership no chapter no mandatory activities etc although it was considered and called an order of chivalry at the time it was already a new breed of order many such orders were created in the 17th and 18th centuries and the following list can only be very partial an asterisk marks those who were knightly or more exactly nobiliary orders san stefano in tuscany 1561 saintesprit in france 1578 montcarmel in france 1607

retained more closely the trappings of the monarchical orders of old saintesprit san gennaro constantinian order but these differences remain small when monarchical orders themselves changed as feudalism gave way to absolutism santo stefano is rather unique in that it imposed substantial obligations on its members and engaged in naval activities against piracy in the mediterranean some of the more exclusive orders often claimed to be sometimes accurately merely revivals of older orders thus the dannebrog was allegedly founded in 1219 the polish eagle in 1325 the tower and sword in 1452 the thistle in 1451 the elephant in 1462 the seraphim in 1334 the bath in 1399 the constantinian order of saintgeorge claimed to have been founded by constantine in 312 see some interesting remarks by james algrant on the true origin of this order the aim was again to let some of the prestige of the older monarchical orders rub off on this new generation of honorific orders in other cases such as the piemontese order of saintmaurice and saintlazarus  transformed into a 5rank order in 1814 or the order of notredame du montcarmel and saintlazare in france or the old spanish orders remnants of militarymonastic orders were transformed into modernstyle honorific orders with or without nobiliary requirements usually their estates ceased to support any independent activity of the order and merely became added revenues for the kings treasury or a source of perks for recipients of the kings favors although the french order of saint lazarus briefly engaged in maritime activities similar to those of malta and s stefano it is also interesting to note the trend towards democratizing older orders by opening up their membership after the 1720s purely nobiliary orders have become very rare another trend is discernible that of naming orders after the sovereign the order of saintlouis was a transparent allusion to louis xiv disguised as a religious dedication but mariatheresa was the first to be explicit she was followed by charles iii and in the 19th century by many sovereigns queens in particular by now the religious connotations of the orders have completely disappeared and the name and profile of the sovereign replaces saints and religious emblems on the insignia the 19th century witnessed a lot of political turmoil and the development of new forms of government from military dictatures napoleon bonaparte to constitutional monarchies and democratic republics yet all governments felt the need to maintain or imitate honorific orders and the habit has spread to nonwestern countries and in the 20th century to communist countries as well it was rather ironic to see a regime such as that of the soviet union award something called the order of lenin where the link with the militarymonastic orders of 12th century jerusalem is tenuous at best yet these modern institutions are still called orders  the fate of the original militarymonastic orders what became of the original militarymonastic orders the order of saintjohn malta lost its territorial sovereignty in 1798 since then it has retained its statutes although massively expanding membership in recently created categories and is dedicated to medical and charitable activities as a subject of international law the order enjoys recognition from a number of countries and institutions the templars were abolished in 1312 the teutonic knights abandoned their status as order of chivalry in 1929 and became a simple religious order instead the order of saintlazarus split into two branches one obeying papal orders and merging with the savoyard order of saintmaurice in 1572 the other falling under the protection of the french crown in 1608 and merging with notredame du mont carmel it was abolished by louis xvi in july 1791 and not revived when the monarchy was restored in 1814 currently an organization claims to be the order of saintlazarus the savoyard order was an italian state order from 1860 to 1946 at which date it ceased to be conferred in italy the heir to the italian royal dynasty continues to confer it see that orders website the portuguese orders avis santiago christ were all secularized in 1789 and remained as national orders abolished at the fall of the monarchy in 1910 they were recreated as national orders in 1918 avis currently rewards military services christ rewards civilians and foreigners and santiago rewards accomplishments in arts and sciences the spanish orders santiago calatrava alcantara montesa secularized in the late 15th and 16th centuries briefly abolished in 187374 were abolished in spanish law in 1934 although this had no effect in canon church law their activities were unofficially revived in 1978 and king juan carlos i is their grand master a title first used by alfonso xiii in 1916 and perpetual administrator on behalf of the holy see they are thus dynastic orders of the royal house of spain but not spanish state
