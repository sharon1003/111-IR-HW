some shops charge you a dollar or two and some do it for free yet yall are talking about getting a new sim and porting numbers overpermalink embed – utakia  s 1 points 2 years agobecause if they do that then usually it wont come under warranty for phones and stuff i think thats why anywaypermalink embed parent – mankydingo 1 point 2 years ago unless you can show me a link then im calling bullshitpermalink embed parent – utakia  s 1 points 2 years agoidk in the link i have in the post the guy says that if companies do this then it breaches the warranty in case you do it wrong and it breaks something inside the phone because it was something done on purposepermalink embed parent – mankydingo 0 points 2 years ago yeah youre right its probably best to go with advice from someone with a geo cities style website after all he has just the same amount of reputation of anyone here including mepermalink embed parent – utakia  s 2 points 2 years agolol calm down buddy its not a big deal i dont really care cuz i got my sim to fit in my phonepermalink embed parent
