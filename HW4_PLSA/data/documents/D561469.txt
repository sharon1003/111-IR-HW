this is the guideline i go by to determine the xbrace location effect add that to the other parameters of your build to give an idea of what the tone tendency will be others may not agree with the below forward shifted â€“ 1â€ from edge of sound hole allows for more bass standard â€“ 1 â½â€ from sound hole edge even tempered rear shifted â€“ 1 â¾â€ from sound hole edge more focused treble and mid heavy can be driven harder ive been had again tim benware creedmoor nctop ken lewis post subject re when to forward shift the xbrace posted wed aug 13 2014 1111 pm contributing member joined sat

turned out very nice i liked it enough to use pretty much the same bracing layout for a 16 lower bout that i call a concert model i havent but would use it for other top woods i cant see a disadvantage but i am far from an expert on such matters i would be interested to hear what others say topsdsollod post subject re when to forward shift the xbrace posted thu aug 14 2014 116 am koa joined thu jan 10 2008 1008 am posts 1404 location raleigh nc first name steve last name sollod focus build status amateur i was thinking that maybe a 12 fret already moves the position of the bridge into the center of the lower bout and the forward shifted x might be too much a stiff spruce top could bennefit from the forward shift but maybe cedar or redwood could perhaps loose definition just thinking maybe too hard steve sollod  pronounced sorta like solidwwwswiftcreekguitarscom top greg bpost subject re when to forward shift the xbrace posted thu aug 14 2014 511 am koa joined mon jun 30

no i think thats pretty much it i do think it is more logical to think of forward shift in terms of the x position relative to the bridge rather than the sound hole relative to the soundhole is the traditional way to describe it but only works for traditional shapes it doesnt really define the structural relationships the way i see it the x arms crossing the upper corners of the bridge and exiting the sides is forward shifted x arms exiting across the lower corners of the bridge is standard and x arms crossing the back of the bridge is rear shifted top john arnold post subject re when

country usa focus repair status professional quote i was thinking that maybe a 12 fret already moves the position of the bridge into the center of the lower bout and the forward shifted x might be too much not true the bridge and the bracing move together the original martin 12fret designs were all forwardx afaik all 12fret martins made since then have been that way the original 12fret dreadnought designs and the older smaller bodies had 19fret fingerboards which means that the soundhole is further from the bridge in that case forwardx means the xcrossing is more than 1 from the soundhole as greg pointed out the important thing is the relationship between the bridge and the xbraces john top beth mayer post subject re when to forward shift the xbrace posted thu aug 14 2014 422 pm

going because i mistakenly place my x brace for 2475 scale length on a guitar which i meant to use 2534 this resulted in what you are describing as a forwardshifted x which should be fine except this sitka top is not very stiff and i had to make it a bit more thin than i might have because of some deeper scratches that had to be sanded out as i read this thread it looks like youre saying that a less stiff top would benefit from not being forward shifted though it isnt too much difference and would still likely be mostly forwardor at best standardâ€¦maybe i should just make this one a 2475 to compensate a little does anyone have much of a feel for how much of a tonal effect forward shifting might have on a less stiff top also i did beef up the height of the braces by about 12 mm at the x and transverse brace thanks beth top clay s post subject re when to forward shift the xbrace posted sat aug 16 2014 201 pm brazilian rosewood joined sun mar 30 2008 120 pm posts 2266hi beth if you follow the link ken posted you will notice that the diagram shows the tone bars below the bridge to be closer to perpendicular to the centerline this helps stiffen the soundboard some folks will add a tone bar directly below the bridge plate running parallel to the bridge if they feel the finished guitar top is too weak in that area this also helps keep the top from deforming and bridges from lifting top pat foster post subject re when to forward shift the xbrace posted sat aug 16 2014 250 pm contributing member joined sat may 17 2008 611 pm posts 1889 location spokane washington first

somewhat mythical since the upper bout is flattened on the 14fret bodies with the exception of the norman blake models on gibsons its not so clearcut this cobbled together image using grabs from the old martin web site shows it pretty well i think attachment9700714995b44d67b28b612b906d843fjpeg pat you do not have the required permissions to view the files attached to this post formerly known
