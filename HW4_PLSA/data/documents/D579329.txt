or sting 2 often the patches of rash move around 2 typically they last a few days and do not leave any longlasting skin changes 2 fewer than 5 of cases last for more than six weeks 2 the condition frequently recurs 2hives frequently occur following an infection or as a result of an allergic reaction such as to medication insect bites or food 2psychological stress cold temperature or vibration may also be a trigger 1 2 in half of cases the cause remains unknown 2 risk factors include having conditions such as hay fever or asthma 3 diagnosis is typically based on the appearance patch testing may be useful to determine the allergy 2prevention is by avoiding whatever it is that causes the condition 2 treatment is typically with antihistamines such as diphenhydramine and ranitidine 2 in severe cases corticosteroids or leukotriene inhibitors may also be used 2 keeping the environmental temperature cool is also useful 2 for cases that last more than six weeks immunosuppressants such as ciclosporin may be used 2about 20 of people are affected 2 cases of short duration occur equally in males and females while cases of long duration are more common in females 4 cases of short duration are more common among children while cases of long duration are more common among those who are middle aged 4 hives have been described at least since the time of hippocrates 4 the term urticaria is

appear anywhere on the surface of the skin whether the trigger is allergic or not a complex release of inflammatory mediators including histamine from cutaneous mast cells results in fluid leakage from superficial blood vessels welts may be pinpoint in size or several inches in diameter angioedema is a related condition also from allergic and nonallergic causes though fluid leakage is from much deeper blood vessels in the subcutaneous or submucosal layers individual hives that are painful last more than 24 hours or leave a bruise as they heal are more likely to be a more serious condition called urticarial vasculitis hives caused by stroking the skin often linear in appearance are due to a benign condition called dermatographic urticaria cause  edithives can also be classified by the purported causative agent many different substances in the environment may cause hives including medications food and physical agents in perhaps more than 50 of people with chronic hives of unknown cause it is due to an autoimmune reaction 6medications  editdrugs that have caused allergic reactions evidenced as hives include codeine dextroamphetamine 7 aspirin ibuprofen penicillin clotrimazole trichazole sulfonamides anticonvulsants cefaclor piracetam vaccines and antidiabetic drugs the antidiabetic sulphonylureaglimepiride in particular has been documented to induce allergic reactions manifesting as hives druginduced hives has been known to have an effect on severe cardiorespiratory failure  medical citation neededfood  editthe most common food allergies in adults are shellfish and nuts the most common food allergies in children are shellfish nuts eggs wheat and soy one study showed balsam of peru which is in many processed foods to be the most common cause of immediate contact urticaria 8 a less common cause is exposure to certain bacteria such as streptococcus species or possibly helicobacter pylori 9infection or environmental agent  edithives including chronic spontaneous hives can be a complication and symptom of a parasitic infection such as blastocystosis and strongyloidiasis among others 10the rash that develops from poison ivy poison oak and poison sumac contact is commonly mistaken for urticaria this rash is caused by contact with urushiol and results in a form of contact dermatitis called urushiolinduced contact dermatitis urushiol is spread by contact but can be washed off with a strong grease or oildissolving detergent and cool water and rubbing ointments dermatographic urticaria  editmain article dermatographic urticaria dermatographic urticaria also known as dermatographism or skin writing is marked by the appearance of weals or welts on the skin as a result of scratching or firm stroking of the skin seen in 4–5 of the population it is one of the most common types of urticaria 11 in which the skin becomes raised and inflamed when stroked scratched rubbed and sometimes even slapped 12the skin reaction usually becomes evident soon after the scratching and disappears within 30 minutes dermatographism is the most common form of a subset of chronic hives acknowledged as physical hives  citation neededit stands in contrast to the linear reddening that does not itch seen in healthy people who are scratched in most cases the cause is unknown although it may be preceded by a viral infection antibiotic therapy or emotional upset dermographism is diagnosed by taking a tongue blade and drawing it over the skin of the arm or back the hives should develop within a few minutes unless the skin is highly sensitive and reacts continually treatment is not needed taking antihistamines can reduce the response in cases that are annoying to the patient  citation neededpressure or delayed pressure  editthis type of hives can occur right away precisely after a pressure stimulus or as a deferred response to sustained pressure being enforced to the skin in the deferred form the hives only appear after about six hours from the initial application of pressure to the skin under normal circumstances these hives are not the same as those witnessed with most urticariae instead the protrusion in the affected areas is typically more spread out the hives may last from eight hours to three days the source of the pressure on the skin can happen from tight fitted clothing belts clothing with tough straps walking leaning against an object standing sitting on a hard surface etc the areas of the body most commonly affected are the hands feet trunk abdomen buttocks legs and face although this appears to be very similar to dermatographism the cardinal difference is that the swelled skin areas do not become visible quickly and tend to last much longer this form of the skin disease is however rare  citation neededcholinergic or stress  editmain article cholinergic urticaria cholinergic urticaria cu is one of the physical urticaria which is provoked during sweating events such as exercise bathing staying in a heated environment or emotional stress the hives produced are typically smaller than classic hives and are generally shorterlasting 13 14multiple subtypes have been elucidated each of which require distinct treatment 15 16coldinduced  editfurther information chronic cold urticaria the cold type of urticaria is caused by exposure of the skin to extreme cold damp and windy conditions it occurs in two forms the rare form is hereditary and becomes evident as hives all over the body 9 to 18 hours after cold exposure the common form of cold urticaria demonstrates itself with the rapid onset of hives on the face neck or hands after exposure to cold cold urticaria is common and lasts for an average of five to six years the population most affected is young adults between 18 and 25 years old many people with the condition also suffer from dermographism and cholinergic hives  citation neededsevere reactions can be seen with exposure to cold water swimming in cold water is the most common cause of a severe reaction this can cause a massive discharge of histamine resulting in low blood pressure fainting shock and even loss of life cold urticaria is diagnosed by dabbing an ice cube against the skin of the forearm for 1 to 5 minutes a distinct hive should develop if a patient suffers cold urticaria this is different from the normal redness that can be seen in people without cold urticaria patients with cold urticaria need to learn to protect themselves from a hasty drop in body temperature regular antihistamines are not generally efficacious one particular antihistamine cyproheptadine periactin has been found to be useful the tricyclic antidepressant doxepin has also been found to be an effective blocking agent of histamine discharge finally a medication named ketotifen which keeps mast cells from discharging histamine has also been employed with widespread success  citation neededsolar urticaria  editmain article solar urticaria this form of the disease occurs on areas of the skin exposed to the sun the condition becomes evident within minutes of exposure  citation neededwaterinduced  editmain article water urticaria this type of urticaria is also termed rare and occurs upon contact with water the response is not temperaturedependent and the skin appears similar to cholinergic form of the disease the appearance of hives is within one to 15 minutes of contact with the water and can last from 10 minutes to two hours this kind of hives do not seem to be stimulated by histamine discharge like the other physical hives most researchers believe this condition is actually skin sensitivity to additives in the water such as chlorine water urticaria is diagnosed by dabbing tap water and distilled water to the skin and observing the gradual response aquagenic urticaria is treated with capsaicin zostrix administered to the chafed skin this is the same treatment used for shingles antihistamines are of questionable benefit in this instance since histamine is not the causative factor  citation neededchizzola maculae is a very specific skin lesion due to fluoride exposure the size of a coin these lesions may resemble small blue bruises or be wholly pink doctors george waldbott and v a cecilioni named the lesions after a town in italy where they were common in young women and children 17 according to waldbott chizzola maculae are early symptoms of fluoride intoxication 18 19exercise  editthe condition was first distinguished in 1980 people with exercise urticaria eu experience hives itchiness shortness of breath and low blood pressure five to 30 minutes after beginning exercise these symptoms can progress to shock and even sudden death jogging is the most common exercise to cause eu but it is not induced by a hot shower fever or with fretfulness this differentiates eu from cholinergic urticaria  citation neededeu sometimes occurs only when someone exercises within 30 minutes of eating particular foods such as wheat or shellfish for these individuals exercising alone or eating the injuring food without exercising produces no symptoms eu can be diagnosed by having the patient exercise and then observing the symptoms this method must be used with caution and only with the appropriate resuscitative measures at hand eu can be differentiated from cholinergic urticaria by the hot water immersion test in this test the patient is immersed in water at 43 °c 1094 °f someone with eu will not develop hives while a person with cholinergic urticaria will develop the characteristic small hives especially on the neck and chest  citation neededthe immediate symptoms of this type are treated with antihistamines epinephrine and airway support taking antihistamines prior to exercise may be effective ketotifen is acknowledged to stabilise mast cells and prevent histamine release and has been effective in treating this hives disorder avoiding exercise or foods that cause the mentioned symptoms is very important in particular circumstances tolerance can be brought on by regular exercise but this must be under medical supervision  citation neededpathophysiology  editsee also list of human leukocyte antigen alleles associated with cutaneous conditions the skin lesions of urticarial disease are caused by an inflammatory reaction in the skin causing leakage of capillaries in the dermis and resulting in an edema which persists until the interstitial fluid is absorbed into the surrounding cells  citation neededhives is caused by the release of histamine and other mediators of inflammation  cytokines from cells in the skin this process can be the result of an allergic or nonallergic reaction differing in the eliciting mechanism of histamine release 20allergic hives  edithistamine and other proinflammatory substances are released from mast cells in the skin and tissues in response to the binding of allergen bound ig e antibodies to highaffinity cell surface receptors basophils and other inflammatory cells are also seen to release histamine and other mediators and are thought to play an important role especially in chronic urticarial diseases autoimmune hives  editover half of all cases of chronic idiopathic hives are the result of an autoimmune trigger roughly 50 of patients with chronic urticaria spontaneously develop autoantibodies directed at the receptor fcεri located on skin mast cells chronic stimulation of this receptor leads to chronic hives patients often have other autoimmune conditions such as autoimmune thyroiditis celiac disease type 1 diabetes rheumatoid arthritis sjögrens syndrome or systemic lupus erythematosus 6infections  edithivelike rashes commonly accompany viral illnesses such as the common cold they usually appear three to five days after the cold has started and may even appear a few days after the cold has resolved nonallergic hives  editmechanisms other than allergenantibody interactions are known to cause histamine release from mast cells many drugs for example morphine can induce direct histamine release not involving any immunoglobulin molecule also a diverse group of signaling substances called neuropeptides have been found to be involved in emotionally induced hives dominantly inherited cutaneous and neurocutaneous porphyrias  porphyria cutanea tarda hereditary coproporphyria variegate porphyria and erythropoietic protoporphyria have been associated with solar urticaria the occurrence of druginduced solar urticaria may be associated with porphyrias this may be caused by ig g binding not ig e dietary histamine poisoning  editthis is termed scombroid food poisoning ingestion of free histamine released by bacterial decay in fish flesh may result in a rapidonset allergictype symptom complex which includes hives however the hives produced by scombroid is reported not to include wheals 21stress and chronic idiopathic hives  editchronic idiopathic hives has been anecdotally linked to stress since the 1940s 22 a large body of evidence demonstrates an association between this condition and both poor emotional wellbeing 23 and reduced healthrelated quality of life 24 a link between stress and this condition has also been shown 25 a recent study has demonstrated an association between stressful life events eg bereavement divorce etc and chronic idiopathic urticaria 26 and also an association between posttraumatic stress and chronic idiopathic hives 27diagnosis  editthe cause of chronic hives can rarely be determined 28 in some cases regular extensive allergy testing over a long period of time is requested in hopes of getting new insight 29 30 no evidence shows regular allergy testing results in identification of a problem or relief for people with chronic hives 29 30 regular allergy testing for people with chronic hives is not recommended 28acute versus chronic  editacute urticaria is defined as the presence of evanescent wheals which completely resolve within six weeks 31 acute urticaria becomes evident a few minutes after the person has been exposed to an allergen the outbreak may last several weeks but usually the hives are gone in six weeks typically the hives are a reaction to food but in about half the cases the trigger is unknown common foods may be the cause as well as bee or wasp stings or skin contact with certain fragrances acute viral infection is another common cause of acute urticaria viral exanthem  less common causes of hives include friction pressure temperature extremes exercise and sunlight chronic urticaria ordinary urticaria 32 is defined as the presence of evanescent wheals which persist for greater than six weeks 31 some of the more severe chronic cases have lasted more than 20 years a survey indicated chronic urticaria lasted a year or more in more than 50 of sufferers and 20 years or more in 20 of them 33acute and chronic hives are visually indistinguishable related conditions  editangioedema  editangioedema is similar to hives 34 but in angioedema the swelling occurs in a lower layer of the dermis than in hives 35 as well as in the subcutis this swelling can occur around the mouth eyes in the throat in the abdomen or in other locations hives and angioedema sometimes occur together in response to an allergen and is a concern in severe cases as angioedema of the throat can be fatal vibratory angioedema  editthis very rare form of angioedema develops in response to contact with vibration in vibratory angioedema symptoms develop within two to five minutes after contact with a vibrating object and abate after about an hour patients with this disorder do not suffer from dermographism or pressure urticaria vibratory angioedema is diagnosed by holding a vibrating device such as a laboratory vortex machine against the forearm for four minutes speedy swelling of the whole forearm extending into the upper arm is also noted later the principal treatment is avoidance of vibratory stimulants antihistamines have also been proven helpful  citation neededmanagement  editthe mainstay of therapy for both acute and chronic hives is patient education avoiding triggers and using antihistamines chronic hives can be difficult to treat and lead to significant disability unlike the acute form 50–80 of people with chronic hives have no identifiable triggers fortunately 50 of people with chronic hives will experience remission within 1 year 36 overall treatment is geared towards symptomatic management individuals with chronic hives may need other medications in addition to antihistamines to control symptoms patients who experience hives with angioedema require emergency treatment as this is a lifethreatening condition treatment guidelines for the management of chronic hives have been published 37 38 according to the 2014 american practice parameters treatment involves a step wise approach step 1 consists of second generation h1 receptor blocking antihistamines systemic glucocorticoids can also be used for episodes of severe disease but should not be used for long term due to their long list of side effects step 2 consists of increasing the dose of the current antihistamine adding other antihistamines or adding a leukotriene receptor antagonist such as montelukast step 3 consists of adding or replacing the current treatment with hydroxyzine or doxepin if the individual doesnt respond to steps 1–3 then they are considered to have refractory symptoms at this point antiinflammatory medications dapsone sulfasalazine immunosuppressants cyclosporin sirolimus or other medications like omalizumab can be used these options are explained in more detail below antihistamines  editnonsedating antihistamines that block the histamine h1 receptors are the first line of therapy first generation antihistamines such as diphenhydramine or hydroxyzine block both central and peripheral h1 receptors and can be sedating second generation antihistamines such as loratadine cetirizine or desloratadine selectively antagonize the peripheral h1 receptors and are less sedating less anticholinergic and generally preferred over the first generation antihistamines 39 40people who don’t respond to the maximum dose of h1 antihistamines may benefit from increasing the dose then to switching to another nonsedating antihistamine then to adding a leukotriene antagonist then to using an older antihistamine then to using systemic steroids and finally to using ciclosporin or omalizumab 39systemic steroids  editoral glucocorticoids are effective in controlling symptoms of chronic hives however they have an extensive list of adverse effects such as adrenal suppression weight gain osteoporosis hyperglycemia etc therefore their use should be limited to a couple of weeks in addition one study found that systemic glucocorticoids combined with antihistamines did not hasten the time to symptom control compared with antihistamines alone 41leukotrienereceptor antagonists  editleukotrienes are released from mast cells along with histamine the medications montelukast and zafirlukast block leukotriene receptors and can be used as add on treatment or in isolation for patients with cu it is important to note that these medications may be more beneficial for patients with nsaid induced cu 42 43other  editother options for refractory symptoms of chronic hives include antiinflammatory medications omalizumab and immunosuppressants potential antiinflammatory agents include dapsone sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine dapsone is a sulfone antimicrobial agent and is thought to suppress prostaglandin and leukotriene activity it is helpful in therapyrefractory cases 44 and is contraindicated in patients with g6pd deficiency sulfasalazine a 5asa derivative is thought to alter adenosine release and inhibit ig e mediated mast cell degranulation sulfasalazine is a good option for people with anemia who cannot take dapsone hydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial agent that suppresses t lymphocytes it has a low cost however it takes longer than dapsone or sulfasalazine to work omalizumab was approved by the fda in 2014 for patients 12 years old and above with chronic hives it is a monoclonal antibody directed against ig e significant improvement in pruritus and quality of life was observed in a phase iii multicenter randomized control trial 45immunosuppressants used for cu include cyclosporine tacrolimus sirolimus and mycophenolate calcineurin inhibitors such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus inhibit cell responsiveness to mast cell products and inhibit t cell activity they are preferred by some experts to treat severe symptoms 46 sirolimus and mycophenolate have less evidence for their use in the treatment of chronic hives but reports have shown them to be efficacious 47 48 immunosuppressants are generally reserved as the last line of therapy for severe cases due to their potential for serious adverse effects research  editafamelanotide is being studied as a hives treatment 49opioid antagonists such as naltrexone have tentative evidence to support their use 50see also  editurticarial vasculitis references  edit a b c d hives archived from the original on 19 august 2016 retrieved 10 august 2016 a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p
