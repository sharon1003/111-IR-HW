moonshine  homemade stillsby jesse taylor ohio usamaking a still which is short for distillery is quite easy you dont need lots of copper unless youre going to be drinking the end product all it really takes is an old pressure cooker and about six feet of two different sizes of copper pipe i can tell you how to do it if youre interested alcohol will run an engine im not a mechanic so i dont know anything about any carburetor or mechanical adjustments you may have to make to compensate for the difference in the explosive force between alcohol and gasoline but i do believe you have to add things to the alcohol so you dont ruin your engine when using it with this new fuel i think alcohol requires the addition of substances to help lubricate the valves and cylinders a lead substitute just to name one possible additive a mechanic should be consulted about such things what seems to be keeping people from using alcohol based fuel instead of petroleum based fuel is the one main drawback to the production of alcohol to put it simply you cannot distill a gallon of alcohol then use that same gallon to alcohol as fuel to heat your still and make lets say a gallon and a half of alcohol next time if you did try to use that gallon of alcohol you would have to supplement it with an additional fuel source you would not get enough energy from it to let you compound your next attempt at production in this way its a process of diminishing returns you must have a separate fuel source to distill your alcohol one of the ways the reveneurs used to find the old moonshiners was to look for areas where the woods had been cleaned by the cutting of firewood it takes a lot of wood to fire up a stilland i mean a lot of wood i know this because my very own grandfather was a professional moonshiner my dad dabbled in it but not to sell any distilling requires that the alcohol already be present in the material being distilled youre not producing alcohol from a substance youre only removing the alcohol thats already present how does the alcohol become present simple you ferment whatever you plan to use be it apples corn or some other vegetable matter simply put you make wine then you distill this wine plus the vegetable matter and that takes the alcohol out of it leaving most of the water behind in the still pot what do you do with this left over water and vegetable matter depends on what it is if its corn or fruit its now going to be cooked corn or fruit you might feed it to your chickens or hogs depending on the size of your flock or herd its going to have a distinctive odor to it make no mistake thats another way the old reveneurs used to find the stills they just smelled for them even if you flushed the spent mash down a nearby stream you cant help but spill some of that stuff it will stink up the creek bank all the way back to your still you can use the water for your plants and plow the spent solids into your soil i suppose anyway it will take you between two and three weeks to ferment a batch of mash that is if you want to get the optimum yield of alcohol from that batch lets say you did ferment a 40 gallon barrel full and ran that through your still how much alcohol could you reasonably expect to get you can only expect about a 25 return that means you might get 10 gallons of alcohol out of 40 gallons of mash how much alcohol do you need to last you until the next batch is ready to run through the still do you have the space to keep a constant supply fermenting do you have the time and fuel to distill the alcohol on a regular basis how legal would such a thing be well as a free american you should be able to produce anything you want to use you may not be able to sell it to anyone but you should have the freedom to produce it and use it for your own purposes of course just how much freedom you can enjoy in this land of the free may be a hotly contested point between you and your elected law makers these fine folks may have already rendered your freedom to distill your own alcohol to be null and void its a topic you may have to take up with your local sheriff at some point if anyone is interested in the ins and outs of the old time way of moonshining i can tell you quite a few things about how it used to be at my house jesse taylor due to the popularity of this page i have added a page on how to make moonshine
