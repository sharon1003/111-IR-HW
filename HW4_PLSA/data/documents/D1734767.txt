 – buckus69 web developer 2 points 3 years ago etl  extract transform and load basically youre going to take data from one source and transform it then load it to another place it could be as simple as mapping fields between two databases or as complicated as performing mathematical operations on some fields combining it with other data sources then loading them into a final location many dbas do both etl work and dba work but if a company takes in a lot of data or has a need to move data around alot they could have a dedicated department just to do that kind of stuff generally what youre doing is interfacing data from one department or an outside source and loading it into another database for another department this has the advantage of each department being able to set their own technical specifications for their projects then having the etl team transform the data they need from other departments into the format that will work for their projectpermalink embed save – rawrrang  s 2 points 3 years ago so is it correct to say that architects and developers are the ones to first engineer a database then etl developers and dba are the ones responsible for the day to day operations of the databasepermalink embed save parent – eecsasdf 3 points 3 years ago etl developers do a lot of development derp especially in big data so i wouldnt necessarily call it day to day operations its a challenging software engineering problem to build an etl pipeline when you have multiple petabytes of data add some specific requirements and scale it to a certain extent then it becomes a huge undertaking many no sql databases and platforms have spawned from within companies facing these problems data quality is also a challenging problem no matter the size of your data you will find that the roles are not black and white im a software engineer in data analytics and we spend a lot of effort just wrangling data into a system and format that is both fast enough and useful for our analytical applications that involves a lot of etl and data modeling cant just copy and paste your data into sqlite and call it a day when you need to scan 100 tb of data as instantly as possible the team that is responsible for infrastructure and etl of our big data platform is mainly composed of folks from software engineering backgrounds it depends on the company though architects software engineers etl developers and dbas all collaborate and provide valuable input in the engineering processpermalink embed save parent – buckus69 web developer 1 point 3 years ago it can depend on the size of the company small to medium size companies the developer could also be the database developer and the etl guy the larger the company the more likely youll find specialized roles like people who just do etl people who just do database development often the database developer will work with an application developer to develop a database etl people dont do the data loads manually they usually design a process using a tool and then have it run on a schedule most of their time is spent designing the etl and making sure it is running okpermalink embed save parent
