15 august 2014what is the cost of the ideal protein diet one of the first questions to come up whenever i’m discussing the ideal protein weight loss program with someone in our clinic is “what does the ideal protein diet cost” many people are afraid they can’t afford it but like most things in life you have to weigh the costs versus the benefits the ideal protein weight loss program cost will typically replace a lot of the foods you are currently eating let’s break down the ideal protein diet plan costs shall we ideal protein price for food during phase 1 of the ideal protein diet you’ll eat three ideal protein diet foods per day the ideal protein price for food is 4 to 5 per packetmeal the prices of some are higher some are lower so let’s use 13 per day therefore in phase 1 you’ll eat three ideal protein foods per day and spend an average of 92 per week for your meals ideal protein supplements costs along with the ideal protein foods you need to factor in the cost of ideal protein supplements these are important for supporting your weight loss and will be purchased once per month the multivitamin is sixty capsules for 3010 the calciummagnesium supplement contains 120 capsules and costs 24 the omega 3s are 31 and a twomonth supply of potassium is 13 the cost of the ideal protein diet is affordable the weekly cost of the ideal protein diet in phase 1 is 85 to 95 dollars “ouch” you might say “i can’t afford that” but you can and here’s how before i started on the ideal protein diet i had a lot of bad eating habits let’s face it we don’t let ourselves become obese by being calorie and healthconscious the ideal protein price vs my morning latte before i started the ideal protein diet protocol i used to stop by starbucks at least three to four times per week i would get a grande nonfat caramel macchiato and a breakfast sandwich usually the bacon artisan breakfast sandwich i was buying nonfat because you know i was trying to be healthy my coffee was costing me 435 each time i went however and the sandwich was 345 that was a total of 780 plus tax per visit that’s roughly the cost of two ideal protein meals per visit i had to make a choice would i choose two ideal protein meals or the instant gratification of my morning breakfast habit which was costing me approximately 25 to 30 per week the ideal protein price vs pizza delivery it occurred to me the other day that i haven’t ordered pizza in a long long time before i started the ideal protein diet i used to order pizza to be delivered to my house about once per week and i wouldn’t just get the pizza oh no i had to use the coupon for the free order of cheese sticks a 2liter of coke and sometimes a desert the total with tip was usually right in the 45 range now maybe pizza’s not your thing but i bet you have some meal that’s your goto on days when you come home from work feeling too tired to cook what does it cost you it doesn’t matter whether you’re ordering in or going out for pizza chinese food or thai curries there are costs associated with that meal how much does that meal cost you financially how much is it costing you physically again you have to choose will you spend 45 toward a week’s worth of ideal protein foods or buy that pizza the ideal protein price vs happy hour ok i know giving up happy hour may be where some people draw the line but you cannot drink when you’re on the ideal protein program you can still go socialize with your friends after work but you’ll be drinking sparkling water with a twist of lime if you’re ordering the house liquor happy hour cocktails run about 57 each head to a popular upscale establishment and they can be as much as 15 a pop once you’re at the bar what are the chances that you’ll have just one that’s what i thought let’s say you have two if you go out one night per week that’s about 30 bars rarely charge you for water eliminate any alcohol you drink throughout the week and you’ve just found more money towards the cost of the ideal protein diet as you can see simply by eliminating or modifying some of your current food choices the cost of the ideal protein diet becomes affordable overall ideal protein weight loss program cost phase 1phase one is where the ideal weight loss program costs the most this is the phase where you will lose all of the weight there is a 399 fee to get started on the program which includes your initial consultation full body composition analysis full body measurements 25 ideal protein meals all of the supplements and ideal protein blender bottle 2 oz real salt sea salt

insurance doesnt cover it you can use an hsa to pay coaching costs your provider needs to provide you a separate invoice for that i will say that most people find the diet doesnt cost them too much extra because you eat out less and avoid expensive processed food that are bad for you plus  you feel better so youre so much more productive good luck70keith  monday 20 march 2017 2134im a type 1

scanned56nay  wednesday 09 march 2016 1819hi how long does each phase last55tammy benner  wednesday 30 december 2015 1153sobst in my clinic if you dont use ideal protein supplements you cant do the diet with me heres the reason  not all vitamins are created equal mass produced vitamins have stabilizers and fillers that allow them to be on the shelf at costco for months at a time these additives can prohibit the absorption of the vitamins this can affect your weight loss ideal protein vitamins are specifically made to supplement what is missing from our diet they are made in small batches and shipped directly to us every batch is tested for heavy metals etc and there are no stabilizers if you put our multivitamin out on the desk it will actually age this is a good thing this is also why the vitamins may be a bit more expensive than what you see in rite aid plus your rite aid vitamins dont come with a coach to help you lose weight look at it this waylets say your clinic does let you use less expensive vitamins lets say you lose weight just a tiny bit slower because of it an extra week on the diet is another 90 so do you want to take a chance and save 1015 on vitamins  only to spend another week or maybe more on the diet at a rate of 90 per week its just not worth it tammy54sobst  tuesday 29 december 2015 2347do you need to use the ideal protien supplement when you are
