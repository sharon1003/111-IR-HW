quite sometime now about something that has been happening with my body please do not laugh i am not making this up my body at times will vibrate or hum for lack of better explanation i only notice it if i am sitting or lying in bed it is very disconcerting especially since no one has an answer could it simply be the nerves vibrating at a higher frequency it is not something that happens all the time but i would feel a lot better if there was some kind of explanation thanks violet back to topjaden regular member date joined dec 2011 total posts  275posted 292012 557 pm gmt 6i always get a

list of things all the things that my regular doctor said was in my mind at that time he said that they had been treating women in sweden for years for fibromyalgia he wrote an extensive letter to my us doctor and it was from then that my doctor stopped telling me that it was all in my head back to top tired artist regular member date joined jan 2012 total posts  189posted 2102012 345 pm gmt 6wow

am gmt 6hello  ive been reading some of the posts re vibrations fibromyalgia and lyme disease im australian but in 1996 we were living in the us i began to feel like an 80 year old i was in my late 30s and had tests for lyme disease which came up negative my husband also had lyme disease but with all the symptoms and a positive blood test we were about to return to australia but i still felt bad and i knew if i did have a false negative and it was lyme id have great trouble dealing with it in australia as virtually no one would have heard of it i went back to the doctor and asked for the antibiotics which he gave me i took them for 4 weeks and then one morning i woke up and knew i was better for some time after that i would have hip discomfort on standing for long periods but eventually that went away 18 months ago i was diagnosed with fibromyalgia and ive wondered if there was a connection but recently ive started having the vibrations that people mention here do you get used to them i hope they disappear  theyre not great i asked the doctor who said he thought it was probably the medication im on im going to ask him for more details it kind of freaks me out that i may still have active lyme disease though  is that likely after 4 weeks of antibiotics and would there be such a long period before any real symptoms showed up id had some muscular pain issues about 6 years ago but they went away for a few years too id appreciate peoples opinions theres still dispute as to whether lyme disease even exists in australia  a man in nsw died a while back and his wife believes it was lyme disease but thats the only reference to it that ive ever heard here i had a general blood test quite a few years ago and that indicated that id had lyme disease thanks for your

other threads here and in the menopause board i have had this internal vibrations for about a year i have told my doctor about it i feel it in my right leg foot and head the head part scares me the most my doctor first thought it was my blood pressure so he put me on medicine but the vibrations did not stop now he is checking my thyroid he also said it could be the hormonal imbalance due to menopause so i am using bioidentical progesterone anxiety just might be the reason because when i take a xanax the vibrations calms down originally i had thought it was the tractor trailers flying by
