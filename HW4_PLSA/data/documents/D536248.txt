receptor abbreviated ach r is an integral membrane protein that responds to the binding of acetylcholine a neurotransmitter nicotinic acetylcholine receptor structure contents1 classification2 receptor types21 n ach r22 m ach r3 role in health and disease4 see also5 references6 external links classification  editlike other transmembrane receptors acetylcholine receptors are classified according to their pharmacology or according to their relative affinities and sensitivities to different molecules although all acetylcholine receptors by definition respond to acetylcholine they respond to other molecules as well nicotinic acetylcholine receptors  n ach r also known as  ionotropic  acetylcholine receptors are particularly responsive to nicotine the nicotine ach receptor is also a na  k  and ca 2ion channel muscarinic acetylcholine receptors  m ach r also known as  metabotropic  acetylcholine receptors are particularly responsive to muscarine nicotinic and muscarinic are two main kinds of cholinergic receptors receptor types  editmolecular biology has shown that the nicotinic and muscarinic receptors belong to distinct protein superfamilies ach and its receptors drug

causes the contraction of skeletal muscles by way of endplate potential epps nn causes depolarization in autonomic ganglia resulting in post ganglionic impulse nicotinic receptors cause the release of catecholamine from the adrenal medulla and also site specific excitation or inhibition in brain both nm and nn are na  and ca 2 channel linked but nn is also linked with an extra k  channeln ach r  editmain article nicotinic acetylcholine receptors the n ach rs are ligand gated ion channels and like other members of the  cysloop  ligandgated ion channel superfamily are composed of five protein subunits symmetrically arranged like staves around a barrel the subunit composition is highly variable across different tissues each subunit contains four regions which span the membrane and consist of approximately 20 amino acids region ii which sits closest to the pore lumen forms the pore lining binding of acetylcholine to the n termini of each of the two alpha subunits results in the 15° rotation of all m2 helices 2 the cytoplasm side of the n ach r receptor has rings of high negative charge that determine the specific cation specificity of the receptor and remove the hydration shell often formed by ions in aqueous solution in the intermediate region of the receptor within the pore lumen valine and leucine residues val 255 and leu 251 define a hydrophobic region through which the dehydrated ion must pass 3the n ach r is found at the edges of junctional folds at the neuromuscular junction on the postsynaptic side it is activated by acetylcholine release across the synapse the diffusion of na  and k  across the receptor causes depolarization the endplate potential that opens voltagegated sodium channels which allows for firing of the action potential and potentially muscular contractionm ach r  editmain article muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in contrast the m ach rs are not ion channels but belong instead to the superfamily of gproteincoupled receptors that activate other ionic channels via a second messenger cascade the muscarine cholinergic receptor activates a gprotein when bound to extracellular ach the alpha subunit of the gprotein deactivates adenylate cyclase while the betagamma subunit activates the kchannels and therefore hyperpolarize the cell this causes a decrease in cardiac activity role in health and disease  editnicotinic acetylcholine receptors can be blocked by curare hexamethonium and toxins present in the venoms of snakes and shellfishes like αbungarotoxin drugs such as the neuromuscular blocking agents bind reversibly to the nicotinic receptors in the neuromuscular junction and are used routinely in anaesthesia nicotinic receptors are the primary mediator of the effects of nicotine in myasthenia gravis the receptor at the neuromuscular junction is targeted by antibodies leading to muscle weakness muscarinic acetylcholine receptors can be blocked by the drugs atropine and scopolamine congenital myasthenic syndrome cms is an inherited neuromuscular disorder caused by defects of several types at the neuromuscular junction postsynaptic defects are the most frequent cause of cms and often result in abnormalities in nicotinic acetylcholine receptors the majority of mutations causing cms are found in the ach r subunits genes 4out of all mutations associated with cms more than half are mutations in one of the four genes encoding the adult acetylcholine receptor subunits mutations of the ach r often result in endplate deficiency most of the mutations of the ach r are mutations of the chrne gene the chrne gene codes for the epsilon subunit of the ach r most mutations are autosomal recessive lossoffunction mutations and as a result there is endplate ach r deficiency chrne is associated with changing the kinetic properties of the ach r 5 one type of mutation of the epsilon subunit of the ach r introduces an arg into the binding site at the αε subunit interface of the receptor the addition of a cationic arg into the anionic environment of the ach r binding site greatly reduces the kinetic properties of the receptor the result of the newly introduced arg is a 30fold reduction of agonist affinity 75fold reduction of gating efficiency and an extremely weakened channel opening probability this type of mutation results in an extremely fatal form of cms 6see also  editmuscarinic
