attorney with the registry or the land titles office general information what is a power of attorney a power of attorney is a document in which one person the donor appoints another person the attorney to act for him or her there are many reasons why you might want to appoint someone else to look after your financial affairs for example if you are going to be out of the country for a lengthy period of time you might want someone to do your banking while you are gone if you are approaching old age you may want to give a power of attorney to a person you trust so that he or she can manage your property for you what are the differences between enduring and ordinary powers of attorney there are two major types of powers of attorney ordinary and enduring an ordinary power of attorney is only valid as long as the donor is capable of acting for him or herself if the donor dies or becomes mentally incompetent the power of attorney is invalidated an enduring power of attorney remains valid even if the donor later becomes mentally incompetent note the donor must be competent at the time the power of attorney is made in either case the power of attorney becomes invalid when the donor dies a power of attorney cannot be used to bequeath property upon the death of the donor what are the differences between general and specific powers of attorney a general power of attorney is one that gives the attorney the authority to do anything the donor could do him or herself a specific power of attorney is one that gives the attorney authority to act for a particular purpose eg to buy or sell a particular piece of property will a power of attorney still be valid after the donor dies no generally speaking when a person dies the executor also called a personal representative appointed in the persons last will and testament takes control of the deceased persons property and distributes it according to the instructions in the will if there is no will or if the will is invalid each jurisdiction has intestacy legislation that distributes the deceased persons property to his or her relatives according to a set of rules a court generally appoints an administrator to oversee this process unfortunately the deceased persons wishes are not taken into account during the process which can be very lengthy since they have not been formally expressed in the proper manner the donor who is the donor the donor is the person who needs someone else to act for him or her the donor must be an adult the donor must be capable of making his or her own decisions at the time the power of attorney is executed signed what is incapacity a person is incapable of managing property if the person is unable to understand information relevant to making a decision about the management of property or if the person cannot appreciate the foreseeable consequences of making or not making a decision about the management of property the attorney who is the attorney the person appointed by the donor is called the attorney the attorney is the person who acts for the donor does the attorney have to be a lawyer no there is no need for the attorney to be a lawyer see below for attorney qualifications what qualifications does an attorney need to have the attorney must be a capable adult the attorney cannot be an undischarged bankrupt the attorney should not be the owner operator or employee of a nursing home or extended care facility in which the donor is a resident what qualities should i look for in an attorney your attorney must be someone whom you trust completely in addition remember that your attorney will have complete authority to deal with your financial and legal affairs subject to any limitations or restrictions specified in your power of attorney you should ensure that the person you choose has adequate financial management skills and sufficient time to handle your affairs properly your attorney must be available when required be able to objectively make decisions and be able to keep accurate financial records what are the responsibilities of my attorney your attorney has the following responsibilitiesto act in your best interestto keep accurate records of dealingstransactions undertaken on your behalfto act for you with the utmost good faith and to avoid situations where there is a conflict of interest andto keep your property and money separate from their own is it okay to appoint a relative as attorney yes people often appoint relatives as attorneys can my attorney also be a beneficiary in my will yes attorneys can also be beneficiaries in your will what are joint or joint  several attorneys sometimes a donor will want to appoint two attorneys in that case the donor must decide whether the attorneys will be joint attorneys or joint and several attorneys joint attorneys must act together they must both agree before any action can be taken and they must both take the same action at the same time if one is absent no action can be taken joint and several attorneys can act together or individually either one can take an action without consulting the other if one is absent the other can still act what is an alternatesubstitute attorney do i need one it is a good idea to appoint an alternatesubstitute attorney but it is not absolutely necessary an alternatesubstitute attorney can only act when the attorney is unable or unwilling to continue acting for the donor note a third party eg the donorâ€™s bank may require proof that the original attorney is unable to continue as attorney before accepting instructions from the alternate where two attorneys have been appointed the document may state that if one dies or is otherwise incapable of acting the other will continue as sole i am an attorney how should i sign documents on the donors behalf there is no one standard way for an attorney to sign documents however when you do sign it is important that you clearly state who the donor is and that you are acting as their attorney one convention is to write the donors name then sign your name and then indicate that you are the attorney the following is an example john johnson by jane smith attorney you should always have a copy of the power of attorney with you whenever you are acting as an attorney you may be required to sign an affidavit stating that the power of attorney is valid that it hasnt been revoked and that the donor is still alive and remember failure to comply with directions given by the donor without reasonable cause can leave you subject to civil liability for any damages caused by noncompliance place and time what is jurisdiction a jurisdiction is a place that has its own laws it is a territory with boundaries such as a state or a province for example california is a jurisdiction in the united states ontario is a jurisdiction in canada scotland is a jurisdiction in the united kingdom and queensland is a jurisdiction in australia what is the governing law a power of attorney is governed by the law of the jurisdiction where the actions of the attorney will be performed normally this is the place in which the property of the donor is located therefore it is not a good idea to appoint an attorney who resides in a different jurisdiction unless the property or assets you want the attorney to deal with are also in the different jurisdiction if you anticipate that your attorney will be acting in more than one jurisdiction you should probably make separate powers of attorney for each jurisdiction examples if your bank accounts and other property are located in the jurisdiction where you live you will want to appoint an attorney who lives in the same jurisdiction if you live in one jurisdiction but have a bank account or other property someplace else and you want an attorney to deal with that property you will want to choose the place where the property is located as the governing law and appoint an attorney who is located in or is willing to travel to the same jurisdiction as the property when does a power of attorney start a power of attorney can start on a date specified in the document or upon the occurrence of an event such as disability or incompetence if there is no specified date or event a power of attorney starts immediately upon execution note some jurisdictions do not allow powers of attorney that start on the occurrence of an event howwhen does a power of attorney end an ordinary power of attorney ends automatically when the donor becomes mentally incapacitated or dies an enduring power of attorney ends automatically when the donor dies as long as you are mentally competent you may revoke your power of attorney at any time by notifying your attorney in writing that the power is revoked and destroying the original power of attorney otherwise a power of attorney continues in effect indefinitely unless the document specifies an end date can i revoke my power of attorney after i have become incompetent a person who is incompetent cannot revoke an enduring power of attorney however an ordinary power of attorney is automatically revoked when the donor is found to be incompetent how do i revoke my power of attorney you can revoke or cancel a power of attorney by giving your attorney a written notice saying that his or her power has ended also you may make a new power of attorney that states your previous power of attorney is now revoked but you must still notify the previous attorney of the revocation third parties eg people or organizations that have been dealing with the attorney must also be notified additionally if your power of attorney is registered you must also register the revocation please note that if you fail to inform your attorney of the revocation your attorney can legally continue to make decisions on your behalf powers should i put restrictions on my attorney when you give a general power of attorney you give your attorney the authority to do anything you could do yourself with a few exceptions  such as areas where you possess skills that your attorney doesnt eg if you are a dentist you cannot authorize your attorney to practice dentistry on your behalf but there may be some things you would prefer your attorney did not do for example you may want to require that your attorney get prior approval from you before signing cheques for large amounts on your account should my attorney be allowed to personally benefit from managing my assets if the person you are appointing as your attorney is also a member of your family or a beneficiary in your will you may want that person to be able to personally benefit from managing your assets since you intend that person to become owner of the assets eventually generally however it is probably not a good idea to allow your attorney to personally benefit from managing your assets as this creates a conflict of interest for your attorney who is legally obligated to act in your best interest not his or her own best interest what can the attorney do the attorney may transact business respecting the donors property in all areas specified by the donor is the attorney obligated to do anything generally speaking the attorney is not obligated to act for the donor however in some circumstances the attorney may agree in writing to accept an obligation to take action when necessary when the attorney acts on behalf of the donor the attorney must act in the best interest of the donor does my attorney have the authority to act while i am still available and able to take care of my own finances generally speaking a power of attorney is effective as soon as it is executed signed and witnessed etc whether or not the donor is available or able to handle his or her own affairs however the document might specify that it will only be effective under certain conditions for example some powers of attorney specify that they will not come into effect unless and until the principal has become mentally incompetent to handle his or her own finances note some jurisdictions do not allow powers of attorney that commence upon the occurrence of a condition or event such as mental incapacity signing details what are the requirements for signing witnesses and notarization different jurisdictions have different signing requirements for powers of attorney which may depend on what powers are given to the attorney if you are giving your attorney the power to sell or otherwise dispose of your property you will probably have to acknowledge your document before a notary public otherwise witnesses should be legally sufficient be aware however that many banks and other institutions have their own policies about signing requirements and may refuse to accept documents that are not notarized regardless of their legal sufficiency if you want to avoid bureaucratic holdups it is probably a good idea to take your document to a notary public as well as having it witnessed what does it mean to execute a document when a person executes a document he or she signs it with the proper formalities for example if there is a legal requirement that the signature on the document be witnessed the person executes the document by signing it in the presence of the required number of witnesses how should i sign my power of attorney document to be valid you must sign the document with your usual cheque signing signature you should also initial each page of the document the signing and the initialing of the pages must occur in the presence of your notary or witness es after you have signed and initialed your document in front of your notary or witness es your notary or witness es must sign on the applicable page of the power of attorney and should initial each page this must occur in your presence does it matter where my power of attorney document is signed and witnessed if your document will be used in a different jurisdiction  but not in a foreign nation  there is no problem with having the document signed and witnessed where you live rather than where the document will be used the witnessing requirements number of witnesses required whether or not notarization is needed should still be those of the place where the power of attorney will be used however what if my power of attorney will be used in a foreign nation if your document is intended to be used in a foreign nation you may have to have it authenticated or legalized this is a process whereby a government official eg the secretary of state the foreign office the office of the attorney general  depending on where you live certifies that the signature of the authority eg notary or solicitor on your document is authentic and should be accepted in the foreign nation for more information about document authentication and legalization contact the local consulateembassy of the foreign country your document will be going to or one of the following government web sites united states httpstravelstategovcontenttravelenlegalconsiderationsjudicialauthenticationofdocumentsofficeofauthenticationshtml united kingdom httpswwwgovukgetdocumentlegalisedcanada httpwwwgovoncambsenglishmbsodsauthenthtml web site is for ontario  other provinces contact the provincial office of the attorney generalaustralia httpwwwdfatgovaubrisbaneindexhtml other considerations do i have to pay my attorney depending on the kind of relationship you have with the person who will be acting as your attorney you will have to consider whether they should be paid for their services you can stipulate in your document that your attorney will not receive any payment except the reimbursement of outofpocket expenses or you can agree to pay your attorney a specified amount if you prefer you can authorize your attorney to pay him or herself a reasonable amount for acting for you should i have my attorney prepare financial statements you can require your attorney to prepare periodical financial statements and send them to your accountant lawyer or some other person you choose this is a good deal of work however and most people do not require it of unpaid attorneys note attorneys should keep records of their actions what are coowned assets if your attorney is a family member you may be joint owners of property it is important to state this in your document so that third parties dealing with your attorney understand that the attorney is entitled to coown assets with you otherwise the coowning of assets could give the impression of impropriety do i have to file or record my power of attorney with the registry or the land titles office generally speaking a power of attorney has to be recorded filed with the registry or the land titles office depending on the jurisdiction if it could affect real property land or other real estate for example if the attorney is authorized to mortgage or sell the donors real estate or to purchase real estate on behalf of the donor the power of attorney will probably have to be recorded at the appropriate office note if this is the case the document will probably need to be notarized
