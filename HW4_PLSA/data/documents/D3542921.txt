scissor sisters interview scissor sisters sexuality is a universal thingby alexis petridis the scissor sisters ended up binning their first run at a third album before it emerged as a dark reflection on gay culture if only they can agree on how to put it on stagealexispetridis thu 17 jun 2010 1630 edt1630 edt1scissor sisters’ jake shears and ana lynch photograph sarah lee for the guardian j ake shears pokes distractedly at his i pad and lets out a sigh if everything goes according to plan over the coming year he says a little ruefully im going to be totally screwed you come and see me again in six months time and im not going to be looking so cute across the table his covocalist and longterm onstage foil ana lynch nods sympathetically babys going to be busy she says from beneath a hairstyle so elaborate it looks like it required not a stylist but a team of structural engineers and a quantity surveyor the issue isnt really the third scissor sisters album night work which has finally arrived after a gestation period so lengthy and torturous that a despondent shears literally disappeared midway through its making not even telling his partner where he was going nor is it the accompanying world tour on which shears suggests – not entirely convincingly and apparently to the bemusement of lynch – that scissor sisters will present themselves in a way thats a little more grown up a little less ramshackle muppetfest the problem is that the scissor sisters have somehow contrived to launch an album and a world tour at the same time as their frontmans first musical goes into production an adaptation of armistead maupins tales from the city hes written in collaboration with the team behind the smash broadway muppetfest avenue q its scheduled to open next spring in san fransisco after three years in development the moneys come to the table so now its real its getting serious which is actually kind of frightening its a musical musical its not a rock musical i havent approached it like a pop star this isnt – he wrinkles his nose – u2 writing a spiderman musical i think the best thing about it is that its got all my leanings towards musical theatre out and i cant thank you enough for letting all your musical theatre out there rather than on the new album says lynch heavily this is it turns out a pretty representative exchange between the two a decade on from their legendary first meeting in a new york gay club on halloween lynch in fancy dress modelled on the superstars of indeterminate talent who populated andy warhols factory in the 60s shears – then a stripper at a bar called ic guys – as a lateterm backalley abortion their conversation is somewhere between that of a long married couple and a vaudeville crosstalk act they bicker about the bands stage show their history the history of new york and today at least they make for a striking visual study in contrasts shears extremely handsome in a very cleancut allamerican way is dressed down in jeans lynch on the other hand is resplendent in designer dress false lashes you could comfortably land a helicopter on eyeliner out to here and heels down to there a look which has earned her her own following of lovestruck admirers – who refer to themselves as anasexuals – within the bands pantheon of fans although shes keen to point out that she only looks like this because of an imminent photoshoot and is perfectly capable of walking around glastonbury with her husband unnoticed – if i dont want to be recognised i will not be recognised i am that powerful a witch – their appearances seem to reflect their personalities at least while the dictaphone is on while youre clearly never going to get him mixed up with a former member of oasis shears is less camp and more earnest than you might expect of a man who recently posed for a magazine photoshoot naked save for a sailors cap lynch on the other hand has the unmistakable highspeed wisecracking speech patterns of a woman who has spent a lot of time hanging around gay men in the past she has described her immersion in gay culture as an attempt to understand her father who came out when she was a toddler and died of an aidsrelated illness when she was 15 if you search the internet you can find a website that collects her more memorable outbursts stop booing the heteros she told one audience if it wasnt for them your gay asses wouldnt be here she has a propensity to puncture some of shearss more sober pronouncements with oneliners three albums in they still make being in a multimillionselling pop band seem like incredible fun which is a rarer state of affairs than you might expect they dont complain about the workload or the pressures of fame or any of the things pop bands past a certain point tend to make heavy weather of no theyre not bothered about scissor sisters failure to replicate their european success in america i always say that our success in america is ordinary and our success everywhere else is extraordinary because it feels that way offers lynch no they dont put said failure down to homophobia or a prevalent feeling among us rock audiences that disco still sucks dave grohl really likes us they dont even make the recording of night work sound that tough although it clearly was midway through the sessions with an album i didnt feel was both right or very good nearly completed shears elected to vanish to berlin in what he calls a symbolic move neglecting to tell anyone where he was going i ran out of new york before anybody knew i was gone which was very exciting i felt bad for my boyfriend poor chris everybody thought id left him which was sad for him but he was very supportive i just had a really great time i met a lot of musicians i love i made a lot of new friends i went out a lot and just partied i felt like a kid again in new york id started to feel like an old lady i was doing the same routine every day living in tri be ca which is mommy central with financial analysts around you at all times i knew berlin was a place where i could go out dancing and hear good techno and get up to whatever it was i felt like getting up to at any particular time of day sign up for the sleeve notes email music news bold reviews and unexpected extras read more while in berlin he came up with an entirely new concept for the album based around the music that predominated in early 80s clubland and in britain at least the charts 1984 was the year when the top 40 went howlingly unrepentantly gay in a way never seen before or since the big new artists were frankie goes to hollywood and bronski beat the hot new indie band was the smiths an array of highenergy records – where is my man sung by of all people eartha kitt so many men so little time i need a man its raining men searchin i gotta find a man you think youre a man – shifted vast quantities that music worked universally i think the trick is that sexuality whether its gay sexuality or not is a universal thing i mean everyone gets horny i dont think it really matters what kind of sex is being sung about because i think it still applies to everyone its as if the party kind of stopped and its no coincidence that happened hand in hand with aids it set back the gay rights movement in a major way i think were just moving past this 25year setback it placed a big judgment call on the gay club scene suddenly there was a big oh you had it coming i just started wondering where music was headed where dance music would have headed where all that would have gone and night work is my hypothesis the result is a noticeably harder and darker album than the familyfriendly dancefloor euphoria associated with scissor sisters it arrives wrapped in a sleeve featuring a taut pair of male buttocks features a demonic frankiestyle voiceover from sir ian mc kellen did he nail it straightaway oh yeah you know what even if he wouldnt have what are you going to say sorry you need to do that again and in a metaphor you hardly need a degree in the semiotics of rock lyrics to decode a song in which a serial killer stalks the dancefloor with its fixation on clubland and hymning of a mythic lost past its tempting to view night work as the product of a stadiumfilling band pining for a time before the platinum records and brits appearances when they were famed only as a fixture in new yorks more outré gay clubs but lynch looks a bit horrified at the suggestion do i miss being a club band in new york no fuck no we had a problem in new york that was very similar to the problems we had in america subsequently the electroclash scene was going on and we were a unicorn it was all like who is this weird band playing guitars we were busting out this like honkytonk music nods shears he thinks for a moment actually i do miss those days lynch frowns i would say we look back fondly but not wistfully not in the slightest it was fun protests shears it was a lot of fun concedes lynch after a pause i havent had a drink poured down my pants while i was on stage since talk turns to their forthcoming world tour but that just seems to set them off arguing again lynch has already had ideas for elaborate staging – the first time i heard invisible light i had a very clear idea of what i wanted to have happen in one part of the song – and responds to a question about whether theyd like to perform without the associated glitz and razzmatazz with a baffled pardon me shears on the other hand insists weve never been outrageous on stage which with the best will in the world seems a slightly odd conclusion to draw given his costumes and lynchs betweensong banter collected at the aforementioned website there arent a lot of tits on the radio but theres certainly a lot of cunts i mean weve always had big shows or whatever shears says perhaps noticing my confused expression but weve never had …its never been about dancers or choreography says lynch or pyrotechnics and i hope it never will be he frowns actually there may be some pyrotechnics there will definitely be some pyrotechnics nods lynch shears exhales im less compelled at the moment to like be crazy on stage seeing as everybody else is now yeah well snorts lynch thanks to us i just wore jeans in our first video for this record says shears and it was fucking awesome im wearing a lot of denim lynch looks mortified i am not she says firmly
