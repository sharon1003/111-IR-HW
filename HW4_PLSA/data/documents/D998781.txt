the only two writing tips you’ll ever need read and write posted by melissa donovan on may 30 2017 ·read and writei love collecting writing tips you never know when you’re going to stumble across a golden nugget of wisdom that will make your writing richer and more vibrant one of the reasons i started this website was so that i could share the many valuable tips that i’ve acquired over the years i figure that if some bit of advice helped my writing it’ll probably help other people’s as well but writing tips are funny things what works for me might not work for you maybe you’re naturally inclined to show rather than tell whereas i need someone to say “show don’t tell” or maybe you only write nonfiction and have no use for tips on creating believable characters or riveting plots maybe you only write farout abstract poetry and could care less about good grammar we writers are a varied bunch with different needs goals and standards but we all do have one thing in common we write and because we all write there are a couple of writing tips that apply to each and every one of us in fact i’d argue that there are just two things that every writer absolutely must do in order to succeed“if you want to be a writer you must do two things above all others read a lot and write a lot” – stephen king stephen king’s statement is one of my favorite quotes on writing it should be repeated often and expressed in as many ways as possible writers must read writing begins with reading it is through reading that we learn how to tell stories how to choose words and craft sentences the books we read will inform and inspire the books we’ll write and there’s a lot we can learn from the authors who have gone before us how can we write if we don’t read if you’re not well read it will show in your writing more than once i’ve reviewed written work and asked the author “do you read much” almost always the answer is exactly what i guessed if the writing flows effortlessly the writer reads a lot if the writing is jagged confusing and amateurish then the writer is not a big reader can you imagine a musician who never listens to music a film director who doesn’t watch movies these are the arts you’re in it because you love it with fierce passion you’re going to need that passion if you want to get anywhere and you’re going to have to be immersed in the art to which you aspire for writers that means reading lots and lots of reading and if you read voraciously you’ll reap the benefits you’ll naturally grow your vocabulary and pick up better language skills you’ll learn new information or be entertained by books articles and stories you’ll be able to speak intelligently about literature and writing you’ll observe a cacophony of styles and your own voice will emerge your grammar spelling and punctuation will improve drastically especially if you have high reading standards there are many more writerly perks that come from reading can you think of any to add writers write it goes without saying yet it has to be said again and again if you want to be a writer you must write but how much must you write according to neurologist daniel levitin to become a true master at anything one must put in 10000 hours“in study after study of composers basketball players fiction writers iceskaters concert pianists chess players master criminals this number comes up again and again ten thousand hours is equivalent to roughly three hours a day or 20 hours a week of practice over 10 years… no one has yet found a case in which true worldclass expertise was accomplished in less time it seems that it takes the brain this long to assimilate all that it needs to know to achieve true mastery “ – daniel levitin allow me to repeat the time it takes 10000 hours — three hours per day or 20 hours per week for ten years that’s to become a master writer maybe you just want to be a published writer in either case you’re going to have to do a whole lot of writing take a few minutes today to think about how many hours you’ve spent writing or reading or both a few hundred a few thousand maybe you’re halfway there maybe you’ve passed the finish line and just need to start putting your work out there there’s no point sitting around daydreaming about becoming a writer thinking someday i’ll write that novel someday is here someday was yesterday it’s today and it’s tomorrow someday is right now so start writing — today and every day learn from the masters stephen king is an accomplished writer he has sold an estimated 300350 million copies of his novels and
