nursing pay rates explained posted by tera tuten on september 24 2015online lists stating the average pay for nurses nationwide can vary wildly and often suggest that huge rises or drop have occurred but what’s the final word on how and what nurses actually get paid under various circumstances we take a look at the most uptodate numbers and what the statistics can – and can’t – tell us pay scales low ranges while some lowerpaying states average in the 20s for perhour pay stats show that some areas within the top ten highest paying states also average as low as 2675 this raises the question that these lists may not be averaging just rn pay into these salary numbers a registered nurse working at a big city hospital – on average – can earn about 40hour though a licensed practical nurse in a smalltown rest home might not make half that wage it’s important to remember that hourly wages don’t reflect the extra hours and higher pay of overtime which almost all nurses work voluntarily andor as part of their contract “as needed” we spotted one salary site poster who identified themselves as an rn say “you might have to work 80 hours a week but even at 2025hour you can still bring in 100k a year”pay scales high ranges nursing in america is a vast profession covering millions of people employed in thousands of different positions and hundreds of job types a chief nurse anesthetist can make more than 160000 a year five times what some lpns bring home in the same time keep in mind that while some scales may be brought down in average hourly pay by including lpns with rns other scales from job sites and the like may be raised by including numbers from higherpaid senior and specialist nurses these lists also tend to be perpetuated over many other sites and blogs which may not verify the source or accuracy of the information for themselves or put the information in its proper context location location location as of may 2014 the bls reported that rn salaries across various states varied massively but according to these latest stats the average american rn makes about 32 an hour or about 66000 a year however rns working in the highest paying states can earn far more than nurses elsewhere and among the highestpaying regions of those states rns can earn even more for example while the median pay for rns in california is 4638hour or about 96470year rns in the modest
