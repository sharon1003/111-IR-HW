the lowdown on cruise ship gratuities tips should be discretionary so why do most cruise lines levy a daily surcharge for gratuities4 comments anonymous cruise editor april 18 2013the protocols for offering gratuities to waiters hotel maids and others in the service industry can vary considerably by country so it’s a bit of a relief to know that between the eight major lines serving north american cruisers no matter where they sail they share fairly consistent guidelines for tipping in general cruise lines expect you to leave a tip of 1150 to 12 a day per person to cover services by your cabin attendants and waiters a somewhat higher tip might be recommended for those staying in suites the cruise lines keep the process relatively simple by adding these “autogratuities” to your shipboard account distributing the tips behind the scenes not including mandatory service charges for beverages the autogratuity for two can total around 168 on a typical sevenday cruise gratuities should be discretionary if you feel the service you received fell short go to the front desk and have the tip reduced if the service was great you can also request to have gratuities increased or leave an additional cash tip for a particularly deserving individual keep in mind most cruise ship workers are paid substantially lower wages than most americans working in service industries and tips usually represent a substantial portion of their monthly income other places where tipping comes into play or not drinks — expect a 15 percent service charge to be added not only to bar bills but
