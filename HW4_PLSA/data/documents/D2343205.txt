voice50 out of 5 stars well crafted easy to play very accessible japanese rpgjuly 17 2013platform sony psp edition standard verified purchase i thought my review might be of some use as im not a gigantic fan of japanese rpgs and probably most people aware of this game or writing reviews for it are i love sakaguchis gamesthe final fantasy series lost odyssey chrono trigger i like a lot of nintendos rpgsthe mario rpgpaper mariomario  luigi games but thats about it i dont like disgea dont like dark souls nor tales nor final fantasy tactics etc i sometimes go years between japanese rpg releases that i care about so i almost skipped persona 3 it sounded like an off brand probably overly complicated boring to me game i mean it has a focus on relationships between characters and i despise the talking to the villagers part of an rpg i just figured it would be another game hyped by hardcore jrpg players that i end up not being able to stand the giant bomb guys playing through persona 4 is one of the few reasons i gave it a shotand im glad i did under the surface the game really has much of the familiar in a good way japanese rpg structure youve got your dungeons your npcs to talk to your equipment upgrades your levels and magic and stats despite a lot of changessome superficial some notits still very much a traditional japanese rpg in some respects and i like that the game also does a great job introducing elements of its gameplay over time it eases you into it as the best games do so that if you can play a final fantasy or a mario  luigi youll have no problem understanding this either they do a great job of that where the game differs most is that instead of exploring a big world going from town to town it mostly takes place in one city in a set number of locations one of the big aspects to the game is actually time management every day that passes gives you the opportunity to do a limited number of things and basically every month ends with a boss battle so there fun and a bit of panic trying to figure out what of the many things you can do to do there are a set number of characters you can have relationships withmost but not all are also members of your groupparty that you take into battle these characters may ask you out after school or they may be in a hallway or the like with an explanation point over their heads etc there are 10 levels to each relationship and each character has a story associated with them thats generally pretty interesting every time the relationship levels up you get extra experience points when fusing personasokay all that sounds complicated but its really not in the game and the game explains it all very well as you go along basically personas are kind of like summons in final fantasybasically all magic in the game is being done by a persona though effectively its no different than casting magic in other jprgs every playable character in the game has one except your protagonist who can use a ton of different personas you can combine peronas together to make other more powerful ones and when you do the persona gets extra experience points if you have levels in the relationship corresponding to that personawhich again all sounds complicated when i write it out but in practice is super easy to understand thankfully early on i found a persona i really liked as it gave me a bunch of healing magic so ive just kept using it for most of the game im not sure thats the correct way to play but the game hasnt punished me for just using the same one and she continues to level up along with me so shes probably not as powerful as i could get if i used that fusion system more but isnt a wimp either the games main story revolves around the dark houra period of time at 12am that most people dont experience but which the games main characters do basically every day during the dark hour the high school turns into a giant tower the games dungeon in effect most nights you can choose to go to the tower and the dark hour stays in effect as long as youre there basically every month you can only explore up to a set point in the towerand youll want to do so so that your characters level up so that youre powerful enough for the boss battle at the end of the month there are usually also rescue missions every month where you can optionally rescue someone trapped in the tower that gives you a good excuse to go back and end up leveling up a bit more the towers design isnt really very interesting its all randomly generated and the floors of the tower basically just use one texture set for 20 or 30 floors or whatever not the most exciting dungeon design but it gets the job done the bosses you face basically once a month may have a more custominteresting area youre in i think that im almost at the end of the game so i may have more thoughts about all this once i finish im about at the end of the first year its worth mentioning that there are actually three different versions of persona 3 the original playstation 2 release persona 3 fes and this persona 3 portable which is the newest version my understanding is that fes added an epilogue to the main game but that its not very good not really worth much the two playstation 2 versions also have animated sections that were cut from the psp version though the sequences are still there just not in animated form theres still at least one animated cut scene in the psp version though and its worth noting that all or almost all important dialog is fully voiced in the psp version the psps discs only hold 19gb versus 9 or so gb for dvd which is presumably why animation was cut down the voice acting is good or at least good by japanese rpg standards it does help bring the characters to life the psp version replaced a lot of the 3d art from the ps2 versions with really high quality 2d art imo thats a good thing as their 2d art is great and high resolution while the 3d art both on ps2 and psp ismuch lower quality and a bit more super deformedlook on the psp version you really only see the 3d art when in towers and in battlesthe rest of the time youre getting high quality 2d hand drawn backgrounds and characters which is a definite improvement the game also replaced wandering around randomly in the environment with little indicators for people or objects in the environment you can interact with so you can quickly zoom a cursor over the area it serves the same use as walking over to something but just speeds up the game theres also a quick menu you can pull up to zoom around to other locations despite all the relationship stuff and the like the game feels really fast playing though of course its also long so youll still be spending a lot of time with it another change is the option to play as a male or female protagonist which has some i think mostly minor changes to the story and dialogand i guess in one place even gameplay slightly for a variety of reasons i went with a girl and to am really glad to have had that choice and if nothing else i like her art better than the guy version of the protagonist im not sure how much if at all the musics been changed but personally i love the music in persona 3 portable its pretty much all high quality but really different from typical japanese rpg musicthere are a lot of imo fun raps in there eveni particularly enjoy the basic battle music not everyone may like it but i think its all fun and high quality and different than anything else it also doesnt sound compressed at all nor do character voices unlike what you might expect from say a 3ds cartridge game one huge change to the psp versions battle systemwhich will probably make the difference in and of itselfthe psp one lets you have direct control of all characters the two ps2 versions only control your main character and the others are cpu controlled i find that super annoying so quickly switched to manual control so really the only downside i see to the psp version is that theres animation cut all the other changes are upgrades imo personally ill take a portable version of a game anyway if its not much worse or better so for me the choice between versions is super easy its worth noting too that that game lets you install part of it i didnt try it without the install but with it load times are super shortfaster than cartridge games often are hope im not forgetting anything and i tried not to say much about the story but anyway if youre like mea casual japanese rpg fan who maybe enjoys final fantasy or paper mario but not much else dont be scared of this game its very easy to play doesnt have a crazy hard difficulty level and has an interesting and very unique story and some very unique gameplay twists i think surprisingly the hype for it was actually justifiedits a clear cut above most jrpgs a bit different and well crafted after a few days playing persona 3 i went ahead and bought persona 4 golden for vita the vita version of 4 has upgraded visuals among some other tweaksplus its portableso again it seems like an easy choice i wont know until i play it but before playing either the setting of 4 appealed to me more than 3s that said im really glad i played 3 and im also a bit worried that i wont like the structure of 4 as much as p3ps streamlined overworld structure read more comment 5 people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no report abuse merchantof venice88850 out of 5 stars 5 starsjune 1 2015platform sony psp edition standard verified purchase i feel weird giving it 5 stars but not write anything its a great version of persona 3 itself a great game although the lack of 3d models is a loss for many and the lack of anime cutscenes is a loss for me personally i found p3p to be more streamlined and better maybe not better more tightly paced than p3fes a couple of things stood out to me i played p3p before fes and i did not adequately appreciate the skill cards until i no longer had them speaking to team members individually to check status and change equipment seems immersive until about the dozenth time then i wish i had p3ps interface to see everything for everyone on the fly this may be my imagination because i remember the end of p3p but only the beginning of fes but everyone seems to tire more easily in fes which made me realize how lucky i was to level my p3p personas to my hearts content on the other hand when i play fes i feel more involved i need to plan things out better i need to live with greater restrictions on resources like time and persona p3p improves gameplay in several ways so it is a better game but perhaps making it a better game also makes it a lesser experience comment 3 people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no report abuse r pickman vine voice top 500 reviewer30 out of 5 stars love and hate on a single umdjuly 25 2014platform sony psp edition standard verified purchase ive been gaming for decades and i can honestly say that no remake has polarized me to the extent of p3p i love and hate this game so much let me preface before you read any further if you have never played any iteration of persona 3 and are looking for a genrebending unique rpg with an amazing story and hours of gameplay buy this game do it now and you will not regret it if you have played persona 3 andor persona 3 fes on the ps2 keep reading i love essentially everything about persona 3 on the ps2 the animated cutscenes are a phenomenal way to tell the story and set the tone for the game running around the town and the school talking to people and hanging out building social links etc is a ton of fun and breaks up the dungeon crawling play persona 3 or 4 enough and youll actually begin to think you went to high school in japan graphically persona 3 still holds up great i love the style music is outstanding and varied these are also the reasons i hate persona 3 portable beautiful animated cutscenes have been replaced with moving stills and ingame cutscenes the intro loses so much of the ambience and the tension in the scene where the first shadow is on the roof is all but gone really disappointing running around town and the school is now replaced with an isometric map and sprites representing people all this is navigated in point and click fashion yeah it speeds things up a bit but it also really takes you out of the game graphically the game has been downgraded to psone quality smooth models are now aliased and very rough its just all together a shame graphics arent everything but when ive spent countless hours playing the ps2 versions and remember exactly how they look i just cant overcome the downgrade in image quality voice acting and soundtrack have remained largely the same whats the problem then just dont play it  youre probably shouting at your screen right now well the problem is that they made so many improvements to gameplay and mechanics and they added several new things stat cards and the female protagonist to name only a couple that this is in many ways the definitive version of the game it is absolutely maddening i want to play the game and enjoy it and i do enjoy all the added features and fixes however theres this constant nagging in my gut because i know the game should look better than this and i know that this should be a gorgeous cutscene instead of lowpoly models acting it out in summation if youve never played the ps2 titles dont play this instead and youll most likely love it and have no idea what youre missing if youve played the other versions just know that while this will exceed your expectations in many regards youll definitely feel that some areas have been severely watered down to accommodate the limited umd sizepsp hardware i really wish they wouldve released this as a digital only to eliminate the size constraints or held off until the vita because p4 golden is a masterpiece and only serves to make you feel worse about p3p because you know what it couldve been read more comment 9 people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no report abuse see all 149 reviews write a customer review customer images
