while he is relaxing usually sponge bob interrupts him next to his dream to become a renowned clarinet player he dreams of having hair as he is quite sensitive about his baldness which due to his egotistical nature he will not admit however in  the original fry cook  it is revealed that squidward used to have flowing blond hair while talking to jim about life squidward said he might possibly

the act and gives away everything he ownsin pizza delivery the customer of the first and only krusty krab pizza slams the door in sponge bobs face he starts crying and squidward tries to see if sponge bob is ok but he gets no answer squidward marches to the door and throws the pizza into the customers face to make sponge bob feel better earlier in the episode squidward pushes sponge bob out of the way of a 16wheeler after a failed attempt at hitchhiking in fools in april when squidward plays a mean prank on sponge bob on april fools day he runs out of the krusty krab crying squidward makes many attempts to apologize to him but all of them fail miserably when he remembers the things said to him earlier he is forced to apologize to sponge bob properly in breath of fresh squidward squidward is shocked by his own electric fence that was supposed to keep sponge bob and patrick out causing him to be nice to the two until sponge bob yells at him for pogo dancing with patrick causing squidward to go back to his fence when he tries to open it he gets shocked again sponge bob decides to apologize and grabs onto squidwards hand for a handshake and gets shocked too patrick who joins him grabs on to sponge bobs hand stating i wanna dance funny too and gets shocked as well squidward reverts to his regular self but sponge bob and patrick share his grouchy traits as well and they all argue with each other in dying for pie when sponge bob eats a pie thats actually a bomb that squidward buys for employee brotherhood day from pirates even though the rules say you have to make the gift mr krabs says that hes only got until sunset before the piebomb hits his lower intestine causing him to explode squidward tries to call the hospital but mr krabs says it wont do any good he calls the hospital anyway the person on the phone tells him the same thing mr krabs does he tries to tell sponge bob next but mr krabs says not to because thatll only make him feel worse the lad deserves his final hours squidward starts to feel really sorry for sponge bob agrees with mr krabs and promises to make sponge bobs final hours the best hes ever had he then declares that this time theres gonna be love so much hes gonna drown in it so squidward decides to do things with sponge bob that the sponge has on his list of fun things that he likes to do one of them being watch the sunset with squidward squidward builds a brick wall between him and sponge bob so he wont get injured by the explosion the piebomb hits sponge bobs lower intestine and squidward knows its only a matter of time before he explodes sponge bob likes to count down until the sun sets he starts with five and leaves squidward to do the rest buddy squidward counts to one but the sun doesnt set he tries again but as the sun sets day turns to night and squidward gets to three sponge bob explodes and he cries he says at least i was able to make his last few hours meaningful i am such a good person suddenly a second explosion occurs and the brick wall falls on squidward sponge bob is alive and blowing bomb bubbles squidward gets out from under the wall and reveals that sponge bobs explosion was what hes been waiting for he also explains the piebomb to him because he didnt understand which pie he was talking about however the piebomb wasnt eaten by sponge bob who had been saving it for them to share meaning squidward did all that stuff for nothing however sponge bob trips on a rock causing him to throw the piebomb in squidwards face of course it explodes and the entire town is destroyed in idiot box sponge bob and patrick buy a tv so that they can play with the box their first adventure is mountain climbing the noise bothers squidward who took the tv and came outside to find the remote it came with he kicks the box causing an avalanche squidward actually worried for the two touches the box causing a second avalanche when he hears sponge bob and patrick talking about cutting off frozen body parts with a saw he opens the box to check on them but theyre perfectly fine and not in a cold mountain setting the squid then reverts to his angry and grouchy self technically this counts because squidward was worried about them hed usually not care about them and leave them alone in graveyard shift right before the hashslinging slasher attacks them squidward admits despite what he says to sponge bob all the time that hes always sort of liked him right before sponge bob tells squidward that he used his clarinet to unclog his toilet squidwards schemes to get rid ofaway from sponge bob andor patrick in naughty nautical neighbors squidward makes sponge bob and patrick become enemies so he thinks there are no problems anymore now sponge bob and patrick want to be his best friend so squidward gets the contrary of his idea in opposite day squidward is going to move out however the controller is going to check if there are no perturbing neighbors otherwise he must not move so that sponge bob and patrick do not disturb the controller he invents the opposite day but sponge bob and patrick think they are squidward as the controller thinks there are three squidward’s she refuses the move in sb129 squidward wants to play the clarinet without sponge bobs and patricks noise so he absconds and goes to the krusty krabs freezer shortly after he is frozen and unfreezes 2000 years later he does not want to stay there and with a time machine he moves in the past and at the end he was in the middle of nowhere and he recognizes he cannot live without sponge bob and patrick in squids day off mr krabs arms are broken so he gives his job to squidward squidward benefits this chance to be as far as possible from sponge bob however whilst sponge bob in the krusty krab works and squidward in his house squidward thinks of ways sponge bob will destroy the krusty krab which would get him in trouble in squidville squidward moves to tentacle acres so that squidward is

card trick while sponge bob does this squidward gets on the bus and disappeared sometimes later he returns and immediately he absconds a second time in sponge bob vs patty gadget squidward has a
