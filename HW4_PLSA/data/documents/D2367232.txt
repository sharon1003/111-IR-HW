use to drill a 3 deck screw through one 2x4 into another 2x4 i have seen a miliion charts all saying different things im assuming 3 deck screws are 8 screws is this correct going by that most charts say to use a 332 or 764 drill bit for me this is close to impossible the screw will barely go in sqeaking like crazy and constantly slipping ive used a 18 but that stills seems extremely difficult a 532 worked much better but im worried that pilot hole is too big and it wont hold well im building a workbench i bought these phillips ii plus premium exterior 3 deck screws from lowes im trying to use they have some type of evercote coating on the screws thanks remove advertisements sponsored links diychat roomcom advertisement01152010 1131 pm  2joed super moderator join date mar 2005location

will defeat the purpose try rolling or drilling the screws into a little candle wax or parafin canning type wax first if they really scream i usually keep an old candle from the table in my box do you have a screwdriver with enough torque that lumber sounds less than kiln dried too cheap box store screws last edited by user1007 01162010 at 0243 am  remove advertisements sponsored links diychat

points 500view pypers album it sounds like youre driving them by hand  is that the case 3 deck screws can be driven with a screwdriver but its a workout you can drill a hole almost as large as the shank without altering the screws ability to hold you can spray the screws with wd40 if youre not painting and theyll go in easier soap works too if you dont have parafin01162010 0748 am  6user1007too

but no one mentioned what size exactly someone mentioned a small hole wouldnt hurt but im not sure how small thats why i was asking also about the pilot hole being the diameter of the screw yes i understand that but there are a few drill bits that seem pretty close to the diameter so i wasnt sure which one to use maybe its not a cut and dry thing and thats fine but for a beginner like myself i wanted to be sure before i damaged my workpiece01162010 0956 am  10user1007too short cut it againjoin date sep 2009posts 9634 rewards points 2000view user1007s album i still think you will find with some wax on your screws you are worrying about nothing use the drill smallest that you have if you are going to dirll a pilot hole the concept of a pilot hole is to provide but a path for the screw smaller the better the screw will find the path if you are putting them in by hand take frequent breaks if with a power tool take a break too if they freeze on you get real screws from a fastener or hardware store if yours keep freezing up on you lowes sells crap would not buy fasteners from them unless they were the last on earth01162010 1010 am  11goldglv member join date jun 2009posts 69

652 rewards points 500view brokenknees album the only place i ever drill pilot holes is close to the end to prevent the wood from splitting it is not necessary to drill holes in the field of the wood the size i drill one a little smaller than the screw just hold the screw up to the bit and make sure it is not larger than the shank of the screw as already mentioned of course the drill bit i want is the one that is always missing clarity to agreement dennis prager picturephoto pitchercarafe  wheresomeplace werebe01162010 1042 am  13daniel holzman civil engineer join date mar 2009location boston posts 5833 rewards points 5246view daniel holzmans album screws have two diameters that are normally discussed the diameter of the threads is known as the thread diameter big surprise there and is the diameter you would measure if you put a micrometer to the screw and measured from thread to thread the diameter of the shank the unthreaded part of the screw is known as the root diameter if you have a thin micrometer you can measure that as well else you can estimate it pretty closely by putting up a nail of known diameter against the screw and checking to see if the root diameter of the screw is the same as the diameter of the nail by eye you want to drill a pilot hole that is the root diameter of the screw in the case of tapered screws you would drill a pilot hole that is approximately the average root diameter on some screws the box will actually list the thread diameter and root diameter but this is unusual for certain types of screws specifically concrete screws the box will often contain a drill bit of the correct diameter for installation of the screws if the pilot is too large you lose pull out strength if too small it is hard to install the screw and you risk breaking the screw off during installation in addition to the suggestions previously offered since you are using an electric driver on a relatively long screw you can reverse the screw direction about halfway through the install then finish the install this often works to reduce the chance of breaking the screw off01162010 0232 pm  14kevin mbeam me up scottiejoin date nov 2009location omaha ne posts 194

book to see if there is a fastenahl store nearby those folks have every type of fastener known to man and all are generally high quality as for those holes  just about any pilot hole is just about as good as any other so long as the screw head doesnt fall in and note that your drilldriver is strong enough to drive those screws without any pilot holes  though your wrists might get a bit tired
