diatoms first diatoms are eukaryotes meaning they have true cells with a defined nuclei enclosed in a nuclear membrane since they are algae which are plants they carry out photosynthesis in cellular “organelles” called chloroplasts the received wisdom these days is that the eukaryotes arose from the symbiotic union of various prokayotes so that chloroplasts for example were probably once some sort of little round cyanobacteria that found it convenient to take up residence inside some larger prokaryotic cells second diatoms also called “bacillariophyta”  “stick plants” belong to the kingdom “ protoctista ”  “very first established” the protoctista “protists” for short collect all the eukaryotic microorganisms that used to be in individual groups like protozoa algae yeasts etc diatoms range considerably in size the largest species being about 2mm and the smallest being only a few micrometers long the “pennate” diatom shown below is a little over 200micrometers long such long skinny pennate diatoms are the most common form equally common is the gold or yellow color this is because they have a large amount of yellow carrotenoid pigment and xanthophyll pigment that masks the green color of their chlorophyll many diatoms are motile moving slowly but steadily motion can be useful if you live at the bottom of a pond and need to get from a dark areas to the sunlight diatoms are very difficult for us ordinary mortals to identify since their body plan is basically quite simple and they are pretty much all the same color the two tests fit together like the two parts of a petri plate and the assembly is called a “valve” essentially diatoms are either pennate or “centric” the valve of a centric diatom really looks like a petri plate since they are usually round from the top and flat when seen from the side taxonomists however are not to be foiled by simplicity they hit upon the idea of carefully examining the little bumps knobs holes slits ridges and whatnot in the silica of the tests if you strip out the goo inside so you can see the silica test clearly it turns out that every species of diatom has a unique pattern of these little “whatnots” oh my oh my… that makes life tough when you want to identify the living diatoms swimming around all full of colorful and unidentifiable goo it is a brave thing to identify a diatom by genus it is a foolhardy thing to attempt its species you will notice that i rarely identify diatoms when i do it is only to the genus level and it is because they have some attribute that makes it easy more or less… i live in fear that some taxonomist may tap me on the shoulder… here are a few pictures of diatoms these are some of the heron’s head salt marsh diatoms that are bit players in one or the salt marsh communities the diatoms shown live as individual freefloating cells some diatoms however link together to form colonies each such colony forms a filament melosira is a colonial diatom that can also define a microcommunity this macrophotograph shows filaments of melosira sp growing on the underside of a bay area boat dock in marin county often mistaken for “sea weed” melosira is actually a colonial diatom consisting of long filaments of individual diatoms linked together this is shown in the inset photomicrograph each filament is attached to the wood of the boat dock with many filaments forming a clump if you run your hand over this clump you quickly discover that it is not “slimy” as you would expect from “seaweed” but very rough in texture remember that the “shell” valve of each individual cell is composed of silica with many sharp edges you are literally running your hand over filaments covered in tiny bits of glass here is a filamentous colony of melosira from a sample taken at the heron’s head salt marsh at this magnification the individual melosira cells are shown in greater detail notice that each melosira valve is shaped like a little medicine capsule with the smaller test fitting inside of the larger test masses of melosira filaments frequently define a microcommunity that supports many other species of microorganisms each large clump of melosira filaments on the boat dock formed a community that supported many bacteria protozoa other diatoms and even some small bivalves similarly melosira defined the 2006 winter “mat” microcommunity at both the heron’s head park salt marsh and the bayfront park salt marsh community in those communities melosira formed velvetlike masses along the bottom of the salt marsh ponds replacing the cyanobacterial mat community of the summer shown below is a melosira colonial filament next to an ordinary filamentous green alga of the kind often described as “seaweed” 800x magnification each filament is composed of individual cells but the structure of the colonial diatom filament is markedly different from the “seaweed” filament of ordinary green algae cells the cell walls of the ordinary green algae are composed of cellulose not of silica and the algal filament is an organism not a colony of individual cells joined together as a filament this distinction is somewhat subtle since colonial growth of cells may be thought of as either an evolutionary step on the way to an organism or just a more primative form of organism to be continued…this entry was posted on thursday june 8th 2006 at 349 pm and is filed under  you can
