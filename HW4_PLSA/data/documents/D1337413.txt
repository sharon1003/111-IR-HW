hard at college page cohosted a radio show with his roommate charlie hines who remembers the time they spoofed the campus with a war of the worlds style hoax about drunken sorority sisters taking over the grounds their creativity extended to matters of the heart as they tried to talk coeds into spending the night by informing them a tornado was coming and their bathtub was the only safe place to ride out the storm it was an urban myth hines explains page may have been known for his wild antics but hines recognized davids innate sense of journalism after college page fulfilled that promise by taking a job at a tv station in phoenix where he developed a reputation as a tenacious reporter and a bit of a hothead he certainly didnt suffer fools gladly remembers ktar news director al buch i can see where he might butt heads with people who want to gloss over facts and do things on the short page produced investigative reports exposing medicaid supplemental insurance fraud and unsafe railroads in short order his work earned him promotions to larger markets it was in atlanta that pages career took a major left turn he had always been an onair correspondent but one day atlanta abc

bestselling bookstheres people that god intended to be on tv and people he didnt fisher told him in your case he didnt in the mid1980s page took a job as an overseas producer for nbc news where he won

star guy fieri had been a smalltime chef who won a reality show the next food network star earning him a development contract not knowing what to do with the pudgy prodigy network executives assigned him to pages fledgling project at first page worried that fieri would singlehandedly sink the show with his bleached goatee and indoor sunglasses fieri didnt resemble any host that food television had seen before but on that first day of shooting page quickly realized fieri was a diamond in the rough he has probably the most natural talent of any performer ive ever worked with page says still it didnt take long before fieri made his first rookie mistake he started making a lot of mob jokes about people being found dead in telephone booths page remembers page decided to get fieri in line before he made any more of a fool of himself youre not from here i am page lectured nobody here thinks thats funny fieri took the advice cut out the clowning and nailed the rest of his lines the show premiered in november 2006 to rave reviews it was intended to be a oneoff special the network had real doubts the gimmick could sustain itself through a whole season but fans fell in love the cameras brought viewers into the kitchens where they could almost smell the fried chicken and homemade biscuits no detail had escaped pages notice—hed spend hours in postproduction tuning the sound of clanking dishes and sizzling griddles television done properly is simply voyeurism page says most of all the audience loved fieri they laughed at his goofy oneliners and oddball charm guy proclaimed good diners flavortown praised meals as hot frisbees of fun and bragged that a great dish could be served on a flipflop and it would still taste good fieris onscreen talents and pages backroom production made for a formidable team in his 2008 book diners driveins and dives fieri called page a creative genius and declared page productions the best in the world but as his star power grew fieri stopped returning pages phone calls when nbc hired fieri to film the primetime game show minute to win it guy started canceling shoots with page a posse of friends—a bawdy band of homeboys with names like gorilla kleetus and dirty p—trailed guy everywhere and his manager tom nelson took to calling himself the consigliore the group became known as the garlic mafia and fieri styled himself as the mob boss almost everyone who becomes a star in television develops an abnormal sense of self page says in the worstcase scenario they become surrounded by sycophants who tell them everything they want to hear the relationship between fieri and page boiled over during a christmas special filmed in alaska it was october 2009 but to maintain the illusion that its christmas page asked everyone on set to dress for december fieri emerged from his trailer in shorts page fought his star talent and won guy wore long pants he says exasperated but it was a pyrrhic victory page wound up getting chewed out by fieri who threatened to complain to the network about who controls his wardrobe it was a slap in the face for page who had always prided himself on making fieri presentable you have to protect guy from all of his poop jokes page says anytime any woman mentioned cream guy went into a sexual riff when cutting the show you had to tell the editors to watch guys eye line because its always on breasts fieri also needed protection from homosexuals or at least advance warning early in the shows run page got a phone call from fieri whod just walked out of a restaurant in a huff guy had decided that the two men running the restaurant were life partners page remembers he said you cant send me to talk to gay people without warning those people weird me out from then on show researchers were required to note any indications of homosexuality detected during preinterviews fieri declined to comment for this story through his spokespeople former field producer kari kloster confirms that fieri made the odd demand about gay guests and says she witnessed the star become more controlling on set i spent over a year going on the majority of shoots as one of the field producers and it was very obvious to me very early on that i was one of the only field personnel who felt that i worked for david page says kloster now a vice president at page productions she remembers an afternoon of shooting when fieri ran late kloster went looking for fieri and found him camped out with the crew shooting promotional material for a project unrelated to diners some people who work in television fall into this excitement at the idea of thinking theyre close friends with the talent they get a kick out of having a celebrity on speed dial kloster says when you start to think you have that relationship with someone like that you tend to do what they want and lose sight of what your job is out there the infighting only intensified when it involved money the longer we shot the more he started taking financial liberties with our budget page says of fieri the final straw was a dispute over how to divide revenue from the bestselling diners driveins and dives books fieri had promised to split the proceeds instead fieri gave page productions nothing when the second book was commissioned fieri approached page to ask for access to some of the shows research material that led to an uncomfortable discussion over compensation page claims they were demanding tremendous research from my people and pictures but they didnt want to pay for them page says guy said to me you know its true jews are cheap food network representatives declined to address many of pages allegations but vice president of communications and public relations irika slavin denies the network removed page at fieris request guy fieri is and always has been a consummate professional and we look forward to continuing our work with him slavin says in a prepared statement our lawsuit with page productions has settled and we will have no further comment about it before the lawsuit was settled the network had much more to say in court papers according to the networks countersuit page can be blunt bordering on brutal in one email the network submitted as evidence page calls an employee a vile uninformed piece of shit another email refers to a colleague as one fucked up dumbass loser in a particularly dark passage page wishes death on an employee who disagrees with him i hope you die so i can dance on your fucking grave nobody who worked with page would confuse him for a shrinking violet acknowledges ian logan an editor at page productions passiveaggressive david is not you know where you stand with david at all times everyone who knows page has a story about a time he let them have it supervising producer drew sondeland remembers the bruising reception he got after he dropped the ball on a tape delivery he said some pretty harsh things sondeland says but it was a pretty big fuckup he explained why it was a big deal it wasnt just him screaming at me some employees have walked away disillusioned as page puts it theres a lot of people who couldnt cut it jayne ubl was almost one of them a grizzled veteran of television ubl worked on diners for nine months and says it almost destroyed her selfconfidence you get beat up ubl says after a number of months i started asking how did i get so terrible at this job head writer margaret elkins agrees pages criticism can create an existential crisis she wound up in pages doghouse last year and grew so tired of his haranguing that she finally had to confront him about it i said to david youve got to know youre killing me elkins recalls pages response was to get angry i cant believe you would tell me you think im an asshole he told her to pages credit he eventually settled down and apologized for his behavior that angry side is in full flower when it comes to the court battle page says the food networks lawsuit was an attempt at creating a revisionist history that he was fired for creating an intolerable workplace page calls it a convenient excuse to smear him food network host tom pizzica worked with page on another show outrageous foods and supports him pizzica says the problem was as much fieri as it was page i think it was just two people whose egos are very big and they cant be in the same room together pizzica says thats how people are in this industry a dozen writers editors and producers gather around page who holds court on a leather couch in a longfellow living room today is the premiere of a new episode of diners driveins and dives and page and his production crew want to see what its going to look like without them rumors flew that the show would be canceled after the food network ended its relationship with page productions but page handed over all the footage his team had shot for future programs including a couple of finished episodes the network gave the tapes to citizen pictures a denver studio to recut and repackage pages team is anxious to see how the food network will handle the credits the staff wonder if their hard work will be acknowledged as the show begins the crew grows silent fieri appears onscreen and the familiar jingle plays they laugh at fieris jokes for the first time theyre watching as outsiders then they realize that the new production studio hasnt used their soundtrack when the credits roll they see that their names have been deleted some in the room are baffled by the edit wondering why the network took a completed episode changed its sound and stripped their credits for page it takes all of his strength to remain magnanimous im not going to tell you the show sucked page offers it was different than we did it update response to guy fieris request for a correction comments
