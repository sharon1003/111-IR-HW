of all whenever you think you might be pregnant try not to stress out too much because that can make you be late also about pregnancy tests i believe you have to wait until you missed a period then take a test and if its negative but youre still worried try a few more in the following weeks replynini over a year agohi thanks for the reply i am late for my period 18 days late now reply guest over a year ago well i know that the 20 iu can detect 68 days after i dont know if this means 68 after intercourse or 68 days after you get pregnant but it can detect before you miss your period however if you keep getting negative and youre not getting your period you should really go to a doctor and get a blood test if its still negative you need to seek professional medical advice reply guest over a year ago im confused my boyfriend and i had unprotected sex and i took a pregnancy test 8 days later it came out negative i have a few pregnancy symptoms but not a lot did i test too early reply guest over a year ago hello there you know i came here to look for an answer to my questions too i have thesame problem exactly as you me  hubby had unprotected sex but used the viginal contraceptive foam the next morning but then now i am more than 1 week late for my period we did a pregnancy test the one that says early pregnancy test use right after you miss your period but we got the negative result but until now im still so late i was thinking that maybe the foam can cause the late of mentrual period and same as you i felt like i have some symtoms of pregnancy but not all or i might be just paranoid that feelings things you know i dont know what to do to but i told my husband that if ever after this month an not getting a period i will take another test and then if it still negative i will go to the doctor reply tiona m21675 over a year ago i think that i may be pregnant this will be my 5th pregnancy if i am anyway i have been having some symptoms like extreme fatigue moodiness irritability nausea i missed my period which is always late anyway but the home pregnacy test that i took was negative i mean i sometimes go through this little ritual right before i get pregnant i mean i just know that i am pregnant for like three months and i wont be and then i get really sick and then everyone starts to ask me if i am pregnant and through all of this i really am not and then like out of the blue like two weeks later i find out that i am pregnant it happens every time anyway ive taken a test and its negative but i know that i am pregnant i mean i can just feel it i was just wondering if anybody out there has ever been through anything similar reply guest over a year ago my husband and i had sex about close to 2 weeks ago we are trying to have another child how long do i have to wait to see if i am pregnant do i take a test the next day or the next couple of days we had sex when i was on my period does that help getting pregnant reply guest over a year ago you have to wait until you miss your period you cant just have sex and then a week later take the pregnancy test and expect anything to show up even if you get the most sensitive test out there you have to miss your period before anything will show up it is possible to get an early result but only about 4 or 5 days earlier than your missed period at best stop stressing thats probably whats causing your missed period if youre really worried about it go get a blood test done replymoonbeam71 over a year agocan anyone tell me if i ovulated and had sex on day 21 of my cycle when would a pregnancy test be reliable if my period is due just 7 days after the event and it has not arrivedreply guest over a year agohey i had sex with my boybriendwith out protection and the thing is that i lost my period chart and i can not remember when im supposed to get my period again is there a pregnancy test that i can take like days before sex to tell if im pregnant because most people say that you have to take the test after you missed your perios and i dont know when that would be reply guest over a year ago you need to take pregnancy tests only if you are late there really is no sense trying to take one before your period is late stressing out about being pregnant will make you late as well if you tested negative after taking a prengancy test try again a week later if your preiod doesnt show up stressing plays a big role i too did the same thing and yes you will even gather up pregnancy symtoms too if you think you are including sore breasts and nausea being the most common one so if you test negative and still no sign of your period take it again do not drink or smoke until you know for sure good luck reply guest over a year ago i see a few people out there that i have had similar experiences for one i have missed my period and i stressed out about it and then it was weeks late finally i got it but do try not to stress not only will it mess with your cycle it also has effects on a baby if you are pregnant and also it doesnt really help to have sex on your period if youre trying to get pregnant the woman is fertile during ovulation which occurs before your moon cycle usually a small degree rise in temperature and an egg like discharge are signs of ovulation a mans sperm can be alive for days so even if you had sex a day or so before you ovulate it would be possible for the sperm to still be alive and swimming to their goal i would get a blood test done if i had a missed period and was concerned about it my big question is that i am breastfeeding and i just spotted i havent got the results back yet from the blood test but i just realized that i had sex only 6 days before the blood test and am concerned that i may want to test again if it is negative but i do not have a period yet since i am breastfeeding so i think 10 days after conception the blood test is more than 99 percent accurate reply guest over a year ago tiona m wrote i think that i may
