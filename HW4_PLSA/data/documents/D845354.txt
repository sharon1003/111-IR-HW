hypothermia targeted temperature management icd10pcs 6a4me sh c18452394750ops301 code 8607  edit on wikidatatargeted temperature management  ttm previously known as therapeutic hypothermia or protective hypothermia is an active treatment that tries to achieve and maintain a specific body temperature in a person for a specific duration of time in an effort to improve health outcomes during recovery after a period of stopped blood flow to the brain 1 this is done in an attempt to reduce the risk of tissue injury following lack of blood flow 2 periods of poor blood flow may be due to cardiac arrest or the blockage of an artery by a clot as in the case of a stroke 3targeted temperature management improves survival and brain function following resuscitation from cardiac arrest 4 evidence supports its use following certain types of cardiac arrest in which an individual does not regain consciousness 1 both 33 °c 91 °f and 36 °c 97 °f appear to result in similar outcomes 5 6 targeted temperature management following traumatic brain injury has shown mixed results with some studies showing benefits in survival and brain function while others show no clear benefit 7 while associated with some complications these are generally mild 8targeted temperature management is thought to prevent brain injury by several methods including decreasing the brains oxygen demand reducing the production of neurotransmitters like glutamate as well as reducing free radicals that might damage the brain the lowering of body temperature may be accomplished by many means including the use of cooling blankets cooling helmets cooling catheters ice packs and ice water lavage contents  hide 1 medical uses11 cardiac arrest12 neonatal encephalopathy2 adverse effects3 mechanism4

external links medical uses  edittargeted temperature management may be used in the following conditions cardiac arrest  editthe 2013 ilcor and 2010 american heart association guidelines support the use of cooling following resuscitation from cardiac arrest 1 5 these recommendations were largely based on two trials from 2002 which showed improved survival and brain function when cooled to 32–34 °c 90–93 °f after cardiac arrest 2 9however more recent research suggests that there is no benefit to cooling to 33 °c 91 °f when compared with less aggressive cooling only to a nearnormal temperature of 36 °c 97 °f it appears cooling is effective because it prevents fever a common complication seen after cardiac arrest 10 there is no difference in long term quality of life following mild compared to more severe cooling 11neonatal encephalopathy  edithypothermia therapy for neonatal encephalopathy has been proven to improve outcomes for newborn infants affected by perinatal hypoxiaischemia hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy or birth asphyxia a 2013 cochrane review found that it is useful in full term babies with encephalopathy 12 whole body or selective head cooling to 33–34 °c 91–93 °f begun within six hours of birth and continued for 72 hours reduces mortality and reduces cerebral palsy and neurological deficits in survivors  citation neededadverse effects  editpossible complications may include infection bleeding dysrhythmias and high blood sugar 13 one review found an increased risk of pneumonia and sepsis but not the overall risk of infection 14 another review found a trend towards increased bleeding but no increase in severe bleeding 15 hypothermia induces a cold diuresis which can lead to electrolyte abnormalities  specifically hypokalemia hypomagnesaemia and hypophosphatemia as well as hypovolemia 16mechanism  editthe earliest rationale for the effects of hypothermia as a neuroprotectant focused on the slowing of cellular metabolism resulting from a drop in body temperature for every one degree celsius drop in body temperature cellular metabolism slows by 5–7 17 accordingly most early hypotheses suggested that hypothermia reduces the harmful effects of ischemia by decreasing the body’s need for oxygen 18 the initial emphasis on cellular metabolism explains why the early studies almost exclusively focused on the application of deep hypothermia as these researchers believed that the therapeutic effects of hypothermia correlated directly with the extent of temperature decline 19in the special case of infants suffering perinatal asphyxia it appears that apoptosis is a prominent cause of cell death and that hypothermia therapy for neonatal encephalopathy interrupts the apoptotic pathway in general cell death is not directly caused by oxygen deprivation but occurs indirectly as a result of the cascade of subsequent events cells need oxygen to create atp a molecule used by cells to store energy and cells need atp to regulate intracellular ion levels atp is used to fuel both the importation of ions necessary for cellular function and the removal of ions that are harmful to cellular function without oxygen cells cannot manufacture the necessary atp to regulate ion levels and thus cannot prevent the intracellular environment from approaching the ion concentration of the outside environment it is not oxygen deprivation itself that precipitates cell death but rather without oxygen the cell can not make the atp it needs to regulate ion concentrations and maintain homeostasis 18notably even a small drop in temperature encourages cell membrane stability during periods of oxygen deprivation for this reason a drop in body temperature helps prevent an influx of unwanted ions during an ischemic insult by making the cell membrane more impermeable hypothermia helps prevent the cascade of reactions set off by oxygen deprivation even moderate dips in temperature strengthen the cellular membrane helping to minimize any disruption to the cellular environment it is by moderating the disruption of homeostasis caused by a blockage of blood flow that many now postulate results in hypothermia’s ability to minimize the trauma resultant from ischemic injuries 18targeted temperature management may also help to reduce reperfusion injury damage caused by oxidative stress when the blood supply is restored to a tissue after a period of ischemia various inflammatory immune responses occur during reperfusion these inflammatory responses cause increased intracranial pressure which leads to cell injury and in some situations cell death hypothermia has been shown to help moderate intracranial pressure and therefore to minimize the harmful effects of a patient’s inflammatory immune responses during reperfusion the oxidation that occurs during reperfusion also increases free radical production since hypothermia reduces both intracranial pressure and free radical production this might be yet another mechanism of action for hypothermias therapeutic effect 18 overt activation of nmethyldaspartate nmda receptors following brain injuries can lead to calcium entry which triggers neuronal death via the mechanisms of excitotoxicity 20methods  editthere are a number of methods through which hypothermia is induced 13 these include cooling catheters cooling blankets and application of ice applied around the body among others 13 21 as of 2013 it is unclear if one method is any better than the others 21 while cool intravenous fluid may be given to start the process further methods are required to keep the person cold 13core body temperature must be measured either via the esophagus rectum bladder in those who are producing urine or within the pulmonary artery to guide cooling 13 a temperature below 30 °c 86 °f should be avoided as adverse events increase significantly 21 the person should be kept at the goal temperature plus or minus half a degree celsius for 24 hours 21 rewarming should be done slowly with suggested speeds of 01 to 05 °c 018 to 090 °f per hour 21targeted temperature management should be started as soon as possible 22 the goal temperature should be reached before 8 hours 21 targeted temperature management remains partially effective even when initiated as long as 6 hours after collapse 23prior to the induction of targeted temperature management pharmacological agents to control shivering must be administered when body temperature drops below a certain threshold—typically around 36 °c 97 °f—people may begin to shiver 24 it appears that regardless of the technique used to induce hypothermia people begin to shiver when temperature drops below this threshold 24 drugs commonly used to prevent and treat shivering in targeted temperature management include acetaminophen buspirone opioids including pethidine meperidine dexmedetomidine fentanyl andor propofol 25 if shivering is unable to be controlled with these drugs patients are often placed under general anesthesia andor are given paralytic medication like vecuronium people should be rewarmed slowly and steadily in order to avoid harmful spikes in intracranial pressure 23cooling catheters  editcooling catheters are inserted into a femoral vein cooled saline solution is circulated through either a metal coated tube or a balloon in the catheter the saline cools the person’s whole body by lowering the temperature of a person’s blood catheters reduce temperature at rates ranging from 15 to 2 °c 27 to 36 °f per hour through the use of the control unit catheters can bring body temperature to within 01 °c 018 °f of the target level furthermore catheters can raise temperature at a steady rate which helps to avoid harmful rises in intracranial pressure a number of studies have demonstrated that targeted temperature management via catheter is safe and effective 26 27 28 29 30adverse events associated with this invasive technique include bleeding infection vascular puncture and deep vein thrombosis dvt 31 infection caused by cooling catheters is particularly harmful as resuscitated people are highly vulnerable to the complications associated with infections 32 bleeding represents a significant danger due to a decreased clotting threshold caused by hypothermia the risk of deep vein thrombosis may be the most pressing medical complication deep vein thrombosis can be characterized as a medical event whereby a blood clot forms in a deep vein usually the femoral vein this condition may become potentially fatal if the clot travels to the lungs and causes a pulmonary embolism another potential problem with cooling catheters is the potential to block access to the femoral vein which is a site normally used for a variety of other medical procedures including angiography of the venous system and the right side of the heart however most cooling catheters are triple lumen catheters and the majority of people postarrest will require central venous access unlike noninvasive methods which can be administered by nurses the insertion of cooling catheters must be performed by a physician fully trained and familiar with the procedure the time delay between identifying a person who might benefit from the procedure and the arrival of an interventional radiologist or other physician to perform the insertion may minimize some of the benefit of invasive methods more rapid cooling  citation neededtransnasal evaporative cooling  edittransnasal evaporative cooling is a method of inducing the hypothermia process and provides a means of continuous cooling of a person throughout the early stages of targeted temperature management and during movement throughout the hospital environment this technique uses two cannulae inserted into a persons nasal cavity to deliver a spray of coolant mist that evaporates directly underneath the brain and base of the skull as blood passes through the cooling area it reduces the temperature throughout the rest of the body  citation neededthe method is compact enough to be used at the point of cardiac arrest during ambulance transport or within the hospital proper it is intended to reduce rapidly the persons temperature to below 34 °c 93 °f while targeting the brain as the first area of cooling research into the device has shown cooling rates of 26 °c 47 °f per hour in the brain measured through infrared tympanic measurement and 16 °c 29 °f per hour for core body temperature reduction 33 34water blankets  editwith these technologies cold water circulates through a blanket or torso wraparound vest and leg wraps to lower temperature with optimal speed 70 of a person’s surface area should be covered with water blankets the treatment represents the most well studied means of controlling body temperature water blankets lower a person’s temperature exclusively by cooling a person’s skin and accordingly require no invasive procedures  citation neededwater blankets possess several undesirable qualities they are susceptible to leaking which may represent an electrical hazard since they are operated in close proximity to electrically powered medical equipment 35 the food and drug administration also has reported several cases of external cooling blankets causing significant burns to the skin of person other problems with external cooling include overshoot of temperature 20 of people will have overshoot slower induction time versus internal cooling increased compensatory response decreased patient access and discontinuation of cooling for invasive procedures such as the cardiac catheterization 36if therapy with water blankets is given along with two litres of cold intravenous saline people can be cooled to 33 °c 91 °f in 65 minutes  citation needed most machines now come with core temperature probes when inserted into the rectum the core body temperature is monitored and feedback to the machine allows changes in the water blanket to achieve the desired set temperature in the past some of the models of cooling machines have produced an overshoot in the target temperature and cooled people to levels below 32 °c 90 °f resulting in increased adverse events they have also rewarmed patients at too fast a rate leading to spikes in intracranial pressure some of the new models have more software that attempt to prevent this overshoot by utilizing warmer water when the target temperature is close and preventing any overshoot some of the new machines now also have 3 rates of cooling and warming a rewarming rate with one of these machines allows a patient to be rewarmed at a very slow rate of just 017 °c 031 °f an hour in the automatic mode allowing rewarming from 33 °c 91 °f to 37 °c 99 °f over 24 hours cool caps  editthere are a number of noninvasive head cooling caps and helmets designed to target cooling at the brain 37 a hypothermia cap is typically made of a synthetic material such as neoprene silicone or polyurethane and filled with a cooling agent such as ice or gel which is either cooled to a very cold temperature −25 to −30 °c −13 to −22 °f before application or continuously cooled by an auxiliary control unit their most notable uses are in preventing or reducing alopecia in chemotherapy 38 and for preventing cerebral palsy in babies born with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy 39  needs update in the continuously cooled iteration coolant is cooled with the aid of a compressor and pumped through the cooling cap circulation is regulated by means of valves and temperature sensors in the cap if the temperature deviates or if other errors are detected an alarm system is activated the frozen iteration involves continuous application of caps filled with crylon gel cooled to −30 °c −22 °f to the scalp before during and after intravenous chemotherapy as the caps warm on the head multiple cooled caps must be kept on hand and applied every 20 to 30 minutes history  edithypothermia has been applied therapeutically since antiquity the greek physician hippocrates the namesake of the hippocratic oath advocated the packing of wounded soldiers in snow and ice 18 napoleonic surgeon baron dominique jean larrey recorded that officers who were kept closer to the fire survived less often than the minimally pampered infantrymen 18 in modern times the first medical article concerning hypothermia was published in 1945 18 this study focused on the effects of hypothermia on patients suffering from severe head injury in the 1950s hypothermia received its first medical application being used in intracerebal aneurysm surgery to create a bloodless field 18 most of the early research focused on the applications of deep hypothermia defined as a body temperature of 20–25 °c 68–77 °f such an extreme drop in body temperature brings with it a whole host of side effects which made the use of deep hypothermia impractical in most clinical situations this period also saw sporadic investigation of more mild forms of hypothermia with mild hypothermia being defined as a body temperature of 32–34 °c 90–93 °f in the 1950s doctor rosomoff demonstrated in dogs the positive effects of mild hypothermia after brain ischemia and traumatic brain injury 18 in the 1980s further animal studies indicated the ability of mild hypothermia to act as a general neuroprotectant following a blockage of blood flow to the brain this animal data was supported by two landmark human studies that were published simultaneously in 2002 by the new england journal of medicine 40 both studies one occurring in europe and the other in australia demonstrated the positive effects of mild hypothermia applied following cardiac arrest 9 responding to this research in 2003 the american heart association aha and the international liaison committee on resuscitation ilcor endorsed the use of targeted temperature management following cardiac arrest 41 currently a growing percentage of hospitals around the world incorporate the ahailcor guidelines and include hypothermic therapies in their standard package of care for patients suffering from cardiac arrest 40 some researchers go so far as to contend that hypothermia represents a better neuroprotectant following a blockage of blood to the brain than any known drug 24 over this same period a particularly successful research effort showed that hypothermia is a highly effective treatment when applied to newborn infants following birth asphyxia metaanalysis of a number of large randomised controlled trials showed that hypothermia for 72 hours started within 6 hours of birth significantly increased the chance of survival without brain damage 42research  editttm has been studied in several use scenarios where it has not been found to be helpful or is still under investigation stroke  editthere is currently no evidence supporting targeted temperature management use in humans and clinical trials have not been completed 43 most of the data concerning hypothermia’s effectiveness in treating stroke is limited to animal studies these studies have focused primarily on ischemic stroke as opposed to hemorrhagic stroke as hypothermia is associated with a lower clotting threshold in these animal studies hypothermia was represented an effective neuroprotectant 44 the use of hypothermia to control intracranial pressure icp after an ischemic stroke was found to be both safe and practical 45traumatic brain or spinal cord injury  editanimal studies have shown the benefit of targeted temperature management in traumatic central nervous system cns injuries clinical trials have shown mixed results with regards to the optimal temperature and delay of cooling achieving therapeutic temperatures of 33 °c 91 °f is thought to prevent secondary neurological injuries after severe cns trauma 46 a systematic review of randomised controlled trials in traumatic brain injury tbi suggests there is no evidence that hypothermia is beneficial 47neurosurgery  editas of 2015 hypothermia had shown no improvements in neurological outcomes or in mortality in neurosurgery 48see also  editdeep hypothermic circulatory arrest
