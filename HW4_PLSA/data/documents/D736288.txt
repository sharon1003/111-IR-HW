i was watching a tutorial on youtube where the tutor talked about various methods he talked about returning values in java but i didnt understand a thing about it i will first share the script and then share my thoughts and queries here is the class1 scriptimport java util scannerclass class1 public static void main  string args  system out println  this is class1 scanner x  new scanner  system in system out print  please enter the name of your first gf here string name  x next line class2 class2obj  new class2 class2obj setname  name class2obj tellname as you can see it is having the main method and what it does is  it first asks for the name of your first girlfriend and then store it in the variable name then it links the class2 script which i will share after this and executes the setname method in the class2 the class2 script isclass class2 private string girlnamepublic void setname  string name  girlname  namepublic string returnname  return girlnamepublic void tellname  system out printf  your first girlfriend was s returnname in class2 i can see that the setname method sets the value of the name to a private variable girlname but my question is that what is it returning why do we require the returnname method is it absolutely essential for intermethod variables also why isnt it posible to return the girlname in the setname method i dont know a thing about the return so a video or an article would help a lot also this is the reason if you find what i say above strange also please tell me what the returnname method and the tellname method is doing also in class1 we executed class2objtellname why didnt we execute class2objreturnname  i am really confused right now so please dont mind if i am acting sillyjava return returnvalueshare improve this

missing quite a lot of the basics and im not sure this site is a good fit for teaching you all that stuff in a single question – mat jul 28 12 at 751add a comment8 answers active oldest votesup vote6down vote first of all if the code youve given is really the code used in the tutorial then choose another tutorial it doesnt even respect the standard java naming conventions then to answer your question an object is a mix of state fields and behaviour methods some methods modify the state of the object some methods let you access the state of the object some methods allow doing both some methods use the state of the object and other objects to do something useful the method void set name string name doesnt return anything if it had a javadoc comment and if the class and method names were wisely chosen this comment would say  sets the name of this girl friend object replaces the previous name of  the girl friend with the new name given as argument public void set name  string new name this name  new namethis method modifies the state of the object and doesnt need to return anything its responsibility is to change the name and nothing else returning the new name doesnt serve any purpose since the caller already knows it it passed it as argument later on you could be interested in knowing the name of the girl friend  returns the name of this girl friend object public string get name  return this namethis method doesnt need any argument it allows asking the girl friend for her name and the method returns the name as an answer i would go with a good book or with the official java tutorial to learn moreshare improve this answeredited jul 28 12 at 802answered jul 28 12 at 755jb nizet496k 47 770 9261user1512179 everyone who reads your code will care one of the first things you need to learn is that making your code readable is hugely important – jon skeet jul 28 12 at 822user1512179 you are right in that it does not affect the ability of the code to run however if you ever need to work on a project with multiple people then following these style guidelines make it much easier to understand each others code – acattle jul 28 12 at 8221even if you work alone not respecting good naming standards will affect you leave the code you wrote for a week come back and try to improve it and youll suffer because of the bad names you chose and because theyre inconsistent with the rest of the standard api – jb nizet jul 28 12 at 851add a commentup vote1down votesetname has return type void which means it doesnt return anything at all the behavior of this function is to store the name for later retrievalreturnname has return type string and is to be called when you want to retrieve what was stored earlier the pattern poorly exemplified being used here is the gettersetter they have complementary but very different opposite behavior you could return a value with your setter setname  but thats for a beginner anyway an unnecessary complication  lets just not go there yet ok keep your methods singlepurposed and focusedtellname is a helper function to print namerelated output to the console regardingalso in class1 we executed class2objtellname why didnt we execute class2objreturnname  you could just as tellname  called returnname  your code in class1 might then replaceclass2objtellname with systemoutprintf your first girlfriend was s

no sense in most cases because we need separate getter read more about java beans and gettersetter also this method will have two responsibilities change value return result that is no good as you already understand returnname is getter method and used to obtain value of private variable read more about java access modifiers tellname just printer method and shows to standard output girlfriend name because returnname returns string object that variable sav ed in memory and you can print it out with using systemoutprintln class2objreturnname  but you have method that print it why do you need to do this just call class2objtellname  this is bad approach thoughps dont call portion of java code script share improve this answeredited may 23 17 at 1229community ♦1 1answered jul 28 12 at

meaning it cannot be accessed directly from outside class2 hence the 2 methods to set and return the girlname variable are made  to access the value of the variable from outside the class also you could use classobj2returnname  which will return the value of the girlname variable in class 2 and display it classobj2tellname is used here to simple print the value of the variable directlyshare improve this answeranswered jul 28 12 at 754rndm2829 6 27 55add a commentup vote0down votereturnname  and setname  are examples of getter and setter methods respectively these are also known as mutator methods the main reason these types of methods exist is to honour encapsulation this tutorial is obviously a very simple example where this isnt necessary but imagine youre building a system where you want to let the user find information in a database if you dont use a setter method and instead let the user directly access a variable which becomes part of the query run by the database then they could insert all kind of nasty code and hack your database this would be known as an sql injection attack  you prevent this by hiding the variable from the user in your example the variable is private and set the value through setter methods this method can be more complex than your example and look at the input to remove any unwanted input of course now that the variable is hidden we need a way for other objects to access the value thus the getter method in summary it leads to a more secure system and lets the developer control how a variable is accessed to prevent misuse even though youre working on a very simple example its a good practice to learn as it will be important in building secure systems latershare improve this answeranswered jul 28 12 at 755acattle2236 1 9

you want an answer you write a function that return a certain object other wise you set that function to void and you dont return anything when you call set name youre action is to set the object name so you didnt need anything back when you call return name you do want an answer  what is the object name so there you use the return statementshare improve this answeranswered jul 28 12 at 757oopsi731 3 8 24add a commentup vote0down vote because girlname is private it can not be accessed by any other objects so unless you provide some way to read the value you will never be able to get the value back is it essential no but it is good practice this prevents other objects from changing girlname without you knowing it this is actually a very important concept in oop it would be quite vesiable to return the girlname from the setname method but what would be the point youve already passed in the value that suggests that you already have access to the variabletell name does nothing more than more then displays some text in fact it uses the returnname method there is no reason why you cant call returnname but unless you assign it to a variable theres not much point you might to have a read

understandable  beginners do get the terminology wrong a lot no matter what the language is the conventions shown by these sources are quite terrible and most likely contribute to your confusion but the bottom line is that all variables have a scope scope in a nutshell means where the variable can be used and scope is seen as one of the most important things to take care of in good code to avoid weird side effects and bugs that are difficult or just plain impossible to fix in the class2 above you actually are correct the method call returnname  isnt actually required in tellname  since the private string girlname field is in class private scope that is all methods within the class can see that particular field directly you also askwhy isn t it posible to return the girlname in the setname methodwhich actually is possible but as i already mentioned the code here is very unconventional to normal java which is definitely causing some confusion the get xset x method naming convention is what is known as property pattern it is a convention where a class that has a private field of type foo exposes two public scope methods to allow users of the class to modify that field this convention is part of java beans which is quite a large topic to side step into right now so you may want to read about that on your own a simple class showing this would look like thispublic class foo field bean private foo fieldpublic foo get foo  return fieldpublic void set foo  this field  fieldas a small bonus heres the two class sources cleaned up to match common java conventions pay
