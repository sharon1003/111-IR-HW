have gotten fat too and have also slimmed down i think maybe we dont like to see this in our icons however i am sure in reallife he would have admitted to being fat and then slimmed down again like he eventually did zarcero junior bounty hunter posts 61joined sun jan 06 2008 956 pm location houston top steveby birdbrain » mon jan 07 2008 336 pm dont foget steve was carrying a 5 pound tumor in his

what like santa claus fat not likely monica bandito posts 15joined sat dec 15 2007 116 pm topby zarcero » mon jan 07 2008 345 pm you are right which is why i dont believe what i read about the 172 lbs i just look at the photos im 58 and at 172 lbs i look famished someone who is 510 at 172 lbs is going to look skinny id say judging from the photos he looks like 200 lbs or thereabouts the illness could have been part of it but i seem to recall from later photos that he had slimmed down again zarcero junior bounty hunter posts 61joined sun jan 06 2008 956 pm location houston topby gera » mon jan 07 2008 509 pm maybe he was fat whatever that means for some time why not i believe he just enjoyed life in his last years when he was with barbara he was just himself not the movie icon in his case that meant eating chocolate cake and beer for breakfast  so why not i dont think it got like really bad because his wife wives would have done something against it it takes fifty years for the majority to be right and then the majority is never right until it does rightgera chief reporter posts 958joined thu jun 15 2006 1025 am top steves weightby marshall t » mon jan 07 2008 637 pm ive been asked by darren to weigh in on this subject pardon the bad pun i have various documents in my possession military gun license marriage license etc  which show that steves weight fluctuated between 165 and 175 pounds the reason for that was when steve prepared for a film he got into movie shape you can clearly see in the sand pebbles that steve was at his thinnest and probably weighed about 155 to 160 most other times his movie weight was no more than 165 when he wasnt on a movie his weight hovered around 172 pounds steve was about 510 and had a wiry frame when he put on 10 pounds it showed but at no time was steve ever fat i dont know the page number but in the last mile theres a picture of steve making mashed potatoes with his shirt off this was in late 1977early 1978 during his supposed fat period examine the picture closely  he didnt have an ounce of body fat on him look at all the pictures in the last mile  theres not one where you can say that steve was overweight most men would kill to have a body like steves you have to remember the reporting of mc queens weight was mostly done by the national enquirer and other tabloid formats of that era there was no science to the reporting  no documents to back up claims and most of the eyewitnesses were unnamed sources a clever way of the reporter to inject his personal bias with that said i think the beard and the way mc queen dressed threw people off but i dont think steve mc queen ever weighed over 175 pounds in his life both barbara mc queen and pat johnson have both attested to this fact as well best

that he did balloon up at least once its no biggy as far a i am concerned and besides this is just my opinion and i go by the photos not the testimonials as for his for his fittest i would say in wanted dead or alive he was at his slimmest i have the series and several of his movies and i would say he is the slimmest in wdoa however he still seems to have a boys body in those shows whereas in grt esc he has the fitness of a man zarcero junior bounty hunter posts 61joined sun jan 06 2008 956 pm location houston topby monica » mon jan 07 2008 802 pm thank you very much marshall your learned
