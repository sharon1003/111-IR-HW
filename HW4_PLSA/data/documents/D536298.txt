of the cardiac conduction system purkinje fibers av node  sa node are short thick branched muscle of the heart cardiocytes a normal heart rate triggered by the sa node is reffered to as  rhythm sinus which of the following are components of the cardiovascular system capillaries heart veins  arteries the heartbeat is coordinated by the cardiac   conduction system the volume of blood ejected by the ventricles per minute is the cardiac output the study of the heart and its disorders is known as cardiology the  circuit of the cardiovascular system carries blood from the right ventricle to the lungs for gas exchange  returns it to the left atrium of the heart pulmonary place the following chambers in the correct order to best represent the flow of blood through the heart once blood has returned to the heart from the svc  ivc 1 right atrium 2 right ventricle 3 left atrium 4 left ventricle the  is the layer that lines the inner chambers of the heart endocardium the broad flat superior top portion of the heart is known as the  base carrying the action potentials the   spread throughout the ventriclar myocardium to excite the ventricles purkinje fibers the  is a composite recording of all nodal  myocardial action potentials ecglist in the correct order the major phases of the cardiac cycle following ventricular filling 1 isovolumetric contraction 2 ventricular ejection 3 isovolumetric relaxation the depolarization of the sa node is due to the inflow of    calcium  sodium the term  refers to the contraction of the heart systole which side of the heart pumps blood to the lungs right the part of the cardiac conduction system which acts as the pacemaker is the  sa node systemic circulation pumps blood from the  side of the heart to the  and then back to the  side of the heart left body tissues  right the thick inferior chambers of the heart that pump blood into the arteries are the right  left ventricles the  side of the heart supplies blood to the systemic circuit left the inferior end of the heart that tapers to a blunt point immediately above the diaphragm is called the  of the heart apex list in order the events of an action potential of a ventricular cardiocyte 1 voltagegated na channels open 2 influx of na causes more na channels to opendepolarization 3 na channels close close as membrane potential peaks at 30m v 4 ca enters through slow calcium channels creates plateau 5 ca channels close k channels openrepolarization the term  refers to relaxation of the heart diastole what are the functions of the fibrous skeleton provides structural support for the heart anchors the cardiocytes  give them something to pull against  provides electrical insulation between the atria  ventricles as a chamber such as a cardiac ventricles contracts just prior to reducing its volume the pressure of the fluid within would  increase cardiac out put is equal to svx hrthe amount of blood pumped by the left ventricle is  the amount of blood pumped by the right ventricle equal to excitation in the cardiac conduction system leaves the av node by the way of the  av bundle indicate which of the chemicals can cause an increase in hr caffine thyroid hormone nicotine the portion of the cardiac conduction system located in the lower end of the interatrial septum is the  av node the circuit of the cardiovascular system that carries blood to the body excluding the inferior of the lungs then returns it to the right side of the heart is the  circulation systemic the broad superior part of the heart is the  of the heart base the cells of the sa node spontaneously depolarize the local potential that leads to action potentials in these cells is called a  potential pacemaker the blood pressure in the great arteries determines the  of the heart afterload the outerwall of the pericardium consisting of a fibrous layer lined by a serous layer is the pericardial sac the pacemaker potential of sa node cells is due to the influx of  ions sodium one specific cause of arrhythmia is  which is failure of the cardiac conduction system to transmit signals heart block the vertebrate heartbeat is said to be  because the signal originates within the heart itself myogenic the right  left coronary arteries arise from the aorta the epicardium the serous layer of the pericardium is also called the visceral pericardium the artery that exits the aorta travels under the left auricle  then divides into 2 branches is the left  artery coronary the branch of the left coronary artery that continues around to the back of the heart in the coronary sulcus is the  artery circumflex the ability to rhythmically depolarize without outside stimulation is referred to as  autorhythmic parasympathetic nerve fibers transmit  effects from the cardiac center to the heart cardioinhibitory the   branch of the left coronary artery travels down the front of the heart to the apex of the heart anterior interventricular during ventricular contraction the ejection of blood out of the heart occurs because the pressure within the  exceeds the pressure within the  ventricles  great arteries when 2 arteries or veins join this is referred to as an  anastomosis a consistently elevated resting heart rate of above 100 bpm is called tachycardia is the process of listening to sounds made by the body ausculation the  wave of an ecg is a regarding of the depolarization of the atrial myocardium pwhen ventricles contract blood surging against the  valves forces them closed atrioventricular a  is the instrument used to measure blood pressure sphygmomanometer a persistent low resting heart rate below 60bpm is called bradycardia the auricles are flaplike extensions of the right and left atrium blood flow through the coronary circulation increases during ventricular diastole a difference in pressure creates a pressure  that directs the flow of fluids gradient a measure of the  can be obtained by taking a pulse at a point where an artery runs close to the body surface heart rate the strength of contraction for a given preload is defined as the  of the myocardium contractility the outermost layer of the heart wall is called the epicardium closing of the aortic  pulmonary semilunar valves produces the  heart sound second the qrs wave of an ecg represents the  of the ventricular myocardium depolarization the contraction of a cardiocyte occurs during the  phase of its action potential plateau when the av node acts as pacemaker the slower heartbeat is called a n  rhythm nodal the difference between maximum cardiac output  resting cardiac output is referred to as the cardiac  reserve the majority of the venous drainage from the coronary veins is collected by the   which then drains into the right atrium coronary sinus the groove that extends downward from the coronary sulcus on the back of the heart is the posterior  sulcus interventricular the  center of the medulla oblongata initiates autonomic output to the heart cardiac the  of the heart is the amount of tension in the ventricular myocardium immediately before it begins to contract preload ear  like extensions of the heart chamber auricle the mitral valve is also known as the  valve left avthe  nerve conveys parasympathetic signals to the heart vagus depolarization of a cardiocyte is due to opening of  channels sodium the surface indentation that separates the atria from the ventricles is known as the  sulcus coronary the heart receives innervation from both sympathetic and parasympathetic systems cardiac muscle relies on  metabolism to produce atp aerobic the closing of the atrioventricular valves produces which of the heart sounds 1st the role of the papillary muscles is to do which of the following tense the tendinous cords just prior to ventricular contraction the second heart sound is associated with the closing of the  valves semilunar the pericardial sac is also called the parietal pericardium the heartbeat originates in the heart muscle itself the term that describes this characteristic is myogenic fluids always flow from an area of  pressure to an area of  pressure high low the opening and closing of heart valves are governed by changes in  within heart chambers pressure the blood vessel that collects venous drainage from the anterior side of the heart and travels alongside the anterior interventricular artery is the  vein great cardiac the  is an earlike extension of each atrium auricle when two arteries or veins join this is referred to as a an anastomosis heart rate will increase when the sa node is stimulated by the  branch of the autonomic nervous system sympathetic
