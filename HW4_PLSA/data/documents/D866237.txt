rackandpinion steering prev nextrackandpinion steering is quickly becoming the most common type of steering on cars small trucks and suvs it is actually a pretty simple mechanism a rackandpinion gearset is enclosed in a metal tube with each end of the rack protruding from the tube a rod called a tie rod connects to each end of the rack the pinion gear is attached to the steering shaft when you turn the steering wheel the gear spins moving the rack the tie rod at each end of the rack connects to the steering arm on the spindle see diagram above the rackandpinion gearset does two things it converts the rotational motion of the steering wheel into the linear motion needed to turn the wheels it provides a gear reduction making it easier to turn the wheels on most cars it takes three to four complete revolutions of the steering wheel to make the wheels turn from lock to lock from far left to far right the steering ratio is the ratio of how far you turn the steering wheel to how far the wheels turn for instance if one complete revolution 360 degrees of the steering wheel results in the wheels of the car turning 20 degrees then the steering ratio is 360 divided by 20 or 181 a higher ratio means that you have to turn the steering wheel more to get the wheels to turn a given distance however less effort is required because of the higher gear ratio generally lighter sportier cars have lower steering ratios than larger cars and trucks the lower ratio gives the steering a quicker response  you dont have to turn the steering wheel as much to get the wheels to turn a given distance  which is a desirable trait in sports cars these smaller cars are light enough that even with the lower ratio the effort required to turn the steering wheel is not excessive some cars have variableratio steering which uses a rackandpinion gearset that has a different tooth pitch number of teeth per inch in the center than it has on the outside this makes the car respond quickly when starting a turn the rack is near the center and also reduces effort near the wheels turning limits power rackandpinion when the rackandpinion is in a powersteering system the rack has a slightly different design part of the rack contains a cylinder with a piston in the middle the piston is connected to the rack there are two fluid ports one on either side of the piston supplying higherpressure fluid to one side of the piston forces the piston to move which in turn moves the rack providing the power assist well check out the components that provide the highpressure fluid as well as decide which side of the rack to supply it to later in the article first lets take a look at another type of steering1 2 3 â€¦ 6 7 nextprint  citation  date  reprint more to explore related content heres why the us government 3d printed a classic muscle car 19821989 lamborghini jalpa how rambler cars work
