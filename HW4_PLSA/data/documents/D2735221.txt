sunday august 4 1996  page updated at 1200 amemail article print classing over park venture  for the benaroyas boblo island amusement park was a business deal gone bad for michael moonbaugh it was a dream that was never given a chance by stanley holmes seattle times business reporter spring had never been so promising for michael moodenbaugh a young selfmade entrepreneur from tiny randle lewis county as he stood on a podium surrounded by 1000 excited employees two nights before their risky attempt to reopen a venerable but troubled amusement park standing in the background watching moodenbaugh rally the employees was larry benaroya the scion of one of seattles wealthiest and most philanthropic families benaroya was bankrolling moodenbaughs dream to resurrect the boblo island amusement park near detroit that was in 1993 but the partnership soon dissolved into a clash of wills that led to the collapse of the amusement park and a bitter lawsuit the suit filed by moodenbaugh last month describes the benaroyas moves to dissolve the company dismantle the amusement park and sell off the assets after moodenbaugh was in a nearfatal car accident late that summer moodenbaugh alleges that larry benaroya and his father jack  prominent realestate developers in the puget sound area  intentionally damaged interfered with and fraudulently misrepresented moodenbaughs economic interests as he lay comatose and paralyzed from the crash according to the lawsuit the benaroyas spread defamatory rumors about moodenbaugh and refused to give his family access to financial records to complete a refinancing deal that would have paid off the benaroyas and kept the park open the benaroyas deny the charges in the lawsuit they said the business partnership was a mistake they lost confidence in moodenbaughs ability to manage the park they claim he was arrogant headstrong and unwilling to listen to advice and they didnt believe he could bail out the moneylosing operation by the time the season closed in late september boblo island had racked up 2 million in operating losses but why the benaroyas moved so quickly to shut down boblo island after one season when their partner clearly saw it as a longterm investment remains a mystery they gave moodenbaugh less than a year  roughly seven months from february to late september 1993  to turn around boblo island the benaroyas had another factor working in their favor the value of the property and its hard assets far exceeded their 63 million investment experts said few mistakes in 40 years the benaroyas didnt build a realestate fortune investing in moneylosing ventures known as aggressive but fair businessmen the benaroyas have made few mistakes in nearly 40 years of developing commercial properties in the puget sound area and elsewhere for the benaroyas boblo island was a business deal that went bad plain and simple we had to stop the bleeding said jack benaroya 75 in a rare interview from his plush 47thfloor office suite in downtown seattle no money was ever made from month to month but moodenbaugh and former boblo island employees said that park attendance was improving they were narrowing the monthly losses and had turned a profit in september time would have proven them right they contend from the day the park reopened in may 1993 former employees said the partnership turned into a personal battle between moodenbaugh and larry benaroya a secondgeneration businessman who has lived in the shadow of his successful father larry benaroya 45 who formed the boblo island partnership with moodenbaugh has been unavailable for comment certainly jack benaroya the patriarch of the benaroya family has built a sterling name for his family the realestate magnate has donated tens of millions of dollars to the arts and to various charities but the semiretired developer dislikes the media attention that surrounds his charity contributions as well as his business deals even after he donated 15 million toward the construction of a new concert hall for the seattle symphony benaroya didnt want the attention gerard schwarz seattle symphony music director said benaroya is so private that it was some time before we could get him to agree to attribute the gift to him it wasnt until before the announcement that he agreed to let us name the hall for his family foundation that tells you a lot in the world of realestate development benaroya is known as a visionary who sees a garden where others see a plot of dirt benaroya is also noted for his long silences during negotiations that tactic often draws out unsolicited information from rivals who break under the pressure said those who have engaged in negotiations with him benaroya began building his empire in 1956 almost from the beginning he was a step ahead of the market observers said he first started building speculative industrial parks and later developed discountretailshopping complexes benaroya never looked back he owned office parks in kent tukwila seattle bellevue and portland and developed the pavilion mall in tukwila before selling his realestate empire in 1984  near the height of the market  for a reported 315 million he is perhaps best known for building in the early 1970s design center northwest a georgetown complex that grew to more than 100 designer showrooms the benaroyas have reentered the realestate market most recently paying more than 80 million to purchase the twintower metropolitan park along interstate 5 from martin selig a local officebuilding developer born in montgomery ala in 1921 benaroya and his family moved to vallejo calif where his father ran a modest grocery and delicatessen with business slow during the depression the family moved to seattle in 1933 his father and older brother started a beerwholesaling company benaroya graduated from garfield high school in 1939 and served in the navy during world war ii he worked briefly in the beer business but opted for real estate without much formal training in the art of dealmaking he began his ascent with an ownership in one small building the benaroyas always distinguished themselves over the years by their strong sense of honor said jerry mathews chairman of kidder mathews  segner one of seattles leading commercial realestate firms they keep their word they deal straight theyre not devious and theyre fair in their dealings golden boy of federal way perhaps the boblo island partnership was a mistake but in the beginning the benaroyas were impressed by the golden boy from federal way moodenbaugh was an energetic dealmaking wunderkind who earned his first million before he was 30 by doing exactly what jack benaroya did in the 1960s and 70s making profits on properties where others saw losses michael was the guy who could turn around things said mark huston an eastside realestate financing specialist who has done business with moodenbaugh hes the guy who could see the diamond in the hill when others saw coal  not unlike jack benaroya in his early years by 1985 moodenbaugh teamed with former professional soccer player jeffrey stock to form omni properties in federal way the two young men specialized in turning around distressed commercial properties at one point they owned eight office buildings in the south end that were fully leased michael was very successful in the beginning said phyllis danforth owner of coldwell banker danforth in federal way who gave moodenbaugh his start he was almost like an instant success he just formed his company and overnight he began buying distressed properties he showed tremendous capability moodenbaugh and stock set their sights on the financially troubled enchanted village and wild waves amusement park in federal way they bought it for 8 million in a short time they made it profitable enchanted village was a risky venture that conventional banks wouldnt touch moodenbaugh went to the benaroyas one of a handful of private lenders willing to loan significant money at high interest rates for risky realestate ventures larry benaroya who operates the benaroya companies lent omni about 75 million at 25 percent interest plus a personal guarantee by going to the benaroyas it also meant that moodenbaugh and stock were entering the big league of local realestate development that notion was not lost on danforth who knew the benaroyas play to win i wondered how successful that would be she said but it obviously caught larrys attention moodenbaugh and stock paid back the loan ahead of schedule conflict grows worse the benaroyas must have liked moodenbaughs style because when he approached larry benaroya about the boblo island project larry not only agreed to lend money but wanted to become partners moodenbaugh and benaroya purchased the 202acre boblo island at an auction in february 1993 for 37 million moodenbaugh was to move to the detroit area and manage it boblo island had a history of financial trouble going through five owners since 1979 but it also had valuable assets and community support one of the last companies to own boblo island sold it for 22 million moodenbaugh saw tremendous opportunity in the rundown amusement park but he had three months to hire a staff of 1000 and add improvements before the park reopened may 22 1993 almost from the beginning moodenbaugh and larry benaroya clashed the conflict grew worse when revenue fell short of expectations larry and i didnt see eye to eye at all moodenbaugh said he expected me to jump when he said jump you cant buy time and thats what we needed the benaroyas became concerned in june when moodenbaugh continued to ask for money couldnt break even and pay the interest jack benaroya said they got upset at moodenbaughs promotional events and music concerts he booked the beach boys and other music performers but the shows failed to generate profits moodenbaugh handed out free tickets promoted the park on the radio and in newspapers and was negotiating with the canadian government to bring gambling to the island we had to overcome the negative publicity to turn the tide to get the goodwill back said moodenbaugh all of these efforts said former employees were drawing ontario and detroit residents back to their beloved park but it wasnt turning a profit and that frustrated the benaroyas concerned by the losses the benaroyas told moodenbaugh they wanted out and set midaugust for moodenbaugh to find new partners the benaroyas said moodenbaugh never met those deadlines and never offered them a credible investor but at least one private banker confirms that he was willing to invest in the island i gave a verbal commitment to help michael said lender robert jarvis who lives in lake oswego ore and has done business with moodenbaugh i had a lot of faith in him and if he hadnt gotten hurt id probably own the thing and wed be running it together in a turnaround situation you have to be prepared for losses in the first couple years why didnt they give him a chance to run it what were their expectations larry never gave michael a chance to make a move moodenbaugh alleges that the benaroyas continued to interfere with the daily operations of the company and that they tried to undermine his authority by stirring up trouble with disgruntled employees and spreading false rumors the benaroyas dismiss those allegations they said moodenbaugh was becoming difficult and unmanageable differences boiled over in an early september meeting between jack benaroya and moodenbaugh jack pokes his finger at me and says im tired of you writing checks out of my checkbook and i said jack you dont know jack    about the amusement park  recalled moodenbaugh who said he stormed out when he realized nothing would be accomplished jack benaroya said he met with moodenbaugh because we were having difficulty agreeing on anything i went back to see if i could lend some help i didnt feel we got any satisfaction dealing with him three weeks later on sept 24 moodenbaugh was involved in a nearfatal automobile accident in toledo where he was promoting boblo island and lay comatose within 12 hours the benaroyas and associates flew to detroit they shut down the park sept 26 and later fired 1000 people sold the amusement rides at bargain prices and sold the island to a developer moodenbaugh said the benaroyas refused to give his family copies of the parks financial records so they could complete the refinancing with another investor and keep the park open the benaroyas said the financial records were a mess and they were unwilling to be held responsible for faulty information we had no accurate numbers and would not give inaccurate information to others benaroya said they also said the ongoing expenses of maintaining the park were substantial they had only three months beginning in february to sell off the rides and games for the next summer season so they had to act swiftly the benaroyas just did not want that deal to happen said moodenbaugh who now uses a wheelchair and lives at his fathers house in tacoma all they had to do was give them the paperwork so my family could finish the deal they would have gotten their money and boblo island amusement park would still be open the benaroyas wish the summer of 93 would go away moodenbaugh wishes he could have it back a jury will have to sort out the facts from the allegations something that neither moodenbaugh nor larry benaroya apparently could achieve during their short and stormy partnership a trial is scheduled for december 1997 in the boblo island suit moodenbaugh also is suing his former business partner stock for breach of contract over the buyout of the boblo island partnership he also is suing stock over differences stemming from prior business dealings stock denies the allegations and sides with the benaroyas immediately after moodenbaughs accident jack benaroya said he shared some observations with michaels father i told him i felt very badly that michael had an accident and i told him i felt very badly that our two sons had differences benaroya said they could not agree that was the source of the problem copyright c 1996
