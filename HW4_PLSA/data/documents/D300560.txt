is aspirin the same as ibuprofen no ibuprofen is not aspirin nor does it contain aspirin the chemical name for aspirin is acetylsalicylic acid aspirin is a generic drug and is sold by several manufacturers under various brand names ibuprofen which is isobutylphenyl propionic acid is also a generic that is sold under various brand names such as advil  applications both aspirin and ibuprofen are used for pain relief and to reduce fevers however aspirin is generally ineffective at treating pain caused by muscle cramps bloating and skin irritation in such cases ibuprofen is preferable compared to aspirin aspirin is effective in treating headaches and migraines reducing fever although not in children and preventing heart attacks and strokes in atrisk individuals antiplatelet effect both ibuprofen and aspirin have an antiplatelet effect ie they prevent the risk of heart attacks and strokes by improving the circulation of blood in the arteries by preventing platelet aggregation however the antiplatelet effect of ibuprofen is relatively mild and shortlived compared to aspirin doctors often prescribe a daily lowdose aspirin to cardiovascular patients at risk for heart attacks prophylactic use taking aspirin daily at doses between 75 and 325 mgday has been shown to be beneficial in reducing the risk of cancer with longer use likely to provide greater benefits 3 cardiologists also recommend a daily dose of aspirin to prevent heart attacks however due to the risk of stomach bleeding this recommendation has been amended to now apply not to the general population but only to those who are already at risk for cardiovascular health drug interactions ibuprofen should not be mixed with aminoglycosides such as paromycin garamycin or tobi aspirin should not be mixed with nsaids like naproxen  antidepressants like celexa and lexapro or alcohol because it increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding aspirin and ibuprofen together ibuprofen can interfere with the antiplatelet effect of lowdose aspirin 81 mg per day this can render aspirin less effective this is called attenuation when used for preventing heart attacks however this risk is minimal if ibuprofen is used only occasionally because aspirin has a relatively longlasting effect on platelets the us fda recommends that patients who use immediaterelease aspirin not enteric coated and take a single dose of ibuprofen 400 mg should dose the ibuprofen at least 30 minutes or longer after aspirin ingestion or more than 8 hours before aspirin ingestion to avoid attenuation of aspirins effect note that this fda recommendation is only for immediaterelease lowdose aspirin 81 mg the effects of the interaction of ibuprofen with entericcoated aspirin are not known so it may not be advisable to use the two concomitantly as always it is best to consult your doctor about this drug interaction and the timing of when to take these drugs nonselective otc nsaids other than ibuprofen such as naproxen should also be viewed as having the potential to interfere with the antiplatelet effect of lowdose aspirin side effects potential side effects of ibuprofen include nausea gastrointestinal bleeding diarrhea constipation headache dizziness salt and fluid retention and hypertension rare side effects include esophageal ulcers heart failure renal impairment and confusion overdose can lead to death potential side effects of aspirin include upset stomach heartburn drowsiness and headache more severe side effects can include gastrointestinal bleeding severe nausea fever swelling and hearing problems aspirin should be avoided up to 1 week before surgeries including cosmetic procedures like tummy tucks or facelifts it is also recommended to avoid aspirin during a flu infection especially influenza type b because doing so can lead to reyes syndrome a rare but potentially fatal disease of the liver recommended dosage of ibuprofen and aspirin the adult dose for ibuprofen is between 200mg and 800mg per dose up to four times a day a doctor should be consulted in the case of an overdose the adult dose for aspirin is typically 325mg which can be taken four times a day efficacy conclusions from various research studies examining the efficacy of ibuprofen and acetaminophen are presented below after ligament reconstruction a 2004 study concluded that ibuprofen 800 mg thrice daily reduced pain to a greater degree than acetaminophen 1 g thrice daily after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction under general anaesthesia the combination of acetaminophen and ibuprofen did not provide any superior analgesic effect combined use a more recent study in 2013 concluded that ibuprofen plus paracetamol combinations provided better analgesia than either drug alone at the same dose with a smaller chance of needing additional analgesia over about eight hours and with a smaller chance of experiencing an adverse event for headaches a study published in 1996 examined the efficacy of acetaminophen and ibuprofen in treating tension headaches the study concluded that while both drugs are effectiveibuprofen at 400 mg is significantly more effective than acetaminophen at 1000 mg for treating this condition for children a metaanalysis of several studies was published in 2004 which concluded that both drugs were equally effective in providing shortterm pain relief in children with roughly equal safety however ibuprofen advil was a more effective feverreducer in children single doses of ibuprofen 410 mgkg and acetaminophen 715 mgkg have similar efficacy for relieving moderate to severe pain and similar safety as analgesics or antipyretics ibuprofen 510 mgkg was a more effective antipyretic than acetaminophen 1015 mgkg at 2 4 and 6 hours posttreatment another study published in 1992 examined only the feverreducing properties of the drugs and had similar conclusions ibuprofen provided greater temperature decrement and longer duration of antipyresis than acetaminophen when the two drugs were administered in approximately equal doses after childbirth a research study in 2008 looked at the efficacy of both drugs for the relief of perineal pain after childbirth this study concluded that ibuprofen was consistently better than acetaminophen at 1 hour after treatment for relief of perineal pain after childbirth without any side effects after 2 hours ibuprofen and acetaminophen had similar analgesic properties references wikipedia ibuprofen wikipedia aspirin fda recommendations on mixing ibuprofen and aspirin can an aspirin a
