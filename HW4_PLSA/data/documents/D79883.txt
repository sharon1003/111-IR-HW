1 dear alicei had my first sexual experience on the weekend now im still bleeding its been about two days is this normal how long does it last from confused2 hi alicerecently my boyfriend and i were fooling around and he was fingering me he has really big hands with really long fingers and for the first time i felt a lot of pain followed by a lot of pleasure after he was done i checked my underwear and it was drenched in blood i am assuming that my hymen was broken but i didnt think it was supposed to bleed for over two days and certainly not this much is this normal or is something else happening dear confused and reader 2its normal for some women to bleed after having sexual intercourse for the first time bright red in color the bleeding is caused by stretching of the hymen until it tears if the bleeding continues it will turn dark red and trail off until it stops typically within a few days if a woman is penetrated with fingers and experiences bleeding there are a few causes if shes a virgin its possible that the hymen has been torn its also possible that the vaginal walls have been scraped by a partners fingernails in which case its a good idea for to be examined and get treatment so that a vaginal infection doesnt develop in either case it would be wise to see a health care provider for a checkup if bleeding is significant is heavier than the first couple of days of her period is constant andor soaks through a tampon and a padbleeding persists for more than a few days there is pain that does not get better she is worried about anything for some peace of mindin order to heal its wise not to have any vaginal penetration no penises fingers tampons etc and orgasm until after the bleeding has completely stopped if bleeding returns after vaginal penetration or orgasm has resumed then a visit to a health care provider for a checkup might be in order while its highly likely that the bleeding is in response to a sexual act its also quite possible that it may not be related if the bleeding starts out as dark rather than bright red in color then there may be bleeding from the cervix or higher up in the uterus in this case seeking medical attention as soon as possible is advised aliceshare this page on facebook share this page on twitter share this page on google printerfriendly version send by email pdf version
