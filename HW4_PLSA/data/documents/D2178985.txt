nothing and in the wake of this nothing i had to figure out how to make myself safe again she wrote that one day she decided to resist describing how she bit her father as hard as she could at first he didnt even seem to mind so i tried to bring my teeth together then i was sailing across the room he had tossed me away to stop me from biting him … i was sure he would beat me to death at this point but instead she was taken aback because her father seemed surprised by her actions he apparently didnt realize i didnt like what was happening he said something like oh you dont like it when we do this my father never touched me again broadcasting break not all of her childhood memories are quite so painful i love baltimore it gave me a great foundation says the western high school school
