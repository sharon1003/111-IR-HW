even before rafael perezs allegations surfaced the l a p d was conducting an internal investigation into suspicious activity among some rampart crash officers as of may 2001 the rampart investigation resulted in 58 officers being brought before an internal administrative board of these 12 were suspended seven have resigned and five were terminated there are critics however who believe that the l a p d leadership was not truly interested in getting to the bottom of the rampart scandal detective russell poole claims that in the early stages of the investigation crucial leads were ignored others note that administrative decisions taken after the scandal erupted discouraged officers with critical information from coming forward here are the views of detective poole l a p d chief bernard parks gerald chaleff former president of the l a police commission and gil garcetti former l a district attorney detective russell poole former l a p d robberyhomicide detective lead investigator in the lygagaines shooting poole was also investigating an alleged stationhouse beating of a gang member by crash officer brian hewitt we had conducted the investigation for a couple of months then the chief out of the blue orders a meeting in his office which was quite unusual he never has done that really he wanted to be briefed on the hewitt investigation so we were asked to prepare a timeline on the events leading up through the hewitt investigation my original timeline included all the evidence involving gangs all the things that involved that case all the evidence included in the biggie smalls case involving mack all the evidencesome of the evidence involving perez and many of the different issues with hewitt and then when i turned it in they redlined about three pagestook out all of the gang stuff all the mack stuff in my opinion i felt that maybe at the time the chief didnt really know all the facts in this  i briefed the chief on the hewitt investigation during the course of that meeting i was describing other cases that had occurred in the past  i didnt bring up biggie smalls but detective brian tyndall brought it up brian tyndall told the chief that russ believes that david mack was involved in the conspiracy to kill biggie smalls the chief didnt have a comment about that i was describing all the different incidents that involved hewitt and perez and some of these same officers involved in several other incidents that occurred where serious injuries had occurred on some people i requested to investigate it further and he told me no i want you to concentrate on just this one case the jimenez beating dont do anything further i said chief its more than just this one case it has to do with these officers over at rampart youve got a group of vigilante cops over there at rampart division and everybody went silent the chief kind of looked over at lieutenant hernandez then they changed the subject they changed the subject if i recall correctly it was oh i think we need to do an audit on some of these police officers like hewitt and perez seems that some of these officers came on at the same time we need to find out if weve got a series of problem officers in this span of a year or so at the time these guys came on the police force and then they adjourned the meeting said thank you very much very good presentation nothing else was said  i did my best to uncover as much as possible we needed more time to investigate this whole matter there was much more to it but the chief said no i want a report in two weeks i wasnt able to do a thorough investigation on the matter that included the jimenez beating because there were several things that needed to be investigated further  and so what i did is that i did what the chief said i prepared a report i turned in that 40page report the report was suppressed it was not turned in who didnt turn it in i turned it in to lieutenant hernandez lieutenant hernandez said we couldnt turn this in because he said basically the chief doesnt want this in the chief was calling the shots on it which was very unusual but youve got to know something im the lead investigator in a case im the one thats going to be testifying in a court of law i told lieutenant hernandez if theres something inaccurate in my report lets change it he really didnt give me a good explanation why he didnt want to turn this report in  eventually i gave the district attorney my version of the report and was told that had we received all the evidence in this report all the stuff and all the other complaints against hewitt involving other incidents they would have filed charges but i was prevented from doing thatfrom doing my job so in essence it doesnt take a genius to figure out that there was some obstruction of justice it was just plain and simple they purged items from the d a package i had prepared it had documents documents and photographs they had purged from the d a should have had those items in order to have a good picture of what was occurring in this particular case for him to get only five yearshes going to be out in juneis a travesty of justice so far weve had one court case and the court case has been thrown out you tell me how many prosecutions as a result of ray perezs confessions resultedzip zip hes getting out in june all it has resulted in is civil lawsuits by gang members who are getting rich the investigation of ray perez was prematurely settled i think that the head people at the d a s office were duped by their own people they were duped by the l a p d in charge of this investigation based on the information facts that i have gathered during all these investigations it dates back when chief parks was in charge of internal affairs  i think over the years it just kept snowballing from one event to the next i think he felt that if he could contain each investigation individually that the sloppiness of internal affairs would not be uncovered and made public he tried to contain it  i knew that the chief and some of the other people involved suppressed evidence obstructed justice nothing was being done about it i complained and nothing was being done about my concerns it was all swept under the rug i stayed on for another year and then resigned chief bernard parks chief of l a p d i wanted to ask you about one fellow detective poole he as you know was assigned to a narrow piece of a case found some interesting stuff and wanted to follow that thread it was death row records he has suggested that that there was much more there and that he tried to bring it to you and that you shut him down eventually of course he left the force what is your response to this i think its completely illogical why would we gone through what weve done to ignore credible information i think what has been very clear throughout this case is that officer poole had some theories that couldnt be substantiated and when he couldnt substantiate them clearly his supervision gave him the right direction and said until you substantiate them they cant be a part of a case the thing that concerns me is that if detective poole really thought seriously that he was being ignored and he had all of this information then why didnt he bring it forth before he resigned and before he was disciplined because of his own personal misconduct why didnt this come to light before then well he says that he did he said he brought it to you at the famous meeting russell poole came to a meeting amongst other detectives and basically had a very minimal role in that meeting again why would i insist on moving forward and pushing the da to file cases to bring a task force forward to investigate the casebe the lone voice in investigating this for two and a half years and then listen to russell poole and say im not interested in what you say because it might bring something negative towards the department it doesnt make any sense at all so it didnt happen it didnt happen and the thing is in my judgment its kind of interesting that he only brought it up when he left the department and after he had been personally disciplined and removed from the task force so those are things that cause me some concern what was he disciplined for i cant go into that but  he was removed from the task force disciplined and then retired before he had vested his pension which then would cause you concern to say why would he do all of those things it wasnt because we did anything to him and certainly why would we ignore information that was relevant gerald chaleff former president of the la police commission when chief parks began to see these things happening one thing he did was form what became a rampart task force to look into what looked liked it might be a subculture of gangsta cops basically was it appropriate in your view that the l a p d be investigating itself yes i think it was appropriate i think its appropriate that the police certainly began the investigation and then the fbi became involved i think that certainly was appropriate do you have every confidence that they expended every effort to actually get to the bottom of it wherever it led however high it led well i dont think anybody could have level of confidence do i think that the officers involved or some of the people investigating this were highly motivated yes because they were ashamed by the actions of these people do i think that we know the full extent of what happened no do i think well ever know the full extent no i think one of the problems we had is chief parks refusal to allow any kind of amnesty or immunity for officers coming forward for wrongdoing that may have occurred in the past that they now wanted to talk about and they are fearful of being punished because of l a p ds rule about if you fail to report a misconduct youre guilty of misconduct that inhibited the ability to have officers come forward help me to understand chief parks in this rampart scandal where is he on it youve been an informed observer has he been interested in shutting this thing down identifying enough of a scandal to shut it down and move on or has he really been interested in getting in there and rooting around and doing a thorough investigation thats a difficult question because i think that hes exhibited both you can look at the fact of his highly public dispute with the district attorney about filing casesyou can argue either waythat he wanted to get cases going so officers would then begin to cooperate or in fact he wanted to have certain ones picked off and that would be the end of it his bringing in the fbi and the u s attorney would indicate that he wanted a more wideranging investigation one of my concerns was that they began to do administrative hearings too quickly on matters that i thought werent that important that caused the board of rights to begin to basically say we cant trust perez because there was a drinking party up at the academy which is certainly small in comparison to other things why youd have to ask them why they did that i think the department sent out mixed messages he certainly wanted certain people prosecuted whether or not there is an honest belief that it was perez and limited to a small group of people or whether because of their board of inquiry report or others or whether they felt that we should contain it i cant answer that i think the best i can say is that the department has sent mixed messages  gil garcetti former district attorney for los angeles county the investigation didnt go i believe the way it could have gone you simply cannot make successful police corruption cases without police officers working with you we had some officers who were willing to work with us and some of them did to some extent but the ones that were out there who we think could have really helped us could not or would not step forward because they were afraidfearful of administrative retribution within their own department the problem simply was that this police department wasnt willing to do what the new york city police department and other police departments had done and that is give some administrative leniency to police officers who would help you go after a bigger fish in other words if we had a police officer who had in fact witnessed some wrongdoing in the rampart division but was a rookie cop and saw it and was scared to death maybe knew that she or he had to report this but was scared and didnt report it three or four years later this explodes and they said ok im going to step forward now and then he or she is told fine step forward but you will be fired because you did not report it when you should have my position wasand i conveyed this to the chiefi said bend on this for heavens sake discipline that person sure give them some time off or write up a report dont fire them because that person will never step forward he was unyielding on this and he has total control and discretion here no one can tell himnot the police commissioner not the mayor not the d a no one can tell him he said no if you broke the rule you have to pay the price and the price is you will be fired he knew that thats the position he was going to take and that we would not get those officers who could step forward the effect was that we didnt go as far with the case as i felt that we could and that is really warranted by the evidence and by the allegations made by perez and othershome · rampart scandal · bad cops · race  policing · aftermath · connecting the dotsdiscussion ·
