photochemical smog to fully appreciate photochemical smog formation one must first recognize that nitrogen is transformed between many different substances in the atmosphere automobile exhausts release nitrous oxide no along with small amounts of nitrogen dioxide no 2  these two substances form the starting materials for a vast array of chemical reactions that lead to products with higher oxidation states in a straight forward process nitrogen oxide no is converted to nitrogen dioxide no 2  nitrogen dioxide is transformed to nitrogen trioxide no 3  and nitrogen trioxide in transformed into dinitrogen pentoxide n 2 o 5  each of these four simple nitrogen oxides then reacts through a photochemical process or direct physical contact with atmospheric substances to form and an impressive list of biological irritants the list of irritants includes 1 alkyl nitrite 2 peroxyalkyl nitrate 3 alkyl nitrate 4 peroxyacetyl nitrate 5 nitrous acid 6 peroxynitric acid 7 nitric acid and 8 ammonium nitrate these chemical transformations are shown graphically in figure 401 figure 401 chemical transformations of nitrogen oxides in the troposphere the substances that react with nitrogen oxides to form oxidants the final product of photochemical smog are trace hydrocarbons from incomplete combustion and the hydroxyl radical the necessary ingredients for photochemical smog formation are 1 nitrogen oxides 2 sunlight and 3 hydrocarbons photochemical smog formation proceeds through a sequence of reactions all involving a free radical mechanism free radicals are generated by photodissociation of nitrogen dioxide a process that generates ozone and oxygen atoms oxygen atoms react with water to form hydroxyl radicals which in turn react with hydrocarbons to form hydrocarbon radicals oxidation of hydrocarbons by the hydroxyl radical leads to the formation of aldehydes the aldehydes are oxidized further to form aldehyde peroxides and aldehyde peroxyacids these final substances are the compounds that are so irritating to sensitive biological tissues and cause most of the health problems associates with photochemical smog figure 403 shown below is a diagram showing the changes in atmospheric concentrations for nitrogen oxide nitrogen dioxide nonmethane hydrocarbons aldehydes and oxidants analysis of the data shown in figure 403 led to the equations for photochemical smog formation equations 18 shown below figure 402 cartoon illustrating the main components of photochemical smog formation figure 403 daily chemical transformations occurring in the formation of photochemical smog generalized reaction scheme for photochemical smog formation this is a cyclic process that needs light and nitrogen oxides to generate oxygen atoms once formed the oxygen atoms react with water to form hydroxyl radicals the hydroxyl radicals then react with hydrocarbons according to equations 5 through 8 to form peroxyacyl nitrates or panthen in summary this is what happens in photochemical smog formation1 nitrogen oxides generate oxygen atoms2 oxygen atoms form hydroxyl radicals3 hydroxyl radicals generate hydrocarbon radicals4 hydrocarbon radicals form hydrocarbon peroxides5 hydrocarbon peroxides form aldehydes6 aldehydes form aldehyde peroxides7 aldehyde peroxides form peroxyacylnitrates original page created by dr richard foust professor of chemistry and environmental science northern arizona university
