different locations or at different times german kohärenz category general optics how to cite the article suggest additional literature coherence is one of the most important concepts in optics and is strongly related to the ability of light to exhibit interference effects a light field is called coherent when there is a fixed phase relationship between the electric field values at different locations or at different times partial coherence means that there is some although not perfect correlation between phase values there are various ways of quantifying the degree of coherence as described below it is also common to call certain processes or techniques coherent or incoherent in that case “coherent” essentially means phasesensitive for example the general method of coherent beam combining relies on the mutual coherence of beams whereas spectral incoherent beam combining does not− spatial versus temporal coherence figure 1 a prism is inserted into a spatially coherent laser beam generating an interference pattern on the screen there are two very different aspects of coherence spatial coherence means a strong correlation fixed phase relationship between the electric fields at different locations across the beam profile for example within a crosssection of a beam from a laser with diffractionlimited beam quality the electric fields at different positions oscillate in a totally correlated way even if the temporal structure is complicated by a superposition of different frequency components spatial coherence is the essential prerequisite of the strong directionality of laser beams temporal coherence means a strong correlation between the electric fields at one location but different times for example the output of a singlefrequency laser can exhibit a very high temporal coherence as the electric field temporally evolves in a highly predictable fashion it exhibits a clean sinusoidal oscillation over extended periods of time lasers have the potential for generating beams eg gaussian beams with very high spatial coherence and this is perhaps the most fundamental difference between laser light and radiation from other light sources high spatial coherence arises from the existence of resonator modes which define spatially correlated field patterns in situations where only a single resonator mode has sufficient laser gain to oscillate a single longitudinal mode can be selected obtaining singlefrequency operation with very high temporal coherence as well figures 2–4 further illustrate the difference between spatial and temporal coherence for reference figure 2 shows a monochromatic gaussian beam exhibiting perfect spatial and temporal coherence figure 2 electric field distribution around the focus of a gaussian laser beam coming eg from the left side with perfect spatial and temporal coherence figure 3 shows a beam with high spatial coherence but poor temporal coherence the wavefronts are formed as above and the beam quality is still very high but the amplitude and phase of the beam varies along the propagation direction note that both the local amplitude and the spacing of the wavefronts vary to some extent such a beam can be generated eg from the output of a supercontinuum source figure 3 a laser beam with high spatial coherence but poor temporal coherence figure 4 shows a laser beam with reduced spatial coherence but high temporal coherence the wavefronts are deformed and this results in a high beam divergence and poor beam quality on the other hand the beam is monochromatic so that the spacing of the deformed wavefronts remains constant such a beam can result from a singlefrequency laser when its output is sent through some optically inhomogeneous material figure 4 a laser beam with poor spatial coherence but high temporal coherence if a laser beam with high spatial coherence is sent through an optical element for example a very inhomogeneous piece of glass which totally scrambles the wavefront the resulting distorted beam could in principle still be considered as spatially coherent since the phase relationship between the electric fields at different points would still be fixed as long as the wavefront distortions do not change with time it would then also in principle be possible to restore a simple beam shape by applying another optical element which compensates the complicated spatial distortions for most practical purposes however such a distorted beam will be spatially incoherent nevertheless a real destruction of special coherence requires timedependent wavefront distortions as can be obtained with a rotating diffuser for example in that case the temporal coherence is also somewhat degraded− quantifying coherence there are different ways to quantify the degree of coherence correlation functions specify the degree of correlation as a function of a spatial or temporal distance there are correlation functions of different orders the firstorder correlation function is related to the optical spectrum  the secondorder correlation function describes intensity correlations ie effects like photon bunching or antibunching higherorder functions describe still more subtle details the coherence time quantifies the degree of firstorder temporal coherence via the time over which coherence is lost the coherence length is the coherence time times the vacuum velocity of light and thus also characterizes the temporal not spatial coherence via the propagation length and thus propagation time over which coherence is lost the linewidth of a singlefrequency laser is also strongly related to temporal coherence a narrow linewidth high monochromaticity means high temporal coherence fringe visibility parameters essentially specify the visibility contrast of an interference pattern generated by superposition of two electric fields the relationship between optical bandwidth and temporal coherence can be nontrivial for example a pulse train from a modelocked laser can have a broad overall bandwidth with the fourier spectrum consisting of discrete very narrow lines → frequency combs  the temporal coherence can be very high in the sense that there are strong field correlations for large time delays which are close to integer multiples of the pulse period see also the discussion on the coherence of supercontinua and the article concerning coherence of ultrashort pulses in the photonics spotlight  − importance of coherence in applications some applications need light with very high spatial and temporal coherence this applies eg to many variations of interferometry holography and some types of optical sensors eg fiberoptic sensors  such features are also important for the technique of coherent beam combining for other applications the coherence of the light used should be as low as possible for example very low temporal coherence but combined with high spatial coherence is required for coherence tomography where images are created with a kind of interferometry and a high spatial resolution requires low temporal coherence suitable light sources for such applications can be based on amplified spontaneous emission ase from a laser amplifier → superluminescent sources or on supercontinuum generation in nonlinear media a low degree of temporal coherence can also be beneficial for laser projection displays imaging and pointer applications as it reduces the tendency for speckle and similar interference effects− coherence in quantum optics in quantum optics the term coherence is often used for the state of lightemitting atoms or ions in that case coherence refers to a phase relationship between the complex amplitudes corresponding to electronic states this is important eg in the context of lasing without inversion  there is also the term “ coherent states ” of the light field which has yet another meaning see also coherence time coherence length laser beams beam quality linewidth
