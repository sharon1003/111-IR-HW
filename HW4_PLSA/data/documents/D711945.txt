obituaries carlos kleiber 74 brilliant reclusive conductor july 20 2004  mark swed  times staff writer carlos kleiber a conductor of tremendous mystique who had the uncanny ability to animate the smallest details in a piece of music yet whose personal elusiveness made him one of the most enigmatic stars of the classical music world has died he was 74 kleiber died july 13 after a long illness a relative who did not want to be named told the associated press and was buried saturday in konjusica slovenia next to his wife who was slovenian and died in december no information was released on where kleiber died or the cause of death even in an art form that relies to a considerable degree on conjuring  the conductor using the power of communication through eyes body gestures and words to convey to other musicians the essence of sound  kleiber was a remarkable magician a performance by him was like that of no other conductor his eyes had a glint that all but hypnotized orchestra musician and audience member alike his gestures were so precise that they seemed to etch melodies out of thin air it was as if every fiber in his body was translated into singleminded musical impulse which he conveyed with a dancers grace but just to make sure the players knew what he meant he loved to send them individual kleibergrams after rehearsals with reminders he is a wizard placido domingo the tenor and los angeles opera general director who sang often with kleiber told the guardian in london in 1987 he has assimilated the score to such a degree that he can read through the notes to uncover all the drama and feeling of the music everything the composer imagined but the sheer intensity of kleibers music making his compulsive perfectionism and his appearing to live the music he conducted also came at a price he might be able to get a small obscure oboe solo in an opera such as verdis otello to express as much depth of feeling as a character in the opera but in so doing he worked constantly on the edge that meant he couldnt be bothered with the ancillary aspects of performing or fame which gave him the reputation for being difficult he had a nearphobia of the limelight he refused requests for interviews he insisted that he not be introduced to anyone he didnt want to meet he demanded double or triple the typical number of rehearsals and he never announced what he would conduct in advance deciding on repertory when he showed up for rehearsals that however wasnt as great a problem as it might seem since despite what was said to be a vast knowledge of the repertory he only conducted a handful of symphonies concertos and operas but even when all conditions were met  and orchestras and opera companies were willing to do just about anything to entice kleiber onto their podia  he could still refuse or walk out or cancel still every performance was an occasion and nearly every one of his small number of recordings such as those of beethovens fifth and seventh symphonies and verdis la traviata is considered a classic the son of the famed austrian conductor erich kleiber carlos kleiber was born in berlin on july 3 1930 to escape the war in europe the kleibers emigrated to buenos aires where erich kleiber conducted at the teatro colon but he discouraged his son from pursuing a career in music despite a natural talent the young musician did in fact have thoughts about going into chemistry but he eventually rebelled against his domineering father and slowly worked his way up in small opera houses in germany fighting under the yoke of his father he used the pseudonym karl keller when he made his conducting debut in potsdam in 1954 but his father continued to publicly criticize his son saying he would never get the rhythms right in viennese waltzes in 1958 two years after his father died kleiber got his first conducting post at the deutsche oper am rhein in dusseldorf in 1964 he moved on to switzerland at the zurich opera for two years then returned to germany and conducted opera in stuttgart for two years for the next 10 years he had a guest contract with the staatsoper in munich and his international career blossomed while he conducted celebrated performances of wagners tristan und isolde in vienna and at the bayreuth festival and strauss rosenkavalier and elektra at covent garden in london kleiber made his american debut conducting verdis otello at the san francisco opera in 1977 and he appeared several times at the metropolitan opera in the late 80s and early 90s but the only american orchestra he ever conducted was the chicago symphony twice however he nearly came to los angeles ernest fleischmann the former general manager of the los angeles philharmonic recalled monday in the mid70s after
