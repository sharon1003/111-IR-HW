editnirvana was a grunge rock band from aberdeen washington formed by kurt cobain and krist novoselic in 1987 that had signed to seattle independent record label sub pop the band released their debut album bleach in 1989 with chad channing on drums however channing left nirvana in 1990 and the band was in need of a permanent drummer during a show by hardcore punk band scream the groups drummer dave grohl impressed cobain and novoselic when scream unexpectedly disbanded grohl contacted novoselic made his way to seattle and was soon invited to join the band novoselic said in retrospect that when grohl joined the band everything fell into place 2meanwhile cobain was writing a number of new songs at the time cobain was listening to bands like the melvins r e m the smithereens and the pixies feeling disillusioned by the heavy detuned rock popular in the seattle grunge scene upon which sub pop had built its image cobain—inspired by his contemporary listening habits—began writing songs that were more melodic a key development was the single  sliver  released on sub pop in 1990 before grohl joined the band which cobain said was like a statement in a way i had to write a pop song and release it on a single to prepare people for the next record i wanted to write more songs like that 3 grohl said that the band at that point often made the analogy of likening their music to childrens music in that the band tried to make its songs as simple as possible 2by the start of the 1990s sub pop was experiencing financial difficulties with rumors that sub pop would sign up as a subsidiary of a major record label the band decided to cut out the middleman and start to look for a major record label 2 a number of labels courted the band but nirvana ultimately signed with geffen records imprint dgc records based upon repeated recommendations from kim gordon of sonic youth and their management company 4recording and production  editnirvana enlisted producer butch vig at the suggestion of their former label sub pop in early 1990 nirvana began planning its second album for sub pop tentatively titled sheep for the album sub pop head bruce pavitt suggested butch vig as a potential producer 2 nirvana particularly liked vigs work with killdozer and called vig up to tell him we want to sound as heavy as that record 5 the band traveled out to vigs smart studios in madison wisconsin recording from april 2 to 6 1990 6 most of the basic song arrangements were completed by that time but cobain was still working on lyrics and the band was unsure of which songs to record 7 ultimately eight songs were recorded immodium later renamed breed dive later released as the bside to sliver  in bloom  pay to play eventually renamed stay away and given a new set of lyrics sappy  lithium   here she comes now  released on velvet underground tribute album heaven and hell volume 1  and polly 8 on april 6 the band played a local show in madison with fellow seattle band tad 9 vig began to mix the recordings while the band hung out in madison giving an interview to madisons community radio station wort on april 7 10 nirvana had planned to record more tracks but cobain had strained his voice forcing nirvana to shut down recording on april 8 the group headed to milwaukee to kick off an extensive midwest and east coast tour of 24 shows in 39 days 11 vig was told that the group would come back to record more songs but the producer did not hear anything for a while 2 with the band parting ways with drummer chad channing after the tour additional recording was put on hold instead nirvana used the sessions as a demo tape to shop for a new label within a few months the tape was circulating amongst major labels creating a buzz around the group 12after signing to dgc a number of producers for the album were suggested including scott litt david briggs and don dixon but nirvana still wanted butch vig 13 novoselic noted in 2001 that the band was already nervous about recording on a major label and the producers suggested by dgc wanted percentage points for working on the album instead the band held out for vig with whom they felt comfortable collaborating 14 afforded a budget of 65000 nirvana recorded nevermind at sound city studios in van nuys california in may and june 1991 15 nirvana was originally set to record the album during march and april 1991 but the date kept getting pushed back in spite of the bands eagerness to begin the sessions to earn gas money to get to los angeles nirvana played a show where they performed  smells like teen spirit  for the first time 2 the band sent vig some rehearsal tapes prior to the sessions that featured songs recorded previously at smart studios along with some new ones including smells like teen spirit and  come as you are  16when the group arrived in california nirvana did a few days of preproduction where the band and vig tightened up some of the song arrangements 17 the only recording carried over from the smart studios sessions was the song polly which included cymbal crashes performed by chad channing once recording commenced the band worked eight to ten hours a day the band members tended to take two or three tries at instrumental takes if the takes were not satisfactory at that point they would move on to something else 18 the group had rehearsed the songs so much before recording started that often only a few takes were needed 14 cobain used a variety of guitars from stratocasters to jaguars and novoselic used a black 1979 and natural 1976 gibson ripper novoselic and grohl finished their bass and drum tracks in a matter of days but cobain had to work longer on guitar overdubs singing and particularly lyrics which sometimes were finished mere minutes before recording 19 cobains phrasing was so consistent on various takes that vig would mix the takes together to create overdubs 18 vig says that he often had to trick cobain into recording additional takes for overdubs since the singer was averse to performing multiple takes in particular vig convinced cobain to doubletrack his vocals on the song in bloom by telling him  john lennon did it 2 while the sessions went well generally vig said cobain would become moody and difficult at times hed be great for an hour and then hed sit in a corner and say nothing for an hour 5after the recording sessions were completed vig and the band set out to mix the album however after a few days both vig and the band members realized that they were unhappy with how the mixes were turning out as a result they decided to call in someone else to oversee the mixing with geffen records imprint dgc supplying a list of possible options the list contained several familiar names including scott litt known for his work with r e m and ed stasium known for his work with the ramones and the smithereens however cobain feared that bringing in known mixers would result in the album sounding like the work of those bands instead cobain chose andy wallace who had coproduced slayer s 1990 album seasons in the abyss from the bottom of the list 20 novoselic recalled we said right on because those slayer records were so heavy 21 wallace ran the songs through various special effects boxes and tweaked the drum sounds completing about one mix per day 22 both wallace and vig noted years later that upon hearing wallaces work the band loved the mixes 23 after the albums release however members of nirvana expressed dissatisfaction with the polished sound the mixer had given nevermind cobain said in come as you are looking back on the production of nevermind im embarrassed by it now its closer to a mötley crüe record than it is a punk rock record 22nevermind was mastered on the afternoon of august 2 at the mastering lab in hollywood california howie weinberg started working alone when no one else showed up at the appointed time in the studio by the time nirvana andy wallace and gary gersh arrived weinberg had mastered most of the album 24 one of the songs mastered at the session a hidden track called endless nameless intended to appear at the end of something in the way was accidentally left off initial pressings of the album weinberg recalled in the beginning it was kind of a verbal thing to put that track at the end maybe i misconstrued their instructions so you can call it my mistake if you want maybe i didnt write it down when nirvana or the record company said to do it so when they pressed the first twenty thousand or so cds albums and cassettes it wasnt on there when the band discovered the songs omission after listening to its copy of the album cobain called weinberg and demanded he rectify the mistake 25 weinberg complied and added about ten minutes of silence between the end of something in the way and the start of the hidden track on future pressings of the album 26music  editcome as you area sample of  come as you are  the second single from nevermind guitarist kurt cobain uses a chorus pedal when playing his guitar creating a watery effect pollya sample of  polly  which was inspired by a news article cobain had read about the abduction torture and rape in june 1987 of a 14yearold girl by gerald arthur friend problems playing these files see media help cobain nirvanas main songwriter fashioned chord sequences using primarily power chords and wrote songs that combined pop hooks with dissonant guitar riffs his aim for nevermind s material was to sound like  the knack and the bay city rollers getting molested by black flag and black sabbath  27 many of the songs on nevermind feature shifts in dynamics where the band changes from quiet verses to loud choruses dave grohl said this approach originated during a fourmonth period prior to the recording of the album where the band would experiment with extreme dynamics during regular jam sessions 28 however the smart studios recordings of songs such as  lithium  and  in bloom  show the band was writing songs in that style long before grohl had joined the band guitar world wrote kurt cobains guitar sound on nirvanas nevermind set the tone for nineties rock music on nevermind cobain played a 1960s fender mustang a fender jaguar with di marzio pickups and a few fender stratocasters with humbucker bridge pickups the guitarist used distortion and chorus pedals as his main effects the latter used to generate a watery sound on come as you are and the prechoruses of smells like teen spirit 29 krist novoselic tuned down his bass guitar one and a half steps to d flat to get this fatass sound 14lyrics  editgrohl has said that cobain told him music comes first and lyrics come second and grohl believes that above all cobain focused on the melodies of his songs 2 cobain was still working on the albums lyrics well into the recording of nevermind additionally cobains phrasing on the album is often difficult to understand vig asserted that clarity of cobains singing was not paramount vig said even though you couldnt quite tell what he was singing about you knew it was intense as hell 2 cobain would later complain when rock journalists attempted to decipher his singing and extract meaning from his lyrics writing why in the hell do journalists insist on coming up with a secondrate freudian evaluation of my lyrics when 90 percent of the time theyve transcribed them incorrectly 30charles r cross asserted in his 2001 biography of cobain heavier than heaven that many of the songs written for nevermind were about cobains dysfunctional relationship with tobi vail after their relationship ended cobain began writing and painting violent scenes many of which revealed a hatred for himself and others songs written during this period were less violent but still reflected anger absent from cobains earlier songs cross wrote in the four months following their breakup kurt would write a half dozen of his most memorable songs all of them about tobi vail drain you begins with the line one baby to another said im lucky to have met you quoting what vail had once told cobain and the line it is now my duty to completely drain you refers to the power vail had over cobain in their relationship according to novoselic lounge act is about tobi and the song contains the line ill arrest myself ill wear a shield referring to cobain having the k records logo tattooed on his arm to impress vail though lithium had been written before cobain knew vail the lyrics of the song were changed to reference her 31 cobain also said in an interview with musician that some of my very personal experiences like breaking up with girlfriends and having bad relationships feeling that death void that the person in the song is feeling–very lonely sick 32title and artwork  editthe albums tentative title sheep was something cobain created as an inside joke directed towards the people he expected to buy the album he wrote a fake advertisement for sheep in his journal that read because you want to not because everyone else is 33 novoselic said the inspiration for the title was the bands cynicism about the publics reaction to operation desert storm 14 as recording sessions for the album were completed cobain grew tired of the title and suggested to novoselic that the new album be named nevermind cobain liked the title because it was a metaphor for his attitude on life and because it was grammatically incorrect 34the nevermind album cover shows a naked baby boy alone underwater with a us dollar bill on a fishhook just out of his reach according to cobain he conceived of the idea while watching a television program on water births with grohl cobain mentioned it to geffens art director robert fisher fisher found some stock footage of underwater births but they were too graphic for the record company furthermore the stock house that controlled the photo of a swimming baby that they subsequently settled on wanted 7500 a year for its use instead fisher sent a photographer kirk weddle to a pool for babies to take pictures five shots resulted and the band settled on the image of a fourmonthold infant named spencer elden the son of weddles friend 35 however there was some concern because eldens penis was visible in the image geffen prepared an alternate cover without the penis as they were afraid that it would offend people but relented when cobain made it clear that the only compromise he would accept was a sticker covering the penis that would say if youre offended by this you must be a closet pedophile 36the back cover of the album features a photograph of a rubber monkey in front of a collage created by cobain the collage features photos of raw beef from a supermarket advertisement images from dantes inferno and pictures of diseased vaginas from cobains collection of medical photos cobain noted if you look real close there is a picture of kiss in the back standing on a slab of beef 37 the albums liner notes contain no complete song lyrics instead the liner contains random song lyrics and unused lyrical fragments that cobain arranged into a poem 38for the 10th 17th and 25th anniversaries of the album spencer elden recreated the front cover shot for photographers each time he wanted to do the 25th anniversary shoot nude but the photographer preferred that he wore swim shorts 39 in 2003 he also appeared on the cover of c evin key s album the dragon experience 40release  editnevermind was released on september 24 1991 american record stores received an initial shipment of 46251 copies 41 while 35000 copies were shipped in the united kingdom where bleach had been successful 42 the lead single smells like teen spirit had been released on september 10 with the intention of being a basebuilding cut among alternative rock fans while the next single  come as you are  would be the song that would possibly garner more attention 43 the band set out on a short american tour four days before the release date to support the album geffen records hoped that nevermind would sell around 250000 copies which was the same level the record company had achieved with sonic youths geffen debut goo 44 the best estimate was that if all involved worked hard the record could possibly be certified gold by september 1992 45the album debuted on the billboard 200 at number 144 46 geffen shipped about half of the initial us pressing to the american northwest where it sold out quickly and was unavailable for days geffen reputedly put production of all other albums on hold in order to fulfill demand in the region 47 nevermind was already selling well but over the next few months the momentum increased significantly as smells like teen spirit unexpectedly became more and more popular the songs video had received a world premiere on mtv s late night alternative show 120 minutes but it soon proved so popular that the channel began playing it during the day 48 the record was soon certified gold but the band was relatively uninterested in the achievement novoselic recalled yeah i was happy about it it was pretty cool it was kind of neat but i dont give a shit about some kind of achievement like that its cool—i guess 49as the band set out for their european tour at the start of november 1991 nevermind entered the billboard top 40 for the first time at number 35 by this point smells like teen spirit had become a genuine hit and the album was selling so fast none of geffens marketing strategies aimed at different sales levels could be enacted geffen president ed rosenblatt told the new york times we didnt do anything it was just one of those get out of the way and duck records 50 nirvana found as they toured europe during the end of 1991 that the shows were dangerously oversold television crews became a constant presence onstage and smells like teen spirit was almost omnipresent on radio and music television 51nevermind became nirvanas first number one album on january 11 1992 replacing michael jackson at the top of the billboard charts by this time nevermind was selling approximately 300000 copies a week 52 come as you are was finally released as the second single in march 1992 also becoming a hit it peaked at number nine on the uk singles chart and at number 32 on the billboard hot 100 singles chart 53 two more singles lithium and in bloom were released from the album which peaked at number 11 and 28 on the uk singles chart respectively 54nevermind was certified gold and platinum by the recording industry association of america in november 1991 and was certified diamond in march 1999 55 it was also certified diamond in canada 1000000 units sold by the canadian recording industry association in march 2001 56 and five times platinum in the united kingdom 57 in 1996 mobile fidelity sound labs released nevermind on vinyl as part of its anadisq 200 series and as a 24 carat gold compact disc the cd pressings included endless nameless the lp version quickly sold out its limited pressing but the cd edition stayed in print for years 58 in 2009 original recordings group released nevermind on limited edition 180g blue vinyl and regular 180g black vinyl mastered

with long lead times for publication as well as magazines in the seattle area the unexpectedly positive feedback from critics who had received the album convinced the label to consider increasing the albums original print run 42at first nevermind did not receive many reviews and many publications ignored the album months after its release and after smells like teen spirit garnered airplay print media organizations were scrambling to cover the phenomenon the album had become however by that point much of the attention fell on cobain rather than the album itself the reviews that did initially appear were largely positive 71 karen schoemer of the new york times wrote with nevermind nirvana has certainly succeeded there are enough intriguing textures mood shifts instrumental snippets and inventive word plays to provide for hours of entertainment schoemer concluded nevermind is more sophisticated and carefully produced than anything peer bands like dinosaur jr and mudhoney have yet offered 72entertainment weekly gave nevermind an a– rating and reviewer david browne argued that on nevermind nirvana never entertain the notion of wanting to sound normal compared to other contemporary alternative bands 65 concluding his very enthusiastic review for the british melody maker everett true wrote that when nirvana released bleach all those years ago the more sussed among us figured they had the potential to make an album that would blow every other contender away my god have they proved us right 73 spin gave nevermind a favorable review stating that youll be humming all the songs for the rest of your life—or at least until your cdtapealbum wears out 74 select compared the band to janes addiction sonic youth and the pixies stating that the album proves that nirvana truly belong in such high company 70some of the reviews were not entirely positive rolling stone originally gave the album three out of five stars 75 reviewer ira robbins wrote if nirvana isnt onto anything altogether new nevermind does possess the songs character and confident spirit to be much more than a reformulation of college radios highoctane hits 68 the boston globe was less enthusiastic about the album reviewer steve morse wrote most of nevermind is packed with generic punkpop that had been done by countless acts from iggy pop to the red hot chili peppers  and added the band has little or nothing to say settling for moronic ramblings by singerlyricist cobain 75nevermind was voted as the best album of the year in the village voice pazz  jop critics poll smells like teen spirit also topped the single of the year and video of the year polls 76 nevermind topped the poll by a large majority and village voice critic robert christgau wrote in his companion piece to the poll as a modest pop surprise they might have scored a modest victory like de la soul in 1990 instead their multiplatinum takeover constituted the first fullscale public validation of the amerindie values—the noise the toons the tude—the radder half of the pazz  jop poll electorate came up on 77legacy  editbassist krist novoselic at a nevermind 20th anniversary show in 2011nevermind not only popularized the seattle grunge movement but also brought alternative rock as a whole into the mainstream establishing its commercial and cultural viability 78 nevermind  s success surprised nirvanas contemporaries who felt dwarfed by its impact fugazi s guy picciotto later commented it was like our record could have been a hobo pissing in the forest for the amount of impact it had  it felt like we were playing ukuleles all of a sudden because of the disparity of the impact of what they did 79 karen schoemer of the new york times added that whats unusual about nirvanas nevermind is that it caters to neither a mainstream audience nor the indie rock fans who supported the groups debut album 80 in 1992 jon pareles of the new york times described that in the aftermath of the albums breakthrough suddenly all bets are off no one has the inside track on which of dozens perhaps hundreds of ornery obstreperous unkempt bands might next appeal to the mallwalking millions record company executives offered large advances and record deals to bands and previous strategies of building audiences for alternative rock bands had been replaced by the opportunity to achieve mainstream popularity quickly 81michael azerrad argued in his nirvana biography come as you are the story of nirvana 1993 that nevermind marked an epochal generational shift in music similar to the rockandroll explosion in the 1950s and the end of the baby boomer generations dominance of the musical landscape azerrad wrote  nevermind came along at exactly the right time this was music by for and about a whole new group of young people who had been overlooked ignored or condescended to 82 in its citation placing it at number 17 in its 2003 list of the 500 greatest albums of all time rolling stone said no album in recent history had such an overpowering impact on a generation—a nation of teens suddenly turned punk—and such a catastrophic effect on its main creator 83 gary gersh who signed nirvana to geffen records added that there is a prenirvana and postnirvana record businessnevermind showed that this wasnt some alternative thing happening off in a corner and then back to reality this is reality 84nevermind has continued to garner critical praise since its release the album was listed at number 17 on rolling stone  s list  the 500 greatest albums of all time  83 rolling stone also rated nevermind as the number one best album of the 1990s calling it the album that guaranteed the nineties would not suck 85 time placed nevermind which writer josh tyrangiel called the finest album of the 90s on its 2006 list of the alltime 100 albums 86 pitchfork named the album the sixth best of the decade noting that anyone who hates this record today is just trying to be cool and needs to be trying harder 87 in 2006 readers of guitar world ranked nevermind 8th on a list of the 100 greatest guitar recordings 88entertainment weekly named it the 10th best album of all time on their 2013 list
