the taste of chaos concert takes place thursday evening at sherman theater’s summer stage in mount pocono john j moser contact reporter of the morning call when seminal emo band dashboard confessional went on hiatus in 2010 — exhausted by recording a halfdozen albums and playing 200 to 300 shows a year for a decade — frontman chris carrabba expected the group would return to a smaller audience what i expected when i finally got the desire to come back and do dashboard was that we had driven ourselves to the bottom because you cant walk away in this business and expect that when you come back anybody will care carrabba says with a laugh calling from the road somewhere in middle tennessee im not a dummy — i knew that was like oh well now well come back and maybe well be where what our original goal was — which was we got into clubs and maybe thats not the worst thing in the world instead when dashboard confessional returned in 2014 to play chicagos riot festival then went on a tour with third eye blind in 2015 carrabba says it found crowds as big and as enthusiastic as when it had left that response has put dashboard confessional at the top of the bill for this summers taste of chaos tour which also returned last year after a fiveyear break its supported by other emo bands taking back sunday saosin and the early november the tour comes to the sherman theater summer stage at pocono mountain carnival grounds in mount pocono on thursday and at philadelphias festival pier at penns landing on june 19 it also has spurred carrabba into what he says has been a particularly prolific period writing dashboard confessional songs the group released a surprise single the acoustic may on may 19 — the bands first new music since the 2009 album alter the ending i was purely shocked — i just didnt expect it carrabba says of the fan interest at riot fest the fans walked over to our stage and instantly brought us back it was incredible and when we went out on the summer tour last year and we didnt start from the bottom shockingly we ended up in amphitheaters thats the most astounding thing probably in my whole career … somehow we went away at a high point and came back at the high point i just dont get it its just the passion that these fans have they continue to feel that passion was a trait of the emo scene which also produced bands such as jimmy eat world and saves the day in the early 2000s if you can recall to those days to when we started the state of radio did not predict that bands like dashboard and taking back sunday my chemical romance or anything like that would — that we could — be played on the radio carrabba says but our fans were very active there were no passive fans of the scene they were — oh god i dont even know how to say it — tirelessly promoting us even to this day you gotta hear this you just have to hear you have to see this please come with me you know dashboard confessional not only was at the forefront of the scene — it released the genredefining album the swiss army romance initially a carrabba side project while he was in the band further seems forever dashboard confessional also had perhaps the most success producing three gold albums two of which — 2003s a mark a mission a brand a scar and 2006s dusk and summer — hit no 2 on billboards overall albums chart and topped the indie and rock charts the group also had a platinum album from a 2002 appearance on mtv unplugged yet carrabba notes the band never had a hit song i mean to have plaques — platinum and gold records — on the wall with no hits thats the real testament to that fan base they did that he says we just made sure we went out we played our hearts out and really did play like honestly and truly from the heart but constant touring eventually left him and fellow band members scott schoenbeck mike marsh and john leffler feeling the group was headed for burnout carrabba says we had to say to ourselves do we need a break and the answer was yes he says it wasnt that we needed a break from music i think we needed a break from delivering this same music every night because we were exhausted im not gonna lie it leaves us with the possibility that our next tour would be the one where we might be phoning it in and we dont get that luxury thats when our fans say nope i dont buy it anymore and it was not a risk worth taking so we decided we just better go on hiatus until we feel like were able to give this everything weve got and everything those fans earned through their passion carrabba did a 2010 reunion tour with further seems forever then did a solo tour to mark the 10 t h anniversary of the swiss army romance which he recorded solo before building the band around him carrabba also in 2011 formed another band twin forks that played americana and folk rock and released a wellreceived selftitled album in 2014 that was important for me he says that was really the piece that led back to dashboard confessional i got back in a van and i started touring really small clubs started opening for other bands he says tried to keep my name or musical history out of the press a little bit when it came to previewing the shows so that we could really just go out and be an unknown band and just to fight for it i really love that i could go out there and start over from the bottom i couldnt have done that with dashboard carrabba says that when dashboard got the invitation to play riot fest the band thought it would be a onetime reunion but the crowd response brought a flood of offers and the band realized it was back in 2015 it toured with third eye blind which carrabba says was a great summer we really had fun but he said it started him thinking about touring with other bands from the emo scene this summer and when he talked about that idea at the taste of chaos festival the other bands jumped aboard i think that got everybodys wheels spinning because the festival was so great carrabba says taste of chaos founders john reese and kevin lymon who also started the warped tour were a good match carrabba says the tour kicked off june 2 and is scheduled to play more than 35 dates through july 16 last summers tour was just incredible — invigorating in every sense of the word carrabba says and he returned home and for the very first time in a long time without any intention wrote a song that was a dashboard song i know the difference i know when a song is a dashboard song it had been a long time since those just came out he says im being completely honest with you i could have forced things out and made it sound like dashboard — i mean i intimately know what that sound is but those ones never resonate in the long term so i just wait around carrabba says songs havent stopped pouring out since though he didnt talk about it until recently i think the anonymity working without presenting that im working on something has been very liberating its been effective he says its allowed me to just write songs that seem to mean something to me and seem to mean something to each other in other words theres some kind of i dont know loose thematic string kind of tying them he says its starting to look like ive written a record or ive recorded a record or nearly recorded a record … and i honestly think its — is it awful to say i think its really great i dont care if it awful i think its great its great so im excited asked whether dashboards sound has evolved or matured carrabba says is it ok to say all of the above dashboard has a thing and it sounds like that thing but of course ive matured as a person and a writer the band has matured as a band that might sound so good theyre going to pull out every trick we know but part of that maturity is like knowing when enough is enough too and not overdoing it or overproducing stuff knowing when something should simply just be an acoustic guitar and a vocal … i think thats where were at right now carrabba says he has no idea when an album will come out and im kind of happy that i dont theres not any overriding pressure he says dashboard confessional fans are pretty vocal about wanting new songs but i think im in a lucky place where us being back is still new enough that theyre getting some satisfaction from that so hearing new music is more of a desire than a demand i think well beat the clock he says with a laugh i think before they need something out or i quit well have it out johnmosermcallcom twitter johnjmoser6108206722dashboard confessionaltaste of chaos tourwith taking back sunday saosin and the early november• when
