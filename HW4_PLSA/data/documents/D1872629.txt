koodo mobile review better than telus but beware of the koodo tab first published on april 9 2008koodo mobile a subsidiary of telus is the new kid on the block in the canadian cell phone scene its loud print tv and transit ads not to mention the silly promotion on the street where they gave away head bands signal that telus is aggressively going after the “nofrills” cell phone service market of players like virgin mobile and pay as you go providers using an ironic pitch that goes against what many people dislike about telus itself there is actually a lot to like about koodo mobile it has no system access fee that bogus monthly fee that is usually around 7 and no 911 fee with persecond billing call forwarding call waiting and conference calling included that’s certainly a good start you might find the 20 and up deals to suit your needs with included features like free evenings and weekends the koodo mobile website is clear and easy to use so you can mess around with the different plans and addons the cheapest 15 plan which gives you 50 minutes and 50 text messages is not that good of a deal for light users remember that unlike a pay as you go or “prepaid” plan if you use only 30 minutes of airtime in a month your 20 extra minutes are gone and minutes over the alloted bundle are 35 cents per minute unlike the cheaper rates of 20 or 25 cents per minute of pay as you go plans i’ve noticed a few things that prospective koodoers should keep in mind the long distance rate presumably for calls made to canada and the usa is an extra 035 per minute call display and voice mail cost extra on all plans koodo runs on the telus cdma network for travellers this means that you cannot use your phone overseas with foreign sim cards the koodo tab is in my opinion just a reformulation of those contracts that everybody dreads in the longterm it is slightly better than a contract consider the scenario where you buy a phone at a discount because you start a 150 koodo tab if you have a 45 monthly plan you can deduct 10 of it or 450 from the tab every month this means that you have to stay with the 45 plan for 34 months almost three years before you completely pay off the tab if you only have a 50 tab and a 25 monthly plan this is paid off in over 15 years the reason why this is better than a contract is that you only have to pay the remaining balance on your tab if you decide to leave early august 6 2008 due to the number of comments on this post all discussion about koodo mobile has been moved to the forum forumtopic started last post posts koodo mobile koodo sucksjanuary 15 2009 1244 pm by koodo sucks august 15 2014 1237 pm by klee160koodo mobile continued to bill the customer after cancallation august 15 2014 1245 am by klee august 15 2014 1245 am by klee1koodo mobilekoodoo customer service january 25 2013 304 pm by linda january 25 2013 304 pm by linda1koodo mobile complaints august 7 2008 638 pm by peter january 14 2013 837 am by robin98koodo mobile changing my number on self serve september 6 2009 1049 am by tommy moran november 30 2012 149 pm by j4related posts send free sms in canada to bell fido rogers virgin solo and telus cell phones through the internet jajah mobile plugin my mostly positive experience in europe this entry is filed under telephony vancouver  bc  canada and written by peter keung  you can follow any responses to this entry through the rss 20 feed
