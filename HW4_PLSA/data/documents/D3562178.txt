science  mathematics chemistry can anyone help with chemistry i need help with my chemistry homework if you could explain how you got to the answer instead of just giving the answers i would really appreciate it i dont really understand most of this so any help you could give would be awesome thanks write a balanced chemical equation for the reaction that occurs show more follow 1 answer answers best answer 4 al 3 br2 2 al2br3 in order to do this synthesis reaction you need to know that aluminum compounds always have a charge of 3 and bromides which form from the reaction of a metal and bromine always have a charge of 1 th charge of he compound that is formed always is a net zero charge so 2 aluminum cations are 2 3  6 and 6 bromide anions are 6 1  6 6  6  0 you also need to know that bromine is a diatomic element which is why it is always written as br2 now you just balance the equation so that you have the same number of atoms on each side sr co3  sr o  co2 this one is easy as youre already told the products and it is balanced as is metal carbonates in group two all decompose in this fashion this is a hydrocarbon combustion and they all burn to carbon dioxide and water assuming there is sufficient oxygen c7h16  11 o2  7 co2  8 h2o you balance this by noticing that there are 7 cs on the left side so put a 7 in front of co2 on the right also there are 16 hs on the left so put 8 in front of water on the right now count the number of os on the right there are 14 from co2 and 8 from water making a total of 22 atoms oxygen is a diatomic gas o2 so to balance it we need to put an 11 in front of o2 to gives us 22 oxygen atoms the combustion of dimethyl ether is similar to a hydrocarbon combustion in that the products are still co2 and h2o c2h6o  3 o2  2 co2  3 h2o balancing this is easy there are 2 cs on the left side so put a 2 in front of co2 on the right there are 6 hs on the left so put a 3 in front of h2o on the right count the oxygens on the right  2 2  3 1  7 putting a 3 in front of o2 on the left gives you six os and the seventh comes from the sole oxygen in dimethyl ether doc Â· 7 years ago0 0 comment maybe you would like to learn more about one of these find moving container services looking for a new chandelier should you donate your car look for franchises for sale
