server fault is a question and answer site for system and network administrators join them it only takes a minute sign up heres how it works anybody can ask a question anybody can answer the best answers are voted up and rise to the top dynamics crm 2013 on premise workflow performanceup vote0down votefavorite we are speaking of the time it takes for the workflow state machine to notice that task a is complete thus satisfying a wait condition in a workflow definition which then creates task b user1 marks task a complete  it takes between 2  20 minutes for task b to be created here is what i’ve learned the most common solution found on the forums is to cleanup the async operation base table it is said that performance will suffer if this table contains  1 million rows however ours only contains 22k with crm 2013 ms created a new type of workflow called “real time workflows” these are the ones without the check next to “run this workflow in the background” we cannot use those because real time workflows cannot have wait conditions in crm 2011 it was usually just a few seconds before the state machine noticed a task complete  created the next one it seems that with the introduction of real time the other types are even further “in the background” … the most pertinent statement to this effect is from the url below “background workflows are generally recommended because they allow the system to apply them as resources on the server are available this helps smooth out the work the server has to do and help maintain the best performance for everyone using the system the drawback is that actions defined by background workflows are not immediate you can’t predict when they will be applied but generally it will take a few minutes”is there any possible solution using which the workflow process will help create task b in lesser timeperformance crm microsoftdynamicsgpshare improve this questionasked sep 12 14 at 1603user35994101 1add a comment1 answer active oldest votesup vote0down vote what are the specifications of your microsoft sql server ie ram disk and cpu how many microsoft crm users do you have both licensed and typical concurrent while not typically a factor in slow workflow performance if the microsoft crm server is underpowered it could affect how fast the workflows are processed too what are the hardware specifications of the microsoft crm server cpu ram it sounds like you may have a sql server performance problem but the real way to identify that is through capturing some data and analyzing it you should capture 515 minutes of data with the sql server pss perf wait stats trace tool available here  httpsqlnexuscodeplexcomwikipagetitlesql2005perf stats scriptreferring titlehome and can analyze it with sqlnexus available at httpsqlnexuscodeplexcom typically there are a few key missing indexes that if added to the microsoft crm database will take care of most performance problems depending on the ram on the sql server and if it is shared with microsoft crm andor other services you may need to consider either moving sql server to a dedicated machine andor to upgrade the ram or disk system on it for more optimal performance if you want to get more specific numbers and data from the workflows that have completed you can get the actual processing time crm on premise only using the sql query below to run against your mscrm database ie contosomscrm uncomment and enter in the name of your workflow if wishing to only see instances of your workflow that was mentioned above note that the time to process below is
