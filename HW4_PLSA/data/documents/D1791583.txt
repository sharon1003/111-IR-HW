guide overwatch overwatch mercy hero guide in this mercy guide we provide an overview of her strengths abilities talents and matchupsby lewis burnell on jul 11 2017mercy was once one of the strongest support heroes in overwatch able to deal damage with her caduceus blaster heal her teammates or boost their damage there’s little wonder she’s popular although she lacks the mobility of lucio she can heal single targets far better than he can her caduceus staff can heal or boost the damage output of a single hero and as a channeled ability similar to the medic in team fortress 2 she offers excellent single target healing with correct positioning and if she follows behind a tank especially roadhog or reinhardt she dramatically increases her teams push potential the official blizzard site shows her as a 1 star hero easy to play however this isnt necessarily true to play mercy well requires incredible positioning and awareness unsurprisingly and due to the fact mercy is almost entirely support based she’s incredibly limited when she isn’t assisting her team although her caduceus blaster deals reasonable damage she really can’t survive against most enemy heroes 1 on 1 fortunately for her she has two tools that can help her angelic descent and guardian angel the former allows mercy to dramatically reduce her speed when falling from a height ensuring she has an advantage when trying to escape others while the latter allows mercy to fly towards an ally at speed both combined give her valuable means of escapeengagement and if she is caught out of position can save her life updated 11 july 2017pros cons excellent single target healing almost entirely reliant on others her allied damage boost is enormous not an overly exciting playstyle for many guardian angel offers great mobility if caught out of position she can die quite quickly her ultimate ability is a gamechanger her effectiveness is determined by the coordination of her team she can heal herself when out of combat can easily cause tunnel vision for new players lore ziegler rose to become the head of surgery at a prominent swiss hospital before pioneering a breakthrough in the field of applied nanobiology that radically improved the treatment of lifethreatening illnesses and injuries it was this expertise that attracted the attention of overwatch because her parents had been taken by war ziegler was opposed to the organizations militaristic approach to keeping global peace ultimately she recognized that overwatch offered her the opportunity to save lives on a much larger scale as overwatchs head of medical research angela sought to leverage her work for healing in frontline crises the result was the valkyrie swiftresponse suit which ziegler herself piloted on many overwatch missions despite her contributions to overwatch she was often at odds with her superiors and the organizations overarching aims when the group was faced with a series of allegations ziegler was interrogated in the hearings conducted by the united nations in light of the fight between overwatch members john morrison and gabriel reyes ziegler admitted that the outcome had been inevitable they had drifted further and further apart ever since morrison had been chosen over reyes for the position of strike commander and that rift has widened despite her efforts abilities angelic descent passive  allowing mercy to descend slowly from any height you might think a trait such as this is bizarre in a game that doesn’t have falling damage while that’s somewhat right its purpose is to allow mercy to jump greater distances or to keep up with heroes such as pharah combined with guardian angel see below she can comfortably fly up glide down and fly back up instead of dropping like a stone to activate angelic descent simply press and hold the jump button to begin slowly falling to the ground to end the passive ability simply let go of the jump button finally and as an undocumented addition her passive ability also allows her to regenerate health if she doesn’t take damage for 3 seconds caduceus staff lmbrmb  capable of firing two types of beam at her allies caduceus staff provides a continuous stream of healing to allies mercy targets healing them for 60 hps if she uses her alternative fire she can boost their damage output by 30 as long as she maintains the beam on them switching between both beam types regularly is key to playing mercy as knowing when to heal or boost the damage of an ally can often clinch a fight caduceus blaster  providing mercy with her only means of defence caduceus blaster is a rapid firing pistol that deals reasonable damage it’s more than capable of killing other heroes but its low damage 20 per shot compared to mc cree that deals 70 makes it much better at finishing off low health players than attempting to bring them down from full health guardian angel shift  fundamental to mercy’s playstyle guardian angel allows her to quickly fly towards an ally she targets whether it’s a teammate who’s low health or to simply escape someone that’s trying to kill you effective use of guardian angel will not only allow you to quickly reach allied players but survive when necessary guardian angel also allows mercy to follow pharah with ease as the combination of flyingslow fall allows you to remain airbourne for lengthy periods of time resurrect ultimate  probably one of the strongest ultimate abilities in the game resurrect allows mercy to revive dead teammates as long as they’re still respawning if she uses her ultimate ability near their corpse they’ll be brought back from the dead considering it brings allied heroes back to life with full health it’s more than possible to turn a match around with its use on a team wipe instantly reviving everyone  against heroes that are weakened  is exceptionally strong ability hp ammo fire rate cast time cooldownreload heals damage range caduceus staff heal 200   channelled  60

first and foremost your role is to keep your team alive and focus your attention on your frontline heroes such as your tanks or heroes that are incapable of healing themselves ensuring your tank survives will not only allow them to soak damage and push forwards but reduces the healing you’ll need to provide to the rest of your team as it currently stands there’s only two ways to play mercy due to how vulnerable she is the first is to simply stay with your team keep all their health topped up or to “pocket” another hero such as reinhardt and pharah pocketing is when you follow one hero and bolster their damage constantly healing them when necessary it’s particularly effective with high impact high burst heroes such as those two named because it allows them to deal eyewatering damage unsurprisingly mercy is a prime target for the enemy team due to the amount of healing she can provide but also because of her ability to bolster the damage of her team widowmaker genji and even winston will make it their mission to zone you out or pressure you constantly the only way to survive is to hope and rely on your team to peel for you should it come to it you can always use guardian angel to quickly fly away finally and when it comes to using your ultimate it really needs to be at a time where your team will gain maximum value from it reviving just one fallen player isn’t usually worthwhile but if that one player happens to be your tank and the rest of your team are alive and making a push it could just be matchups heroes listed here are particularly challenging for mercy while those listed can still be killed they pose a particularly difficult challenge for him so be sure to take extra care mercy is weak against threat reaper the fact he can appear from nowhere makes reaper particularly difficult to deal with especially if hes out of your line of sight if he has his ultimate ready you and those around you are going to die try to use guardian angel to leap away quickly710soldier 76 although the fact he attacks from range works in your favor he can quickly cut you down if he catches up to you in mid range try to juke his shots from afar and stay near your tank810pharah her ranged poke and aerial mobility is amazing and theres nothing you can do to prevent it if shes positioning herself behind you and your team you should find cover or use your team as damage sponges to preserve your own life910tracer a huge headache to deal with due to her speed and mobility tracer can easily zip towards you  drop her ultimate ability  and recall away when needed910genji similarly to tracer genji will always try to harrass you hes slightly worse off that tracer however because he lacks the ease of engage and if youre near your team he may struggle to find an entry point810winston his leap combined with his tesla cannon can quickly cut your health and theres very little you co do if his team follow him in things will go south very quickly810tips this list of tips and tricks are just a handful of things we think will help your mercy play well continue to add to the list as required and if you have any tips youd like to share let us know in the comments below and well place them here1 in an emergency you should change to your blaster against low health players it can easily finish them off2 you should always give priority to your tank especially on payload escort but keep the rest of your team topped up when they need it3 your damage boost is incredible with hard hitting heroes such as pharah or widowmaker it also works exceptionally well with bastion and roadhog4 guardian angel is your main leap that allows you to quickly travel to an ally whether its to reach them in order to heal or to escape choosing the right target and the right time is incredibly important5 your passive can be particularly value when using guardian angel as it allows you to fly high but descend slowly  alternating both can keep you afloat6 your ultimate ability is best used on a capture point or next to a payload when multiple allies have fallen try to position yourself where youll be safe as it causes you to remain immobile when being used7 try to encourage your team to work together if youre on defence have reinhardt and bastion setup together with you the three combined are absolutely hellish to fight again8 as support and when healing or damage boosting youre a second pair of eyes for the hero youre looking after be sure to look for threats position yourself to reduce risk from them and warn your team of the danger9 your resurrect ability your ultimate resets guardian angel allowing you to fly in resurrect and fly out immediately to an ally10 you can cancel guardian angel by pressing it again11 you can cancel your resurrection animation by pulling out your pistol take advantage of this by firing on enemies as your allies come back from the dead12 stay with the group flying off to help the lone wolf player only puts you in a position with no escape route13 when boosting a pharah remember that your boost affects the rocket on impact not when it is fired14 only use resurrect if it will give your team an advantage rezzing into more deaths is a huge nono15 only use resurrect if the location you are rezzing into can be held16 turn toggle guardian angel off in mercys personal settings  options  controls this will allow you to hold shift and fly immediately as a teammate comes into line of sight it also allows you to stop flying by releasing the shift key17 hiding makes sense if you are going to lose the fight but dont hide in a 5050 team fight you just give the other team a 5v6 opportunity which you will then rez into your stream of healing is powerful use it18 pharmercy is powerful but dont permanently attach yourself to her you are part of a team19 dont rez if your team has already won the fight20 if your team is going to die let them all die at the same time topping off the tank just to watch the critically injured dps die is just poor play21 you can kill torbjorn’s turret with your blaster from outside of his turrets range22 be careful when using guardian angel as it can sometimes put you in a worse position if it causes you to overextend23 you do not have to constantly look at your ally when casting your beam at them as long as you hold the button down and you’re near them you can look around for dangers24 when low health find cover and allow your passive to regenerate your health skins emotes victory poses and voice lines unlock cost notes skins classic 0
