concept 1 review a closer look energy and atpthe atp molecule can store energy in the form of a high energy phosphate bond joining the terminal phosphate group to the rest of the molecule in this form energy can be stored at one location then moved from one part of the cell to another where it can be released to drive other biochemical reactions the energy stored in atp at one location is released from atp when the terminal phosphate bond is broken in this process a phosphate group is detached to yield inorganic phosphate and adp and results in the liberation of 73 kcalmol under standard conditions to see the process point to the image below as you move your mouse over the image the terminal phosphate group forms a high energy phosphate bond with the molecule thus creating the triphosphate tail of atp please visit the phosphate groups and nucleotides lab simulations for more information on the chemical energy of atp be sure to use your browsers back button to return to this page‚Üê back to review
