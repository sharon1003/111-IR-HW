controversial it generally refers at least to the cultures of virtual communities but extends to a wide range of cultural issues relating to  cyber topics eg cybernetics and the perceived or predicted cyborgization of the human body and human society itself it can also embrace associated intellectual and cultural movements such as cyborg theory and cyberpunk the term often incorporates an implicit anticipation of the future the oxford english dictionary lists the earliest usage of the term cyberculture in 1963 when a m hilton wrote the following in the era of cyberculture all the plows pull themselves and the fried chickens fly right onto our plates 3 this example and all others up through 1995 are used to support the definition of cyberculture as the social conditions brought about by automation and computerization 3 the american heritage dictionary broadens the sense in which cyberculture is used by defining it as the culture arising from the use of computer networks as for communication entertainment work and business 4 however what both the oed and the american heritage dictionary miss is that cyberculture is the culture within and among users of computer networks this cyberculture may be purely an online culture or it may span both virtual and physical worlds this is to say that cyberculture is a culture endemic to online communities it is not just the culture that results from computer use but culture that is directly mediated by the computer another way to envision cyberculture is as the electronically enabled linkage of likeminded but potentially geographically disparate or physically disabled and hence less mobile persons  original research cyberculture is a wide social and cultural movement closely linked to advanced information science and information technology their emergence development and rise to social and cultural prominence between the 1960s and the 1990s cyberculture was influenced at its genesis by those early users of the internet frequently including the architects of the original project these individuals were often guided in their actions by the hacker ethic while early cyberculture was based on a small cultural sample and its ideals the modern cyberculture is a much more diverse group of users and the ideals that they espouse numerous specific concepts of cyberculture have been formulated by such authors as lev manovich 5 6 arturo escobar and fred forest 7 however most of these concepts concentrate only on certain aspects and they do not cover these in great detail some authors aim to achieve a more comprehensive understanding distinguished between early and contemporary cyberculture  jakub macek  8 or between cyberculture as the cultural context of information technology and cyberculture more specifically cyberculture studies as a particular approach to the study of the culture  technology complex david lister et al 9manifestations  editmanifestations of cyberculture include various human interactions mediated by computer networks they can be activities pursuits games places and metaphors and include a diverse base of applications some are supported by specialized software and others work on commonly accepted internet protocols example include but are not limited to blog bulletin board systems chat cybersex ecommerce games internet forums internet memes online videos peertopeer file sharing social networks usenet virtual worlds wikis qualities  editfirst and foremost cyberculture derives from traditional notions of culture as the roots of the word imply in noncyberculture it would be odd to speak of a single monolithic culture in cyberculture by extension searching for a single thing that is cyberculture would likely be problematic the notion that there is a single definable cyberculture is likely the complete dominance of early cyber territory by affluent north americans writing by early proponents of cyberspace tends to reflect this assumption see howard rheingold  10the ethnography of cyberspace is an important aspect of cyberculture that does not reflect a single unified culture it is not a monolithic or placeless cyberspace rather it is numerous new technologies and capabilities used by diverse people in diverse realworld locations it is malleable perishable and can be shaped by the vagaries of external forces on its users for example the laws of physical world governments social norms the architecture of cyberspace and market forces shape the way cybercultures form and evolve as with physical world cultures cybercultures lend themselves to identification and study there are several qualities that cybercultures share that make them warrant the prefix cyber some of those qualities are that cyberculture is a community mediated by icts is culture mediated by computer screens 10 63relies heavily on the notion of information and knowledge exchange depends on the ability to manipulate tools to a degree not present in other forms of culture even artisan culture eg a glassblowing culture allows vastly expanded weak ties and has been criticized for overly emphasizing the same see bowling alone and other works multiplies the number of eyeballs on a given problem beyond that which would be possible using traditional means given physical geographic and temporal constraints is a cognitive and social culture not a geographic one 10 61is the product of likeminded people finding a common place to interact 11 58is inherently more fragile than traditional forms of community and culture  john c dvorak  thus cyberculture can be generally defined as the set of technologies material and intellectual practices attitudes modes of thought and values that developed with cyberspace 12identity – architectures of credibility  editthis sections tone or style may not reflect the encyclopedic tone used on wikipedia see wikipedias guide to writing better articles for suggestions october 2017  learn how and when to remove this template messagecyberculture like culture in general relies on establishing identity and credibility however in the absence of direct physical interaction it could be argued that the process for such establishment is more difficult how does cyberculture rely on and establish identity and credibility this relationship is twoway with identity and credibility being both used to define the community in cyberspace and to be created within and by online communities in some senses online credibility is established in much the same way that it is established in the offline world however since these are two separate worlds it is not surprising that there are differences in their mechanisms and interactions of the markers found in each following the model put forth by lawrence lessig in code version 20 13 the architecture of a given online community may be the single most important factor regulating the establishment of credibility within online communities some factors may be anonymous versus known linked to physical identity versus internetbased identity only unrated commentary system versus rated commentary system positive feedbackoriented versus mixed feedback positive and negative oriented moderated versus unmoderated anonymous versus known  editsee also anonymous post many sites allow anonymous commentary where the userid attached to the comment is something like guest or anonymous user in an architecture that allows anonymous posting about other works the credibility being impacted is only that of the product for sale the original opinion expressed the code written the video or other entity about which comments are made eg a slashdot post sites that require known postings can vary widely from simply requiring some kind of name to be associated with the comment to requiring registration wherein the identity of the registrant is visible to other readers of the comment these known identities allow and even require commentators to be aware of their own credibility based on the fact that other users will associate particular content and styles with their identity by definition then all blog postings are known in that the blog exists in a consistently defined virtual location which helps to establish an identity around which credibility can gather conversely anonymous postings are inherently incredible note that a known identity need have nothing to do with a given identity in the physical world linked to physical identity versus internetbased identity only  editarchitectures can require that physical identity be associated with commentary as in lessigs example of counsel connect 13 94–97 however to require linkage to physical identity many more steps must be taken collecting and storing sensitive information about a user and safeguards for that collected information must be establishedthe users must have more trust of the sites collecting the information yet another form of credibility irrespective of safeguards as with counsel connect 13 94–97 using physical identities links credibility across the frames of the internet and real space influencing the behaviors of those who contribute in those spaces however even purely internetbased identities have credibility just as lessig describes linkage to a character or a particular online gaming environment nothing inherently links a person or group to their internetbased persona but credibility similar to characters is earned rather than bought and because this takes time and credibility is not fungible it becomes increasingly hard to create a new persona 13 113unrated commentary system versus rated commentary system  editin some architectures those who review or offer comments can in turn be rated by other users this technique offers the ability to regulate the credibility of given authors by subjecting their comments to direct quantifiable approval ratings positive feedbackoriented versus mixed feedback positive and negative oriented  editarchitectures can be oriented around positive feedback or a mix of both positive and negative feedback while a particular user may be able to equate fewer stars with a negative rating the semantic difference is potentially important the ability to actively rate an entity negatively may violate laws or norms that are important in the jurisdiction in which the internet property is important the more public a site the more important this concern may be as noted by goldsmith  wu regarding e bay 14moderated versus unmoderated  editarchitectures can also be oriented to give editorial control to a group or individual many email lists are worked in this fashion eg freecycle in these situations the architecture usually allows but does not require that contributions be moderated further moderation may take two different forms reactive or proactive in the reactive mode an editor removes posts reviews or content that is deemed offensive after it has been placed on the site or list in the proactive mode an editor must review all contributions before they are made public in a moderated setting credibility is often given to the moderator however that credibility can be damaged by appearing to edit in a heavyhanded way whether reactive or proactive as experienced by diggcom in an unmoderated setting credibility lies with the contributors alone the very existence of an architecture allowing moderation may lend credibility to the forum being used as in howard rheingolds examples from the well 10 or it may take away credibility as in corporate web sites that post feedback but edit it highly cyberculture studies  editsee also list of humancomputer interaction topics the field of cyberculture studies examines the topics explained above including the communities emerging within the networked spaces sustained by the use of modern technology students of cyberculture engage with political philosophical sociological and psychological issues that arise from the networked interactions of human beings by humans who act in various relations to information science and technology donna haraway sadie plant manuel de landa bruce sterling kevin kelly wolfgang schirmacher pierre levy david gunkel victor j vitanza gregory ulmer charles d laughlin and jean baudrillard are among the key theorists and critics who have produced relevant work that speaks to or has influenced studies in cyberculture following the lead of rob kitchin in his work cyberspace the world in the wires we might view cyberculture from different critical perspectives these perspectives include futurism or technoutopianism technological determinism social constructionism postmodernism poststructuralism and feminist theory 11 56–72see also  editanonymous cicada 3301cyber
