two terms are generally used when talking about broadband speeds download speed the speed at which information is transferred from the internet to your computer better download speeds mean you can get photos music and video from the internet faster than if youre using a slow connection youll also be able to watch films and tv shows online with fewer pauses for loading upload speed the speed at which information is transferred from your computer to the internet the faster the upload speed the smoother the online experience youll have upload speeds also determine how quickly you can send emails post photos on facebook or upload large videos or batches of photos to sites like you tube and flickr if youre interested in which providers have the best upload speeds you can find out in our full guide on typical home broadband upload speeds are considerably slower than download speeds so dont be alarmed if you see a disparity between the two providers give downstream data priority as most of us are more concerned with how quickly we can download stuff than how long it takes us to upload files what download and upload speeds do i get if you dont know what broadband speeds you currently get knowing whether you should switch packages to get better speeds is going to be hard work  how will you know if you can get faster broadband if you dont know how fast the broadband you have is theres a simple solution to that though  use our speed tester to find out itll tell you exactly what download and upload speeds you get and confirm whether your broadband is as fast as a ferrari fast or more like a moped in mud heres another important point  and its a biggie dont assume the speeds providers advertise are the speeds youll actually get for example if you see package advertised as offering doenload speeds of up to 16mb theres no guarantee youll get that speed the advertised speed is based on the speeds that at least 10 of the people with that package get so the chances are youll get less yes its confusing yes its stupid but those are the current advertising rules so until they change remember up to means exactly that thankfully you dont have to resort to just picking a package you like the sound of and hoping for the best thats because every six months or so ofcom  theyre the people who look after everything communicationsrelated in the uk  publishes research about home broadband speeds not only does it tell you what the average speeds in the country are so you can see how good or bad your broadband is in comparison it also gives you the average download speeds of each of the packages offered by the biggest providers you can use these to get an idea of how likely you are to get the download speeds advertised how do i get faster broadband

but a regular adsl connection is sometimes more than enough heres what you need to know adsl broadband comes entirely through the telephone line which isnt hugely efficient advertised speeds typically hover between up to 14mb and up to 18mb but youll likely see less than that remember telephone wires were designed for carrying our voices back and forth not for you to stream the east enders omnibus fibre optic broadband delivered through efficient reliable fibre optic cables advertised speeds are typically between up to 38mb and up to 300mb and more likely to be closer to the advertised up to amounts than adsl youll need to check its availabile in your area thoughits worth pointing out that fibre optic broadband packages vary as services such as bt infinity  still use a copper phone line to connect your property to the fibre network via the nearest street cabinet as a result your speeds may be slower than your neighbours if they live closer to the green box at the end of the street whats the fastest broadband in the uk virgin media  wwwvirginmediacom has the fastest widelyavailable broadband in the uk offering download of up to 300mb its not a cheap option but if its pure speed you want its most certainly the one for you not that the countrys other major providers are slouches mind you all of them now offer fibre optic broadband with bt  www btcom  plusnet  wwwplusnet  sky  wwwskycom and talk talk  wwwtalktalkcouk all offering packages with download speeds of up to 76mb if you want to see how each provider compares in a general sense ofcom the uks telecoms regulator produces a regular report about broadband speeds you can find it right here basically if you want faster download and upload speeds you more choice than ever before thats presuming of course you can get fibre not everyone can because its still a relatively new technology and hasnt yet reached every corner of the country  use our postcode checker to see if its available in your area what broadband speed do i need its easy to get hung up on broadband speeds  the faster it is the better right well… not necessarily the truth is that not everybody needs their broadband to be at the upper end of the speed scale although prices are coming down topend fibre packages are typically the most expensive broadband options out there and many users dont do anything online that requires or benefits from speeds of 100mb or more for these users it would be a bit like buying a years gym membership then only going once before throwing in the towel  why pay for something if youre not going to use it you should take the time to consider what speeds you actually need from your broadband package before making any switching decisions with that in mind heres a handy list of reasons to consider superfast fibre optic speeds do i need fibre optic broadband superfast broadband is worth considering if you have a large family or shared house with several people using the web simultaneously have lots of connected devices  laptops tablets mobiles console smart tv for example regularly download movies music and tv to watch offline use film and tv streaming sites like netflix amazon prime instant video and now tvwatch a lot of ondemand tv services like bbc i player in highdefinition hd or dont want as much buffering download and play video games that require an internet connection you currently have adsl broadband and find it just isnt fast enough for your needs if a few of these apply to you you should look at fibre broadband packages the faster the package the smoother these activities are likely to be however if you live alone or you just use the internet for light browsing social media and email for instance its worth considering cheap internet providers either way do your homework
