sites till the work is completed and fumes are cleared flooring types for families our latest tests of flooring products found some wood and bamboo winners including an oak flooring that fended off the effects of foot traffic nearly as well as the best vinyls and laminates but we also found that some bamboo cork and other “green” products can be far less robust than others however our tests that simulated exposure to scuffs scratches sunlight dents and spills also confirm that most woods and even some vinyl and laminate floors can wilt under life’s daily grind knowing how rough you’ll be can help when choosing if you’re putting down flooring in a dining room that you rarely use you can consider the top engineered wood or bamboo in our ratings both engineered products offer the beauty of natural veneer along with easy installation but if you have a busy family and you’re reflooring a hightraffic area—think dragged and dropped toys and food high chairs and spilled drinks—you’ll want durability as well as looks the best solid wood laminate and vinyl in our ratings were also best in our simulated foottraffic tests all the flooring types listed here performed adequately in our slipresistance tests though vinyl tended to provide slightly more slip resistance and engineered wood slightly less for more pros and cons about each flooring type see the types section of our buying guide flooring and childrens health here are some health issues to consider before you shop for flooring especially if you have kids vinyl floors bearing the flooring industry’s floor score certification emit relatively low levels of volatile organic compounds all the flooring models we recommend in our ratings have this certification vocs are linked to respiratory illnesses and can cause headaches and dizziness despite the versatility and durability of vinyl some groups including the nonprofit center for health environment  justice advise against buying any vinyl flooring particularly for homes with small children citing vinyl’s lead and phthalate risks we do not evaluate the lead or phthalate content of the flooring products we test lead exposure can have adverse health effects on a child’s cognitive function academic performance and endocrine systems even at blood levels lower than the government’s current allowable threshold 10 mcgd l and in january 2012 an advisory committee of the centers for disease control and prevention stated that the elimination of all lead exposure from the environment is the best course of action phthalates are a family of compounds that can be used to make plastics flexible and harder to break but many are also endocrine disruptors that can interfere with the network of hormone glands that orchestrate growth and development in 2008 the cpsc banned three types of phthalates dehp dep and bbp in children’s bedding toys and care articles and in addition banned three other phthalates dinp didp dn op in teethers toys and care articles that can be put into a baby’s mouth the eu banned these same phthlates back in 2005 some believe that the group most likely to be affected by hormone disruptors are fetuses infants and children the university of michigan formative childrens environmental health and disease prevention center warns against installing any vinyl flooring in a home flooring products certified by the independent forest stewardship council logo shown or sustainable forestry initiative provide some assurance that a wood floor is sustainably harvested or contains a portion of recycled materials but neither label takes the use of formaldehyde glues or resins into account for pressed wood or mdf products that means that even with the fsc or sfi seal those products could contain formaldehyde a volatile organic compound or vocs boards bonded with ureaformaldehyde adhesive sometimes referred to as a resin can give off formaldehyde gas find ratings flooring flooring ratings view
