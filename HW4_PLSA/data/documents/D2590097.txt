australian farming and agriculture – grazing and cropping for over 100 years from the 1840s to the 1950s the australian economy was seen to be ‘riding on the sheeps back agriculture especially wool established australia as a thriving economy with a substantial workforce service industries and large port cites australian farmer with sheep courtesy of agricorner australian agriculture benefitted from many different agricultural practices formal and informal land grants overseas capital and access to relatively cheap labour through indigenous workers and indentured schemes combined with invention ingenuity and hard work this has led to australia becoming a leading exporter of fine food meats and grains however from 1901 to 2009 there has been a dramatic decline proportionally in the income from wool and the people employed in agriculture from 14 per cent to 3 per cent at the same time there has been an increase in the head of cattle and the variety of profitable agricultural export industries most of australias agricultural products continue to be exported and farmers supply about 93 per cent of australias food there have been many changes in farming methods over the last 200 years and australian farmers have had to be adaptable as well as resilient and inventive the challenges of access to fresh water the legacy of high amounts of fertilisers massive clearing over grazing a tyranny of distance transport costs and feral animals have tested australian farmers to their limits in response farming has become more mechanised and reliant on technologies as well as holistic as it seeks to become more sustainable a stockman musters cattle photograph by gary ticehurst courtesy of abc news most of australias land about twothirds is given over to farming production about 90 per cent of farm land is for grazing on native pastures occurring mostly in the arid and semiarid zones cattle and sheep grazing is known as pastoralism and has a long history associated with rural and outback australia connecting most australians the opportunity to open up vast native grass resources as grasslands and establish native pasture for livestock grazing was due to the firestick farming carried out by aboriginal people over thousands of years later aboriginal people became the backbone of the pastoral industry fruit picker sorts apples in a tasmanian orchard april 2012 courtesy of abc news grazing continues as the highest value sector in farm production in 2012 the highest value of production in order was cattle wheat dairy vegetables fruit and nuts before lamb meat and wool at the same time most of australias agricultural businesses are involved in a ‘twolegged economy – combining wheat and sheep cropping is across a wide variety of grains and other crops in 2012 smaller agricultural practices such as fruit and nut trees grape growing sugar cane and other crop businesses represented about half the number of the total grain beef cattle and sheep businesses

agricultural development the area selected ran from port stephens to the manning river it began operations to improve the stock of merino sheep for export to britain cheap labour was sourced through convicts aboriginal workers and indentured labourers on sevenyear contracts with wool reaching record prices in europe especially during the napoleonic wars from 1803 to 1815 there was a large influx of merinos into australia by the end of the 1850s sheep numbers across australia had reached 16 million or around 39 sheep per head of population compared to around 6 sheep per head of population

and from the 1860s until the 1890s the diggings across australia saw a fresh supply of vegetables and sometimes delivery of fruit from chinese market gardeners between 1900 and 1920 the majority of vegetables grown in western australia were grown by chinese market gardeners over a third of the chinese population of western australia was involved in the market garden industry which was labour intensive and relied on farming techniques practiced in china the 1800s – natural grasslands for grazing pasture and clearing for cropping john lewin the plains bathurst depicting governor macquaries

divided into 19 counties with a description of their boundaries mitchells surveys started a land rush of people keen to settle these areas and benefit from their rich soil and open plains farming in new south wales ploughing national museum of australia farmers and pastoralists known as squatters who squatted on the land without formal land grants gradually moved inland and occupied huge areas of pasture for cropping and grazing cattle and sheep the extensive grasslands open woodlands and abundant wildlife exclaimed upon by europeans for their pastoral opportunities has been described as the biggest estate on earth the firestick farming which had created this landscape was a complex countrywide system of land management used by aboriginal people in presettlement australia further huge areas of forest and scrub land covered with low trees or shrubs were cleared for pasture and crop farming along australias coast and inland by 1860 after 70 years of european farming settlement there were 12 million acres or 480000 hectares under crop and livestock numbers had increased to 25 million head the wheat belt distribution of farm types – the rainfall lines goyders line map government of south australia the development of crops was limited by rainfall distribution in this case 12 inches 30 centimetres of rainfall a year the temperate buffer between the 20 and 12 inch rainfall lines separates the coastal areas from the semiarid zones this buffer zone suitable for cropping became known as the wheat belt the 12 inch rain fall line was marked as the goyder line in south australia this was drawn by south australias surveyorgeneral george w goyder in 1865 after two drought years to delineate cropping country from extensive grazing land in the 1870s however after a series of wet years optimistic farmers ignored goyders warnings and moved beyond the 12 inch rainfall line when a series of dry seasons occurred in the 1880s many of the farmers were ruined when the farmers retreated the land was worse off due to the overstocking the struggle to maintain the viability of this farming on the edge of suitable rainfall distribution is still discussed by csiro as a benchmark nevertheless south australias main wheat areas in the temperate buffer zone were reasonably close to the coastal port towns and it was the major wheat producer of the australian colonies until the 1890s tasmania was initially part of ‘the granaries of the east’ but lost out to south australia as transport costs were higher the modern wheat belt in the eastern states was established in pastures west of the great dividing range and railways established rail heads in these areas in the 1870s victoria surpassed south australias wheat production in the 1890s western australia became a major grain producer by 1905 and then new south wales became the premier producer in 1910 overcoming low soil fertility for cropping – super phosphate and nitrogen in the 1890s the introduction of super phosphate and nitrogen to improve soil fertility preached salvation although there was a tendency to crop and overgraze in low rainfall areas one hundred years later this has led to challenges with soil erosion and salinity contemporary management recognises that pastures grazed at lower stocking rates such as with beef have a much lower need for fertilisers science inventions and seed breeding for cropping science inventions in machinery and experimentation in seed have added millions of hectares to wheat farming in the low rainfall areas for most of the 1800s most farming tasks used manual labour along with horses and bullocks australian inventions like the 1840s ridley stripper drastically reduced labour harvesting costs the stumpjump plough sketch courtesy of flinders range research the smith brothers the invention of the stumpjump plough in the 1870s by richard bowyer smith 1837–1919 made it possible to crop large areas of the mallee scrub country the invention was adopted almost universally across the mallee lands further extending the reach of cropping into previously unfarmed country experimentation with pedigree wheat seeds by william farrer in cuppacumbalong in the australian capital territory led to the production of wheat that was resistant to rust and flourished in the hot dry lands of the north merino sheep and droughtresistant strains of crops led to two of the most common forms of agriculture in australia – wheat and sheep farming smaller agricultural practices dairy fruit and nuts dairy cows courtesy of the government of south australia an average rainfall of more than 20 inches and associated rich alluvial soils allowed coastal areas to develop smaller agricultural practices such as timber dairy sugar fruits and vegetables tasmania changed its production from wheat to potatoes oats and fruit which it exported to the mainland these agricultural areas with rich soils have a long history of settlement farmer occupation and have contributed greatly to a variety of food regions and a wine industry after the white australia policy came into law with the immigration restriction act 1901 chinese immigration was restricted and the italian and slavic peoples who arrived in the 1900s worked as market gardeners in suburbs surrounding perth by 1900 greater diversity in agriculture had developed with beef and dairy cattle and a wide range of grain fruit and vegetable crops dairying and horticulture became the main industries of the coastal agricultural areas today yoghurts cheese butter dried fruits canned fruits macadamia nuts and sugar are all exported but vulnerable to markets sugar cane industry burning and harvesting sugar cane at ingham queensland 1986 courtesy of the national archives of australia 1  a6135 k131086139the sugar cane industry in queensland was established in the 1860s using pacific island labourers known as kanakas tens of thousands of kanakas some of whom were kidnapped from their island homes worked under indentured labour schemes on the sugar plantations by 1906 most of the 10000 pacific islanders living in queensland were repatriated under the pacific island labourers act 1901 the plantations then became family farms government protection and subsidies were then provided to cover the costs of white labour following the deportation of the pacific island families newly arrived italian and other european workers took up the opportunities to work on the sugar farms cutting cane and worked hard to buy their own small farms today many sugar cane growers in queensland are descendants of the early cane cutters while machinery for cutting cane was introduced in the 1940s it was not until the 1960s that the process became almost completely mechanised water droughts and empires drought in the wimmera victoria c 1944 courtesy of culture victoria fresh water availability and drought management are key challenges for farmers throughout most of australia the location of wells the building of dams and the sinking of bores all became part of the necessary requirements for farming in the low rainfall areas to establish access to water in dry times and for droving stock to markets in 1910 in western australia the canning stock route was opened up by alfred canning the prolonged drought of 1895–1904 seriously affected wool production sheep numbers fell from 106 million in 1892 to 54 million in 1903 – a 49 per cent fall it took about two decades for sheep numbers to be restored to the levels of 1892 when in 1926 sheep numbers rose above 100 million once again sir sidney kidman 1857–1935 used his experience and understanding of the australian environment and business to build an empire of cattle stations that were droughtproof he ended up with over 100 properties from the top of the northern territory and western australia to south australia they were in two chains and used river systems to move cattle in good condition from the north to markets in the south half a century later another large property owner the englishman lord vestey the owner of wave hill station in the northern territory was at the centre of a dispute over equal wages for aboriginal pastoral workers in august 1966 aboriginal pastoral workers at wave hill station in the northern territory walked off the job unhappy with their poor working conditions and disrespectful treatment this was part of a civil rights campaign which achieved equal wages however as a result whole communities of aboriginal pastoral workers mostly in their traditional countries were turned off properties farming rice courtesy of national farmers federation irrigation irrigation has been a very important factor in making farming viable in inland australia vast irrigation systems such as the snowy mountains scheme were established to divert water into the murray and murrumbidgee rivers and to important inland areas for farming on the east coast and in the murraydarling basin many australian rivers have had their flows changed or regulated by human engineering since the 1960s new industries of rice and cotton have rapidly expanded on large properties with mechanised production today these industries followed by grapes vegetables and nurseriescut flowerscultivated turf are the most intensively irrigated crops most irrigated land is located within the confines of the murray–darling basin which covers parts of new south wales victoria queensland and south australia and all of the australian capital territory however the total area of land irrigated about 18 million hectares in 2009–10 represents less than one per cent of the total land used for agriculture transport – bullocks camels clipper ships and paddlesteamers the development of australian agriculture relied upon overcoming the tyranny of distance that separated farms from their markets from the 1830s the droving of herds of cattle from distant stations along travelling stock routes was how cattle and sheep reached metropolitan markets the feats by ‘drovers and ‘overlanders with teams of bullocks and horses became part of australias folklore wool bales on paddle steamers at echuca wharf the first paddle steamer arrived in australia in 1831 and paddlesteamers plied the murray and darling rivers with agribusiness supplies and return cargoes of wool for another 70 years camels and cameleers first arrived in australia in 1840 services to outback communities and properties all depended on them the afghans as they came to be called helped turn around australias rural transport and communication from the 1850s until the early 1900s agribusiness and thereby agriculture relied upon the afghan cameleers for the transport of supplies the creation of railways from the 1850s onwards began to connect the more remote farmers with quicker and easier transport of their produce to cities and ports in the 1850s revolutions in shipping greatly expanded australias opportunities for agricultural exports the development of clipper ships almost halved the time that it took to complete the voyage from australia to england taking only 90 days instead of 140 days by this time steam was also a part of transporting australian wool and other produce export viability – refrigeration infrastructure bounties and tariffs ss dunedin by frederick tudgay in 1881 the clipper sailing ship dunedin owned by the new zealand and australian land company nzalc was refitted with a bellcoleman compression refrigeration machine and successfully landed a cargo of frozen meats in the united kingdon consequently an extensive frozen meat trade from new zealand and australia to the uk developed over 16 different refrigerated and passenger refrigerated or reefer ships were built or refitted by 1900 by 1910 uk refrigerated meat imports rose to 760000 tons per year queensland beef victoria cheeses tasmanian apples and mutton from everywhere was sent off to grace the tables in europe by the early 1900s australia was one of the worlds major food exporters between 1901 and 1906 exports of frozen mutton and lamb rose by 50 per cent throughout the early 1900s the export trade was assisted by the australian government who provided assistance to farmers and primary producers in the form of bounties the government also placed tariffs on some goods to discourage imports this was part of an allround policy called protection australian agriculture continued to grow throughout the first half of the 1900s despite huge impacts from the great depression and the first and second world wars following the first world war 19141918 there were numerous government marketing schemes for agricultural products which maintained high prices these protection programs continued until the 1980s when the national farmers federation challenged the protective tariff policy this eventuated in prices for agricultural products being directly related to the cycles of the international markets in 2012 australia exported 60 per cent of its agricultural products wool production – the ‘golden fleecerams at wangenella near deniliquin c 1930 courtesy of state library of new south wales by 1914 the united kingdom was purchasing about 30 per cent of australias total wool exports and by the mid1920s it was an astonishing 50 per cent wool exports accounted for threequarters of all pastoral export income which included live cattle and sheep meat wool and hides wool production was helped by a mechanical sheep shearing machine invented by frederick wolseley 1837–99 when it was demonstrated around the country – to the delight of woolgrowers and the horror of blade shearers in the mid1880s in 1888 at louth in new south wales dunlop station become the first large machine shed with 40 wolseley shearing stands operating throughout the 1930s wool remained the cornerstone of australian agriculture wool represented about 30 per cent of the total value of australias exports in the 1930s and this prosperity continued into the 1950s wool clips at pyrmont in 1937 courtesy of state library of new south wales prosperity in the wool industry peaked in 1950–51 when the average greasy wool price reached 1442 pence per pound equivalent to around 37 per kilogram in todays prices compared to the around 320 per kilogram achieved in mid2002 however by 1970–71 wool production contributed only 15 per cent to total gross value of agricultural production in the decade to 1999–2000 australian greasy wool production fell by 35 per cent partly due to a lack of demand influenced by new developments in synthetic fibres while there has been growth in wool exports to china and other south east asian countries over the last decade the contribution of wool exports to australias total merchandise exports fell significantly from 58 per cent in 1991 to 30 per cent in 2001 nevertheless australia produces more than a quarter of the worlds wool lamb – an australian favourite from the 1920s and 30s with the expansion of sheep and wool industries in australia mutton was cheap and abundant in 1903 it was estimated that the average australian ate 61 kilograms of beef and 41 kilograms of mutton in the 1920s new improved pastures enabled lamb to become readily available and by the 1930s lamb was well and truly ensconced as an australian favourite challenges – deforestation erosion rabbits salinity and algae allen taylors saw mill mayers point myall lake established 1915by definition successful and sustainable farms necessarily depend upon healthy soil and fresh water for their arable land and this has an inbuilt resilience if biodiversity is maintained a balance needs to be struck between removal of vegetation and water which may cause erosion and salinity and the cropping or grazing needs which require open pastures a lack of biodiversity can lead to invasions of weeds and pests early laws forbad the clearing of river banks but this was soon ignored and then forgotten great swathes of timber were cleared by the 1840s there was hardly a single stand of australian cedar left on the east coast as a result of the loss of timber in the hunter valley combined with overgrazing the erosion was considered the worst land and riverbank erosion in australia in 1948 it was estimated that the total soil loss from erosion in the hunter valley was in excess of 765000 cubic metres annually the endangered plains wanderer needs an open grassland habitat victoria courtesy of internet bird collection trees were ringbarked and burnt to clear hundreds of thousands of hectares as part of the caveat and lease requirements for soldier settler farming schemes in southwest western australia the wimmera in victoria new south wales and queensland consequently these areas became denuded of bird and other wild life and rabbits multiplied the loss of australias grasslands has also contributed to loss of biodiversity it is estimated that there has been a 45 per cent loss of woodland birds the loss of native grasses has also seen a decrease in live ground cover during droughts the effect of this is that there is insufficient cover to protect soils from erosion in the event of heavy summer rainfall as a result of the human engineering in regulating the flow of rivers especially from dams and locks many of the rivers in the murray–darling basin suffer from an increase in winter velocity slow summer flows greenblue algae outbreaks and stagnation this has seriously affected the access to fresh water required by farmers for their grazing stock and crops rabbits rabbit proof fence western australia 19261927 courtesy of battye library 000876d rabbits are a feral pest that have seriously reduced the productivity of farming in australia to the point
