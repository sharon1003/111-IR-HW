as we age the intervertebral discs in the spine may lose water and become dried out as this happens the disc compresses this may lead to the deterioration of the tough outer ring allowing the nucleus or the inside of the ring to bulge out this is considered a bulging disc degenerative disc disease is one of the most common causes of low back and neck pain as degenerative disc disease continues to worsen or with continued stress on the spine the inner nucleus pulposus may actually rupture out from the annulus this is considered a ruptured or herniated disc the fragments of disc material can then press on the nerve roots that are located just behind the disc space this can cause pain weakness numbness or changes in sensation most disc herniations happen at the lower lumbar spine especially at the l45 and l5s1 levels degenerative disc disease can also occur in the thoracic area of the spine most frequently at the thoracolumbar junction where the thoracic and lumbar areas of the spinal column meet while similar to cervical and lumbar disc disorders thoracic lumbar disc disease is far less likely to cause symptomatic lesions the prevalence of thoracic disc disorders is not fully understood because many do not cause back pain or other symptoms causes of disc disease lumbar disc disease is due to a change in the structure of the normal disc most of the time disc disease comes as a result of aging and the degeneration that occurs within the disc occasionally severe trauma can cause a normal disc to herniate trauma may also cause an already herniated disc to worsen symptoms of degenerative disc the symptoms of lumbar disc disease vary depending on where the disc has herniated and what nerve root it is pushing on the following are the most common symptoms of lumbar disc disease however each individual may experience different symptoms symptoms may includeintermittent or continuous back pain this may be made worse by movement coughing sneezing or standing for long periods of timespasm of the back musclessciatica  pain that starts near the back or buttock and travels down the leg to the calf or into the footmuscle weakness in the legsnumbness in the leg or footdecreased reflexes at the knee or anklechanges in bladder or bowel function the symptoms of lumbar disc disease may resemble other conditions or medical problems always consult your physician for a diagnosis diagnosis of degenerative disc in addition to a complete medical history and physical examination diagnostic procedures for lumbar disc disease may include the following xray  a diagnostic test which uses invisible electromagnetic energy beams to produce images of internal tissues bones and organs onto filmmagnetic resonance imaging mri  a diagnostic procedure that uses a combination of large magnets radiofrequencies and a computer to produce detailed images of organs and structures within the bodymyelogram  a procedure that uses dye injected into the spinal canal to make the structure clearly visible on xrayscomputed tomography scan also called a ct or cat scan  a diagnostic imaging procedure that uses a combination of xrays and computer technology to produce crosssectional images often called slices both horizontally and vertically of the body a ct scan shows detailed images of any part of the body including the bones muscles fat and organs ct scans are more detailed than general xrayselectromyography emg  a diagnostic test that measures muscle response or electrical activity in response to a nerves stimulation of the muscle degenerative disc treatment specific treatment for lumbar disc disease will be determined by your physician based onyour age overall health and medical historyextent of the conditiontype of conditionyour tolerance for specific medications procedures or therapiesexpectations for the course of the conditionyour opinion or preference typically conservative therapy is the first line of treatment to manage lumbar disc disease this may include a combination of the followingbed restpatient education on proper body mechanics to help decrease the chance of worsening pain or damage to the discphysical therapy which may include ultrasound massage conditioning and exercise programsweight controluse of a lumbosacral back supportmedications to control pain andor to relax musclesepidural steroid injections when these conservative measures fail surgery for repair of degenerative disc disease may be recommended the type of surgery needed will be based on your surgeons assessment but the most common includediscectomylaminectomylumbar fusion get a referral to a beaumont spine surgeon8006337377search
