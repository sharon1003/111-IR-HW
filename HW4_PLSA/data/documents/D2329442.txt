voldemort can die he goes into the forest and lets voldemort kill him then wakes up in a dreamlike version of king’s cross train station where dumbledore meets him and tells him that he hasn’t died

gryffindor to kill the giant snake nagini which was the last horcrux keeping voldemort invulnerable a final battle erupts and harry reveals that he’s still alive going on to kill voldemort in a duel
