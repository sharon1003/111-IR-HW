is told completely through dialog like a golden age of radio presentationappropriate as our hero frankie wattleston is crazy about radio specifically the kids and adults adventure serials that populate the airwaves he and his best friend mario create through frankies vivid imagination their own misadventures as they spy on mr swerdlow a medicalschool student who is boarding at frankies homeand try to help their teacher whose boyfriend was killed in battle this is a lively funny story about a boy addicted to radio series the way kids today are addicted to video games im not sure i can quite believe that frankies teacher or parents would be so gullible sometimes and the ending with frankies brother withdrawn after his return from combat seems a bit pat but the dialog and radio series quotes make up for any shortcomings read more comment one person found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no report abuse deborah mc namara40 out of 5 stars who was that masked man

lema50 out of 5 stars i wasnt expecting such a good book when i picked this one at the library  august 19 2015format paperback wow i wasnt expecting such a good book when i picked this one at the library to read with my 10 yearsold son it was a very pleasant surprise set in the us during wwii this is the story of frankie short for franklin delano wattleson a sixth grader crazy about radio shows and avid to save the world with his friendsidekick mario clavino the book is all written in dialog form plus the transcription of radio shows including those funny commercials the style is really innovative although the story is funny other more real situations are present like frankies brother being wounded at the war and coming back home suffering from depression marios father dying while fighting the war etc these events are not display in an upsetting way though i think this book is a great way of introduce historical fiction ill try more avis books for sure read more comment was this review helpful to you yes no report abuse pat smith20 out of 5 stars not avis best work november 13 2014format paperback who was that masked man anyway avi historical fiction review this story is about a sixth grade boy named franklin franklin is growing up during world war 2 and he fancies himself a hero why does he believe he is a super hero it’s because all frankie wants to do is listen to all of his radio programs such as the lone ranger and the green hornet because back then people did not have tv everything was on the radio taking after the heroes he hears about on the radio frankie tries to prove that the guy renting his brothers room is a mad scientist and also tries getting his brother better after being wounded in the war i personally did not enjoy this book all that much i thought that frankie was very mischievous and disrespectful he is told repeatedly to stay out of mr swerdlow’s room and he repeatedly disobeys also he makes school into a joke and messes with the lives of those around him the worst part is that his parents don’t really do much to discipline him they tell him no radio but he sneaks over to his friend’s mario’s house and listens to it anyway he is constantly kept after school for not behaving and his parents don’t seem to think that is a problem i just feel that this story will make kids feel like it’s ok to act anyway you want because there is no consequence to their actions i hate saying this about the book because i usually really enjoy avi’s work but i just do not think this is one of his best works i received a free ecopy of the book from netgalley for my honest opinion read more comment was this review helpful to you yes no report abuse awesome kid30 out of 5 stars oknovember 4 2017format kindle edition i bought
