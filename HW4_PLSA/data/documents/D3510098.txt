comedy overview filmography awards share onfacebook twitter biography by jason ankeny marlon brando was quite simply one of the most celebrated and influential screen and stage actors of the postwar era he rewrote the rules of performing and nothing was ever the same again brooding lusty and intense his greatest contribution was popularizing method acting a highly interpretive performance style which brought unforeseen dimensions of power and depth to the craft in comparison most other screen icons appeared shallow even a little silly a combative and often contradictory man brando refused to play by the rules of the hollywood game openly expressing his loathing for the film industry and for the very nature of celebrity yet often exploiting his fame to bring attention to political causes and later accepting any role offered him as long as the price was right he is one of the screens greatest enigmas and there will never be another quite like him born april 3 1924 in omaha ne brando s rebellious streak manifested itself early resulting in his expulsion from military school his first career was as a ditch digger but his father ultimately grew so frustrated with his sons seeming lack of ambition that he offered to finance whatever more meaningful path the young man chose to pursue brando opted to become an actor  his mother operated a local theatrical group  and he soon relocated to new york city to study the stanislavsky method under stella adler he later worked at the actors studio under the tutelage of lee strasberg and his dedication to the principles of method acting was to become absolute after making his professional debut in 1943s bobino brando bowed on broadway a year later in i remember mama for 1946s truckline cafe the critics voted him broadways most promising actor brando s groundbreaking star turn in the 1947 production of tennessee williams  a streetcar named desire delivered on all of that promise and much much more as the inarticulate brute stanley kowalski brando stunned audiences with a performance of remarkable honesty sexuality and intensity and overnight he became the rage of broadway hollywood quickly came calling but he resisted the studios overtures with characteristic contempt  he was a new breed of star an antistar really and he refused to play ball dismissing influential critics and making no concessions toward glamour or decorum it all only served to make hollywood want him more of course and in 1950 brando agreed to star in the independent stanley kramer production the men as a paraplegic war victim in typical method fashion he spent a month in an actual veterans hospital in preparation for the role while the men was not a commercial hit critics tripped over themselves in their attempts to praise brando s performance and in 1951 it was announced that he and director elia kazan were set to reprise their earlier work for a screen adaptation of streetcar the results were hugely successful the picture winning an academy award for best film brando earned his first best actor nomination but lost despite oscars for his costars vivien leigh karl malden and kim hunter again with kazan he next starred in the title role of 1952s viva zapata after walking out of the french production le rouge et le noir over a dispute with director claude autantlara brando portrayed mark antony in the 1953 mgm production of julius caesar sparking considerable controversy over his idiosyncratic approach to the bard and earning a third consecutive oscar bid in 1954 the wild one was another curve ball casting brando as the rebellious leader of a motorcycle gang and forever establishing him as a poster boy for attitude angst and anomie that same year he delivered perhaps his definitive screen performance as a washedup boxer in kazans visceral on the waterfront on his fourth attempt brando finally won an academy award and the film itself also garnered best picture honors however his next picture desiree was his first disappointment despite gaining much publicity for his portrayal of napoleon the project made a subpar showing both artistically and financially brando continued to prove his versatility by costarring with frank sinatra in a film adaptation of the hit broadway musical guys and dolls another broadwaytoscreen adaptation the teahouse of the august moon followed in 1956 before he began work on the following years sayonara for which he garnered yet another oscar nomination in 1958s the young lions brando costarred for the first and only time with montgomery clift another great actor of his generation it was a hit but his next project 1960s the fugitive kind was a financial disaster he then announced plans to mount his own independent production after both stanley kubrick and sam peckinpah both walked off the project brando himself grabbed the directorial reins the result the idiosyncratic 1961 western oneeyed jacks performed respectably at the box office but was such a costly proposition that it could hardly be expected ever to earn a profit in 1962 mutiny on the bounty underwent a similarly troubled birthing process brando rejected numerous screenplay revisions and mgm spent a record 19 million dollars to bring the picture to the screen when it too failed his diminishing boxoffice stature combined with his increasingly temperamental behavior made him a target of scorn for the first time in his career the downward spiral continued brando himself remained compulsively watchable but suddenly the material itself like 1963s the ugly american 1966s the chase and 1967s a countess from hong kong was selfindulgent and far beneath his abilities his mysterious career choices as well as his often inscrutable personal and professional behavior  he was quoted as declaring acting a neurotic unimportant job  became the topic of much discussion throughout the industry he continued to push himself in risky projects like 1967s reflections in a golden eye an adaptation of a carson mc cullers novel in which he portrayed a closeted homosexual but the end result lacked the old magic while brando still commanded respect from the media and his fellow performers much of hollywood began to perceive him as a bad and unnecessary risk a perception which features like 1968s candy 1969s queimada and 1971s the nightcomers did little to alter the brando renaissance began with 1972s the godfather against the objections of paramount director francis ford coppola cast him to play the aging head of a mafia crime family and according to most reports his onset behavior was impeccable onscreen brando was brilliant delivering his best performance in well over a decade he won his second academy award but became the subject of much controversy when he refused the honor instead sending one sacheen littlefeather  supposedly a native american spokeswoman but later revealed to be a hispanic actress  to the oscar telecast podium to deliver a speech attacking the u s governments history of crimes against the native population controversy continued to dog brando upon the release of 1973s last tango in paris bernardo bertolucci s masterful examination of a sexual liaison between an american widower and a young frenchwoman though critically acclaimed the picture was denounced as obscene in many quarters despite his resurrection brando did not reappear onscreen for three years finally resurfacing in the missouri breaks opposite jack nicholson although he had by now long maintained that he continued to act only for the money the eccentricity of his career choices allowed many fans to shrug off such assertions however never before had brando appeared in so blatantly commercial a project as 1978s superman earning an unprecedented 37 million dollars for what essentially amounted to a cameo performance his next appearance in coppolas 1979 vietnam epic apocalypse now was largely incoherent while for 1980s the formula he appeared in only three scenes and for a decade that was it brando vanished living in selfimposed exile on his island in the pacific growing obese and refusing the few overtures producers made for him to come back to hollywood only in 1989 did a project appeal to brando s deep political convictions and he costarred in the antiapartheid drama a dry white season earning an academy award nomination for his supporting role as an attorney a year later he headlined the freshman gracefully parodying his godfather performance tragedy struck in 1990 when his son christian killed the lover of brando s pregnant daughter cheyenne a long legal battle ensued and christian was found guilty of murder and imprisoned even more tragically cheyenne later committed suicide the trial placed a severe strain on brando s finances and he reluctantly returned to performing appearing in the atrocious christopher columbus the discovery in 1992 he also wrote an autobiography songs my mother taught

onset tirades and bizarre behavior filmgoers remained eager to see the actor reteamed with former godfather cohort robert de niro with edward norton and angela bassett rounding out the cast later that year director francis ford coppola added to brando s legend by lengthening his infamously slurred speeches for the directors recut apocalypse now redux absent from the screen for the next three years
