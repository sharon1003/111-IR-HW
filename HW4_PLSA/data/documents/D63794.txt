niddk found that more than 4 million americans suffered from constipation every year they also found that a massive 725 million is spent annually on laxatives that is a surprising since there are natural remedies out there that do an even better job and are much cheaper… if not free what is constipation as food moves through the digestive system it is liquefied so that the body can absorb nutrients but the water is precious too and must be reabsorbed however the digestive system cannot break all food down and so this then becomes a stool or feces the colon functions to recover water from the stool before it is pushed out through the rectum by intestine muscles in a bowel movement this entire process should be easy and natural constipation comes from when the muscles that work to push the stool through colon are not performing resulting in irregular bowel movements that will cause your stool to be hard dry and hard to pass the different types of constipation many people do not know that constipation is an umbrella term that covers two different types organic and functional it is a good idea to be familiar with both of them organic constipation is the result of various physical abnormalities or chronic illnesses organic constipation is less common and its sufferers are likely seeing a doctor for it functional constipation is caused by poor diet insufficient water intake or high stress constipation can also be caused by anal sex this guide will cover functional constipation what causes constipation constipation is most commonly caused by diets filled with processed food and can be cured by a change of diet processed foods are usually calorierich but nutritionpoor they are hard to break down and can weaken the walls of the colon making it hard to push stool through this difficulty can cause your intestinal muscles to tire and eventually give up resulting in constipation can constipation be serious constipation can cause more than discomfort and lethargy chronic constipation can be an indication of more serious medical conditions including fecal impaction varicose veins hemorrhoids pilesanal tears and fissures a prolapsed rectum diverticular disease how to get rid of constipation immediately and naturally the web is full of diverse cures so here i summarize the best of them in one place people are different and what might work for one might not work for you try a variety of remedies until you find one that works all of the natural constipation remedies found in this list are effective and good for your overall health laxatives from the drugstore while i recommend curing your constipation using natural remedies i think it is important to understand all the options so you can make the decision for yourself people tend to go for drugstore laxatives because they seem convenient but they are only a shortterm cure and don’t have any health benefits drugstore laxatives can even be harmful they can contain chemicals that could cause increased thirst drowsiness nausea vomiting and more prolonged use of some commercial laxatives can overstimulate nerves and lead to nerve damage digestion is a balance pushing food through your system too quickly could mean that the body doesn’t have time to absorb its nutrients check out some of the best laxative here1 stool softening laxatives – mostly works in 1 to 4 days2 bulk creating laxatives – mostly works in 1 to 3 days3 lubricant laxatives – mostly works in 5 to 9 hours4 stimulant laxatives – mostly works in 6 to 24 hours5 saline laxatives – mostly works in 1 to 3 hours some commercial laxatives combine different types and sometimes include all five this combination can be harmful so i would avoid combinations altogether stool softening laxatives stool softening laxatives contain emollients that help to mix oil and water they help bring water in to soften your stools but they take 1 to 4 days to start working so they are commonly used to prevent constipation rather than stop it however prolonged prophylactic use can cause harm bulk creating laxatives bulk creating laxatives are the safest of the drugstore laxatives so they can be used for longer periods their ingredients have qualities that resemble foods high in fiber this will help to create bulkier and heavier stools as well as help trap water for easy passing creating bulkier and heavier stools will trigger the colon to make a bowel movement bulk creating laxatives are the better choice of drugstore laxatives because they provide fiber which is a natural remedy for constipation even though they are safe they are unnecessary because you can get your fiber from a better diet lubricant laxatives rather than draw water in like a stool softener lubricant laxatives add a layer of lubrication to the walls of the intestines that help stool pass more easily there are two types mineral oil lubricant laxative and glycerin oil lubricant laxative the mineral oil lubricant is taken orally while glycerin oil is to be taken rectally if your stools are severely hard and dry then it is usually recommended to use the glycerin oil lubricant laxative lubricant laxatives tend to work in 1 to 4 hours which is great if you want to cure your constipation quickly stimulant laxatives the stimulant laxative pretty much does what it says it stimulates the intestinal muscles to push stools through the colon while this sounds like exactly what you need it is something that you should stay away from because your intestinal muscles can become dependent on them they can also damage these muscles and make your constipation worse stimulant laxatives should only rarely be used if at all saline laxatives saline laxatives work by drawing water into your digestive tract which will then help to encourage bowel movement the main reason people use saline laxatives is because they only take one to three hours to work so can provide instant constipation relief saline laxatives are commonly given to clear the bowels before a colonoscopy as with all drugstore laxatives saline laxatives come with their side effects because they draw water so quickly they can cause intense thirst and dehydration saline laxatives can cause kidney damage if taken high doses so they should be avoided for people with kidney problems herbal laxatives now that i have explained drugstore laxatives it is time to get

chemicalfree strong herbal laxatives some herbal laxatives should only be used when you’re suffering from severe constipation some of these strong herbal laxatives include buckthorn senna aloe and
