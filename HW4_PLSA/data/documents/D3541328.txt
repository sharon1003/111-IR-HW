bog turtle  clemmys glyptemys muhlenbergii threatenedoverview the bog turtle was federally listed as a threatened species in 1997 at only about 4 inches long the bog turtle is one of north america’s smallest turtles this species typically shows a bright yellow orange or red blotch on each side of the head the nearly parallel sides of the upper shell carapace give bog turtles an oblong appearance when viewed from above these small semiaquatic turtles consume a varied diet including insects snails worms seeds and carrion photo by richard c back habitat bog turtles usually occur in small discrete populations generally occupying opencanopy herbaceous sedge meadows and fens bordered by wooded areas these wetlands are a mosaic of microhabitats that include dry pockets saturated areas and areas that are periodically flooded bog turtles depend upon this diversity of microhabitats for foraging nesting basking hibernating and sheltering unfragmented riparian river systems that are sufficiently dynamic to allow the natural creation of open habitat are needed to compensate for ecological succession beaver deer and cattle may be instrumental in maintaining the opencanopy wetlands essential for this species’ survival bog turtles inhabit open unpolluted emergent and scrubshrub wetlands such as shallow springfed fens sphagnum bogs swamps marshy meadows and wet pastures these habitats are characterized by soft muddy bottoms interspersed wet and dry pockets vegetation dominated by low grasses and sedges and a low volume of standing or slowmoving water which often forms a network of shallow pools and rivulets bog turtles prefer areas with ample sunlight high evaporation rates high humidity in the nearground microclimate and perennial saturation of portions of the ground eggs are often laid in elevated areas such as the tops of tussocks bog turtles generally retreat into more densely vegetated areas to hibernate from midseptember through midapril the greatest threats to the bog turtle are the loss degradation and fragmentation of its habitat from wetland alteration development pollution invasive species and natural vegetational succession the species is also threatened by collection for illegal wildlife trade distribution in new york species range the northern population of bog turtles ranges from new york and western massachusetts south to maryland disjunct populations some of which are extirpated have been reported from western pennsylvania and the lake george and finger lakes regions of new york the southern population which occurs in the appalachian mountains from virginia to georgia is listed as threatened due to similarity of appearance to the northern population there is a 250mile gap in the species current known distribution from
