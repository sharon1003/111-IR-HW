this article describes the formula syntax and usage of the z test function in microsoft excel returns the onetailed pvalue of a ztest for a given hypothesized population mean x z test returns the probability that the sample mean would be greater than the average of observations in the data set array — that is the observed sample mean to see how z test can be used in a formula to compute a twotailed probability value see the remarks section below syntax z test arrayx sigmathe z test function syntax has the following arguments array required the array or range of data against which to test xx required the value to test sigma optional the population known standard deviation if omitted the sample standard deviation is used remarks if array is empty z test returns the na error value z test is calculated as follows when sigma is not omitted z test  arrayxsigma  1 norm s dist  average array x  sigma√ntrueor when sigma is omitted z test  arrayx  1 norm s dist  average array x  stdev array√ntruewhere x is the sample mean average array and n is count array z test represents the probability that the sample mean would be greater than the observed value average array when the underlying population mean is μ0 from the symmetry of the normal distribution if average array  x z test will return a value greater than 05 the following excel formula can be used to calculate the twotailed probability that the sample mean would be further from x in either direction than average array when the underlying population mean is x2  min z test arrayxsigma 1  z test arrayxsigma example copy the example data in the following table and paste it in cell a1 of a new excel worksheet for formulas to show results select them press f2 and then press enter if you need to you can adjust the column widths to see all the data data3678654219formula description resultresultz test a2 a114onetailed probabilityvalue of a ztest for the data set above at the hypothesized population mean of 4 009057400905742  min z test a2 a114 1  z test a2 a114twotailed probabilityvalue of a ztest for the data set above at the hypothesized population mean of 4 01811480181148z test a2 a116onetailed probabilityvalue of a ztest for the data set above at the hypothesized population mean of 6 086304308630432  min z test a2 a116 1  z test a2 a116twotailed probabilityvalue of a ztest for the data set above at the hypothesized population mean of 6 02739130273913
