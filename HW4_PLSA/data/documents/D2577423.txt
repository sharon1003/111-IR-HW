appliances from a power surge  due to lightning for example but is it really worth considering subscribers to angies list  wwwangieslistcom might have wondered that when they recently received a dailydeal alert for wholehouse surge protection for 159 regularly 259 the answer is that it depends on your situation people who own many expensive electronic items and appliances might want to look into the protection which uses a device installed in the houses main electrical panel anyone can protect tvs and computers with portable surge protectors at the outlet but many people dont think about the dishwasher refrigerator or other electrically powered home aids if youve never had a loss due to an electrical surge in your house you probably dont need wholehouse protection said chris zeuli an estimator at linner electric in stillwater if you do buy it be clear about what it does a panel that protects against lightning wont be effective against smaller surges zeuli said youll still need the portable surge protector he said randys electric in maple grove which offered the 159 deal now expired said that wholehouse protection usually comes with a limited warranty but that buyers should verify what it covers the electric panel usually has a lifetime warranty as with any service prices vary among providers linner charges about 400 for the panel and labor zeuli said the company installs the protectors mostly in areas more susceptible to lightning strikes  houses on hills and new construction in sparse neighborhoods if you have problems with surges not caused by lightning check with your electric company it can put a monitor on the meter to find out whats causing the surges more on free tvanyone can get about 25 free tv channels with an antenna including highdefinition
