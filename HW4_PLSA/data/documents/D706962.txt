christ sent from my i pad marie r conyers i cannot believe any medical doctor can post such ignorant bs first of all as a native anthropologist i have always wondered about the pineal gland until 2004 when i ran into a neuropsychiatric doctor from upenn at the time i was working as a teller and asked what he did once i found out i asked he saidthe pineal gland is vestigial it doesn’t work i said if that were true i would look like you and there would be no people of color…so what does it do he saidthe ancient frog’s pineal gland allowed it to see into the 4th dimension the spiritual world i said so when people of huecolormelanin wealth ancient people ingest etheogenic the fruit of knowledgeherbs cacti and fungi they will see just like that froginto the 4th dimension he said reluctantly yes so go to herodotus…the greeks called melanin wealthy people human and only melanin wealthy people people of color are ancient people melanin deficit people refer to themselves as mankind or modern man because they came after humans did…so aliens aren’t green…they are whitelxmzhg glad to hear some truth people who pursue the opening of the third eye are no different from adam  eve in the garden of
