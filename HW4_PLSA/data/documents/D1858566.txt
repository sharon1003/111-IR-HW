in the area of beauty standards of beauty were different for whites and blacks and the black community developed its own standards with an emphasis on hair care beauticians could work out of their own homes and did not need storefronts as a result black beauticians were numerous in the rural south despite the absence of cities and towns they pioneered the use of cosmetics at a time when rural white women in the south avoided them as blain roberts has shown beauticians offered their clients a space to feel pampered and beautiful in the context of their own community because inside black beauty shops rituals of beautification converged with rituals of socialization beauty contests emerged in the 1920s and in the white community they were linked to agricultural county fairs by contrast in the black community beauty contests were developed out of the homecoming ceremonies at their high schools and colleges 20 21 the most famous entrepreneur was madame c j walker 18671919 she built a
