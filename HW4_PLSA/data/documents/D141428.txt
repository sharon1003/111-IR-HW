leather in east timor leather tanning in fes morocco tanned leather in marrakech main article leather production processes the leather manufacturing process is divided into three fundamental subprocesses preparatory stages tanning and crusting a further subprocess surface coating can be added into the leather process sequence but not all leathers receive surface treatment the preparatory stages are when the hide is prepared for tanning preparatory stages may include liming deliming hair removal degreasing bleaching and pickling tanning is a process that stabilizes the proteins of the raw hide so it does not putrefy making it suitable for a wide variety of end applications the principal difference between raw and tanned hides is that raw hides dry out to form a hard inflexible material that when rewetted will putrefy while tanned material dries to a flexible form that does not become putrid when rewetted many tanning methods and materials exist the process sees tanners load the hides into a drum and immerse them in a tank that contains the tanning liquor the hides soak while the drum slowly rotates about its axis and the tanning liquor slowly penetrates through the full thickness of the hide once the process achieves even penetration workers slowly raise the liquors p h in a process called basification which fixes the tanning material to the leather the more tanning material fixed the higher the leathers hydrothermal stability and shrinkage temperature resistance chrometanned leather p h is typically between p h 38 and 42 1crusting is a process that thins retans and lubricates leather it often includes a coloring operation chemicals added during crusting must be fixed in place crusting culminates with a drying and softening operation and may include splitting shaving dyeing whitening or other methods for some leathers tanners apply a surface coating tanners call this finishing finishing operations can include oiling brushing buffing coating polishing embossing glazing or tumbling among others leather can be oiled to improve its water resistance this currying process after tanning supplements the natural oils remaining in the leather itself which can be washed out through repeated exposure to water frequent oiling of leather with mink oil neatsfoot oil or a similar material keeps it supple and improves its lifespan dramatically 2tanning methods  edittanning processes largely differ in which chemicals are used in the tanning liquor some common types include vegetabletanned leather is tanned using tannins extracted from vegetable matter such as tree bark prepared in bark mills it is supple and brown in color with the exact shade depending on the mix of materials and the color of the skin vegetabletanned leather is not stable in water it tends to discolor and if left to soak and then dry it shrinks and becomes harder this is a feature of oakbarktanned leather that is exploited in traditional shoemaking in hot water it shrinks drastically and partly congeals becoming rigid and eventually brittle boiled leather is an example of this where the leather has been hardened by being immersed in hot water or in boiled wax or similar substances historically it was occasionally used as armor after hardening and it has also been used for book binding chrometanned leather invented in 1858 is tanned using chromium sulfate and other chromium salts it is also known as wet blue for the pale blue color of the undyed leather the chrome tanning method usually takes approximately one day to complete making it best suited for largescale industrial use this is the most common method in modern use it is more supple and pliable than vegetabletanned leather and does not discolor or lose shape as drastically in water as vegetabletanned however there are environmental concerns with this tanning method as chromium is a heavy metal aldehydetanned leather is tanned using glutaraldehyde or oxazolidine compounds it is referred to as wet white due to its pale cream color it is the main type of chromefree leather often seen in shoes for infants and automobiles formaldehyde has been used for tanning in the past it is being phased out due to danger to workers and sensitivity of many people to formaldehyde chamois leather is a form of aldehyde tanning that produces a porous and highly waterabsorbent leather chamois leather is made using marine oils traditionally cod oil that oxidize to produce the aldehydes that tan the leather to color it brain tanned leathers are made by a laborintensive process that uses emulsified oils often those of animal brains such as deer cattle and buffaloes they are known for their exceptional softness and washability alum leather is transformed using aluminium salts mixed with a variety of binders and protein sources such as flour and egg yolk alum leather is not actually tanned rather the process is called tawing and the resulting material reverts to rawhide if soaked in water long enough to remove the alum salts grades  editin general leather is produced in the following grades topgrain leather includes the outer layer of the hide known as the grain which features finer more densely packed fibers resulting in strength and durability depending on thickness it may also contain some of the more fibrous under layer known as the corium types of topgrain leather include fullgrain leather contains the entire grain layer without any removal of the surface rather than wearing out it develops a patina during its useful lifetime it is usually considered the highest quality leather furniture and footwear are often made from fullgrain leather fullgrain leather is typically finished with an aniline dye russia leather is a form of fullgrain leather corrected grain leather has the surface subjected to finishing treatments to create a more uniform appearance this usually involves buffing or sanding away flaws in the grain then dyeing and embossing the surface nubuck is topgrain leather that has been sanded or buffed on the grain side to give a slight nap of short protein fibers producing a velvetlike surface split leather is created from the corium left once the topgrain has been separated from the hide known as the drop split in thicker hides the drop split can be further split into a middle split and a flesh split splits are often used to create suede split leather can also have a polyurethane or vinyl layer applied to the surface and embossed to give it the appearance of a grain known as bicast leather which is slightly stiffer than topgrain leather but has a more consistent texture patent leather is leather that has been given a highgloss finish by the addition of a coating inventor seth boyden developed the first massproduction process using a linseed oilbased lacquer in newark new jersey in 1818 modern versions usually have a plastic coating similar to bicast leather bonded leather also called reconstituted leather is a material that uses leather scraps that are shredded and bonded together with polyurethane or latex on to a fiber mesh the amount of leather fibers in the mix varies from 10 to 90 affecting the properties of the product 3from other animals  editphone cases in ostrich leather today most leather is made of cattle hides but many exceptions exist horse hides are used to make particularly durable leathers shell cordovan is a horse leather made not from the outer skin but an under layer found only in equine species called the shell it is prized for its mirrorlike finish and anticreasing properties lamb and deerskin are used for soft leather in more expensive apparel deer and elkskin are widely used in work gloves and indoor shoes pigskin is used in apparel and on seats of saddles buffalo goat ox and yak skins may also be used for leather reptilian skins such as alligator crocodile and snake are noted for their distinct patterns that reflect the scales of their species this has led to hunting and farming of these species in part for their skins kangaroo leather is used to make items that must be strong and flexible it is the material most commonly used in bullwhips some motorcyclists favor kangaroo leather for motorcycle leathers because of its light weight and abrasion resistance 4 kangaroo leather is also used for falconry jesses soccer footwear 5 and boxing speed bags 6although originally raised for their feathers in the 19th century ostriches are now more popular for both meat and leather 7ostrich leather has a characteristic goose bump look because of the large follicles where the feathers grew different processes produce different finishes for many applications including upholstery footwear automotive products accessories and clothing in thailand stingray leather is used in wallets and belts stingray leather is tough and durable the leather is often dyed black and covered with tiny round bumps in the natural pattern of the back ridge of an animal these bumps are then usually dyed white to highlight the decoration stingray rawhide is also used as grips on chinese swords scottish basket hilted swords and japanese katanas stingray leather is also used for high abrasion areas in motorcycle racing leathers especially in gloves where its high abrasion resistance helps prevent wear through in the event of an accident environmental impact  editleather produces some environmental impact most notably due to the carbon footprint of cattle rearing use of chemicals in the tanning process eg chromium formic acid mercury and solventsair pollution due to the transformation process  hydrogen sulfide during dehairing and ammonia during deliming solvent vaporscarbon footprint  editone estimate of the carbon footprint of leather goods is 051 kg of co 2 equivalent per £1 of output at 2010 retail prices or 071 kg co 2 eq per £1 of output at 2010 industry prices 8water footprint  editone ton of hide or skin generally produces 20 to 80 m 3 of waste water including chromium levels of 100–400 mgl sulfide levels of 200–800 mgl high levels of fat and other solid wastes and notable pathogen contamination producers often add pesticides to protect hides during transport with solid wastes representing up to 70 of the wet weight of the original hides the tanning process represents a considerable strain on water treatment installations

editrajasthanistyle leather jooti jaipur india tanning is especially polluting in countries where environmental regulations are lax such as in india the worlds thirdlargest producer and exporter of leather to give an example of an efficient pollution prevention system chromium loads per produced tonne are generally abated from 8 kg to 15 kg voc emissions are typically reduced from 30 kgt to 2 kgt in a properly managed facility a review of the total pollution load decrease achievable according to the united nations industrial development organization 12 posts precise data on the abatement achievable through industrially proven lowwaste advanced methods while noting even though the chrome pollution load can be decreased by 94 on introducing advanced technologies the minimum residual load 015 kgt raw hide can still cause difficulties when using landfills and composting sludge from wastewater treatment on account of the regulations currently in force in some countries in kanpur the selfproclaimed leather city of world—with 10000 tanneries as of 2011 and a city of three million on the banks of the ganges —pollution levels were so high that despite an industry crisis the pollution control board decided to shut down 49 highpolluting tanneries out of 404 in july 2009 13 in 2003 for instance the main tanneries effluent disposal unit was dumping 22 tonnes of chromiumladen solid waste per day in the open 14 scientists at the central leather research institute in india have developed biological methods for pretanning as well as better chromium management in the hazaribagh neighborhood of dhaka in bangladesh chemicals from tanneries end up in dhakas main river besides the environmental damage the health of both local factory workers and the end consumer is also negatively affected 15 after approximately 15 years of ignoring high court rulings the government shut down more than 100 tanneries the weekend of 8 april 2017 in the neighborhood 16the higher cost associated with the treatment of effluents than to untreated effluent discharging leads to illegal dumping to save on costs for instance in croatia in 2001 proper pollution abatement cost us70–100 per ton of raw hides processed against 43t for irresponsible behavior 17 in november 2009 one of ugandas main leather making companies was caught directly dumping waste water into a wetland adjacent to lake victoria 18role of enzymes  editenzymes like proteases lipases and amylases have an important role in the soaking dehairing degreasing and bating operations of leather manufacturing proteases are the most commonly used enzymes in leather production the enzyme must not damage or dissolve collagen or keratin but should hydrolyze casein elastin albumin globulin like proteins and nonstructural proteins that are not essential for leather making this process is called bating 19lipases are used in the degreasing operation to hydrolyze fat particles embedded in the skin 20amylases are used to soften skin to bring out the grain and to impart strength and flexibility to the skin these enzymes are rarely used preservation and conditioning  editthe natural fibers of leather break down with the passage of time acidic leathers are particularly vulnerable to red rot which causes powdering of the surface and a change in consistency damage from red rot is aggravated by high temperatures and relative humidities although it is chemically irreversible treatments can add handling strength and prevent disintegration of red rotted leather exposure to long periods of low relative humidities below 40 can cause leather to become desiccated irreversibly changing the fibrous structure of the leather chemical damage can also occur from exposure to environmental factors including ultraviolet light ozone acid from sulfurous and nitrous pollutants in the air or through a chemical action following any treatment with tallow or oil compounds both oxidation and chemical damage occur faster at higher temperatures various treatments are available such as conditioners saddle soap is used for cleaning conditioning and softening leather leather shoes are widely conditioned with shoe polish 21in

leather pants to protect the lower body many sports still use leather equipment its flexibility facilitates forming and shaping it into balls and protective gear leather fetishism is the name popularly used to describe a fetishistic attraction to people wearing leather or in certain cases to the garments themselves many rock groups particularly heavy metal and punk groups in the 1980s are well known for wearing leather clothing extreme metal bands especially black metal bands and goth rock groups have extensive leather clothing leather has become less common in the punk community over the last three decades as there is opposition to the use of leather from punks who support animal rights many cars and trucks come with optional or standard leather seating religious sensitivities  editin countries with significant populations of individuals observing religions which place restrictions on material choices leather vendors typically clarify the kinds of leather in their products for example leather shoes bear a label that identifies the animal from which the leather came this helps a muslim not accidentally purchase pigskin and a hindu avoid cattle many vegetarian hindus do not use any kind of leather such taboos increase the demand for religiously neutral leathers such as ostrich and deer judaism forbids the comfort of wearing leather shoes on yom kippur tisha bav and during mourning 22 also see teffilin and torah scroll jainism prohibits the use of leather since it is obtained by killing animals alternatives  editmany artificial leather substitutes have been developed usually involving polyurethane or vinyl coatings applied to acloth backing many names and brands for such artificial leathers exist including pleather a portmanteau of plastic leather and
