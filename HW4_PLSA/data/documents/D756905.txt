what is a reasonable accommodation if you have a disability you may be able to get what is called a reasonable accommodation a reasonable accommodation means that a housing authority or subsidized development makes certain adjustments in rules policies services or even the physical structure of an apartment so that you can have full use of your home it means that sometimes housing authorities and subsidized landlords need to make exceptions and do things differently to enable a person who is disabled to participate more easily in a housing program you can request an accommodation when you are applying for housing before moving into housing or during your tenancy you are protected against housing discrimination and entitled to make requests for reasonable accommodations when you are applying for or living in most types of housing whether it is public housing or privately owned subsidized or nonsubsidized private housing who is entitled to a reasonable accommodation people who have disabilities are generally protected against housing discrimination but the definition of who is entitled to a reasonable accommodation and who is protected against discrimination are different a person with a disability who is entitled to a reasonable accommodation is an individual with a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities in order to be entitled to a reasonable accommodation you must have a current disability as defined above if you cannot claim a disability under the definition above you can still be protected against direct disability discrimination such as being refused housing because of your disability if you fall into one of the following additional protected categories you have a record or history of such an impairment or you have been perceived to have or are regarded as having such an impairment note keep in mind that these definitions of disabled are related to discrimination issues and requests for reasonable accommodations these definitions are different from the same definition that is used to qualify people for elderlydisabled housing or specialized section 8 programs for people with disabilities see chapter 3 who is eligible physical or mental impairment a physical or mental impairment can be almost any kind of mental or physical condition illness or disorder including for example depression cancer cerebral palsy learning disorders alcoholism mental retardation attention deficit disorder or deafness substantial limitation in major life activities there is no set definition that states when an impairment substantially limits a major life activity major life activities include but are not limited to caring for ones self performing manual tasks walking seeing hearing speaking breathing learning and working there may be other activities that should also be considered major life activities whether an impairment causes a substantial limitation to a major life activity needs to be decided on a casebycase basis if you are receiving disability benefits such as ssi ssdi or eaedc a housing authority or subsidized landlord will probably consider you to be disabled if you do not receive disability benefits the best thing to do to establish your disability is to get your doctor or medical care provider to write a letter detailing the nature of your impairment and stating that your impairment substantially limits you in a major life function a doctor should say which major life function is impaired and how it substantially limits your functioning having a record or history of an impairment having a record or history of an impairment means that even if you do not currently meet the definition of disabled you may be protected against discrimination if in the past you had a disability for example you may be functioning well now but in the past had a history of psychiatric hospitalizations if a landlord knows this or suspects this and discriminates on this basis she would be acting unlawfully perceived as having an impairment if a housing authority or subsidized landlord treats you as having an impairment regardless of whether you do or do not this would be discrimination for example if you are gay and a landlord refuses to rent to you because she believes that you or your friends are likely to have aids the landlord has acted unlawfully in violation of state and federal discrimination law this is true whether or not you or any of your friends have aids is drug addiction or alcoholism considered a disability illegal drug use current users of illegal drugs are not considered to be disabled on the basis of their illegal drug use or addiction if however you have had a history of drug abuse and are no longer using drugs you are protected under state and federal discrimination laws and may be able to ask for a reasonable accommodation if you have successfully completed a rehabilitation program have otherwise been rehabilitated successfully or are participating in a treatment or selfhelp program if you are applying for state public housing you will be presumed to be a current user if you have used illegal drugs in the past 12 months you can overcome this presumption by a convincing showing that you have permanently ceased all illegal use of controlled substances if you are applying to any other state or federal housing programs there is no set time frame for determining when someone is or is not a current user the courts have generally used a reasonableness standard for determining current use as a practical matter many housing authorities have set time frames to determine eligibility for housing for example a housing authority may have a policy usually unwritten that you will be denied if you were actively using illegal drugs within the last two years it may be unlawful however for the housing authority to apply this uniform policy where you can show that you have been successfully rehabilitated alcohol use alcohol use is treated somewhat differently from illegal drug use in large part because it is not unlawful to consume alcohol under both state and federal antidiscrimination laws you can be considered disabled and protected if you are substantially limited in one or more major life activity as a result of the alcoholism however under federal law you most likely will not be protected against discrimination if your current use of alcohol would prevent you from meeting your tenancy obligations or would constitute a direct threat to the health or safety of other tenants in addition under most federal housing programs you will be denied housing if the housing authority has reasonable cause to believe that a household members abuse or pattern of abuse of alcohol may threaten the health safety or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents it is important to note that a housing authority may not deny you housing solely for being an alcoholic unless there is evidence that the alcoholism is likely to interfere with other residents when is an accommodation reasonable if you are disabled and need a change to a rule or to a physical space you can ask for a reasonableaccommodation the accommodation is considered reasonable when it does not impose an undue administrative or financial burden on a housing authority or subsidized landlord or require a housing authority to fundamentally change a housing program there is no limit to the type of accommodation you can request as long as it meets this definition of reasonable for example accommodations or modifications that are considered reasonable and are required under the law include lowering the cabinets for someone in a wheelchair putting grab bars in bathrooms putting ramps in where there are five or fewer steps and putting in fire alarms that flash for people with hearing impairments in other cases there are no specific rules and it is up to you to advocate that a particular request is reasonable examples of accommodations that may be considered reasonable will be discussed in how a reasonable accommodation request can help do i need to put my request for reasonable accommodation in writing if you need a reasonable accommodation you should inform your landlord or prospective landlord that you are disabled and need a particular kind of adaptation or accommodation either to get into housing or to remain in housing at some point you will also need to show that you will be able to meet your tenancy obligations if such an accommodation is provided although a tenant does not need to put this request for a reasonable accommodation in writing it is better to do so first your request will probably be treated more seriously second in order to bring a fair housing claim later for a landlords refusal to make an accommodation you will have to prove both that your landlord knew or should have known that you were disabled and that you requested an accommodation at some point putting a request into writing makes this easier to prove some housing authorities have reasonable accommodation request forms see a sample letter to request an accommodation for an example see boston housing authoritys request form while under the law a housing authority may not require you to use a particular form it will generally speed up the process if you do use the forms requested by the particular housing authority when must i make the request for an accommodation it is advisable to make your request as soon as possible generally in order to obtain a reasonable accommodation an owner must be aware that a tenant is disabled and that the tenant is in need of an accommodation in the eviction context a tenant may request an accommodation before trial at trial or up until he or she is actually evicted
