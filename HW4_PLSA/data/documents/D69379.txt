are not fully developed and are called blasts or leukemia cells 2 symptoms may include bleeding and bruising problems feeling tired fever and an increased risk of infections 2 these symptoms occur due to a lack of normal blood cells 2 diagnosis is typically made by blood tests or bone marrow biopsy 2the exact cause of leukemia is unknown 4 a combination of genetic factors and environmental noninherited factors are believed to play a role 4 risk factors include smoking ionizing radiation some chemicals such as benzene  prior chemotherapy and down syndrome 4 3 people with a family history of leukemia are also at higher risk 3 there are four main types of leukemia — acute lymphoblastic leukemia all acute myeloid leukemia aml chronic lymphocytic leukemia cll and chronic myeloid leukemia cml — as well as a number of less common types 3 9 leukemias and lymphomas both belong to a broader group of tumors that affect the blood bone marrow and lymphoid system known as tumors of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues 10 11treatment may involve some combination of chemotherapy radiation therapy targeted therapy and bone marrow transplant in addition to supportive care and palliative care as needed 3 certain types of leukemia may be managed with watchful waiting 3 the success of treatment depends on the type of leukemia and the age of the person outcomes have improved in the developed world 9 the average fiveyear survival rate is 57 in the united states 5 in children under 15 the fiveyear survival rate is greater than 60 to 85 depending on the type of leukemia 12 in children with acute leukemia who are cancerfree after five years the cancer is unlikely to return 12in 2015 leukemia was present in 23 million people and caused 353500 deaths 7 6 in 2012 it newly developed in 352000 people 9 it is the most common type of cancer in children with three quarters of leukemia cases in children being the acute lymphoblastic type 3 however about 90 of all leukemias are diagnosed in adults with aml and cll being most common in adults 3 it occurs more commonly in the developed world 9contents  hide 1 classification11 general classification12 specific types2 signs

cllmyelogenous leukemia myeloid or nonlymphocytic acute myelogenous leukemia aml or myeloblastic chronic myelogenous leukemia cmlan explanation of acute leukemia general classification  editclinically and pathologically leukemia is subdivided into a variety of large groups the first division is between its acute and chronic forms acute leukemia is characterized by a rapid increase in the number of immature blood cells the crowding that results from such cells makes the bone marrow unable to produce healthy blood cells immediate treatment is required in acute leukemia because of the rapid progression and accumulation of the malignant cells which then spill over into the bloodstream and spread to other organs of the body acute forms of leukemia are the most common forms of leukemia in children chronic leukemia is characterized by the excessive buildup of relatively mature but still abnormal white blood cells typically taking months or years to progress the cells are produced at a much higher rate than normal resulting in many abnormal white blood cells whereas acute leukemia must be treated immediately chronic forms are sometimes monitored for some time before treatment to ensure maximum effectiveness of therapy chronic leukemia mostly occurs in older people but can occur in any age group additionally the diseases are subdivided according to which kind of blood cell is affected this divides leukemias into lymphoblastic or lymphocytic leukemias and myeloid or myelogenous leukemias in lymphoblastic or lymphocytic leukemias the cancerous change takes place in a type of marrow cell that normally goes on to form lymphocytes which are infectionfighting immune system cells most lymphocytic leukemias involve a specific subtype of lymphocyte the b cell in myeloid or myelogenous leukemias the cancerous change takes place in a type of marrow cell that normally goes on to form red blood cells some other types of white cells and platelets combining these two classifications provides a total of four main categories within each of these main categories there are typically several subcategories finally some rarer types are usually considered to be outside of this classification scheme specific types  editacute lymphoblastic leukemia all is the most common type of leukemia in young children it also affects adults especially those 65 and older standard treatments involve chemotherapy and radiotherapy the survival rates vary by age 85 in children and 50 in adults 13 subtypes include precursor b acute lymphoblastic leukemia precursor t acute lymphoblastic leukemia burkitts leukemia and acute biphenotypic leukemia chronic lymphocytic leukemia cll most often affects adults over the age of 55 it sometimes occurs in younger adults but it almost never affects children twothirds of affected people are men the fiveyear survival rate is 75 14 it is incurable but there are many effective treatments one subtype is bcell prolymphocytic leukemia a more aggressive disease acute myelogenous leukemia aml occurs more commonly in adults than in children and more commonly in men than women it is treated with chemotherapy the fiveyear survival rate is 40 except for apl acute promyelocytic leukemia which has a survival rate greater than 90 15 subtypes of aml include acute promyelocytic leukemia acute myeloblastic leukemia and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia chronic myelogenous leukemia cml occurs mainly in adults a very small number of children also develop this disease it is treated with imatinib gleevec in united states glivec in europe or other drugs 16 the fiveyear survival rate is 90 17 18 one subtype is chronic myelomonocytic leukemia hairy cell leukemia hcl is sometimes considered a subset of chronic lymphocytic leukemia but does not fit neatly into this category about 80 of affected people are adult men no cases in children have been reported hcl is incurable but easily treatable survival is 96 to 100 at ten years 19tcell prolymphocytic leukemia tpll is a very rare and aggressive leukemia affecting adults somewhat more men than women are diagnosed with this disease 20 despite its overall rarity it is the most common type of mature t cell leukemia 21 nearly all other leukemias involve b cells it is difficult to treat and the median survival is measured in months large granular lymphocytic leukemia may involve either tcells or nk cells like hairy cell leukemia which involves solely b cells it is a rare and indolent not aggressive leukemia 22adult tcell leukemia is caused by human tlymphotropic virus htlv a virus similar to hiv like hiv htlv infects cd4 tcells and replicates within them however unlike hiv it does not destroy them instead htlv immortalizes the infected tcells giving them the ability to proliferate abnormally human tcell lymphotropic virus types i and ii htlviii are endemic in certain areas of the world clonal eosinophilias or clonal hypereosinophilias are a group of hematological disorders characterized by the development and growth of a premalignant or malignant population of eosinophils in the bone marrow blood andor other tissues this population consists of a clone of eosinophils ie a group of genetically identical eosinophils derived from a sufficiently mutated ancestor cell 23 these disorders may evolve into chronic eosinophilic leukemia or may be associated with various forms of myeloid neoplasms lymphoid neoplasms myelofibrosis or the myelodysplastic syndrome 24 25 23signs and symptoms  editcommon symptoms of chronic or acute leukemia 26the most common symptoms in children are easy bruising pale skin fever and an enlarged spleen or liver 27damage to the bone marrow by way of displacing the normal bone marrow cells with higher numbers of immature white blood cells results in a lack of blood platelets which are important in the blood clotting process this means people with leukemia may easily become bruised bleed excessively or develop pinprick bleeds  petechiae  white blood cells which are involved in fighting pathogens may be suppressed or dysfunctional this could cause the patients immune system to be unable to fight off a simple infection or to start attacking other body cells because leukemia prevents the immune system from working normally some patients experience frequent infection ranging from infected tonsils sores in the mouth or diarrhea to lifethreatening pneumonia or opportunistic infections finally the red blood cell deficiency leads to anemia which may cause dyspnea and pallor some patients experience other symptoms such as feeling sick having fevers chills night sweats feeling fatigued and other flulike symptoms some patients experience nausea or a feeling of fullness due to an enlarged liver and spleen this can result in unintentional weight loss blasts affected by the disease may come together and become swollen in the liver or in the lymph nodes causing pain and leading to nausea 28if the leukemic cells invade the central nervous system then neurological symptoms notably headaches can occur uncommon neurological symptoms like migraines seizures or coma can occur as a result of brain stem pressure all symptoms associated with leukemia can be attributed to other diseases consequently leukemia is always diagnosed through medical tests the word leukemia which means white blood is derived from the characteristic high white blood cell count that presents in most afflicted patients before treatment the high number of white blood cells are apparent when a blood sample is viewed under a microscope with the extra white blood cells frequently being immature or dysfunctional the excessive number of cells can also interfere with the level of other cells causing further harmful imbalance in the blood count some leukemia patients do not have high white blood cell counts visible during a regular blood count this lesscommon condition is called aleukemia the bone marrow still contains cancerous white blood cells which disrupt the normal production of blood cells but they remain in the marrow instead of entering the bloodstream where they would be visible in a blood test for an aleukemic patient the white blood cell counts in the bloodstream can be normal or low aleukemia can occur in any of the four major types of leukemia and is particularly common in hairy cell leukemia 29causes  editthere is no single known cause for any of the different types of leukemias the few known causes which are not generally factors within the control of the average person account for relatively few cases 30 the cause for most cases of leukemia is unknown the different leukemias likely have different causes leukemia like other cancers results from mutations in the dna certain mutations can trigger leukemia by activating oncogenes or deactivating tumor suppressor genes and thereby disrupting the regulation of cell death differentiation or division these mutations may occur spontaneously or as a result of exposure to radiation or carcinogenic substances 31among adults the known causes are natural and artificial ionizing radiation a few viruses such as human tlymphotropic virus and some chemicals notably benzene and alkylating chemotherapy agents for previous malignancies 32 33 34 use of tobacco is associated with a small increase in the risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia in adults 32 cohort and casecontrol studies have linked exposure to some petrochemicals and hair dyes to the development of some forms of leukemia diet has very limited or no effect although eating more vegetables may confer a small protective benefit 30viruses have also been linked to some forms of leukemia for example human tlymphotropic virus htlv1 causes adult tcell leukemia 35a few cases of maternalfetal transmission a baby acquires leukemia because its mother had leukemia during the pregnancy have been reported 32 children born to mothers who use fertility drugs to induce ovulation are more than twice as likely to develop leukemia during their childhoods than other children 36radiation  editlarge doses of sr90 emission from nuclear reactors nicknamed bone seeker increases the risk of bone cancer and leukemia in animals and is presumed to do so in people 37genetic conditions  editsome people have a genetic predisposition towards developing leukemia this predisposition is demonstrated by family histories and twin studies 32 the affected people may have a single gene or multiple genes in common in some cases families tend to develop the same kinds of leukemia as other members in other families affected people may develop different forms of leukemia or related blood cancers 32in addition to these genetic issues people with chromosomal abnormalities or certain other genetic conditions have a greater risk of leukemia 33 for example people with down syndrome have a significantly increased risk of developing forms of acute leukemia especially acute myeloid leukemia  and fanconi anemia is a risk factor for developing acute myeloid leukemia 32 mutation in spred1 gene has been associated with a predisposition to childhood leukemia 38chronic myelogenous leukemia is associated with a genetic abnormality called the philadelphia translocation 95 of people with cml carry the philadelphia mutation although this is not exclusive to cml and can be observed in people with other types of leukemia 39 40 41 42nonionizing radiation  editwhether or not nonionizing radiation causes leukemia has been studied for several decades the international agency for research on cancer expert working group undertook a detailed review of all data on static and extremely low frequency electromagnetic energy which occurs naturally and in association with the generation transmission and use of electrical power 43 they concluded that there is limited evidence that high levels of elf magnetic but not electric fields might cause some cases of childhood leukemia 43 no evidence for a relationship to leukemia or another form of malignancy in adults has been demonstrated 43 since exposure to such levels of elfs is relatively uncommon the world health organization concludes that elf exposure if later proven to be causative would account for just 100 to 2400 cases worldwide each year representing 02 to 49 of the total incidence of childhood leukemia for that year about 003 to 09 of all leukemias 44diagnosis  editthe increase in white blood cells in leukemia diagnosis is usually based on repeated complete blood counts and a bone marrow examination following observations of the symptoms sometimes blood tests may not show that a person has leukemia especially in the early stages of the disease or during remission a lymph node biopsy can be performed to diagnose certain types of leukemia in certain situations following diagnosis blood chemistry tests can be used to determine the degree of liver and kidney damage or the effects of chemotherapy on the patient when concerns arise about other damage due to leukemia doctors may use an xray mri or ultrasound these can potentially show leukemias effects on such body parts as bones xray the brain mri or the kidneys spleen and liver ultrasound ct scans can be used to check lymph nodes in the chest though this is uncommon despite the use of these methods to diagnose whether or not a patient has leukemia many people have not been diagnosed because many of the symptoms are vague nonspecific and can refer to other diseases for this reason the american cancer society estimates that at least onefifth of the people with leukemia have not yet been diagnosed 29treatment  editmost forms of leukemia are treated with pharmaceutical medication typically combined into a multidrug chemotherapy regimen some are also treated with radiation therapy in some cases a bone marrow transplant is effective acute lymphoblastic  editfurther information acute lymphoblastic leukemia § treatment management of all is directed towards control of bone marrow and systemic wholebody disease additionally treatment must prevent leukemic cells from spreading to other sites particularly the central nervous system cns eg monthly lumbar punctures in general all treatment is divided into several phases induction chemotherapy to bring about bone marrow remission for adults standard induction plans include prednisone vincristine and an anthracycline drug other drug plans may include lasparaginase or cyclophosphamide for children with lowrisk all standard therapy usually consists of three drugs prednisone lasparaginase and vincristine for the first month of treatment consolidation therapy or intensification therapy to eliminate any remaining leukemia cells there are many different approaches to consolidation but it is typically a highdose multidrug treatment that is undertaken for a few months patients with low to averagerisk all receive therapy with antimetabolite drugs such as methotrexate and 6mercaptopurine 6mp highrisk patients receive higher drug doses of these drugs plus additional drugs cns prophylaxis preventive therapy to stop the cancer from spreading to the brain and nervous system in highrisk patients standard prophylaxis may include radiation of the head andor drugs delivered directly into the spine maintenance treatments with chemotherapeutic drugs to prevent disease recurrence once remission has been achieved maintenance therapy usually involves lower drug doses and may continue for up to three years alternatively allogeneic bone marrow transplantation may be appropriate for highrisk or relapsed patients 45chronic lymphocytic  editfurther information chronic lymphocytic leukemia § treatment decision to treat  edithematologists base cll treatment on both the stage and symptoms of the individual patient a large group of cll patients have lowgrade disease which does not benefit from treatment individuals with cllrelated complications or more advanced disease often benefit from treatment in general the indications for treatment are falling hemoglobin or platelet count progression to a later stage of disease painful diseaserelated overgrowth of lymph nodes or spleen an increase in the rate of lymphocyte production 46treatment approach  editfor most people with cll it is incurable by present treatments so treatment is directed towards suppressing the disease for many years rather than totally and permanently eliminating it the primary chemotherapeutic plan is combination chemotherapy with chlorambucil or cyclophosphamide plus a corticosteroid such as prednisone or prednisolone the use of a corticosteroid has the additional benefit of suppressing some related autoimmune diseases such as immunohemolytic anemia or immunemediated thrombocytopenia in resistant cases singleagent treatments with nucleoside drugs such as fludarabine 47 pentostatin or cladribine may be successful younger and healthier patients may choose allogeneic or autologous bone marrow transplantation in the hope of a permanent cure 48acute myelogenous  editfurther information acute myeloid leukemia § treatment many different anticancer drugs are effective for the treatment of aml treatments vary somewhat according to the age of the patient and according to the specific subtype of aml overall the strategy is to control bone marrow and systemic wholebody disease while offering specific treatment for the central nervous system cns if involved in general most oncologists rely on combinations of drugs for the initial induction phase of chemotherapy such combination chemotherapy usually offers the benefits of early remission and a lower risk of disease resistance consolidation and maintenance treatments are intended to prevent disease recurrence consolidation treatment often entails a repetition of induction chemotherapy or the intensification chemotherapy with additional drugs by contrast maintenance treatment involves drug doses that are lower than those administered during the induction phase 49chronic myelogenous  editfurther information chronic myelogenous leukemia § treatment there are many possible treatments for cml but the standard of care for newly diagnosed patients is imatinib gleevec therapy 50 compared to most anticancer drugs it has relatively few side effects and can be taken orally at home with this drug more than 90 of patients will be able to keep the disease in check for at least five years 50 so that cml becomes a chronic manageable condition in a more advanced uncontrolled state when the patient cannot tolerate imatinib or if the patient wishes to attempt a permanent cure then an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation may be performed this procedure involves highdose chemotherapy and radiation followed by infusion of bone marrow from a compatible donor approximately 30 of patients die from this procedure 50hairy cell  editfurther information hairy cell leukemia § treatment decision to treat patients with hairy cell leukemia who are symptomfree typically do not receive immediate treatment treatment is generally considered necessary when the patient shows signs and symptoms such as low blood cell counts eg infectionfighting neutrophil count below 10 kµl frequent infections unexplained bruises anemia or fatigue that is significant enough to disrupt the patients everyday life typical treatment approach patients who need treatment usually receive either one week of cladribine given daily by intravenous infusion or a simple injection under the skin or six months of pentostatin given every four weeks by intravenous infusion in most cases one round of treatment will produce a prolonged remission 51other treatments include rituximab infusion or selfinjection with interferonalpha in limited cases the patient may benefit from splenectomy removal of the spleen these treatments are not typically given as the first treatment because their success rates are lower than cladribine or pentostatin 52tcell prolymphocytic  editfurther information tcell prolymphocytic leukemia § treatment most patients with tcell prolymphocytic leukemia a rare and aggressive leukemia with a median survival of less than one year require immediate treatment 53tcell prolymphocytic leukemia is difficult to treat and it does not respond to most available chemotherapeutic drugs 53 many different treatments have been attempted with limited success in certain patients purine analogues pentostatin fludarabine cladribine chlorambucil and various forms of combination chemotherapy cyclophosphamide doxorubicin vincristine prednisone chop cyclophosphamide vincristine prednisone cop vincristine doxorubicin prednisone etoposide cyclophosphamide bleomycin vapecb  alemtuzumab campath a monoclonal antibody that attacks white blood cells has been used in treatment with greater success than previous options 53some patients who successfully respond to treatment also undergo stem cell transplantation to consolidate the response 53juvenile myelomonocytic  editfurther information juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia § treatment treatment for juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia can include splenectomy chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation 54prognosis  editthe success of treatment depends on the type of leukemia and the age of the person outcomes have improved in the developed world 9 the average fiveyear survival rate is 57 in the united states 5 in children under 15 the fiveyear survival rate is greater than 60 to 85 depending on the type of leukemia 12 in children with acute leukemia who are cancerfree after five years the cancer is unlikely to return 12outcomes depend on whether it is acute or chronic the specific abnormal white blood cell type the presence and severity of anemia or thrombocytopenia the degree of tissue abnormality the presence of metastasis and lymph node and bone marrow infiltration the availability of therapies and the skills of the health care team treatment outcomes may be better when people are treated at larger centers with greater experience 55epidemiology  editdeaths due

the world developed a form of leukemia and 209000 died from it 57 this represents about 3 of the almost seven million deaths due to cancer that year and about 035 of all deaths from any cause 57 of the sixteen separate sites the body compared leukemia was the 12th most common class of neoplastic disease and the 11th most common cause of cancerrelated death 57 leukemia occurs more commonly in the developed world 58united states  editabout 245000 people in the united states are affected with some form of leukemia including those that have achieved remission or cure rates from 1975 to 2011 have increased by 07 per year among children 59 approximately 44270 new cases of leukemia were diagnosed in the year 2008 in the us 60 this represents 29 of all cancers excluding simple basal cell and squamous cell skin cancers in the united states and 304 of all blood cancers 61among children with some form of cancer about a third have a type of leukemia most commonly acute lymphoblastic leukemia 60 a type of leukemia is the second most common form of cancer in infants under the age of 12 months and the most common form of cancer in older children 62 boys are somewhat more likely to develop leukemia than girls and white american children are almost twice as likely to develop leukemia than black american children 62 only about 3 cancer diagnoses among adults are for leukemias but because cancer is much more common among adults more than 90 of all leukemias are diagnosed in adults 60race is a risk factor in the united states hispanics especially those under the age of 20 are at the highest risk for leukemia while whites native americans asian americans and alaska natives are at higher risk than african americans 63more men than women are diagnosed with leukemia and die from the disease around 30 percent more men than women have leukemia 64uk  editoverall leukaemia is the eleventh most common cancer in the uk around 8600 people were diagnosed with the disease in 2011 and it is the ninth most common cause of cancer death around 4800 people died in 2012 65history  editsee also timeline of leukemia rudolf virchow leukemia was first described by anatomist and surgeon alfredarmandlouismarie velpeau in 1827 a more complete description was given by pathologist rudolf virchow in 1845 around ten years after virchows findings pathologist franz ernst christian neumann found that one deceased leukemia patients bone marrow was colored dirty greenyellow as opposed to the normal red this finding allowed neumann to conclude that a bone marrow problem was responsible for the abnormal blood of leukemia patients by 1900 leukemia was viewed as a family of diseases as opposed to a single disease by 1947 boston pathologist sidney farber believed from past experiments that aminopterin a folic acid mimic could potentially cure leukemia in children the majority of the children with all who were tested showed signs of improvement in their bone marrow but none of them were actually cured this however led to further experiments in 1962 researchers emil j freireich jr and emil frei iii used combination chemotherapy to attempt to cure leukemia the tests were successful with some patients surviving long after the tests 66etymology  editobserving an abnormally large number of white blood cells in a blood sample from a patient virchow called the condition leukämie in german which he formed from the two greek words leukos  λευκός  meaning white and haima  αἷμα  meaning blood society and culture  editaccording to susan sontag leukemia was often romanticized in 20thcentury fiction portrayed as a joyending clean disease whose fair innocent and gentle victims die young or at the wrong time as such it was the cultural successor to tuberculosis which held this cultural position until it was discovered to be an infectious disease 67 the 1970 romance novel love story is an example of this romanticization of leukemia in the united states around 54 billion is spent on treatment a year 68research directions  editsignificant research into the causes prevalence diagnosis treatment and prognosis of leukemia is being performed hundreds of clinical trials are being planned or conducted at any given time 69 studies may focus on effective means of treatment better ways of treating the disease improving the quality of life for patients or appropriate care in remission or after cures in general there are two types of leukemia research clinical or translational research and basic research clinicaltranslational research focuses on studying the disease in a defined and generally immediately patientapplicable way such as testing a new drug in patients by contrast basic science research studies the disease process at a distance such as seeing whether a suspected carcinogen can cause leukemic changes in isolated cells in the laboratory or how the dna changes inside leukemia cells as the disease progresses the results from basic research studies are generally less immediately useful to patients with the disease 70treatment through gene therapy is currently being pursued one such approach used genetically modified t cells to attack cancer cells in 2011 a year after treatment two of the three patients with advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia were reported to be cancerfree 71 and in 2013 three of five subjects who had acute lymphocytic leukemia were reported to be in remission for five months to two years 72 identifying stem cells that cause different types of leukaemia is also being researched 73pregnancy  editleukemia is rarely associated with pregnancy affecting only about 1 in 10000 pregnant women 74 how it is handled depends primarily on the type of leukemia nearly all leukemias appearing in pregnant women are acute leukemias 75 acute leukemias normally require prompt aggressive treatment despite significant risks of pregnancy loss and birth defects especially if chemotherapy is given during the developmentally sensitive first trimester 74 chronic myelogenous leukemia can be treated with relative safety at any time during pregnancy with interferonalpha hormones 74 treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemias which are rare in pregnant women can often be postponed until after the end of the pregnancy 74 75see also  editacute erythroid leukemia antileukemic drugs medications used to kill leukemia cells hematologic
