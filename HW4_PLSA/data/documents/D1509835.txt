look 35  smell 325  taste 325  feel 35  overall 35 overall modelo negro is far better than most mexican adjunct lagers i’ve had this beer is a very dark amber color darker than dos equis amber a beer i would compare this too the sip is a tad watery but still has more flavor than an average beer of this type a bit more bitter than i expected it to be the beer leaves a distinct aftertaste one that isn’t all too appealing overalla solid option to pair with spicy food at a latin restaurant but i wouldn’t go out of my way to buy this beer at a store 516 characters beer man247 mar 20 2018408 5 r

then you ought to go out and try it it sports classy looking label art as well no date on the bottle though cheers b 8589 score range 288 characters nass mar 15 2018365 5 r dev 93look 35  smell 35

you get with a dark beer f goes down smooth with very limited fizz o i like this beer a lot it goes down smoother than any dark beer ive ever had at a mexican restaurant this is a far better option than a watery dos equis 373 charactershenrycjones4 feb 14 2018325 5 r dev 27look 325  smell 325  taste 325  feel 325  overall 325 got a bottle at the taco stand nothing really special good with a
