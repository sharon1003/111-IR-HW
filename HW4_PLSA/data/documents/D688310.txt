retirement planning iras when youre over the ira limit non deductible ira contributions you can still save with an irashare flip pin email•••by michael rubin updated february 20 2018many people are not allowed to make taxdeductible contributions to their regular ira or the amount of the contribution may be limited if your income exceeds specific levels certain restrictions may apply to you that affect your ability to deduct your contributions however you still can save for your retirement with a nondeductible ira contribution although your non deductible ira contributions will not reduce your taxes in the year you make them the earnings on them are taxdeferred a key tax advantage of a regular ira nondeductible ira contributions build basis it may be discouraging when you dont receive any immediate tax benefit from a nondeductible ira contribution but the taxdeferred growth can be significant and may ultimately make the contribution worthwhile especially if you expect to have a lower tax rate after you retire than you do now when you take your regular ira distributions during retirement you pay taxes on the growth however any nondeductible contributions are treated as your basis since you effectively paid tax on the money when you made the contribution you won’t have to pay tax on it again later for example say you had made a 2000 nondeductible contribution one year ago and your account balance through additional deductible contributions and investment growth was worth 20000 when you make a withdrawal if you were to make a 1000 withdrawal during retirement only 900 would be considered taxable income since 10 2000 divided by 20000 was a return of a nondeductible basis its not always clear whether nondeductible ira contributions are the best place for you to stash your retirement savings for example if you expect your income and your tax rate to continue rising you may want to pay taxes on earnings as you go rather than defer them ira income restrictions rules for ira contributions are complex and it pays to review them each year in addition the contribution limits can vary from year to year for tax year 2017 those 50 and older can put a combined total of 6500 into their traditional and roth iras those 49 and younger can put a combined total of 5500 into their traditional and roth iras these limits dont apply to rollover contributions or reservist repayments however you may not be able to deduct everything you contribute to a traditional ira if you are employed by a company that offers a workplace retirement account such as a 401 k or 403 b you face certain income limits for deducting your ira contributions this is true regardless of whether you actually choose to participate in the workplace retirement plan for tax year 2017 those covered by a retirement plan at work and filing as single or head of household making 62000 or less are eligible to take the full deduction while those filing as married filing jointly or as a qualified widow er and making 99000 or less are eligible for the full deduction if you are married filing jointly and your spouse is covered by a workplace plan but youre not you can deduct the full amount if you make 184000 or less deductions are phased out from there as income rises those who are married filing separately are subject to more stringent income rules although anyone who is separated and who lived apart for the entire year is treated as single by the irs for the purposes of these limits on the other hand if neither you nor your spouse is eligible to participate in a workplace retirement plan then you may make deductible ira contributions as long as you or your spouse have earned income regardless of the amount roth ira as an alternative many people who have income exceeding the limits for a regular ira deduction may still be eligible for a roth ira contribution which has significantly higher income limits see 2017 roth ira income limits  if this is the case for you it typically makes sense to choose a roth ira contribution over a nondeductible ira after all while neither contribution is deductible with a regular ira the contribution grows taxdeferred but a roth ira contribution grows taxfree
