viscosity 1 it exists in both liquids and gases and is essentially a friction force between different layers of fluid as they move past one another viscosity is a property of the fluid which opposes the relative motion between the two surfaces of the fluid in a fluid that are moving at different in liquids the viscosity is due to the cohesive forces between the molecules whilst in gases the viscosity is due to collisions between the molecules ideal fluid is fluid having no resistance to shear stress zero viscosity is observed only at very low temperatures in superfluid otherwise all

natural that other materials such as fluids too have such a friction acting a more viscous fluid will resist deformation more than a less viscous fluid consider the following gif image courtesy

among the most important concepts our aircraft spacecraft cars and even a golf ball all face drag or friction due to the effect of viscosity if these weren’t present then our life would have changed a lot in many a sense these effects are ill effects but sometimes these are quite essential too viscosity is one among the main factors restricting developments in aerospace applications because a lot

strain rate generated by a given applied shear stress viscosity is caused by cohesive force between molecules of liquid  by collision between molecules of gas newton’s law of viscosity this general physical law is derived from empirical observations so no mathematical proof as expectation consider a flow in which fluid particles move in a particular direction maintaining straight parallel lines for considering viscosity newton proposed some fundamental assumption he proposed thatfirstly when a flow is adjacent to surface stick to it  have zero velocity relative to the boundary which is called no slip condition other fluid particles attempting to slide over them are retarded because of an interaction between faster  slower moving fluid a phenomenon that gives rise to shearing force secondly shear stress on an interface tangent to the direction of flow is proportional to distance rate of change of velocity mathematicallyµ is called coefficient of viscosity it can be considered as

olympics in london many journalistic sources claimed that this was an illustration of the surface tension of water see  incredible shot of us swimmer that perfectly shows the phenomenon of surface tension  its not whats actually being demonstrated here is the viscosity of water i showed this picture to my mechanics students when we covered fluids the first thing to point out is that the swimmer is emerging from below if water were an ideal fluid ie one with no viscosity then the water on top of the swimmer would run off immediately and the part of him above the level of the pool would be dry for this reason john von neumann referred to an ideal fluid as dry water a real as opposed to an ideal fluid has nonzero viscosity this means that a layer of flow cannot slide frictionlessly on another layer it therefore takes force to maintain transverse velocity gradients in the fluid heres an illustration from  the flow of wet water  in the feynman lectures on physics vol ii lecture 41 p 2 there are two solid parallel plates one on the top and one on the bottom both with area matha math in between them theres a layer of fluid suppose that you hold the bottom plate still while you move the top plate with constant velocity mathv0 math if the fluid were ideal the plates wouldnt find out that theyre moving relative to each other and no force would be needed to keep the bottom plate at rest and the top plate with fixed mathv0 math inertia would take care of that but if the fluid has viscosity then therell be friction between the fluid layers and also between the solid plates and the fluid directly in contact with them the water that touches the bottom plate wants to stay at rest and the water touching the top plate wants to move along with velocity mathv0 math so youll get a transverse gradient for the fluid velocity mathv math as shown in the picture maintaining this gradient requires that you exert a force mathf  eta a v0  d  mathwhere mathd math is the transverse separation of the plates if you hold the bottom plate fixed this is the force needed to keep the top plate going with velocity mathv0 math if you pull the top plate along with velocity mathv0 math this is the force needed to hold the bottom plate in place without this force the top plate will accelerate the bottom plate or the bottom plate will decelerate the top plate until they are moving with the same velocity and the transverse gradient of mathv math vanishes the coefficient matheta math is called the first viscosity or shear viscosity the fact that matheta math is constant independent of mathd math and mathv0 math is an assumption fluids such as water for which this is valid are called newtonian fluids because isaac newton was the first person to propose it in book ii of his principia mathematica published in 1687 theres also something called the second or bulk viscosity but its not very important in most situations when people say just viscosity they mean matheta math this is the reason why the water doesnt just immediately run off the swimmer the water sticks to the swimmers solid surface and that pulls along the surrounding water for this reason feynman refers to a real fluid as wet water notice that the picture looks oily oil has a substantially higher viscosity than water and would therefore run off more slowly you wouldnt need a highspeed camera to see this effect for a swimmer emerging from a pool of oil surface tension is something else altogether it is a force that tends to reduce the surface area of a fluid in this case it opposes deformations that make the surface of the water in the pool otherwise than flat note that the surface tension of water is significantly higher than that of oil so that it cannot be the reason for the apparent oiliness of the picture above surface tension may account for a dry solid object that would otherwise sink resting on the waters surface which is deformed by the weight of the solid as if it were a taut sheet but you never see the converse of that with a wet solid that would otherwise float being kept at rest and entirely submerged just underneath a water surface that is deformed outward

example honey has a much higher viscosity than water viscosity is a property of the fluid which opposes the relative motion between the two surfaces of the fluid in a fluid that are moving at different velocities when the fluid is forced through a tube the particles which compose the fluid generally move more quickly near the tubes axis and more slowly near its walls therefore some stress such as a pressure difference between the two ends of the tube is needed to overcome the friction between particle layers to keep the fluid moving for a given velocity pattern the stress required is proportional to the fluids viscosity a fluid that has no resistance to shear stress is known as an ideal or inviscid fluid zero viscosity is observed only at very low temperatures in superfluids otherwise all fluids have positive viscosity and are technically said to be viscous or viscid in common parlance however a liquid is said to be viscous if its viscosity is substantially greater than that of water and may be described as mobile if the viscosity is noticeably less than water the dynamic shear viscosity of a fluid expresses its resistance to shearing flows where adjacent layers move parallel to each other with different speeds it can be defined through the idealized situation known as a couette flow where a layer of fluid is trapped between two horizontal plates one fixed and one

answered what is “viscosity” when we talk of viscosity we usually mean the thickness of a fluid like for example water is of low viscosity whereas oil is of high viscosity however such a definition may not be accurate when we are dealing with fluids with different densities therefore the correct definition would be that “viscosity is a measure of a fluids resistance to flow” it describes the internal friction of a moving fluid a fluid with high viscosity resists motion because its molecular makeup gives it a lot of internal friction a fluid with low viscosity flows easily because its molecular makeup results in very little friction when it is in motion at a molecular level viscosity is a result the interaction between the different molecules in a fluid this can be also understood as friction between the molecules in the fluid just like in the case of friction between moving solids viscosity will determine the energy required to make a fluid flow787 views · view upvoters paul
