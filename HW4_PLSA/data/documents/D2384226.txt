foundations of mathematics  set theory  ordinal numbers interactive entries  interactive demonstrations ordinal number in common usage an ordinal number is an adjective which describes the numerical position of an object eg first second third etc in formal set theory an ordinal number sometimes simply called an ordinal for short is one of the numbers in georg cantors extension of the whole numbers an ordinal number is defined as the order type of a well ordered set dauben 1990 p 199 moore 1982 p 52 suppes 1972 p 129 finite ordinal numbers are commonly denoted using arabic numerals while transfinite ordinals are denoted using lower case greek letters it is easy to see that every finite totally ordered set is well ordered any two totally ordered sets with elements for a nonnegative integer are order isomorphic and therefore have the same order type which is also an ordinal number the ordinals for finite sets are denoted 0 1 2 3  ie the integers one less than the corresponding nonnegative integers the first transfinite ordinal denoted is the order type of the set of nonnegative integers dauben 1990 p 152 moore 1982 p viii rubin 1967 pp 86 and 177 suppes 1972 p 128 this is the smallest of cantors transfinite numbers defined to be the smallest ordinal number greater than the ordinal number of the whole numbers conway and guy 1996 denote it with the notation  from the definition of ordinal comparison it follows that the ordinal numbers are a well ordered set in order of increasing size the ordinal numbers are 0 1 2    the notation of ordinal numbers can be a bit counterintuitive eg even though  the cardinal number of the set of countable ordinal numbers is denoted  aleph1  if is a well ordered set with ordinal number then the set of all ordinals is order isomorphic to this provides the motivation to define an ordinal as the set of all ordinals less than itself john von neumann defined a set to be an ordinal number iff1 if is a member of then is a proper subset of2 if and are members of then one of the following is true is a member of or is a member of3 if is a nonempty proper subset of then there exists a member of such that the intersection is empty rubin 1967 p 176 ciesielski 1997 p 44 this is the standard representation of ordinals in this representationsymbol elements description0 empty set1 set of one element2 set of two elements3 set of three elementsset of all finite ordinalsset of all countable ordinalsset of all countable and ordinalsset all finite ordinals and ordinals for all nonnegative integers rubin 1967 p 272 provides a nice definition of the ordinals since for any ordinal the union is a bigger ordinal there is no largest ordinal and the class of all ordinals is therefore a proper class as shown by the buraliforti paradox  ordinal numbers have some other rather peculiar properties the sum of two ordinal numbers can take on two different values the sum of three can take on five values the first few terms of this sequence are 2 5 13 33 81 193 449  namely 2 5 13 33 81 193 449 1089 2673 6561 15633 37249  conway and guy 1996 oeis a005348  the sum of ordinals has either or possible answers for conway and guy 1996is the same as but is equal to  is larger than any number of the form is larger than and so on there exist ordinal numbers which cannot be constructed from smaller ones by finite additions multiplications and exponentiations these ordinals obey cantors equation the first such ordinal is the next isthen follow                        conway and guy 1996 ordinal addition ordinal multiplication and ordinal exponentiation can all be defined although these definitions also work perfectly well for order types this does not seem to be commonly done there are two methods commonly used to define operations on the ordinals one is using sets and the other is inductively see also aleph1 axiom of choice buraliforti paradox cantors equation cardinal number initial ordinal order statistic order type power set surreal number well ordered set references cantor g über unendliche lineare punktmannigfältigkeiten arbeiten zur mengenlehre aus dem jahren 18721884 leipzig germany teubnerarchiv zur mathematik 1884 ciesielski k set theory for the working mathematician cambridge england cambridge university press 1997 conway j h and guy r k cantors ordinal numbers in the book of numbers new york springerverlag pp 266267 and 274 1996 dauben j w georg cantor his mathematics and philosophy of the infinite princeton nj princeton university press 1990 moore g h zermelos axiom of choice its origin development and influence new york springerverlag 1982 rubin j e set theory for the mathematician new york holdenday 1967 suppes p axiomatic set theory new york dover 1972 sloane n j a sequence a005348 m1435 in the online encyclopedia of integer sequences referenced on wolframalpha ordinal number cite this as weisstein eric w ordinal number from math world a wolfram web resource httpmathworldwolframcomordinal numberhtml
