to vegetables being frozen blanching stops enzyme actions which can cause loss of flavor color and texture up until harvest time enzymes cause vegetables to grow and mature if vegetables are not blanched or blanching is not long enough the enzymes continue to be active during frozen storage causing offcolors offflavors and toughening blanching slows or stops enzymatic action preserving flavor color and texturecleanses the surface of dirt bacteria molds and other organismsbrightens the colorhelps retard loss of vitamins andsoftens vegetables and makes them easier to pack and less susceptible to freezer burn blanching time is crucial and varies with the vegetable and size underblanching actually stimulates the activity of enzymes and is worse than no blanching overblanching causes loss of flavor color vitamins and minerals follow recommended blanching times below or attaches to each relevant recipe blanching applies to freezing and many drying recipes but not to canning since canned foods are effectively blanched during the heat treatment in the cannerhow to blanch vegetables and fruits water blanching for home freezing the most satisfactory way to heat all vegetables is in boiling water use a blancher which has a blanching basket and cover or fit a wire basket into a large pot with a lid use one gallon water per pound of prepared vegetables put the vegetable in a blanching basket and lower into vigorously boiling water over high heat place a lid on the blancher if you dont have a basket just dump them into the pot as shown in the photo the water should return to boiling within 1 minute or you are using too much vegetable for the amount of boiling water start counting the blanching time as soon as the water returns to a boil keep heat high for the time given in the directions for the vegetable you are freezing see further down the page for blanching timesas soon as blanching is complete vegetables should be cooled quickly and thoroughly to stop the cooking process to cool pl nge the basket of vegetables immediately into a large quantity of ice water 60Âºf or below if you didnt use a basket just pour the pot into a colander in the sink then dump the strained vegetables into the ice water if ice is used about one pound of ice for each pound of vegetable is needed cool the vegetables for the same length of time that you blanched them or longer if they are still warm drain vegetables thoroughly after cooling extra moisture can cause a loss of quality when vegetables are frozen simply pouring them into a strainer or colander in your sink and leting them drain for 2 or 3 minutes is fine steam blanching heating in steam is recommended for a few vegetables for broccoli pumpkin sweet potatoes and winter squash both steaming and boiling are satisfactory methods steam blanching takes about 112 times longer than water blanching to steam use a pot with a tight lid and a basket that holds the food at least three inches above the bottom of the pot put an inch or two of water in the pot and bring the water to a boil put the vegetables in the basket in a single layer so that steam reaches all parts quickly cover the pot and keep heat high start counting steaming time as soon as the lid is on see steam blanching times recommended for the vegetables listed below microwave blanching microwave blanching may not be effective since research shows that some enzymes may not be inactivated this could result in offflavors and loss of texture and color those choosing to run the risk of low quality vegetables by microwave blanching should be sure to work in small quantities using the directions for their specific microwave oven microwave blanching will not save time or energy blanching timesvegetable blanching time
