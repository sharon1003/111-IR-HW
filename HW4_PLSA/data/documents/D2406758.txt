pop and rock interview the tallest man on earth it feels like such a freedom to be loudby laura barton kristian matsson sings of grief and personal revelation but when he takes to the stage his mission is to preach to the unconverted tue 23 jun 2015 1034 edt0627 est542 1the tallest man on earth … ‘some of these songs when i recorded them i had to change the lyrics they were too personal’ photograph andrew bengegetty images t here is a moment twothirds of the way into the title track of the tallest man on earth ’s new album dark bird is home when kristian matsson’s voice seems to give way completely “i thought that this would last for a million years but now i need to go” he sings before a pause and a cry of tearful exasperation “… ah fuck”dark bird is home is matsson’s fourth album and his fullestsounding collection to date with layers of rich instrumentation and staxstyle backing vocals but at heart these are small songs songs of grief and personal revelation written after the breakup of his marriage they came together over the course of a summer at home in sweden “when i was totally using songwriting as an outlet” they capture a period of flux a time when it became apparent that his life would no longer follow the trajectory he had anticipated and with that came a strange mingling of emotions wonder and excitement as well as fierce sadness“some of these songs when i recorded them i had to change the lyrics they were too personal” he says “because when i got to recording the vocals i could just see the images i was singing about in front of me it became really real that song dark bird is home is special because … it’s pretty obvious what it’s about it’s communicating to my best friend it’s a song that i needed to write”the tallest man on earth

on earth – sagres in some ways that lyric sums up many of the forces that have characterised matsson’s life to date – the desire for fixed points moments of stillness places to belong as well as the wild energy and itinerant life of a musician matsson grew up in the swedish countryside and still has his home there now “i love it” he says “it’s where i will end my days to me it’s the prettiest place in the world – it’s rural there’s a lot of small villages and all the forests and all the rolling hills i have a house with a river on one side and a mountain on the other it’s pretty great if you like nature”from a musical perspective sweden was also matsson believes an interesting place to begin “what i’m grateful for now is that there were a lot of people in bands but no trends” he explains “so you just do things you have fun and you nerd into different genres there is a lot of folk music around but then i started playing electric guitar and i was in punk bands and glam bands i loved david bowie and that changed into wanting to be iggy pop and so i stopped playing guitar and started climbing around with no shirt on in weird places in the countryside”but at some point he started to play the acoustic guitar “and somehow that felt like me” he says “i started to listen to a lot of old weird blues to skip james weird sounds surreal sounds and i started tuning my guitar differently and all of a sudden i realised i could do whatever with this acoustic guitar and it suited my personality to do whatever – the wildness of it wasn’t so far from punk”that realisation was he says “such an inspiring start to what i’m doing now i found something that was perfect for me i’m a highenergy person – my mind goes pretty fast to different places but i could find a stillness in playing that music a place where i could put my weird energy and it felt so great”fields of our home the tallest man on earth dark bird is home1 fields of our home 4272 darkness of the dream 5003

bulk of the previous seven years on tour acquiring a broad and dedicated following around the world but now he was weary and so he headed home that winter with the intention of taking a long stretch of time off the road “i was going to go home and take a year out” he says “try to live at home try to take care of my house i was going to start recording in the studio that i just built there were a lot of things …” he trails off “i was looking forward to going home i’d been going forth and back but i’d also been romanticising home not realising how much touring had changed me” he felt the disconnect almost immediately upon his return “coming home there’s so much space and quiet – you hear your thoughts and hear them loud” he says “and i was not in balance i grew into something new now i have places all over the world that are important to me”one of those places is wisconsin while matsson had recorded the bulk of the album at his home studio with the assistance of bj burton it was to justin vernon’s studio in eau claire that he headed to finish the new songs – recording the vocals and adding extra instrumentation by many of his “talented friends” matsson is a particularly gifted live performer playing alone with a kind of tightly coiled nearfury that can fill a huge stage “it feels like such a freedom to be loud to stare people in the eyes” he explains “i’m pushing it sometimes – because there are things i can’t do in the street that i can do on the stage”‘there are things i can’t do on the street that i can do on the stage’ … kristian matsson at hurricane festival june 2015 photograph alexander koernerredferns via getty images his greatest challenge he says is to convert an audience member through a kind of intense charm offensive played out over the course of a song or a set “you play directly to one person” he laughs “because at most shows there’s a couple there – one who’s a really big fan and one who’s been dragged along and is bored so i focus on the one that’s bored and try to make them smile or laugh i look at them for a while then i don’t look at them then i know there’s a part coming up where i can make eye contact it’s inspiring to try to connect to people in a different way to how we do normally”this time though and for the first time since he was a teenager he will tour with a full band including some of those talented friends from wisconsin it suits the new songs of course and perhaps it better suits his mood too – after all this time touring solo never quite sure where you should call home people can become a place to belong “it’s just something i need now” he says “i think it will help me to calm down”the tallest man on earth plays at koko london on 23 june the album dark bird is home is out now on dead oceans topics pop
