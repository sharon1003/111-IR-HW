group inhabited irvine about 2000 years ago gaspar de portolà a spanish explorer came to the area in 1769 which led to the establishment of forts missions and cattle herds the king of spain parceled out land for missions and private use after mexicos independence from spain in 1821 the mexican government secularized the missions and assumed control of the lands it began distributing the land to mexican citizens who applied for grants three large spanishmexican grants made up the land that later became the irvine ranch rancho santiago de santa ana rancho san joaquin and rancho lomas de santiago camp bonita at irvine ranch in 1937in 1864 jose andres sepulveda owner of rancho san joaquin sold 50000 acres 200 km 2 to benjamin and thomas flint llewellyn bixby and james irvine for 18000 to resolve debts due to the great drought in 1866 irvine flint and bixby acquired 47000acre 190 km 2 rancho lomas de santiago for 7000 after the mexicanamerican war the land of rancho santiago de santa ana fell prey to tangled titles in 1868 the ranch was divided among four claimants as part of a lawsuit flint bixby and irvine the ranches were devoted to sheep grazing however in 1870 tenant farming was permitted in 1878 james irvine acquired his partners interests for 150000 his 110000 acres 450 km 2 stretched 23 miles 37 km from the pacific ocean to the santa ana river james irvine died in 1886 the ranch was inherited by his son james irvine jr who incorporated it into the irvine company james jr shifted the ranch operations to field crops olive and citrus crops in 1888 the santa fe railroad extended its line to fallbrook junction north of san diego and named a station along the way after james irvine the town that formed around this station was named myford after irvines son because a post office in calaveras county already bore the family name the town was renamed irvine in 1914 13suburban development in irvine ranch in 1975the developing urban core in the city of irvine in 2010by 1918 60000 acres 240 km 2 of lima beans were grown on the irvine ranch two marine corps facilities mcas el toro and mcas tustin were built during world war ii on ranch land sold to the government james irvine jr died in 1947 at the age of 80 his son myford assumed the presidency of the irvine company he began opening small sections of the irvine ranch to urban development the irvine ranch played host to the boy scouts of america s 1953 national scout jamboree jamboree road a major street which now stretches from newport beach to the city of orange was named in honor of this event david sills then a young boy scout from peoria illinois was among the attendees at the 1953 jamboree sills came back to irvine as an adult and went on to serve four terms as the citys mayor myford irvine died in 1959 the same year the university of california asked the irvine company for 1000 acres 4 km 2 for a new university campus the irvine company sold the requested land for 1 and later the state purchased an additional 500 acres 20 km 2  14william pereira the universitys consulting architect and the irvine company planners drew up master plans for a city of 50000 people surrounding the new university the plan called for industrial residential and recreational areas commercial centers and greenbelts the new community was to be named irvine the old agricultural town of irvine where the railroad station and post office were located was renamed east irvine 13 the first phases of the villages of turtle rock university park westpark then called culverdale el camino real and walnut were completed by 1970 on december 28 1971 the residents of these communities voted to incorporate a substantially larger city than the one envisioned by the pereira plan by january 1999 irvine had a population of 134000 and a total area of 43 square miles 111 km 2  12in the 1970s the mayor was bill vardoulis after the fall of saigon in 1975 a large influx of vietnamese refugees settled in nearby fountain valley especially in the late 1970s and throughout the 80s forming a large percentage of asian americans in the city in late 2003 after a tenyearlong legal battle irvine annexed the former el toro marine corps air station this added 73 square miles 19 km 2 of land to the city and blocked an initiative championed by newport beach residents to replace john wayne airport with a new airport at el toro 15 most of this land has become part of the orange county great park geography  editirvine borders tustin to the north santa ana to the northwest lake forest to the east laguna hills and laguna woods to the southeast costa mesa to the west and newport beach to the southwest irvine also shares a small border with orange to the north on open lands by the sr 261 san diego creek which flows northwest into upper newport bay is the primary watercourse draining the city its largest tributary is peters canyon wash most of irvine is in a broad flat valley between loma ridge in the north and san joaquin hills in the south in the extreme northern and southern areas however are several hills plateaus and canyons a planned city  edita view of the irvine business complex and the 405 freeway los angeles architect william pereira and irvine company employee raymond watson designed irvines layout which is nominally divided into townships called villages separated by sixlane streets each township contains houses of similar design along with commercial centers religious institutions and schools commercial districts are checkerboarded in a periphery around the central townships pereira originally envisioned a circular plan with numerous artificial lakes and the university in the center when the irvine company refused to relinquish valuable farmland in the flat central region of the ranch for this plan the university site was moved to the base of the southern coastal hills the design that ended up being used was based on the shape of a necklace with the villages strung along two parallel main streets which terminate at university of california irvine uci the pendant 16 residential areas are now bordered by two commercial districts the irvine business complex to the west and the irvine spectrum to the east traces of the original circular design are still visible in the layout of the uci campus and the two artificial lakes at the center of woodbridge one of the central villages the planning areas of irvine all streets have landscaping allowances rightsofway for powerlines also serve as bicycle corridors parks and greenbelts to tie together ecological preserves the city irrigates the greenery with reclaimed water the homeowners associations which govern some village neighborhoods exercise varying degrees of control on the appearances of homes in more restrictive areas houses roofing paint colors and landscaping are regulated older parts of the village of northwood that were developed beginning in the early 1970s independently of the irvine company have the distinction of being a larger village that is not under the purview of a homeowners association as a result homeowners in the older northwood areas do not pay a monthly village association fee its neighborhoods are generally not as uniform in appearance as those in other villages such as westpark and woodbridge however the more tightly regulated villages generally offer more amenities such as membersonly swimming pools tennis courts and parks in addition to association dues homeowners in villages developed in the 1980s and later may be levied a melloroos special tax which came about in the post proposition 13 era for homeowners in these areas the association dues coupled with the melloroos special tax may add significantly to the cost of living in the city rue rueda

phenomenon widespread in southern california with overcast mornings and occasional drizzle late summer and autumn are warm and mostly dry with occasional bouts of humid weather extending from pacific hurricanes off the west coast of mexico winters are mild with most winters having no frost and can be hot and dry when the santa ana winds blow precipitation in irvine occurs predominantly during the winter months because irvine is close to the coast different parts of irvine have different microclimates for instance the june gloom effect is stronger in the southern parts of irvine closer to the pacific ocean it can occasionally snow in the santa ana mountains to the northeast of irvine 19 snow within the lowerlying parts of irvine is very rare but the area received three inches of snow in
