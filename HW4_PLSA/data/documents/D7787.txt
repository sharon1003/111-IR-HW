summary the cisco wireless location appliance software contains a default password for the root administrative account a user who logs in using this username has complete control of the device this password is the same in all installations of the product prior to version 21340 when shipped as part of a new product purchase this vulnerability still exists on upgraded installations unless explicit steps have been taken to change the password after the initial installation of the product there are workarounds available for this vulnerability this advisory is available at httptoolsciscocomsecuritycentercontentcisco security advisoryciscosa20061012wla  affected products this section provides details on affected products vulnerable products this vulnerability affects cisco 2700 series wireless location appliances shipped with versions prior to 21340 the version of software on the wireless location appliance can be determined in one of three ways from the command line the version can be determined with the getserverinfo command the version is contained in the first five lines of output which will look similar to the following output from a device running version 11730 server config  product name cisco wireless location appliance version 11730another way to get the version from the command line is to view the file optlocserverconfversiontxt for a wla running version 20420 the contents of that file should be similar to rootlocserv  cat optlocserverconfversiontxt tue jan 31 110835 pst 2006 buildnumber 42 minornumber 0 patchnumber 0 majornumber 2 branchnamehot productnamecisco wireless location appliance the version is simply obtained by assembling the numbers beginning with the majornumber followed by minornumber buildnumber and patchnumber in that order with each number separated by a period lastly the version may be obtained via the web interface on a cisco wireless control system wcs for any location appliances which are configured on it browsing to the locations tab and clicking on location servers in the resulting menu will give a list of location appliances with their corresponding versions under the versions column products confirmed not vulnerable no other cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities details the cisco wireless location appliance wla uses rf fingerprinting technology to simultaneously track 80211 wireless devices from directly within a wlan infrastructure by design the cisco wireless location appliance is directly integrated into the wlan infrastructure using cisco wireless lan controllers and cisco aironet lightweight access points to track the physical location of wireless devices the cisco wireless location appliance can be managed via a virtual terminal standard keyboard and monitor attached directly to the appliance a local serial console remote ssh connections andor remote secure web sessions a special administrative account is provided so that certain management troubleshooting tasks and basic initial setup can be performed the default username for administrator login is root without the quotes and the default password is password without the quotes both the username and password are case sensitive this issue has been addressed in fixed versions of software by prompting the user to change the password on the root account during the appliance setup installation this only applies to new wla devices shipped initially with a nonvulnerable version of software for the initial installation previous versions of software which have been upgraded will not prompt the user to change the password for the root user during the upgrade this issue is documented in cisco bug id cscsb92893  registered customers only   workarounds the vulnerability described in this document can be eliminated by logging in to the affected wla and changing the default password for the administrative root account to a strong password chosen by the user if the password has not previously been changed the default username for the administrator login is root without the quotes and the default password is password without the quotes both the username and password are case sensitive after successfully logging in to the wla as root the default password may be changed by running the passwd command a reboot is not required for the new password to take effect so network operations will not be disrupted fixed software this vulnerability is fixed in versions 21340 and later when shipped on new devices for initial installation of the cisco wireless location appliance software when considering software upgrades also consult httpwwwciscocomgopsirt and any subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution in all cases customers should exercise caution to be certain the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release if the information is not clear contact the cisco technical assistance center tac or your contracted maintenance provider for assistance exploitation and public announcements the cisco psirt is aware of several instances in which cisco wireless location appliances have been compromised via the default root password
