from wikipedia the free encyclopedianavigation search for other uses see vix disambiguation cboe volatility index vix 1985–2012 the cboe volatility index known by its ticker symbol vix is a popular measure of the stock market s expectation of volatility implied by sp 500 index options calculated and published by the chicago board options exchange cboe it is colloquially referred to as the fear index or the fear gauge the formulation of a volatility index and financial instruments based on such an index were developed by menachem brenner and dan galai in 1986 1 2 they stated the volatility index to be named sigma index would be updated frequently and used as the underlying asset for futures and options  a volatility index would play the same role as the market index play for options and futures on the index in 1986 brenner and galai proposed the creation of a series of volatility indices beginning with an index on stock market volatility and moving to interest rate and foreign exchange rate volatility to the american stock exchange in 1987 brenner and galai met with joseph levine and deborah clayworth at the cboe to propose various structures for a tradeable index on volatility those discussions continued until 1991 the current vix concept formulates a theoretical expectation of stock market volatility in the near future the current vix index value quotes the expected annualized change in the sp 500 index over the following 30 days as computed from optionsbased theory and current optionsmarket data 3the cboe retained consultant robert whaley in 1992 to develop a tradable volatility instrument based on index option prices 4 based on historical index option prices whaley computed a data series of retrospective daily vix levels from january 1986 onward

specifications  editthe index takes as inputs the market prices of the call and put options on the sp 500 for the front month that is the next monthly expiration date for the options and the second month expirations options are ignored where their strike prices are below the level where two consecutive bid prices are zero 5 the goal is to estimate the implied volatility of sp 500 index options at an average expiration of 30 days the vix is the volatility of a variance swap and not that of a volatility swap volatility being the square root of variance or standard deviation   citation needed a variance swap can be perfectly statically replicated through vanilla puts and calls whereas a volatility swap requires dynamic hedging the vix is the square root of the riskneutral expectation of the sp 500 variance over the next 30 calendar days and is quoted as an annualized standard deviation the vix is calculated and disseminated in realtime by the chicago board options exchange on march 26 2004 trading in futures on the vix began on cboe futures exchange cfe on february 24 2006 it became possible to trade options on the vix several exchangetraded funds seek to track its performance the vix replaced the older vxo as the preferred volatility index used by the media vxo was a measure of implied volatility calculated using 30day sp 100 index atthemoney options 6interpretation  editthe vix is quoted in percentage points and represents the expected range of movement in the sp 500 index over the next year at a 68 confidence level ie one standard deviation of the normal probability curve for example if the vix is 15 this represents an expected annualized change with a 68 probability of less than 15 up or down the expected volatility range for a single month can be calculated from this figure by dividing the vix figure of 15 not by 12 but by √ 12 which would imply a range of  387 over the next 30day period 7 similarly expected volatility for a week would be 15 divided by √ 52 or  208 the price of call and put options can be used to calculate implied volatility because volatility is one of the factors used to calculate the value of these options higher volatility of the underlying security makes an option more valuable because there is a greater probability that the option will expire in the money ie with a market value above zero thus a higher option price implies greater volatility other things being equal even though the vix is quoted as a percentage rather than a dollar amount multiple vixbased derivative instruments are in existence totaling roughly 4 billion in aum  8 including vix futures contracts which began trading in 2004exchangelisted vix options which began trading in february 2006 vix futures based exchangetraded notes

move and lbpx indices although the vix is often called the fear index a high vix is not necessarily bearish for stocks 9 instead the vix is a measure of market perceived volatility in either direction including to the upside in practical terms when investors anticipate large upside volatility they are unwilling to sell upside call stock options unless they receive a large premium option buyers are willing to pay such high premiums only if similarly anticipating a large upside move the resulting aggregate of increases in upside stock option call prices raises the vix just as the aggregate growth in downside stock put option premiums that occurs when option buyers and sellers anticipate a likely sharp move to the downside when the market is believed as likely to soar as to plummet writing any option that will cost the writer in the event of a sudden large move in either direction may look equally risky hence high vix readings mean investors see significant risk that the market will move sharply whether downward or upward the highest vix readings occur when investors anticipate that huge moves in either direction are likely only when investors perceive neither significant downside risk nor significant upside potential will the vix be low the black–scholes formula uses a model of stock price dynamics to estimate how an option’s value depends on the volatility of the underlying assets limitation and gvix  editvix downward bias left this figure plots the vix downward bias measured by daily vix − gvix from jan 2005  may 2014 corresponding to different levels of vix values it has been widely viewed that vix values greater than 30 are generally associated with a large amount of volatility as a result of investor fear while values below 20 generally correspond to less stressful times in the markets chow jiang and li 2014 demonstrated that without imposing any structure on the underlying forcing process the modelfree vix does not measure market expectation of volatility but that of a linear momentcombination 10 particularly vix undervalues overvalues volatility when market return is expected to be negatively positively skewed alternatively they develop a modelfree generalized volatility index gvix with no diffusion assumption gvix is formulated from the definition of logreturn variance making vix a special case of the gvix empirically vix generally understates the true volatility and the estimation errors considerably enlarge during volatile markets in addition the spread between gvix and vix gvspread follows a meanreverting process criticisms  editperformance of vix left compared to past volatility right as 30day volatility predictors for the period of jan 1990sep 2009 volatility is measured as the standard deviation of sp500 oneday returns over a months period the blue lines indicate linear regressions resulting in the correlation coefficients r shown note that vix has virtually the same predictive power as past volatility insofar as the shown correlation coefficients are nearly identical vix is sometimes criticized as a prediction of future volatility it instead is a measure of the current price of index options despite their sophisticated composition critics claim the predictive power of most volatility forecasting models is similar to that of plainvanilla measures such as simple past volatility 11 12 13 however other works have countered that these critiques failed to correctly implement the more complicated models 14some practitioners and portfolio managers seem to ignore or dismiss volatility forecasting models for example nassim taleb famously titled one of his journal of portfolio management papers we dont quite know what we are talking about when we talk about volatility 15in a similar vein emanuel derman expressed his disillusion with empirical models unsupported by theory 16 he argues that while theories are attempts to uncover the hidden principles underpinning the world around us as albert einstein did with his theory of relativity we should remember that models are metaphors  analogies that describe one thing relative to another michael harris argued that vix just tracks the inverse of price and has no predictive power 17 18vix should have predictive power as long as the prices computed by the blackscholes equation are valid assumptions about the volatility predicted for the future lead time the remaining time to maturity robert j shiller argued that it would be circular reasoning to consider vix to be proof of blackscholes because they both express the same implied volatility he also finds that calculating vix retrospectively in 1929 does not predict the highestever volatility of the great depression due to the anomalous conditions of the event vix cannot predict even weakly any future severe events 19on february 12 2018 a letter was sent to the commodity futures trading commission and securities and exchange commission by a law firm representing an anonymous whistleblower alleging manipulation of the vix 20history  edithere is a timeline of some key events in the history of the vix index1987  the sigma index was introduced in an academic paper by brenner
