in order of occurrence what is needed for thesesteps to continuously repeat answer difficulty medium learning objective 1 103 investigate the origination of muscle action potentials at theneuromuscular junction and the steps involved in the sliding filament mechanism of musclecontraction and apply these to the mechanisms of skeletal muscle fiber contraction andrelaxation learning objective 2 1031 outline the steps involved in the sliding filament mechanism ofmuscle contraction section reference 1 103 contraction and relaxation of skeletal muscle fibers solution atp hydrolysis attachment of myosin to actin forming crossbridges the power strokethen detachment of myosin from actin the cycle will continue as long as atp and calcium ionsare available71 how does a nerve impulse elicit a muscle action potential answer difficulty medium learning objective 1 103 investigate the origination of muscle action potentials at theneuromuscular junction and the steps involved in the sliding filament mechanism of musclecontraction and apply these to the mechanisms of skeletal muscle fiber contraction andrelaxation learning objective 2 1032 describe how muscle action potentials arise at the neuromuscularjunction section reference 1 103 contraction and relaxation of skeletal muscle fibers solution a nerve impulse reaches the synaptic end bulb and causes the release of acetylcholinewhich diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to and activates acetylcholine receptors on themotor end plate binding of acetylcholine opens an ion channel in the acetylcholine receptorsallowing na to flow into the cell which generates an action potential in the muscle cell72 what are the three ways that atp can be produced in muscle fibers answer difficulty easy learning objective 1 104 compare anaerobic and aerobic cellular respiration processes bywhich muscle fibers produce atp and the factors that contribute to muscle fatigue this preview has intentionally blurred
