sam hunt how a former college football star is making over country music from releasing a free mixtape to sampling rap in his shows the rbloving exquarterback is reshaping nashville in his own image sam hunts montevallo features a forwardthinking combination of country pop and rb chase lauer by nick murray february 26 2015for most of sam hunt s life the georgiaborn country singer was better known for his arm than his voice as a teenager in cedartown georgia – the home of an adulterous sharecroppers daughter in an early waylon jennings murder ballad – his quarterback skills earned him a high school heisman nomination and when he attended the university of alabama at birmingham he eventually won a starting job related sam hunt salutes mariah whitney reba on solo tourleave the night on singer spotlights breakdancers graffiti artists and divas before he left for college however hunt stumbled upon a new passion i never saw myself as a musician or having any musical talent he says between stops in his ongoing lipstick graffiti tour i was just killing time that summer and a buddy had recently bought a guitar i picked it up one day and on a whim thought you know i think i want to buy a guitar the next four years were devoted mostly to sports studies he began school as a philosophy major and the sort of extracurricular pursuits youd expect of a sixfootfour varsity athlete but any dormroom downtime was spent mastering his new instrument this set him apart from the rest of the team it was definitely different because i didnt know anybody else who i played ball with who also played music he says it took me a while to get over that eventually though he shared a few songs with his roommates and they encouraged him to book shows at bars around town less than a decade later hunt has become one of country musics most exciting new artists his charttopping debut album montevallo owes as much to drake and adam levine as waylon and willie combining earnest storytelling with drum machinedriven pop production and rbinfluenced vocals his touring band look like theyre playing warped tour and his shows include snippets of hits by r kelly and kanye west at one point he sings over the triggaman loop that rolls through much of new orleans bounce country music has always evolved hunt explains ive just stepped into that evolution – the 2015 version ive seen it change since i moved to town hunt entered nashville shortly after graduating from birmingham once again he stood out his late start left him exceptionally inexperienced and his sound baffled many listeners people would say thats not really country or that doesnt really sound like whats happening on the radio now he remembers this began to change when he met shane mc anally and josh osborne two of the citys most progressive and successful songwriters they really embraced and encouraged what i wanted to do i felt like finally maybe i do have something to offer here maybe i do have something unique sam as quarterback for the uab blazers in 2006 streeter leckagetty hunt signed a publishing a deal but he soon became frustrated by the industrys slow process for breaking new acts rather than wait for label support he and a likeminded producer – local hiphop refugee zach crowell – worked together to release a free mixtape frank oceanstyle the money factor had been kind of my excuse as to why i hadnt put out any music hunt says so i just found the cheapest way to make music and get it to people and that was via the internet a lot of artists from other genres were doing that at the time its just that country hadnt tapped into it yet for crowell it was an obvious solution coming from the hiphop world where mixtapes are a common thing i was just like hey lets do this noting countrys gradual embrace of laptop production the nashville native – who has worked with artists like christianrap sensation lecrae and jelly roll a 450pound local favorite – doesnt see anything unusual about his virtually unprecedented career path people are creating demos in their house and that creates a demand for beats and tracks he says so it was only natural for a guy like me whos efficient with that kind of thing to become relevant in songwriting rooms on october 3rd 2013 hunt posted the finished tape between the pines to his facebook page it received only 79 likes but the next month billy currington released his take on one of its standout tracks the freedom and fireflies heartland fantasy we are tonight and eventually made it the most played song on country radio by the time it reached number one the exquarterback behind it had finished montevallo the recording sessions for the album lasted longer than most partly because when hunt is working on new music he tries to experiment as much as possible i like to come up with lots of different sounds he says so the final version of a song might have been 10 completely different songs before we finally got it right crowell is more blunt hes superduper slow says the producer who also sat behind the boards for the lp most people try to write a song in a day but he doesnt think that way and when i get around him i dont think that way either the pair – joined by mc anally – worked most diligently on break up in a small town a detailed account of worldbuckling anxiety thats part pixies part tim mc graw and part i knew you were trouble crowell calls this by far the hardest song ive ever been a part of it took probably 15 days to write that song over the course of six months he says theres an infinite amount of ways to describe that so he was constantly changing lines and moving stuff around hunt was building a sound that would expand the boundaries of country music but he was also studying the rise of the sonically traditional kacey musgraves shane mc anally played me her original demos and i was like wow this is really awesome he says it was cool to watch her come up while i was planning to release a record of my own – to see that unfold was inspiring the way crowell sees it hunts ability to draw upon so many sources goes back to his days on the field he said the other day that he loves to have a team of people around him and that if you put talented people in their place theyll do well says crowell i dont know if hes trying to run this thing like a sports team but it makes perfect sense hes one of the people that makes you feel like a little more talented than you are which gives you a little more confidence to write better songs and bring better ideas even hunt when discussing his goals and approach cant help but pull from his past life you want to stand out and be unique and do something different he says i always try to zig when they zag – i guess its a football term but it applies to a lot of different
