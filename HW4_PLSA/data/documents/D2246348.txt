farai chideya host anatole broyard was one of the most respected literary critics the late editor and columnist for the new york times book review provided a lavish life for his family in new england but he carried a secret so deep that he couldnt tell his own children now his daughter bliss broyard has written the memoir one drop about his life and her search for her family bliss welcome to the show ms bliss broyard daughter of anatole broyard author one drop thanks farai for having me chideya so when your father was dying you find out the big family secret that your father is partblack your brother says thats all what was your reaction ms broyard pretty much along the same lines the afternoon that we found out we had just witnessed my father suffering terrible pain he was in the last stages of prostate cancer so my mom took it upon herself to tell us because it seemed clear that my father wasnt going to live very much longer so it seems frankly like not a big deal and we had known about a secret for a couple of months and i imagined that it was you know my dad had witnessed some horrible crime or incest or something so the fact that it was just that he was partblack and we didnt even realize or understand exactly why had it been a secret at all chideya now how did you feel about meeting these aunts of yours who had been living as black did you feel cheated in any way that they had not been a part of your life and how do you think they felt about you ms broyard absolutely i felt cheated i mean it started to dawn on me when i met them at the memorial service i had met one of my aunts once when i was 7 and she like my father looks you know typically black she could also she passed when she was younger for work in the 1930s but i did feel incredibly cheated and as much as weve you know tried to have a relationship now you just cant its hard to start when youre 24 years old were never going to have the kind of relationship that wed had if wed all grown up together and i think from you know theyve been warm  one of my fathers sisters unfortunately passed away shortly after he did but the rest of the family has been quite warm but theres a legacy of pain and rejection there thats really difficult to get over chideya in your journey after your fathers death you went to louisiana you did an extensive amount of research tracing your family among other things you found that some of your black relatives actually own slaves how did that strike you what did that make you think about all of the different things that had happened in and to your family ms broyard well it really threw me for a loop i mean the woman that youre talking about was my fathers grandmother and i had become convinced in doing my genealogical research that she actually was the daughter of an emancipated slave and finding a slave connection was important to me because i associated slavery with africanamerican identity so strongly and i came to find out one afternoon that no she wasnt the daughter of an emancipated slave she actually was the daughter of a black slaveowning family now the creoles of new orleans you know have a quite a different story than the africanamerican history that i was familiar with they were historically descended from free people they had strong ties to their french and spanish colonial  the colonists settled in louisiana and so they kind of followed sort of white social mores and then when they were prosperous enough they also owned slaves but it really challenged my notion of what kind of you know africanamerican identity i had chideya now you point out that your grandfather joined the carpenters union in new york by passing as white now that hints at passing as a form of economic survival but what about your father why did he pass if you consider it passing ms broyard yeah well i think you know the passing is such a complicated term i mean it suggests that theres these you know a very specific line between the categories of black and white and if you you know just look through the legal history of the south youll see that the color line has changed you know many times and from statetostate so  i  but i think in my fathers case he  i mean like it or not there its a legal and social custom and when he was growing up in louisiana and in new york was that if you had even a small fraction of black ancestry you were considered black and that certainly is the way that both of his sisters lived and many people his childhood friends i think for him he  it was very confusing in growing up because his parents both passed for work he certainly learned the lesson that it was easier to be white there was a lot more opportunity and so when he got to college he went to brooklyn college which was predominantly jewish in the 1930s he found a kind of affinity among the other students there and just sort of blended in with them and stopped you know if he ever had been announcing his racial identity no longer did that chideya now during this book you talk somewhat about your own feelings and you dont always paint yourself in a flattering light you say  and this is about you as you were younger  id never had a conversation about race in the world i was raised  and it was considered an impolite subject  the people i knew lower their voices when referring to a black person now youre a mother when you talk about race to your daughter as she grows what tone of voice will you use and what will you tell her ms broyard well i think ill use a proud tone of voice to tell her about our africanamerican history her familys africanamerican history i mean i grew up in a world that was quite sheltered and you know i really wanted to paint in one drop my evolution from being a sheltered privileged white girl to you know someone i hope of a more sophisticated understanding about the role that racists played in our country so ask mayweather ph if she likes it or not  thats my 15monthold daughter shell know all aspects of her history and also the reason why the question what are you has mattered chideya what about your family your brother your mother your other white relatives how have they reacted to the memoir ms broyard theyve been really supportive and positive i think they recognized that its a you know theres a legacy that my father left behind that was difficult and confusing and i think theyre glad that ive taken it upon myself to tell the complete story in which its a story of the history of racial categories in our country and also the story of fathers personal choice and how he dealt with that and i think from my africanamerican relatives i hope that there is you know some kind of healing that ive chosen to embrace this chideya well bliss
