usain bolt of jamaica wins the men’s 100meter final on day 9 of the 2016 olympic games at the olympic stadium on sunday in rio de janeiro shaun botterillgetty images o n sunday night in rio de janeiro usain bolt won the 100meter dash at the olympics for the third time chasing down justin gatlin to become the first man in history to win three gold medals in track’s showcase event he was already the best ever going into the rio games now he needs a trophy case for his trophy cases the 29yearold jamaican has seven olympic gold medals and 11 more at the track and field world championships six of those golds are in the 4by100meter relay he has the three fastest times ever in the 100 —a 958 a 963 and a 969 tied with tyson gay and yohan blake—and four of the six best in the 200 meters including the world record of 1919 seconds bolt’s winning time on sunday 981 seconds was not anywhere close to his best—he’s run faster 13 times in his career “i expect better” he told nbc’s lewis johnson after the race given that bolt’s only real competition is himself how does his 100 meters in rio compare with his other famous races since 2008 he’s appeared in 13 olympic and world championship finals in the 100 and 200 meters here’s how they rank13 2011 world championships daegu south korea 100 meters disqualified get slatein your inbox sign up id like to receive slate special offers  termsthe counterintuitive take here would be that bolt’s disqualification by false start was more compelling in its way than some of his lesser world championship victories that would be a bad take the one thing all of the world’s greatest athletes have in common is that they do athletic stuff—run and jump and throw after setting two absurd world records at the 2009 world championships bolt had not stepped on the world’s biggest stage for several years when he finally got on the track he falsestarted and got dq’ed the dude was milliseconds away from running the 95second 100 that we’d waited two years to watch and then he didn’t even get to run this was bad12 2013 world championships moscow 200 meters 1966 seconds every race from here on is a usain bolt victory which is crazy and hilarious and means we’re now left to decide which of his greatest triumphs was the least great this was bolt’s slowestever 200meter victory in the world championships or olympics but watching usain bolt run the turn on the 200 meters is one of the great pleasures of this or any lifetime the problem with this race is that bolt gets so far ahead that he stops trying but he doesn’t stop trying in a particularly entertaining way and doesn’t run a superimpressive time by his standards this is tied for the 21 st fastest 200meter dash ever this is a great race it’s bolt’s leastthrilling major victory11 2013 world championships moscow 100 meters 977 seconds this was the jamaican’s first big 100meter win since 2009 on account of the previously discussed falsestart business not a boltian time and a totally expected result—his american “rival” gatlin gets off to a fast start bolt chases him down little yawny10 2015 world championships beijing 100 meters 979 seconds bolt had been a bit off in 2015 after returning from injury so this was the great sprinter’s chance to prove he was still a great sprinter he proved it—sort of gatlin actually would’ve won if he didn’t start flailing his arms wildly with a few meters to go that loss of form was enough for bolt to nip gatlin at the end 979 seconds to 980 this is the narrowest of bolt’s victories and he called it his hardest race a suspenseful 100 meters certainly but neither man ran as fast as he was capable of running and the outcome didn’t change history or alter our perception of either guy the 2015 world championships proved that a diminished usain bolt was still better than everybody else but a diminished usain bolt is not nearly as fun as a nondiminished usain bolt9 2015 world championships beijing 200 meters 1955 seconds watching bolt run the 200 meters is better than watching bolt run the 100 meters because when bolt runs the 200 meters he runs 100 more meters than when he runs the 100 meters this one wasn’t over when bolt came out of the turn gatlin was there challenging for the lead ready to get dusted and he got really really dusted bolt zooms ahead so quickly that he has time to slow down and pound his chest before he crosses the finish line great great race also bonus points because bolt got taken down while celebrating when a photographer lost control of his segway8 2011 world championships daegu south korea 200 meters 1940finally after two years plus one false start bolt got to run the outcome was never in doubt i mean the outcome is never in doubt any time bolt races but this time it was really truly never in doubt bolt makes up the stagger on eventual secondplace finisher walter dix right away and could’ve done the backstroke down the backstretch if he wanted instead he runs fairly hard smokes the field by threetenths of a second and finishes with the sixthbest 200meter time ever pretty pretty good7 2016 olympics rio 100 meters 981 seconds instagram this photo or video has been removed from instagram his slowest 100 meters in a major final tied for his 14 th best time ever bolt said after the race that he expected better all of us did—how could we not given that he clowned his way to an easy 986 finish in the semifinals for a second—ok literally it was closer to about six seconds—it looked as if bolt might not find his topend speed he needed to bust it in the last 50 meters to chase down gatlin who finished in 989 seconds again the 34yearold american—who in 2004 won gold in the last prebolt olympic 100meter final —didn’t perform his best when a great performance could’ve vanquished bolt gatlin has run faster 21 different times this ranks below every other olympic victory in bolt’s career and above every world championship race but two given the everesthigh bar he’s set for himself since the 2008 olympics that feels about right6 2012 olympics london 200 meters 1932 seconds the race that confirmed bolt was the greatest ever at least for anyone who wasn’t already certain of it this win the second of his two in london gave the then25yearold the firstever olympic “double double”—backtoback victories in the 100 and 200 bolt’s countryman yohan blake nicknamed “the beast” was in top form he ran this 200 meters in 1944 seconds the fastest losing time in history it took bolt most of the backstretch to pull away when he finally did he looked to his left and raised a finger to his lips as he crossed the finish line his time 1932 seconds tied michael johnson’s famous mark—one bolt had pushed himself to surpass four years earlier in beijing when the race was over he grabbed a photographer’s camera and started snapping photos they weren’t bad5 2012 olympics london 100 meters 963 seconds the aforementioned blake beat bolt twice at the 2012 jamaican olympic trials running a 975 in the 100 meters to knock off the defending olympic champion bolt looked quite bad at the jamaican trials— he had to crank in the last 20 meters to sneak past asafa powell and into second place there were doubts then that bolt was still the man he’d been in beijing in 2008 or in berlin in 2009  he erased those doubts right out of the blocks getting off to a much stronger start than usual and charging past blake and gatlin in the last half of the race in the clear by a couple of meters bolt dipped his chest at the finish line aiming for a historic time he got it bolt ran these 100 meters in 963 seconds—the secondfastest sprint ever bested only by himself4 2009 world championships berlin 200 meters 1919 seconds four days earlier bolt had smashed his own 100meter record by 011 seconds on sept 3 2009 he smashed his own 200meter record by … 011 seconds nobody pushed bolt to this world record—secondplace alonso edward of panama finished 062 seconds behind somewhere off the screen with whomever katie ledecky just beat in the 800meter freestyle bolt was racing against the clock and against himself and he won when the trackside scoreboard flashed 1920 seconds revised down moments later to 1919 it felt as if evolution had sped up this would be bolt’s last world record in the 100 or 200 but in that instant anything seemed possible if he’d gotten back in the starting blocks and started sprinting again i bet he would’ve covered 200 meters in 19 seconds flat no athlete has ever had a better week than usain bolt had in berlin in 20093 2009 world championships berlin 100 meters 958 seconds the perfect race run by the perfect sprinter2 2008 olympics beijing 200 meters 1930 seconds the tell is the lean at the tape bolt had this one salted away after the turn at which point they could’ve given golf carts to everyone else and it wouldn’t have mattered but there was no mugging for the cameras this time and at the finish line bolt with no other runner in sight folded himself up and lunged he wanted michael johnson’s world record of 1932— recorded at the atlanta games in 1996 in what remains the damnedest thing one of your authors has ever watched—and when bolt saw he’d gotten it he roared and fell to the ground overwhelmed for maybe the only time in his career watch johnson’s 200 and then watch bolt’s johnson compared himself to a gokart speeding downhill which nicely evokes his lowslung stiffbacked gait bolt doesn’t scamper so much as churn he is a runaway cementmixer1 2008 olympics beijing 100 meters 969 seconds months later a group of norwegian physicists tried to determine just how fast bolt would’ve run if he hadn’t spent the last 15 or so meters of the race vamping and pounding his chest and generally doing everything short of the electric slide working off three video feeds the norwegians came up with two estimates the conservative one assumed bolt would’ve matched the acceleration of runnerup richard thompson during the end of the race in that scenario bolt would’ve run 961 give or take 004 seconds the other estimate was premised on the assumption that bolt would’ve maintained an acceleration faster than thompson’s under these conditions he would’ve put up a 955 give or take the study’s lead author cautioned against anyone taking these estimates too seriously but that’s precisely what makes this bolt’s greatest race he gave us everything we could’ve wanted—he won handily and exuberantly and obliterated his own world record on the sport’s biggest stage—and he still left us trackheads and eggheads alike wondering what might’ve been it was a race to savor in the subjunctive too correction aug 15 2016 this post originally misidentified the location of bolt’s 2008 race that laid expectations for the 2012 olympics it was in beijing not london  return see more of slate’s olympics coverage tommy craggs is the former politics editor of slate
