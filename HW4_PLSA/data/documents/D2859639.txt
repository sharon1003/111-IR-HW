makes fc shingle siding as 4 width panels and also as individual shingles the panels are 16 high and exposure is 7 that 16to7 factor means you buy 228 actual sf of product to cover one finished sf of wall contrast that with their clap siding product for 6 exposure with its 714 height the factor being only 121 on top of the factor thing the pricing of the shingle product is astronomical as compared to the clap what is going on here the manufacturing process with parts pressed in a textured mold has got to be similar if not almost identical thickness is about the same so you would think that the cost factor per net finished sf should be around 228121 or 188 its a whole lot more why who can afford it tags nonedavenorthup veteran contributor join date jan 2005location posts 10055205062009 1003

moines iowa posts 4124905092009 1123 pmre hardie shingle siding cost why so high originally posted by no faux zone view post personally im losing interest in concrete siding and going back to wood people who want concrete siding seem to think they dont have to take care of it after install the fact is nothing is maintenance free wood concrete and even vinyl ive seen a lot of 100 year old wood still hanging but not the rest jason the product is not concrete but rather fiber cement i often hear it referred to as concrete siding and i correct this when it comes up the manufacturer probably loves this because it really makes the material seem tough when in reality it is a product that requires attention be paid to the details in which it is applied otherwise it will never make its fifty years as the warranty implies this product enjoys very powerful marketing and has taken on a life of its own as architects and designers blindly specify its use for all sorts of projects i believe as time goes on the love affair with this product will see an end and the reality of its frailness will start to come to light i am seeing more and more problems albeit installation details but problems nonetheless i am sure we will discuss further there are other products that are starting to show that seem a little more friendly bbjhhss  mark parlee besi building envelope science institute envelope

so high fwiw i priced some vinyl shake siding and it was about 3x the cost of regular vinyl maybe they charge more because they think they can i spoke with a hardi rep at a builders show the other day and he said that they have recently changed their formulation this product looks like it might be a good alternative more  though httpwwwmicropositecomindexhtml  rich mark parlee veteran contributor
