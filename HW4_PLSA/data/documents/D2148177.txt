overnights february 5 2015 844 am empire recap my girl got a girlfriend by craig d lindsey share tweet share email hakeem lyon bryshere gray photo foxempire dangerous bonds season 1episode 5editor’s rating prev next complete series coverage let me clarify i do like empire recapping a show like this is a blast it’s a black show about black music starring black people and as a black man in case that hasnt been made apparent yet i enjoy writing about it — even in the wake of a bad episode — mainly because you rarely ever see a drama like this on television  it has happened once  but the show vanished as quickly as it appeared one thing i’m finding fascinating is how strongly fans of the show feel whenever i make the slightest critical comment about any aspect of the show see comments on any one of these recaps  it’s only been on the air for a few weeks but folks are already defending it as untouchable gospel to the point where any recapper disagreement evokes some extreme reactions in just four weeks ive been called humorless racist misanthropic sexist and homophobic empire is certainly not a perfect show no tv show is although this one came pretty damn close each one faces a few hiccups and missteps on its journey toward finding its definitive tone and style and these past few weeks have shown that empire is still trying to find that groove which has churned out some clunkier episodes here and there still it’s a hit drama with a predominantly black cast — practically an oddity in the annals of television history since it seems that the whole world is watching now i want this show to be and do better all the more it appears a lot of you fans and readers want to see it succeed as well hopefully for the same reasons i have or else you wouldn’t be demanding my dismissal every time i neg it however if empire really wants to be a major force in this golden age of ambitious asskicking 21stcentury tv dramas it needs to step up its game no question“dangerous bonds” points the show in the right direction a strong followup to last week’s also surprisingly good episode “bonds” written by malcolm spellman and directed by blackcinema vet john singleton  boyz n the hood  shows each member of the lyon family following separate paths while they all feel theirs will lead to success all of those paths ultimately might lead to selfdestruction let’s start as always with lucious he proposes to anika at his home with anthony hamilton on the piano singing “the point of it all” no less i guess after confiding in anika about having als last week he might as well put a ring on it however as the episode progresses we find out that the alwaysscheming lucious has an ulterior motive in order for his company to go public he needs a clean bill of health from a doctor and you know who has a doctor for a dad why it’s anika lucious makes the old man his second proposal of the evening when he and anika appear at their parents’ house to announce their engagement at first anika’s father declines saying that he could lose his license for committing such a fraud but he inevitably comes around when lucious always laying that sweettalk on thick informs him that with his help his daughter will be a billionaire when he dies lucious’s pimpishness once again saves the day on the video shoot for hakeem’s new single “drip drop” at first hakeem is psyched as hell to shoot the video ready to show the world he’s more than just lucious lyon’s kid unfortunately then he learns that tiana whos also in the video and whom he’s starting to get sweet on has been creeping around on him — with another woman even though hakeem has a middleage sidechick of his own he refuses to work with tiana and shuts down the shoot you’d think with this guys wildandloose ass hakeem would love the fact that his girl goes both ways of course it’s his dad who reminds him hey stupid your girl got a girlfriend using some smooth mathematical mumbojumbo lucious tells hakeem to finish the video so he can start on those two lucious also calls tiana a “ thot ” which made me laugh out loud you can thank andre and rhonda who caught tiana and her girl canoodling at a photo shoot for leaking the incriminating evidence to perez hilton really she didn’t have tmz’s contact info and almost derailing the video andre still kind of bitter after his dad coldly tells him he’s useless if he doesn’t come up with the money for hakeem’s overbudget video also goes to work trying to sabotage jamal’s production which hes conducting in a bulletridden studio somewhere andre makes sure some suspicious goons hanging around hakeem’s shoot overhear him talking on his phone about jamal and his expensive jewelry making certain theyll head over there and stop jamal’s session by jacking his stuff fortunately a defiant jamal along with a shotgunwielding studio engineer promptly runs these idiots out of the building but not before shooting one of them first this temporarily pauses jamals progress on that money song he was working on last week running off various musicians that were around for his one day of recording however jamal finally scrounges up some young cats with instruments to finish the song while andre’s shadiness doesn’t disrupt his little bros projects much its created some tension between the two jamal who thinks hakeem set up the robbery shows up at hakeem’s place to punch him in the stomach and tell him not to underestimate him instead of trying to convince jamal he didn’t have anything to do with the robbery hakeem plays it smart he calls up andre afterwards and demands more money so he can launch this song right — and crush jamal in the process which leads us to cookie who enjoys the most drama of any lyon family member this week while she wants to be there for jamal she also has to testify in front of a grand jury that she saw frank gathers gun down a drug dealer who turned out to be an undercover fed this bit of news comes as a surprise to cookie who is scared gathers’s crew may come after her now that shes snitched on him her suspicions seem to be confirmed when she finds a rose outside her apartment roses which are gatherss trademark are stamped on his crews cocaine bags that’s when cookie becomes a pistolpacking mama and heads to philly to confer with her sister cookie hires a cousin played by comedian de ray davis to “take care” of the gathers henchman who’s possibly behind the rose dropoff in the episode’s closing minutes cookie finds out that lucious left the rose a callback to their first anniversary which shes been a bit too occupied to celebrate this immediately sends cookie to the phone to tell her sister to call the whole thing off — but its too late judging by the stunned frightened look on cookie’s face at the end of the episode we can only assume things are going to get more complicated and intense for the lyons in upcoming episodes and that’s a good thing since it will also make these showrunners work to make empire the outstanding show its fans already believe it is it’s not there yet but it can be some stray thoughts even though cookie had a lot of things to deal with in this episode shes proving herself a master multitasker the scene in the cab where she’s handling both jamal and tiana “i don’t judge but you a freak” on the phone once again shows how immensely compelling a character cookie is also the cookie line of the night “what you mean ‘you people’ you black like me” she says to that bigoted cab driver i personally loved how this episode goes back and forth in showing the resources hakeem and jamal have at their disposal for their projects while hakeem’s video shoot was basically a money pit jamal’s recording is ghetto d i y it kind of reminded me of the end of that rhymefestkanye video for brand new why is there a basketball hoop in the empire entertainment conference room my hatred for anika is once again dissipating slowly especially now that we’ve been introduced to her disapproving judgmental mom i guess if you had her for a mom you’d grow up smug thirsty and desperate for attention too no becky this week — i guess the titanshadowing has begun we did get a lot of porsha who keeps tabs on both tiana and jamal while snacking on craft services while porsha and ta rhonda jones who plays her is beginning to grow on me i cant help thinking it’s too bad leslie jones is too busy killing it on saturday night live — she would’ve slayed in this role is it just me or does andre’s strategy for destroying his brothers seem halfassed as machiavellian as he tries to be his attacks appear not only to be poorly executed but also poorly thoughtout jamal could’ve been shot during that robbery asshole by the way i know you all hate that i constantly bring this up but andre’s bipolar disorder briefly but finally gets a mention this week when we see him holding a prescription bottle while on the phone with his wife hakeem posts a video missive in which he brags that his music is going to have drake j cole and kendrick lamar ducking and running for cover first off i don’t think “drip drop” — which at best is some catchy poprap — is going to have these brothas shaking in their js second it’s nice for the show to finally admit the existence of irl young rappers i was beginning to think the show lived in its own parallel universe also i finally realized who hakeem looks like when he puts on those sunglasses
