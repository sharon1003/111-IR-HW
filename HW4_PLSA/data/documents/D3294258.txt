thanks for the response i wasnt expecting to get a response directly from the team developing the app so kudos to you guys  great job my concern is that while vpn might solve everyones problem with a single solution my already bad battery life will decrease since vpn is being usedshare reply dec 10 2012k2jmacrumors newbie dec 10 20124your concerns are valid since the switch to vpn the battery life on my i phone 5 has become horrible a full charge used to last at least a day now its half of that also ive noticed that my phone has a hard time connecting to the internet via the vpn and why is the vpn still on while im using wifi any suggestions on how to remedy the internet connectivity up until now onavo has been great  i love the service they provide these issues are starting to make me

6502a nov 20 20097anyone try the latest update its supposed to address these issues now i stopped using it before partly because the vpn icon is just annoying to look at and partly because data speeds were horrendous im used to lte speeds that vary from 10 to 30mb but on onavo it barely scratched 2mb if i was lucky totally unacceptable if its gotten better i might use it again but probably only when im traveling internationallyshare reply dec 13 2012dr8ct0pu8macrumors newbie dec 13 20128ive noticed that with onavos vpn some of my apps no longer work properly like the letterpress game or my roku remote app trying to turn the vpn off in the settings is no use as it immediately reconnects ill most likely be uninstallingshare reply dec 15 2012kd7irmmacrumors newbie oct 14 20129i uninstalled as well long delay to context to data and battery drain was unrealshare reply dec 21 2012richard lmacrumors newbie jul 17 2010durham uk10onavo  vpn it is only this morning that i worked out onavo was the cause of my problems i have a wireless system in my home that means i can control electrical devices from my i phone or i pad my i phone with onavo running worked fine but my i pad with onavo running would not connect to the wireless network for the electric devices looking at settings on my i pad i noticed as another member has that if you switched off vpn onavo switched it back on again removing onavo and i have no problems it will have to stay off now until they fix it but strange that it does not happen with my i phone 5share reply dec 31 2012lunarstonemacrumors newbie may 12

auto connect is a fix but then you must remember to turn it back on when you switch away from wifi too much of a hassle for negligible savingsshare reply jan 28 2013cloudgazermacrumors 6502apr 22 2005rsa13tried using onavo really keen to see what it could do however since it created the vpn my connection appeared my slower i tried turning off the vpn to test my theory but it kept turning itself back on irritated i deleted the app and still the vpn connection persisted tried turning it off in settings but it kept turning itself back on to turn it off i resorted to a google search and found this thread thanks but bad form on onavos part what a mission to turn off vpn settingsgeneralvpnonavoconnect on demand ff what a mission wont be using this app againshare reply jan 28 2013lincolnsi podmacrumors 6502a nov 20 200914to be fair i think the vpn approach is required in order for their service to work on cdma because data is also being processed through their servers theres just no way that it can match the speed of lte 3g speeds though shouldnt be a problem but faster than that and you deal with the tradeoff of bandwidth compression for speed in the end i found that it can have erratic results on the performance of the apps that rely on connections where if something goes wrong or an app has severe issues connecting it may not occur to the user right away that onavo might be the culprit which is part of the reason why i opted not to use itshare reply jan 28 2013 last edited jan 28 2013lix4macrumors newbie jan 28 201315cant connect to internet after installing onavo yup i couldnt even connect to safari and cant download any pics from whatsapp after i installed onavo love the idea of onavo but the tradeoff is just too huge at this point update i just realized i had those problems at home when i was connected to wifi now that im outside internet connection seems better but yes i has to turn on the vpn connection againshare reply jun 24 2013grayburnmacrumors 68000jul 12 2010london england16just started to use this again after not needing it as i was on a unlimited data contract now im not on that contract i thought id install this

its as shame you cant sync it with your plan dates being on wifi did not notice any ridiculous battery drain but im starting my work day at work with no wifi today and we will see if i have a battery
