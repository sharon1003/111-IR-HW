collection calls are filling up the landlines once again i’ve heard from readers in detroit florida texas and elsewhere who told me that they started getting these calls again in july and there’s a new twist the con artists aren’t just dialing for dollars the crooks now could be mailing or faxing falsified forms too according to the internal revenue service once again irs impostors are dialing for dollars“taxpayers need to know that scammers have started sending fake documents to trick people into sending money or ‘verifying’ their personal information” said luis d garcia an irs spokesman in detroit if you verify information that data can then be used to commit tax refund fraud and file a fake tax return using your name and id the federal trade commission put out a consumer notice in

calling to help you recover money lost to a scammer how nice they want to help scammers get clever with irs get transcript accounts to learn more about your finances in oakland county the local police in beverly hills said numerous residents had received phone calls this summer from a recording stating that they will be called before a magistrate for money owed for federal income taxes“the recorded voice has an ethnic accent do not reply or return any messages that have been left of this nature” the police told residents in an alert for many of us all those crazy calls are annoying but we’re not loading up cash on a prepaid money card or wiring money via western union we get it we’re working and hauling kids to swim meets we’re not dealing with oddball callers or falling for this irs scam the problem though is some people do get caught and that’s why the scammers keep calling“we have residents send money probably six to eight times a year” said public safety lt michael vargas in beverly hills “the last case was around 6000”eastpointe police said one elderly resident who was scammed out of more than 8000 in july deputy chief eric keiser in the eastpointe police department said the caller claimed that back taxes were owed to the u s treasury and threatened that the person would be taken to jail if payment wasn’t immediately received the resident was first to mail prepaid gift cards to a treasury address in washington d c but then the callers had the resident send a money gram to a walmart in florida“the treasury will not send people out to arrest you for not paying your taxes” keiser said “you don’t get calls out of nowhere from the treasury”keiser said people should call their local police if they believe they’re dealing with a suspicious call first before sending money again the treasury isn’t going to ask anyone to wire money to a walmart or send prepaid cards to washington d c nationwide about 3052 individuals fell for this scam and ended up paying 155 million according to the treasury inspector general for tax administration’s report to congress that data is from oct 1 2013 through march 9 2015 so scammers could have picked up more than 5000 per victim on average but the highest loss reported by one person was 500000 reports of the phone impersonation scam began in august 2013 but the scam has grown into the “largest most pervasive impersonation scam in the history” of the treasury inspector general’s office the agency noted that as of feb 28 the top five states by dollars lost by victims were california 384 million new york 135 million texas 795884 florida 760000 and virginia 648363 it’s not just the irs scam of course where the phone or computer can lead to trouble i spoke with a reader last week who told me he’s spent up to 3000 so far sending money not to the irs scammers but to others pretending to be experts or officials from a computer company he knows he’s being ripped off he said but he’s afraid of what could happen if he does not pay up the most recent caller demanded 199 to unlock his computer that appears to have been hit by ransomware experts advised him that he’s likely better off not paying it and getting a new computer with good security software and stick to safe internet usage what many of these scammers do of course is try to speak with authority they can even have some information on you that makes them sound more legitimate maybe the last four digits of your social security number and they often have caller id set up to make it appear that it’s a legitimate irs phone number when it is not a sure sign of fraud though is if the caller starts making aggressive threats and demands that you pay up immediately another sign of a scam someone asks for credit card or debit card numbers over the phone or threatens to have the local police or other law enforcement groups have you arrested for not paying up sometimes people fear that if they don’t pay up they’ll owe even more money somehow or the elderly could fear losing their independence if they somehow end up in trouble with the irs nancy willaford who lives in san antonio told me that she received a scam call last spring in which the caller said she owed 3598 in taxes for audited years from 2008 through 2013 if she didn’t pay the caller threatened her with a lawsuit and a fine of 30000 plus five years in jail willaford didn’t pay because she knew it was a scam“my heart goes out to all the families who may fall for this scam” willaford said “i can see where your mother or mine will fall into their hands out of fear of their well being”willaford noted that the callers can be particularly abusive“these guys are brutal ultimately threatening rude and foulmouthed” she said once again it’s important to recognize that the irs will not call you to demand immediate payment or tell you to put money on a prepaid debit card the irs will mail you a bill first if tax money is owed but again make sure to call the irs before you pay anything if you think you might owe taxes call your tax preparer and the irs at 8008291040 or read more on the alerts at wwwirsgov if you do not believe you owe any taxes and think
