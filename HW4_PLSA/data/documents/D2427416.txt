pause volume muted i error 4 media source is incompatible with player or browser retrying next movie review 5 feb 2018the cloverfield paradox review share a surprising release delivers an unsurprising narrative by jonathon dornbush the cloverfield franchise since the original film’s announcement trailer has been built on mystery the first film and as producer j j abrams called it its “bloodrelative” sequel 10 cloverfield lane covered distinctly different genre territory while touching on similar themes of survival and the relationships that bind us the cloverfield paradox surprisingly dropped on netflix months ahead of its originally anticipated theatrical release aims to jump into yet another new genre — spaceset scifi with a dash of horror — but never quite reaches the highs of its predecessors in an effort to provide some insight into the blood tying these films together the film paradoxically both stumbles in offering clear answers or thrill as a standalone feature the world is in need of energy badly and a group of international scientists are sent into space aboard the cloverfield station to harness the shepard particle accelerator and provide unlimited energy to earth for close to 700 days the crew fails miserably on one fateful day however they perfect the accelerator but an overload sends the space station…somewhere and wherever they are the earth has disappeared the crew endeavors to return home but misfortune follows them in final destinationstyle horror as multiple universes seemingly collide unfortunately there’s little surprising about what transpires aboard the ship or how the assembled crew acts in the face of imminent doom the cloverfield paradox trailer super bowl spot sharei error 4 media source is incompatible with player or browser retrying030much of the lack of surprise is due to paradox’s story which feels culled together from every space setscifi film since alien and the thing paradox never creatively twists or rises above its inspirations though so predictable beats are easy to guess for anyone familiar with the genre paradox executes some of its inspiration well at the very least with the elements of body horror particularly work well in the context of paradox’s central problem the space station has caused a rift in space forcing similar parts of different dimensions to occupy the same space that idea is a fascinating setup specifically for how it affects volkov aksel hennie and for how it plays into the unexpected appearance of a new crew member midway through the film director julius onah captures some of the body horror related to this idea a gnarly pain in a character’s eye or the materialization of a person inside the machinery of the station are nasty and effective side effects of this dimension smashing but it disperses with these fascinating elements in favor of runofthemill plot beats and character choices often shot as dutch angles of characters running down the same couple of hallways every time cloverfield 4 is already done filming sharei error 4 media source is incompatible with player or browser retrying034some of the more absurd moments would play better if the film never left paradox’s space station 10 cloverfield lane maintained tension by not leaving its core setting but paradox occasionally heads back to earth there the world is under siege by something that will look quite familiar to cloverfield fans these scenes told from the point of view of one of the space station member’s significant others distract more than add to the story they feel included to offer winks and nods to cloverfield fans but not to tell a compelling concurrent story and speaking of the mythology i’ve long been a fan of the offscreen world building done in each cloverfield’s alternate reality game it helps to make these “blood relatives” seem part of an intentioned grand plan even if each subsequent film has been a standalone movie transformed into a cloverfield entry oddly enough a scene early in the film featuring an author who appeared in the paradox arg claims what the space station is doing may open rifts in time and space unleashing monsters it’s such pandering fan service though still a fun cameo from donal logue that i almost felt let down that my theories and ideas would be addressed so blatantly there are moments of that fan service ill happily admit to enjoying but they dont make up for the films missteps the cloverfield paradox images8 imageseven if cloverfield paradox’s plot is expected there’s hope in its ensemble cast of great actors — gugu mbatharaw daniel bruhl david oyelowo and more — to at least bring heart to the predictability they are…a mixed bag as written the international crew serve as clichéd ensemble 101 you’ve got the comic relief in chris o’dowd’s mundy the leader who hides his emotions for the good of his crew in oyelowo’s kiel the german scientist schmidt bruhl some are mistrustful of and so on some like o’dowd lean into what little they’re given and make it work but others like oyelowo are completely underutilized with kiel his choices that should be hefty with meaning often come off as superfluous because we’re given so little time to learn about him the only character truly spared this fate is mbatharaw’s ava hamilton we see her decision to join this unique mission her relationship with her husband michael on earth and learn about her tragic past her motivations and subsequent decisions feel earned and understandable even if i didn’t always agree with them the emotional through line of the film ava’s development is starkly in contrast to a crew of characters who often act more in service to the plot than to themselves and yet i undoubtedly enjoyed watching the cloverfield paradox at many points along the way i loved the early ideas presented of a multiverse colliding with itself which leads to some truly horrific and twisted moments but those ideas quickly give way to a more pedestrian race against time and fate that never quite satisfies as its own story the verdict the cloverfield paradox is a paradox in itself split between trying to be a standalone scifi space horror and a key linking point in the cloverfield mythos the film never truly succeeds at either the original strains of its spaceset plot can’t avoid contrived beats even despite fun performances and an emotionally powerful arc from gugu mbatharaw and the elements included to not only make it a cloverfield film but seemingly the dark tower of this universe feel more like shovedin fan service than details neatly woven into the fabric of the film i still have hope for the cloverfield universe — and its always entertaining methods of release — but i hope further entries learn from the triumphs of
