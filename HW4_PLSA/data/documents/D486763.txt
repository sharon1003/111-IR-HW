degree so you can just get licensed as a psychologist imopermalink embed save parent – deleted 2 points 4 years agooo bcba is a masters level credential and pays at least 50hr on the very low endpermalink embed save parent – the roach 2 points 4 years agoits minimum masters degree to be boardcertified look up how the credential is certified vs open positionsjob market if you have a masters in counseling or school psychology you will be paid on the order of a salaried department head 50hour midrange for mental health professionals you will also be ousted on job prospects by more qualified candidates you can get into behavior analysis as an undergrad that experience will assist in boardcertification but you will have a great deal of trouble achieving any kind of board certification without a masters degree or higher and unless the masters is in behavior analysis in particular you wouldnt meet educational requirements until completing some additional schooling such as a postgraduate degree regardlessanyway the point is that you need to advance beyond an undergraduate degree to specialize enough to make any money in the field i think that was the point but more importantly if youre in the field for money then you will not succeed matter of factpermalink embed save parent – deleted 1 point 4 years ago yes my comment was just responding to your statement that its a bachelorslevel job because at the bachelors level there isnt much you can do other than work as an aba tutorinstructor which is very inconsistent often part time no insurancesalary therefore not a longterm career i have my bcba so im familiar with job prospects in the field as well as the certification processpermalink embed save parent – deleted 4 years ago deleted – deleted 1 point 4 years ago bcba is different though because its so easy to get and masters is terminal level so its far from a long arduous journey the pay is the same 125225 per billable hour as clinical psyc but with much less collegeexperience required before you start practicing and theres no real benefit to having a doctorate unless you want to do research to get certified its literally only 1500hr 750 if you go through a university practicum a masters in anything as of now it can even be in compsci but the regulations are changing soon so it will have to be a related field such as education psyc slp 6 graduate classes in aba and a 150 question multiple choice test its possible to do in just one year postbachelor the board is phasing in changes over the next few years to make the field harder to get into but as of now its in a very unique place in terms of educationexperience required to be a clinicianpermalink embed save – deleted 1 point 4 years ago im also a bcba happy to answer any

notorious for not being good at managementsupervisory positions mainly because of too much empathy should i say sympathy and giving people too many second chances we have habit of having the fence stuck you know where and seeing the greys having another measure called the bottom line to make decisions that is ubiquitous even if you go into non profits or especially private practice i highly encourage also if thats not in your heart your minor can make a difference for other careers if you decide not to go into graduate school for psychology keep in mind most employers look at you as a whole package and that you graduating college as just a whole set of skills and a huge accomplishment the shortfall associated mostly with psychology with the general public has to do bachelor arts degree bas are heavily emphasized in theory and philosophy a bs however is something to emphasize to people on your resume that is science ie research methodology qualitative quantitative experiment driven statistics data analysis programs etc i know many of you may not feel this way now but trust me when you do get into graduate school you will understand how important that difference really is

since your choice assuming you keep this choice that will be the same answer just look at the required courses for ba you will be missing and your aptitude and achievement in such areas of study if you are fearing these areas are a place of concern talk with fellow psych students or student advisor about it if its graduate school then you need to look at the program you are wanting to enter and

offer to a research design the more likely i am to get hired and companies that i want to work for seem to be biting offering me the chance to do the things i like about cog psy without the academic environment that i frankly cant stand the biggest advice id have would be to talk to everyone about what you study  what about people is it that youve done research on in my case attention and

points 4 years ago a bsc or ba in psychology if i remember the stats correctly gives you one of the lowest chances of winding up in employment of pretty much any undergraduate degree and its absolutely the lowest amongst sciencerelated degrees now the reasons for that might be debatable  it could be that since psychology is an exceptionally popular undergraduate choice then theres a lot of competition for relevant jobs perhaps psychology undergrad degrees just dont provide enough training suitable for the workplace  but it seems to be a consistent enough finding to make it believable although im not on the job market yet everything i hear about the job prospects for postgraduate psychology degrees suggests that theyre very good clinical psychology if youre interested in that subfield is a bit of an exception  its apparently incredibly competitive no matter what level youre at in general though your employability will be pretty high the general advice that i see handed out

theory and skills lsws just have more recognition and lobby harder than lpcs however consumer reports just ranked lpcs in the ranks of doctors and etcpermalink embed save parent – aznegglover  s 2 points 4 years agowhat exactly are the differences between msw mpc and clinical psych thenpermalink embed save parent – kornberg 6 points 4 years ago msw and mpc are masters degrees in social work and professional counseling respectively with those degrees you can then apply and do the work to get your lpc which is a license in professional counseling you need that license to be a therapist so you go to school for 2 years to get your masters which qualifies you to get your license which then takes 2 more years a person with an msw can do that andor get a license for social worktheir focus tends to be more on counseling for people who dont haveneedwant a diagnosed problem a person with a mpc will probably lean more on the clinical side of things and focus counseling for substance abuse eating disorders ocd and other more clinical cases than someone with an msw neither degree excludes you from ending up anywhere but the focus in each degree kind of leads you down a certain path clinical psychology is totally differentclinical psychologists have a ph d and other licensing to get if they want to work with patients they tend to work with psychiatrists and their patients you see them frequently working in hospital settingseither a regular hospital in the psych ward or a mental hospital with hospitalized patients clinical psychologists work with very ill people people who cannot function without intense mental health intervention to do this work you can get either a ph d in clinical psychology or what is known as a psy dits a ph d type degree but the focus is on practicing and not on research clinical psychology is also a common degree for people who want to work in research because of that clinical psych programs are very competitive like 500 applicants for 4 spots competitive psy d are a little less competitive but a lot of people look down on them i am not sure why both of these programs will take about 7 years to complete my advice is to get some volunteering and internships under your belt i went into psych thinking id be a therapist after i did an internship and realized that i hated it i tried out clinical psych and research workhated those too now im

more duties under a clinical social workers license than a clinical counselors license ie an lcsw can do everything an lpcc or lmft can do and more im in ca so that is what these licenses are called here in my experience with respect specifically to therapeutic relationships and an understanding of psychotherapy social workers fall a tad short as per less focus on these areas exclusively the other side of the coin is that therapists often refer to community resources and social support with only a basic understanding of these structures which social workers are obviously wellequipped to

be made to the major that will make it both more practical but also more cohesive and fulfilling to students we should get rid of the psych degree as it stands its outdated it would be like getting a degree in natural science psychology as a field has gained many areas of focus to me the current major comes across as a series of intro courses lots of breadth no depth how much about experimental design do you really know from one methods and one psych stats course you can recall a bunch of facts from your perception social developmental and abnormal classes but do they cohere into a single body of knowledge such as in the study of history physics or literature where one class logically and conceptually connects to the next perhaps this is a problem for the field and by extension the major both are in need of synthesizing forces if it were up to me i would have the following cognitive science major structure as a replacement semester 1 physics 1 chemistry 1 biology 1 formal logic calculus through differential equationssemester 2 physics 2 chemistry 2 biology 2 intro to programming linear algebra semester 3 intro to neuroscience stats 1 experimental methods 1 comp sci 1 writing and rhetoric semester 4 intro to cog sci stats 2 experimental methods 2 comp sci 2 philosophy of science after the first two years you have all of the premed recs except for orgo you also have a good foundation in programming being at least a little computer literate is rapidly becoming an important aspect of general literacy you have a knowledge of basic science this is good for the world if you fall in love with one of those courses you can easily change majors and have enough time to graduate on time the stats and methods courses occur simultaneously and should inform each other ive kept the writing requirement that many schools have its important to be able to argue for your position and to be able to express yourself clearly this and the philosophy courses help if you want to go to law school work in hr or any kind of managerial position at this point i would split up the major into concentrations or tracks here there is more flexibility regardless of which track you pick the hard foundation described above provides an important grounding for what you will learn the concentrations allow you to more fully explore area of interest there is some overlap although in some cases i would prefer for there to be different courses for example developmental psych in the neuroscience track might focus more on embryonic development and neuroplasticity while a greater emphasis on cognitive and social development might be more appropriate for the other tracks within a track students would only be required to take a subset of possible courses and could supplement from other tracks or majors below are some sample courses to demonstrate the divisions i have in mind language linguistics formal semantics phonetics philosophy of language memory developmental psychology 2 years of a foreign language some anthropology course other courses overlapping with linguistics perhaps machine learning or computational linguistics cognitive perception comparative psychology memory learning epistemology history of ancient philosophy history of modern philosophy philosophy of mind neural networks neuroscience cellular neurobiology systems neuroscience memory learning genetics bioengineering psychopharmacology computational artificial intelligence circuits or some ee basics philosophy of mind bioengineering machine learning computational neuroscience maybe software design neural networks social and clinical social psychology developmental psychology group dynamics or equivalent sociology health psychology abnormal psychology psychopharmacology i would also require all students to take some sort of civics course and scientific writing and research methods as in how to research something not how to conduct an experiment i would also require a semester or two of working in a lab advanced topics seminars would be available for students interested in a second course on a topic of choice eg advanced seminar in perception if there are say 12 required track courses there should still be plenty of time for electives i havent thought all of this through clearly but on a cursory view it seems to me that this organization provides students with a more cohesive body of knowledge otherwise you end up with just a smattering the foundational courses mean that even if you are not interested in therapy or social work but enjoy social psych you can take those classes and still know something else that can be applicable to other professions and to civic life although as others point out the current psych degree is useful in many jobs even without the courses i suggest sorry for the long rantpermalink embed save – matthias00 5 points 4 years ago people say psych degrees are useless because they assume the only jobs out there for psych people are

point 4 years ago a ba in psychology is as useless or helpful as you make it the value of it depends on the person and what you plan to do with it it can be great if you plan on pursuing graduate school whether for psychology law business education etc however if you dont plan on going to grad school you must have realistic expectations on where it will get you and what type of career it will qualify you for you wont really be qualified for a career in the psychology field with just a ba same thing really with any liberal arts degreepermalink embed save – featherhead13 1 point 4 years ago i just graduated with my bs in experimental psych in may and i decides to wait a year or two before graduate school ive been job hunting for a few weeks and while there are positions available you

assistantssecretaries etc but yea if you actually want to do counseling you need your masters and for a further point of commentary i personally think a ph d isnt worth it unless you want to go into academia or research or if you live in louisiana or oregon and want to prescribe medications without going to med school and becoming a psychiatristpermalink embed save – deleted 1 point 4 years ago i
