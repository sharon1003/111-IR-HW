and other areas they are also used for cooling and for the control of airborne dust sprinkler irrigation is a method of applying irrigation water which is similar to natural rainfall water is distributed through a system of pipes usually by pumping it is then sprayed into the air through sprinklers so that it breaks up into small water drops which fall to the ground the pump valves distribution pipes and sprinklers are generally designed to apply water as uniformly as possible contents  hide 1 types11 industrial12 residential13 underground sprinkler14 agricultural science2 use3

usually designed to operate at pressures due to misting problems that may develop higher pressure sprinklers that themselves move in a circle are driven by a ball drive gear drive or impact mechanism  impact sprinklers  these can be designed to rotate in a full or partial circle rainguns are similar to impact sprinkler except that they generally operate at very high pressures of 40 to 130 lbfin² 275 to 900 k pa and flows of 50 to 1200 us galmin 3 to 76 ls usually with nozzle diameters in the range of 05 to 19 inches 10 to 50 mm in addition to irrigation guns are used for industrial applications such as dust suppression and logging many irrigation sprinklers are buried in the ground along with their supporting plumbing although above ground and moving sprinklers are also common most irrigation sprinklers operate through electric and hydraulic technology and are grouped together in zones that can be collectively turned on and off by actuating a solenoid controlled valve residential  editan oscillating sprinkler is commonly used to water residential lawns and is moved as needed home lawn sprinklers vary widely in their size cost and complexity they include impact sprinklers oscillating sprinklers drip sprinklers and underground sprinkler systems small sprinklers are available at home and garden stores or hardware stores for small costs these are often attached to an outdoor water faucet and are placed only temporarily other systems may be professionally installed permanently in the ground and are attached permanently to a homes plumbing system an ingenious domestic sprinkler made by nomad called a setandforget tractor sprinkler was used in australia in the 1950s water pressure ensured that the sprinkler slowly moved across a lawn 1permanently installed systems may often operate on timers or other automated processes they are occasionally installed with retractable heads for aesthetic and practical reasons making damage during lawn mowing or other maintenance less likely these often are programmed to operate at certain times of day or on some other schedule underground sprinkler  editunderground sprinklers function through means of basic electronic and hydraulic technology this valve and all of the sprinklers that will be activated by this valve are known as a zone upon activation the solenoid which sits on top of the valve is magnetized lifting a small stainless steel plunger in its center by doing this the activated or raised plunger allows air to escape from the top of a rubber diaphragm located in the center of the valve water that has been charged and waiting on the bottom of this same diaphragm now has the higher pressure and lifts the diaphragm this pressurized water is then allowed to escape down stream of the valve through a series of pipes usually made of pvc higher pressure commercial systems or polyethylene pipe for typically lower pressure residential systems at the end of these pipes and flush to ground level typically are pre measured and spaced out sprinklers these sprinklers can be fixed spray heads that have a set pattern and generally spray between 15–2m 7–15 ft full rotating sprinklers that can spray a broken stream of water from 6–12m 20–40 ft or small drip emitters that release a slow steady drip of water on more delicate plants such as flowers and shrubs use of indigenous materials also recommended 2agricultural science  editcenter pivot irrigation sprinkler nozzles used in crop irrigation rotator style pivot applicator sprinkler end gun style pivot applicator sprinkler the first use of sprinklers by farmers was some form of home and golf course type sprinklers these ad hoc systems while doing the job of the buried pipes and fixed sprinkler heads interfered with cultivation and were expensive to maintain in the 1950s a firm based in portland oregon stoutwyss irrigation system developed the rolling pipe type irrigation system for farms that has become the most popular type for farmers irrigating large fields with this system large wheels attached to the large pipes with sprinkler heads move slowly across the field 3use  editmost irrigation sprinklers are used as part of a sprinkler system consisting of various plumbing parts pump unit 4 piping and control equipment outdoor sprinkler systems are sometimes used as a deterrent against homeless people this sprinkler system was programmed to drench unsuspecting sleepers at random times during the night local businessmen soon copied this system in an effort to drive homeless people away from public sidewalks adjacent to their businesses 5health risks from aerosols  editin 2017 it was reported that use of common garden hoses in combination with spray nozzles may generate aerosols containing droplets smaller than 10 μm which can be inhaled by nearby people water stagnating in a hose between uses especially when warmed by the sun can host the growth and interaction of legionella and freeliving amoebae fla as biofilms on the inner surface of the hose clinical cases of legionnaires disease or pontiac fever have been found to be associated with inhalation of garden hose aerosols containing legionella bacteria the report provides measured microbial densities resulting from controlled hose conditions in order to quantify the human health risks the densities of legionella spp identified in two types of hoses were found to be similar to those reported during legionellosis outbreaks from other causes it is proposed that the risk could be mitigated by draining hoses after use
