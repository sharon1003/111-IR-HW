prisoner of interest  wo w  mount hyjal click photos for full view hello and welcome if youve found yourself here you are probably needing help with this quest the most challenging part of this one for me was simply finding the darn barrow dens so lets start with that the red circle is where the entrance of the barrow dens is on the map this is what the entrance looks like plus a shot of where youre at on the mini map once inside the den follow your mini map its pretty easy to navigate speak to saynna you will have to take the arch druid fangdral staghelm back out the way you came the arch druid is unable to put up any fight at all but on the way back out of the den you have to fight these nightmare monster things my level was a bit high for this quest so i had no problems at all but its not particularly challenging anyway after all that you will turn in the quest right outside the den info is good for mo p i dont guarantee it will be the same after more expansions if youd like to add anything feel free to commentposted by wo w helperz at 450 pm email this blog this share to twitter share to facebook share to pinterest labels arch druid  barrow dens  fangdral staghelm  kalimdor  mount hyjal  prisoner of interest  quest  saynna stormrunner  world of warcraft  wow
