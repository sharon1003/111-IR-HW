top 500 reviewer50 out of 5 stars 10 years later my dyson is still going strong march 19 2015verified purchase the dyson cyclone upright vacuum clean is still going strong 10 years after i purchased it  and somehow forgot to review it so you get the 10year review  and heres why after breaking several average 100 or less priced noparticularbrand vacuum cleaners and tired and sick of changing vacuum bags we splurged on this funky futuristic looking vacuum cleaner and not without much hesitation let me tell you at the time i bought this i was not one to spend several hundred dollars on an appliance unless it was an absolute necessity but in hindsight i am so glad we did in 10 years this vacuum cleaner has been in the hands of one rough cleaner  me  and all the cleaning ladies and men that i have hired to clean my house it has gone up and down the stairs in and out on carpeted floors wooded floors  even the delicate bamboo floors in my first home  and into the cervices and tiny corners of both houses and i have to say i am very pleased with it i have never had a damaged part or had to call in for service it comes with several brushes and you can switch them off to suit the exact space you are vacuuming the handle also comes off so when you are cleaning the staircase the machine can stay at the bottom and you can move up the stairs with the extended cleaning hood and get your stairs spotless it is a little heavy so moving it from floor to floor  if you have multiple floors in your home can be a bit challenging just get a strong member of the family to do that and youre all set you just have to remember to empty the container when its just about half or less than half full any more than that it makes the vacuum cleaner heavy and a bit sluggish it is also more work for you to move it around when its fuller when you empty the dust bin shall we call it keep your eyes and face away from it because it is full of dust and you will make a mess in the area where you are emptying it so you can just vacuum right over it thats the messiest part of the job i fully expect the dyson to go on another 10 years it is one of the best purchases i have made and frankly these days when my appliances go past the 5 year mark i am thrilled and past the 8 year mark i am slightly shocked and well past the decade mark i am starting to wonder what is wrong with them they should surely be breaking down by now well im glad to have been wrong in the case of my dyson wellworth the investment read more comment 6 people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no report abuse rickie d bickle50 out of 5 stars excllent vacuum march 2 2013verified purchase i have owned a dyson for several years i started out with the purple model when i got divorced my ex wife kept the vacuum since we had the vacuum for several years and it had just as much suction as the day we bought it i decided to purchase another one i like the long cord i can reach every room in my house without having to unplug it and move to a diffrent plug the attachments it comes with are all i need there is no need to purchase additional attachments i also like overall design i am just as pleased with this one as the first one i purchased while living with my mother she used this vacuum and fell in love with it i purchased one for her as a christmas present for her this has become the only vacuum she uses i would highly recommend this vacuum read more comment 3 people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no report abuse erlo banfield50 out of 5 stars whoa great machine february 6 2007verified purchase3 months later well its been over 3 months of heavy usage of this vacuum it has been fantastic it is such a superior product been doing demos for some of my wifes friends it leaves them awestruck the engineering is superb and with a visible container for dirt you get immediate positive feedback that your cleaning is effective it is unbelievable how much stuff i have removed from our house my son asked me if i had had my office rug cleaned besides removing the dirt in the rug if brought the nap up our stairwell carpeting has never looked as good as it does now im now a committed dyson customer  my dyson dc 07 came today took a break from work have a homeoffice and took my time and went completely through the instructions did some test dismantling of the unit per the instructions and then vacuumed it was almost unbelievable the dirt and hair i picked up and i had just vacuumed this area yesterday i was also impressed with how not so noisy this machine is it is clearly an engineered piece of equipment even though this machine is brand new to me here are some words of wisdom 1 i read through the bulk of the reviews to gain a sense of what people liked or didnt like and to try and ascertain the writers mechanical abilities 2 i would suspect if one is not mechanically inclined this could be a tough machine to use not because there is anything wrong but you should bring something to the party all in all i hope im as impressed a month from now as i currently am again my first impression of this machines performance is fantastic read
