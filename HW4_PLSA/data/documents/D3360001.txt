disturbed an irritation is set up in the womb which produces pleasure and heat in the rest of the body a woman also releases something from her body sometimes into the womb which then becomes moist and sometimes externally as well if the womb is open wider than normal once intercourse has begun she experiences pleasure throughout the whole time until the man ejaculates if her desire for intercourse is excited she emits before the man and for the remainder of the time she does not feel pleasure to the same extent but if she is not in a state of excitement then her pleasure terminates along with that of the man what happens is like this if into boiling water you pour another quantity of water which is cold the water stops boiling in the same way the mans sperm arriving in the womb extinguishes both the heat and the pleasure of the woman both the pleasure and the heat reach their peak simultaneously with the arrival of the sperm in the womb and then they cease if for example you pour wine on a flame first of all the flame flares up and increases for a short period when you pour the wine on then it dies away in the same way the womans heat flares up in response to the mans sperm and then dies away the pleasure experienced by the woman during intercourse is considerably less than the mans although it lasts longer the reason that the man feels more pleasure is that the secretion from the bodily fluid in his case occurs suddenly and as the result of a more violent disturbance than in the womans case another point about women if they have intercourse with men their health is better than if they do not for in the first place the womb is moistened by intercourse whereas when the womb is drier than it should be it becomes extremely contracted and this extreme contraction causes pain to the body in the second place intercourse by heating the blood and rendering it more fluid gives an easier passage to the menses whereas if the menses do not flow womens bodies become prone to sickness when a woman has intercourse if she is not going to conceive then it is her practice to expel the sperm produced by both partners whenever she wishes to do so if however she is going to conceive the sperm is not expelled but remains in the womb for when the womb has received the sperm it closes up and retains it because the moisture causes the wombs orifice to contract then both what is provided by the man and what is provided by the woman is mixed together if the woman is experienced in matters of childbirth and takes note when the sperm is retained she will know the precise day on which she has conceived source shttpwwwstoaorgdiotimaanthologywl deepak · 4 years ago1 0 comment during sex women release lubricating liquid and not sperm puberty attained

to get into the uretus  i know u wont like it but smoking as it has been scientifically proven that tobacco interferes with the conceiving aspect in a woman’s body so get her to smoke a biri or cigg
