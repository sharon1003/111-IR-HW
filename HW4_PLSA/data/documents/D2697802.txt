groups and counseling for scoliosis what is the anatomy of the spine our spine is an engineering marvel that supports our weight and ties our body together the spine consists of a column of small bones vertebrae that range in size from 23 inches to 56 inches in diameter it is divided into anatomical sections these are thecervical spine neck which has seven vertebraethoracic spine upper back which has 12 vertebrae to which the ribs are attachedlumbar spine lower back which has five vertebraesacrum which consists of five bones that are fused or stuck together andcoccyx which is made up of four tiny bones when viewed from the front the normal spine appears to be straight but when viewed from the side the normal spine has two gentle s curves one curves outward in the upper back called kyphosis by physicians and the other curves inward in the lower back known as lordosis what is scoliosis share your story scoliosis is an abnormal curvature of the spine in scoliosis the spine curves to the side when viewed from the front and each involved vertebra also twists on the next one in a corkscrew fashion this twisting is known as rotoscoliosis this may cause one shoulder to be higher than the other or one side of the ribcage or lower back to be more prominent humpback if there is both a sidewise curvature and increase in the outward curvature of the upper back this condition is called kyphoscoliosis it is more common in children with neuromuscular diseases a curve with a rightsided prominence is called dextroscoliosis and a leftsided prominence is levoscoliosis generally children with idiopathic of unknown cause scoliosis have two sidewise curves in opposite directions but these may not be of the same size or severity what are the types of scoliosis there are multiple types of scoliosis classified by age of onset andor cause these include the following congenital scoliosis is present at birth and caused by vertebrae that are not properly formed prior to birth part of a vertebra maybe missing or wedgeshaped andor abnormal bony bridges between two or more vertebrae may be present with infantile scoliosis patients are younger than 3 years of age it is more common in boys and may resolve on its own with only observation generally this type of scoliosis has less of a rotational component than other types juvenile scoliosis is seen in children 310 years of age it is more common in girls than boys and is at the greatest risk of progression of all types with the highest risk of progression in girls idiopathic scoliosis is the most common type of scoliosis this type is seen in children 1116 years of age it is also more common in girls and they are at higher risk of progression of the curvature the term idiopathic refers to any medical condition that arises spontaneously without a known cause neuromuscular scoliosis is caused by any of a number of associated disease processes that affect the neurologic or muscular systems this may include cerebral palsy muscular dystrophy metabolic diseases and connective tissue disorders such as marfans syndrome the age of onset is variable and depends on the disease process adultacquired scoliosis is due to acquired degenerative changes as the spine ages in patients over the age of 18 childhood skin problems slideshow childhood illnesses you should know slideshow brain foods healthy food for kids brains what are causes of scoliosis in most cases the cause of scoliosis is unknown what doctors call idiopathic the nonidiopathic types generally fall into two groups nonstructural functional this type of scoliosis is a temporary condition when the spine is otherwise normal the curvature occurs as the result of another problem from one leg being shorter than another muscle spasms due to a soft tissue injury ruptured disc or abdominal problems such as appendicitis  structural in this type of scoliosis the spine is not normal this may be due to abnormally shaped vertebrae or neuromuscular diseases about 30 of children with idiopathic scoliosis have a family history of the condition but the exact hereditary genetic association is not known at this time what are risk factors for scoliosis and progression of scoliosis risk factors for idiopathic scoliosis and its progression worsening of the curvature include the following female gender family history of scoliosis bone age significantly less than chronologic age progression of the curve despite bracing or the child not wearing the brace called noncompliancepresence of scoliosis before puberty due to the longer time span until completion of bone growth generally the greatest risk of scoliosis progression is in the two years after the onset of puberty during the time of the rapid adolescent growth spurt in girls this is generally in the two years immediately after the age of the first menstrual period called menarche usually beginning around age 12 as puberty is generally later in boys their growth spurt begins around age 13 what are scoliosis signs and symptoms readers comment 1 share your story these signs and symptoms may be seen with idiopathic scoliosis the head may be off center and does not line up with the pelvis one hip or shoulder may be higher than the other the child may walk with a rolling gait the opposite sides of the body may not appear level the child may experience back pain or tire easily during activities that require excessive trunk chest and belly movement one side of the rib cage or lower back may seem more prominent humpback the chest may seem sunken in on one side or in girls one breast may seem smaller than the other the child may appear to have an uneven waist the physical deformities may not be readily apparent as adolescents tend to be more modest as they mature and the parents may not see the childs back unless a bathing suit or similar attire is worn you may also likeviewback pain quiz iqwhat exams help diagnose scoliosis idiopathic scoliosis usually becomes apparent around 10 years of age just as the child begins puberty it is usually seen at an earlier age in girls than boys as girls generally enter puberty at a younger age than boys most school systems have screening programs that look for scoliosis generally performed in grades five or six when the child is 1012 years of age the child is usually examined by a specially trained screening nurse the most common school screening test is while wearing a tshirt the child stands with his or her feet straight ahead with knees locked and then slowly bends over to touch the toes the examiner then sights along the spine from pelvis to head if one side of the rib cage andor lower back is more prominent sits higher or if the trunk curves off to the side this is a positive test the child is then referred for medical followup to hisher primarycare provider or pediatrician at the medical followup visit a more extensive version of the screening test will be done by the physician with the child undressed from the waist up an examination of the neurologic nerves and muscle systems will be completed at the same time in order to determine if the child has any underlying diseases that may be causing the scoliosis scoliosis xrays xrays with special scoliosis views can measure the extent of the curvature these are done using a special long xray image that goes from the base of the skull to the upper pelvis both back to front posterioranterior and side view lateral images are done the examining physician andor a radiologist physician specializing in xrays will take measurements of the spine at specific points around the curves seen on the xrays in order to determine the spinal angles called the cobb angle measurement curves with a cobb angle of greater than 10 degrees are a cause for greater concern and require referral to a pediatric spine surgeon an xray of the hand and wrist may be obtained in order to determine the bone age of the child to help to predict how many years of bone growth is to be expected as the patients chronologic age age in years may not be the same as the bone age by looking at specific growth areas on the spinal films bone maturity and the amount of growth remaining can also be estimated children with a bone age younger than chronologic age are at particular risk for progression of scoliosis childhood skin problems slideshow childhood illnesses you should know slideshow brain foods healthy food for kids brains what specialists treat scoliosis scoliosis is treated by pediatric spine surgeons including orthopedic surgeons and neurosurgeons with specialty training usually a fellowship after completion of a residency in pediatric spine surgery physical therapists may work with patients and families for instruction in exercise programs to be done along with a bracing program and rehabilitation after scoliosis surgery patients with neuromuscular diseases will also be followed by a pediatric neurologist some children may benefit from shortterm counseling with a mentalhealth care provider if they are having difficulty coping with the need for bracing or surgery support groups are available both in person in many towns and online for children with scoliosis what are scoliosis treatments readers comments 4 share your story depending on the degree of the curvature and whether it gets worse over time the pediatric spine surgeon may recommend treatment other than observation alone the majority of cases of scoliosis do not require treatment or may be treated with bracing alone until spine growth is complete if the curve is less than 25° no treatment is required and the child can be seen every four to six months for a physical examination and scoliosis imaging if the curve is more than 25° but less than 40° a custom scoliosis brace may be used for treatment the type and length of the brace depends on the location of the curve s generally the brace will enclose the upper pelvis curves that involve mainly the lumbar spine low back and lower thoracic spine mid back will be treated with a brace that ends under the arms at the upper end curves that involve the upper thoracic spine may require a brace that goes up to the level of the chin with a ring about the neck curves that are more than 45° will need to be evaluated for the possibility of surgical correction treatment options depend more on how likely it is that the curve will worsen than on the angle of the curve itself a child with a 20° curve and four more years of remaining growth may require treatment while a child with 29° of curvature who has stopped growing may not require treatment the bone age as compared to chronologic age as well as monitoring for rate of progression of the scoliosis can help to determine the treatment options children with severe scoliosis that involves the thoracic spine greater than 50° are at risk for problems with their heart and lungs due to decreased space in the chest cavity for these organs as a result of collapse of the chest cavity itself if the child is treated with bracing it is important to follow the timetable for brace wear determined by the spine surgeon braces are generally worn for 1823 hours per day they may be worn for sleeping and removed for showering and sports in a few select cases for specific types of curves treated with special bending braces bracing may be done only during nighttimesleeping the spine surgeon will determine if this is an option for your child successful bracing will maintain the position of the spinal curves until the child has stopped growing but will not correct the curvature your child will be taught exercises to do while in the brace by a physical therapist it is important to follow the instructions of the therapist if the child will not cooperate with wearing a brace a body cast may be considered as it cannot be removed chiropractic adjustments will not correct or reverse idiopathic scoliosis manage diabetes in 10 minutes erectile

referred by the school for a scoliosis evaluation you should make an appointment to see your primarycare provider or pediatrician within the next month or so physicians in these specialties can then evaluate your child and decide whether you child should be monitored with a repeat examination or referred to a pediatric spine specialist for further evaluation if your child requires bracing heshe will be followed by a spine surgeon followup examinations and xrays are generally obtained every three to six months to monitor the child for worsening of the curves children who require bracing will be seen regularly by an orthotist brace maker for adjustments the timetable for these adjustments varies depending on the childs rate of growth during the periods of rapid growth during puberty these adjustments will be at more frequent intervals and may require new construction of all or part of the brace if your child is treated with a brace you should follow the instructions provided by your doctor for its use followup intervals after surgery are determined by the type and extent of the surgery and the surgeon will give you instructions regarding followup evaluations are there ways to prevent scoliosis scoliosis is not preventable at this time we do not understand what causes the condition in the majority of children massage yoga chiropractic treatments osteopathic adjustments and exercises without bracing will not prevent scoliosis correct the curvature or slow the progress of the scoliosis vitamins calcium supplements stretching body wraps muscle stimulators and other home remedies will not prevent or cure idiopathic scoliosis what types of surgery treat scoliosis surgical treatment of idiopathic scoliosis is indicated for curves that are greater than 50° progressing rapidly despite bracing or which are expected to progress beyond the end of bone growth decreased heart or lung function due to loss of chest space capacity compression of the abdominal belly organs due to loss of abdominal space severe cosmetic deformity loss of balanced position of the head andor body over the pelvis andor escalating back pain the goals of surgery are to release the soft tissues holding the bones of the spine in the incorrect position restore the position of the spinal bones to as close to normal alignment as possible maintain the corrected position by stabilizing the spine with a combination of metal plates screws hooks wires andor rods and bone grafting to fuse the bones of spine together permanently corrective surgery may be done from the front anterior approach of the spine the back posterior approach of the spine or a combined procedure the majority of scoliosis surgeries are done from the back of the spine if both anterior and posterior approaches are necessary they may be done on the same day or two different days with a recovery period of a few days in between depending on the extent of the individual surgical procedures required a newer technique called thoracoscopy for approaching the upper thoracic spine from the front through the chest uses a fiberoptic scope and special instruments to release and fuse the spine this may be suitable for some patients with a curvature involving the upper back thoracic spine and avoids a large incision called a thoracotomy into the chest the pediatric spine surgeon will determine if this is an option for your child if a thoracotomy is necessary the spine surgeon may work with a chest thoracic surgeon to open and close the chest if a surgical approach through the chest is carried out a chest tube to reinflate the lung s will be used a combination of plates and screws into the bones if surgery is necessary from the front of the spine or screws into the spinal bones attached to rods near the spine if the spine is approached from the back are used to stabilize the spine while waiting for the bones of the spine to fuse bone graft obtained for the back of the patients called autologous bone pelvis iliac crest bone graft andor various types of human donor bone grafts called allograft bone and synthetic bone grafts are placed around the bones of the spine to encourage the spine to fuse in the corrected position a cell saver device is often used to recover blood lost during the procedure so that it can be returned to the patient the spinal fusion procedure may be done using medications to reduce the patients blood pressure in order to reduce blood loss and other medications that may reduce bleeding after the surgery is completed these measures may allow the patient to avoid or reduce the need for donor blood transfusions childhood skin problems slideshow childhood illnesses you should know slideshow brain foods healthy food for kids brains how long is the recovery time after scoliosis surgery immediately following the surgery the child may need to be in the intensivecare unit especially if a chest tube was necessary for 2448 hours to stabilize fluid balance and to monitor heart lung and kidney function closely a brace or cast is usually not necessary after surgery if metal hardware to stabilize the spine was used the patient is usually out of bed and walking by the morning after surgery a physical therapist will assist the patient with safe walking techniques and an occupational therapist will work with the patient to achieve independence in activities of daily living such as dressing and personal hygiene before discharge to home the hospital stay is usually four to seven days the first postoperative visit with the surgeon is at 1014 days after surgery and any skin sutures or staples are removed by 14 days additional postoperative visits are as recommended by your surgeon but are generally at four to six weeks three months six months nine months and 12 months after surgery xrays of the spine are usually done at each postoperative visit the fusion is usually solid by six months after surgery but may require up to 12 months the patient returns to school by three to four weeks after surgery most patients resume all of their customary activities except sports by three to six months after surgery and return to noncontact sports after nine months what is the prognosis of scoliosis what is the life expectancy for people with scoliosis with early screening and detection the prognosis for children with idiopathic scoliosis is excellent most children with idiopathic scoliosis are initially treated with observation when needed bracing will usually prevent worsening of the curvatures and allow the patient to avoid surgery with proper treatment whether by bracing or surgery the vast majority of children with scoliosis will go on to lead normal independent lives be gainfully employed in many kinds of active careers
