mycotopia moderator8968 posts awards bar posted 17 april 2006  0633 pmthe sugars in mushrooms cause some people stomach upset and gas due to the way your bowels break them down do you also get quite gassy from eating beans if so i suggest beano capsules you can get these in most drug stores they contain a number of enzymes designed to help your stomach break foods down without producing an excess of methane take twice as many as directed on the label and take them about 45 minutes before dosing if gas from beans isnt an issue for you your problem probably isnt caused by the sugars but the fiber in the mushroom material you cant solve a fiber digestion issue with enzymes but you can solve it by avoiding consumption of the fibers how make your mushrooms into tea and dont consume the mushgrit but filter it out to make tea put enough water in the microwave or a sauce pot to make a glass of tea heat the water to boiling and then remove it from the heat dont boil the mushrooms dried mushrooms should be powdered coffee grinder works great fresh mushrooms should be finely diced with a sharp chefs knife you want to expose as much mushroom surface area as possible to the water a squirt of lemon juice about 12 tablespoon will help to get more magic into the water add the appropriate amount of powdered or diced mushrooms and let them steep for about 15 minutes stir the tea a few times during this time using a coffee filter or an old tshirt filter out all the solid material sip the tea slowly over the course of 510 minutes soy lecithin capsules can also help to ease digestion problems if you note any liver discomfort silymarin milk thistle capsules can help take soy or silymarin with a full glass of water about 1 hour before dosing hope this helps5tvcasualty embrace your damage og vip10761 posts awards bar posted 17 april 2006  0701 pmlots of good tips here and i have one to add activated charcoal not just for mushrooms but carry some in the car leave some in the medicine cabinet etc two or three charcoal capsules stop a bad burrito in its tracks or the morning symphony of mushroom gas its found at good health food stores and is the same stuff they make you drink at the er if you get poisoned before they pump your stomach it locks up toxins so you crap them out instead of absorbing them best eaten as long after eating mushrooms as possible the label also warns against eating charcoal an hour or two before or after taking any medication as the med will be adsorbed yes ad sorbed you anyall of you wont believe how much of your past stomach suffering was preventable once you start hitting back with activated charcoal miraculous can save marriages6spark ogfree member821 posts posted 17 april 2006  0738 pmthis happend to me when i drank

strong stomach and the purge soothes my gut i feel better and my high is always exponentially increasedpuke9chillceltic tiger expired member1092 posts posted 18 april 2006  0319 amsome people have found that even tea extractions can cause stomach upset if this is really an issue you can also do an alcohol extraction which has been reported to cause no upset whatsoever good luck many good suggestions in this thread10 guestfreakachinoguest posted 18 april 2006  0842 ami think its different for everyone i dont get stomach upset im really lucky and thankful for that weedy mr freak gets really bad stomach upset for like the first hour he finds smoking herb right after he ingests to help calm him so he doesnt think about it a lot he also knows it will pass in a bit he twitches a lot too i think if you think about it a lot and worry itll only get worse the gas i get gas but i burp mostly until it is digested the beano is a good idea i may try that next time chocolates are a great additon i like hot cocoa instead of tea i use the blender to blend up freshies in hot cocoa and it works great dry powdered mushies make great trips with little discomfort and hot cocoa with steeped mushies i havent done made like tea without the mushroom material may work great chocolate is hard for our bodies to digest also so dont take too much chocolate in as it may take a while for digestion to occur i think its really interesting how different everybodys bodies and minds react to the magic mushrooms that is what is so intriguing to me about them i am going to try an alcohol extraction for weedy to see if it helps him with his stomach upset problems this is a great thread thanks for all the info and input 11srgtm1ayeah yeah you know expired member760 posts posted 18 april 2006  0903 ama lot of good tipstricks in this thread i agree with freakachinoeveryone is different i have friends that puke almost every time they do it even on very small doses i personally never get sickmaybe a little upset stomach once in a very great while but im usually fine its never made me puke though things that my friends do that help them through it smoke a little herb before and after eating them drink warm 7upginger ale during and after eating them reading a magazine until it kicks in to keep your mind off of the upset stomach they say the warm 7upginger ale really helps calm their stomach the best out of all of thosebut again everyone is different i personally think a lot of it is mental and the warm 7up is just a placebobut i wont get into that if it worksgo for it12maxcanadian banned member1084 posts posted 18 april 2006  0929 ami think its caused by your stomach digesting fibre ps cyans are almost woody and alot of fibre very tough on the stomach cubensis not as bad but same problem to digest fibre all the water in your stomach lining gets sucked out if youve ever eaten a highfibre bar it says to eat with a couple glasses of water this will prolly help with shrooms too but the water dilutes a bit so dont over do it13guitargrrl mycophiliac expired member91 posts posted 18 april 2006  0315 pmi occasionally get an upset stomach from mushrooms maybe once out of every 4 or 5 trips a little herb  ginger ale has been an old standby for medoes the trick every time ginger itself is great for calming the stomach down mushroom related or not if youre not a soda person try a cup of ginger tea hell you could probably make gingermushroom tea and get your mushies and stomach soother all at once candied ginger works well but its a little too sweet for my taste buds14 guestdial8guest posted 18 april 2006  0334 pmmy stomach never really hurts but on the come down i do have the poots hell it feels good15simbiosismycophiliac expired member32 posts posted 18 april 2006  0452 pmi always chew the schrooms until they disapear i like the taste and i think absorbtion begins in the mouth also the enzymes in the mouth may help wenn wery well chewn i never had problems and allways do that waybut everybody is diferent a god way a friend of mine found is making chocolat grind the shrooms until they are powder heat schocolat until its liquidi used kichen chocolat let it cool just before it starts to get hard again add the shrooms its mostly not sweetso add shugar i added almonds and raisins too i used 06g per 3x3cm i found god effects from the chocolat i was surprised excuse my writing errors16spyker mycotopiate expired member300 posts posted 18 april 2006  0543 pmget rooibos tea from south africa u can get it on the net or in some shops i think it sooths the stomach and tastes gooood ive been biting my nails since i could walk and with a few years of boarding school food in high school shrooms dont scare my stomach haha no but after seeing a mass poll on here or on the shhhshroomery where tea came up trumps i think a bunch of crampy people tried it and it worked in most cases i got a freind whos stomach dies a terrible death everytime on mushies and i suggested it and it was the trick rooibos teabagmushies pot 1 12 cups water simmer on stove for 10 mins drink and eatchew well soggy mushies after tea is finished i like condensed milk or honey and milk with the tea there is noo way your stomach can refuse rooibos tea and condensed milk  a south african camping tradition its that good heavenly nooo way haha ive always had mushies like this and it kicks me hard haha although i eat em plain never puked either way i think that some people have trouble breaking down the compact cellulose in the shroom which may with other factors give some the cramps wind i get wicked shroom farts though and nausea just spent easter weekend with a few thousand others 3 or 5000  who knows camped in apple and pear orchards in the most beatiful setting in a forest next to a river in the mountains etc a 3 day psy trance festival hippies models rastas yuppies ankle snappers and grannies all races how many kilos of mushies got consumed how much tea how many upseat stomachs vearing off path sorryhaha17spyker mycotopiate expired member300 posts posted 18 april 2006  0547 pmrooibos tea with honey or condense milk or buchu tea with honey and squeeze of
