a day in the life of a hospital cnaa nurse aide working in a hospital is normally assigned to a specific unit and most of the time she will only work on that unit sometimes a cna may be asked to replace another coworker on a different unit if they previously worked there and are familiar with a particular hospital floor the tasks assigned to a nurse aide in emergency room intensive care and medicalsurgical units are the same but some environments may be more overwhelming than others especially if the cna has never worked in a hospital emergency room can become quite hectic at times as can the intensive care department especially when compared to lower key units such as medicalsurgical floors a hospital may choose to rotate nurse aides through several of these units in order to familiarize them with the different settings and environments a nurse assistant working on a labor and delivery unit or postpartum floor is comfortable with providing basic care to female patients who have delivered an infant the cna working on this unit may also rotate to other hospital units especially medicalsurgical ones a nurse aide working in a hospitals emergency department will encounter patients of many different ages from children to the elderly and will develop valuable skills of providing care to each age group in intensive care units the nurse aide assists registered nurses who take care of acutely ill clients these patients are usually hooked up to ventilators heart and oxygen monitors and receive many types of intravenous medications as well as parenteral nutrition the nurse aide is guided and helped by the registered nurse in providing complete baths and other basic care to these critically ill clients every nurse aide starts the work day with an assignment which specifies the room numbers where their clients are located as well as the registered nurse they need to report to in a hospital environment it is normal for the cna finishing up her shift to give the oncoming nurse aide a brief report regarding each clients status and this is usually referred to as going on “rounds” unlike clients in longterm care who are residents of a nursing home for an extended period of time hospitalized patients are discharged as soon as they are stable the brief report a cna gives to another cna during rounds prepares the nurse aide to better care for a given patient in addition to the headsup received from a fellow cna a nurse aide will also speak with the registered nurse to find out about any special needs their clients might have the shift consists of measuring and recording vital signs at certain time intervals assisting with toileting and bathing making the beds measuring and recording output answering call lights and providing the patient with clean gowns linens and hygienic supplies some hospitalized clients may require special supervision and monitoring when a nurse aide provides care for diabetic patient the cna will use a special blood glucose monitor to test blood glucose levels these tests are usually performed by the nurse assistant at the beginning and end of their shift furthermore the nurse aide will ensure that diabetic patients follow the required diet by monitoring the foods they receive keep in mind that only some hospitalized patients need complete hygiene care most of the clients are able to use the bathroom and perform activities of daily living as long as the nurse aide provides them with hygienic supplies nursing home patients on the other hand are highly dependent on the care provided by the cna from washing to eating and turning one of the duties a nurse aide will frequently perform in the hospital is transferring patients to other units and helping with discharging transferring a client who cannot ambulate requires some physical effort since the cna needs to push the clients bed to the new location even though they have wheels these beds might be hard to maneuver for someone who has never performed this task before a client is discharged the cna gathers the residents property and belongings in one place to be inventoried by the nurse and if needed provides a wheelchair and escorts the client a nurse aide working in a hospital does not have ample time to get to know a particular client in a longterm care facility the cna cares for the same patient over a long period of time and thus learns each clients needs likes and dislikes as well as the patients family studies have shown that this type of knowledge results in a better quality of care for clients the cna employed in a hospital must be a quick learner and always strive to achieve continuity of care for every patient questions comments suggestions kathleen s on august 08 2014 at 0422 pm can you share
