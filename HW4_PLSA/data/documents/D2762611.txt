collective punishment that the german empire undertook in german south west africa modernday namibia against the herero nama and san people it is considered the first genocide of the 20th century 1 2 3 it took place between 1904 and 1907 during the herero wars in january 1904 the herero people led by samuel maharero and nama captain hendrik witbooi rebelled against german colonial rule in august german general lothar von trotha defeated the herero in the battle of waterberg and drove them into the desert of omaheke where most of them died of dehydration in october the nama people also rebelled against the germans only to suffer a similar fate between 24000 and 100000 herero and 10000 nama died 4 5 6  page needed 7 8 9  page needed 10 the first phase of the genocide was

as an attempt to exterminate the herero and nama peoples of south west africa and therefore one of the earliest attempts at genocide in the 20th century in 2004 the german government recognized and

the south of the herero 16 22in 1883 during the scramble for africa franz adolf eduard lüderitz purchased a stretch of coast near the angra pequena bay from the reigning chief the terms of the purchase were fraudulent but the german government nonetheless established a protectorate over it 17 at that time it was the only overseas german territory deemed suitable for white settlement 18chief

protection treaty on 21 october 1885 with imperial germany s colonial governor heinrich ernst göring father of nazi luftwaffe commander hermann göring but did not cede the land of the herero this treaty was renounced in 1888 due to lack of german support against witbooi but it was reinstated in 1890 19the herero leaders repeatedly complained about violation of this treaty as herero women and girls were raped by germans a crime that the german authorities were reluctant to punish 20in 1890 kamahareros son samuel signed a great deal of land over to the germans in return for helping him to ascend to the ovaherero throne and to subsequently be established as paramount chief 21 german involvement in ethnic fighting ended in tenuous peace in 1894  citation needed in that year theodor leutwein became governor of the territory which underwent a period of rapid development while the german government sent the schutztruppe imperial colonial troops to pacify the region 22german colonial policy  editunder german colonial rule natives were routinely used as slave labourers and their lands were frequently confiscated and given to colonists who were encouraged to settle on land taken from the natives that land was stocked with cattle stolen from the herero and namas 23 19 34 50 149 24 25 8 22 26 27 28 147–149 185–186 209 causing a great deal of resentment over the next decade the land and the cattle that were essential to herero and nama lifestyles passed into the hands of german settlers arriving in south west africa 23 57revolts  editin 1903 some of the nama clans rose in revolt under the leadership of hendrik witbooi 22 a number of factors led the herero to join them in january 1904 one of the major issues was land rights the herero had already ceded over a quarter of their 130000 square kilometres 50000 sq mi to german colonists by 1903 23 60 before the otavi railway line running from the african coast to inland german settlements was completed 29 230 completion of this line would have made the german colonies much more accessible and would have ushered a new wave of europeans into the area 30 133historian horst drechsler states that there was discussion of the possibility of establishing and placing the herero in native reserves and that this was further proof of the german colonists sense of ownership over the land drechsler illustrates the gap between the rights of a european and an african the german colonial league held that in regards to legal matters the testimony of seven africans was equivalent to that of a colonist 30 132 133 bridgman writes about racial tensions underlying these developments the average german colonist viewed native africans as a lowly source of cheap labour and others welcomed their extermination 23 60a new policy on debt collection enforced in november 1903 also played a role in the uprising for many years the herero population had fallen in the habit of borrowing money from colonist traders at extreme interest rates for a long time much of this debt went uncollected and accumulated as most herero had no means to pay to correct this growing problem governor leutwein decreed with good intentions that all debts not paid within the next year would be voided 23 59 in the absence of hard cash traders often seized cattle or whatever objects of value they could get their hands on to recoup their loans as quickly as possible this fostered a feeling of resentment towards the germans on the part of the herero people which escalated to hopelessness when they saw that german officials were sympathetic to the traders who were about to lose what they were owed 23 60in 1903 the herero learned of a plan to divide their territory with a railway line and set up reservations where they would be concentrated this was also one of the reasons for the revolt 31the herero judged the situation intolerable and revolted in early 1904 killing between 123 and 150 germans including seven boers and three women 23 74 in what nils ole oermann calls a desperate surprise attack 32the timing of their attack was carefully planned after successfully asking a large herero clan to surrender their weapons governor leutwein was convinced that they and the rest of the native population were essentially pacified and so withdrew half of the german troops stationed in his colony 23 56 led by chief samuel maharero the herero surrounded okahandja and cut links  clarification needed to windhoek the colonial capital maharero then issued a manifesto in which he forbade his troops to kill any englishmen boers uninvolved peoples women and children in general or german missionaries 23 70leutwein was forced to request reinforcements and an experienced officer from the german government in berlin 33 604 lieutenantgeneral lothar von trotha was appointed supreme commander  german oberbefehlshaber of south west africa on 3 may 1904 arriving with an expeditionary force of 14000 troops on 11 june leutwein was subordinate to the colonial department of the prussian foreign office which reported to chancellor bernhard von bülow while general trotha reported to the military german general staff which was only subordinate to emperor wilhelm ii leutwein wanted to defeat the most determined herero rebels and negotiate a surrender with the remainder to achieve a political settlement 33 605 trotha however planned to crush the native resistance through military force he stated that my intimate knowledge of many central african nations bantu and others has everywhere convinced me of the necessity that the negro does not respect treaties but only brute force 17 173genocide  editgeneral trotha stated his proposed solution to end the resistance of the herero people in a letter before the battle of waterberg 34 11i believe that the nation as such should be annihilated or if this was not possible by tactical measures have to be expelled from the country  this will be possible if the waterholes from grootfontein to gobabis are occupied the constant movement of our troops will enable us to find the small groups of this nation who have moved backwards and destroy them gradually trothas troops defeated 3000–5000 herero combatants at the battle of waterberg on 11–12 august 1904 but were unable to encircle and annihilate the retreating survivors 33 605part of a series on

the main body of the fleeing force and pushed them further into the desert as exhausted herero fell to the ground unable to go on german soldiers acting on orders killed men women and children 35 22 jan cloete acting as a guide for the germans witnessed the atrocities committed by the german troops and deposed the following statement 30 157i was present when the herero were defeated in a battle in the vicinity of waterberg after the battle all men women and children who fell into german hands wounded or otherwise were mercilessly put to death then the germans set off in pursuit of the rest and all those found by the wayside and in the sandveld were shot down and bayoneted to death the mass of the herero men were unarmed and thus unable to offer resistance they were just trying to get away with their cattle a portion of the herero escaped the germans and went to the omaheke desert hoping to reach british territory of bechuanaland fewer than 1000 reached bechuanaland where they were granted asylum 36 to prevent them from returning trotha ordered the desert to be sealed off 37 german patrols later found skeletons around holes 13 metres 43 ft deep that had been dug in a vain attempt to find water some sources also state that the german colonial army systematically poisoned desert water wells 35 35 22 38 maherero and 500–1500 men crossed the kalahari into bechuanaland where he was accepted as a vassal of the batswana chief sekgoma 39on 2 october trotha issued a warning to the herero de 1 i the great general of the german soldiers send this letter to the herero the herero are german subjects no longer they have killed stolen cut off the ears and other parts of the body of wounded soldiers and now are too cowardly to want to fight any longer i announce to the people that whoever hands me one of the chiefs shall receive 1000 marks and 5000 marks for samuel maherero the herero nation must now leave the country if it refuses i shall compel it to do so with the long tube cannon any herero found inside the german frontier with or without a gun or cattle will be executed i shall spare neither women nor children i shall give the order to drive them away and fire on them such are my words to the herero people 42he further gave orders that this proclamation is to be read to the troops at rollcall with the addition that the unit that catches a captain will also receive the appropriate reward and that the shooting at women and children is to be understood as shooting above their heads so as to force them to run away i assume absolutely that this proclamation will result in taking no more male prisoners but will not degenerate into atrocities against women and children the latter will run away if one shoots at them a couple of times the troops will remain conscious of the good reputation of the german soldier 25 56trotha gave orders that captured herero males were to be executed while women and children were to be driven into the desert where their death from starvation and thirst was to be certain trotha argued that there was no need to make exceptions for herero women and children since these would infect german troops with their diseases the insurrection trotha explained is and remains the beginning of a racial struggle 33 605 regardless german soldiers regularly raped young herero women before killing them or letting them die in the desert 43 272 after the war trotha argued that his orders were necessary writing in 1909 that if i had made the small water holes accessible to the womenfolk i would run the risk of an african catastrophe comparable to the battle of beresonia  35 22the german general staff was aware of the atrocities that were taking place its official publication named der kampf noted that this bold enterprise shows up in the most brilliant light the ruthless energy of the german command in pursuing their beaten enemy no pains no sacrifices were spared in eliminating the last remnants of enemy resistance like a wounded beast the enemy was tracked down from one waterhole to the next until finally he became the victim of his own environment the arid omaheke desert was to complete what the german army had begun the extermination of the herero nation 44 45alfred von schlieffen chief of the imperial german general staff approved of trothas intentions in terms of a racial struggle and the need to wipe out the entire nation or to drive them out of the country but had doubts about his strategy preferring their surrender 46governor leutwein later relieved of his duties complained to chancellor von bülow about trothas actions seeing the generals orders as intruding upon the civilian colonial jurisdiction and ruining any chance of a political settlement 33 606 according to professor mahmood mamdani from columbia university opposition to the policy of annihilation was largely the consequence of the fact that colonial officials looked at the herero people as a potential source of labour and thus economically important 34 12 for instance governor leutwein wrote that i do not concur with those fanatics who want to see the herero destroyed altogether  i would consider such a move a grave mistake from an economic point of view we need the herero as cattle breeders  and especially as labourers 17 169having no authority over the military chancellor bülow could only advise emperor wilhelm ii that trothas actions were contrary to christian and humanitarian principle economically devastating and damaging to germanys international reputation 33 606 upon the arrival of new orders at the end of 1904 prisoners were herded into concentration camps where they were given to private companies as slave labourers or exploited as human guinea pigs in medical experiments 5

through his majestys stationery office in 1926 except for archive copies it was withdrawn and destroyed following a decision of the then legislative assembly 48 49survivors of the massacre the majority of whom were women and children were eventually put in places like shark island concentration camp where the german authorities forced them to work as slave labour for german military and settlers all prisoners were categorised into groups fit and unfit for work and preprinted death certificates indicating death by exhaustion following privation were issued 50 the british government published their wellknown account of the german genocide of the nama and herero peoples in 1918 51many herero died later of disease exhaustion and malnutrition 52 53 estimates of the mortality rate at the camps are between 45 54 55 and 74 28 196–216 54 55food in the camps was extremely scarce consisting of rice with no additions 56 92 as the prisoners lacked pots and the rice they received was uncooked it was indigestible horses and oxen that died in the camp were later distributed to the inmates as food 25 75 dysentery and lung diseases were common 25 76 despite those conditions the herero were taken outside the camp every day for labour under harsh treatment by the german guards while the sick were left without any medical assistance or nursing care 25 76shootings hangings beatings and other harsh treatment of the forced labourers including use of sjamboks were common 25 76 57 a 28 september 1905 article in the south african newspaper cape argus detailed some of the abuse with the heading in german s w africa further startling allegations horrible cruelty in an interview with percival griffith an accountant of profession who owing to hard times took up on transport work at angra pequena lüderitz  related his experiences there are hundreds of them mostly women and children and a few old men  when they fall they are sjamboked by the soldiers in charge of the gang with full force until they get up  on one occasion i saw a woman carrying a child of under a year old slung at her back and with a heavy sack of grain on her head  she fell the corporal sjamboked her for certainly more than four minutes and sjamboked the baby as well  the woman struggled slowly to her feet and went on with her load she did not utter a sound the whole time but the baby cried very hard 58during the war a number of people from the cape in modernday south africa sought employment as transport riders for german troops in namibia upon their return to the cape some of these people recounted their stories including those of the imprisonment and genocide of the herero and nama people fred cornell a british aspirant diamond prospector was in lüderitz when the shark island concentration camp was being used cornell wrote of the camp cold  for the nights are often bitterly cold there  hunger thirst exposure disease and madness claimed scores of victims every day and cartloads of their bodies were every day carted over to the back beach buried in a few inches of sand at low tide and as the tide came in the bodies went out food for the sharks 58shark island was the worst of the german south west african camps 59 lüderitz lies in southern namibia flanked by desert and ocean in the harbour lies shark island which then was connected to the mainland only by a small causeway the island is now as it was then barren and characterised by solid rock carved into surreal formations by the hard ocean winds the camp was placed on the far end of the relatively small island where the prisoners would have suffered complete exposure to the strong winds that sweep lüderitz for most of the year german commander von estorff wrote in a report that approximately 1700 prisoners including 1203 nama had died by april 1907 in december 1906 four months after their arrival 291 nama died a rate of more than nine people per day missionary reports put the death rate at 12–18 per day as many as 80 of the prisoners sent to shark island eventually died there 58there are accusations of herero women being coerced into sex slavery as a means of survival 34 12 60trotha was opposed to contact between natives and settlers believing that the insurrection was the beginning of a racial struggle and fearing that the colonists would be infected by native diseases 33 606benjamin madley argues that although shark island is referred to as a concentration camp it functioned as an extermination camp or death camp 61 62 63medical experiments and scientific racism  editfurther information nazi eugenics racial hygiene scientific racism and craniometry prisoners were used for medical experiments and their illnesses or their recoveries from them were used for research 64experiments on live prisoners were performed by dr bofinger who injected herero that were suffering from scurvy with various substances including arsenic and opium afterwards he researched the effects of these substances via autopsy 16 225experimentation with the dead body parts of the prisoners was rife zoologist leonhard schultze 18721955 65  better source needed noted taking body parts from fresh native corpses which according to him was a welcome addition and he also noted that he could use prisoners for that purpose 66an estimated 300 skulls 67 were sent to germany for experimentation in part from concentration camp prisoners 68 in october 2011 after 3 years of talks the first 20 of an estimated 300 skulls stored in the museum of the charité were returned to namibia for burial 69 70 in 2014 14 additional skulls were repatriated by the university of freiburg 71number of victims  edita census conducted in 1905 revealed that 25000 herero remained in german south west africa 29according to the whitaker report the population of 80000 herero was reduced to 15000 starving refugees between 1904 and 1907 72 in colonial genocide and reparations claims in the 21st

banned from owning land or cattle a necessity for pastoral society 56 89about 19000 german troops were engaged in the conflict of which 3000 saw combat the rest were used for upkeep and administration the german losses were 676 soldiers killed in combat 76 missing and 689 dead from disease 25 88 the reiterdenkmal english equestrian monument in windhoek was erected in 1912 to celebrate the victory and to remember the fallen germans with no mention of the killed indigenous population it remains a bone of contention in independent namibia 75the campaign had cost germany 600 million marks the normal annual subsidy to the colony was 145 million marks 25 88 76 in 1908 diamonds were discovered in the territory and this did much to boost its prosperity though it was shortlived 29 230in 1915 at the start of world war i the german colony was taken over and occupied in the south west africa campaign by the union of south africa acting on behalf of the british imperial government south africa received a league of nations mandate over south west africa in 1919 under the treaty of versailles recognition  editin 1985 the united nations whitaker report classified the massacres as an attempt to exterminate the herero and nama peoples of south west africa and therefore one of the earliest cases of genocide in the 20th century 77in 1998 german president roman herzog visited namibia and met herero leaders chief munjuku nguvauva demanded a public apology and compensation herzog expressed regret but stopped short of an apology he pointed out that international law requiring reparation did not exist in 1907 but he undertook to take the herero petition back to the german government 78the herero filed a lawsuit in the united states in 2001 demanding reparations from the german government and deutsche bank which financed the german government and companies in southern africa 79 80 with a complaint filed with the united states district court for the southern district of new york in january 2017 descendants of the herero and nama people sued germany for damages in the united states the plaintiffs sued under the alien tort statute a 1789 u s law often invoked in human rights cases their proposed classaction lawsuit sought unspecified sums for thousands of descendants of the victims for the incalculable damages that were caused 81on 16 august 2004 at the 100th anniversary of the start of the genocide a member of the german government heidemarie wieczorekzeul germanys minister for economic development and cooperation officially apologised and expressed grief about the genocide declaring in a speech that we germans accept our historical and moral responsibility and the guilt incurred by germans at that time 82she ruled out paying special compensations but promised continued economic aid for namibia which currently amounts to 14m a year 13the trotha family travelled to omaruru in october 2007 by invitation of the royal herero chiefs and publicly apologised for the actions of their relative wolfthilo von trotha saidwe the von trotha family are deeply ashamed of the terrible events that took place 100 years ago human rights were grossly abused that time 83to date the debate regarding the genocide committed by german soldiers in namibia continues herero and nama organisations have brought a suit against germany with a new york court suing for recognition of the genocide legal proceedings began in march 2017 84repatriation  editpeter katjavivi a former namibian ambassador to germany demanded in august 2008 that the skulls of herero and nama prisoners of the 1904–08 uprising which were taken to germany for scientific research to prove the superiority of white europeans over africans be returned to namibia katjavivi was reacting to a german television

editsee also armenian quote and genocide studies the herero genocide has commanded the attention of historians who study complex issues of continuity between the herero genocide and the holocaust 90 it is argued that the herero genocide set a precedent in imperial germany that would later be followed by nazi germany s establishment of death camps 91 92according to benjamin madley the german experience in south west africa was a crucial precursor to nazi colonialism and genocide he argues that personal connections literature and public debates served as conduits for communicating colonialist and genocidal ideas and methods from the colony to germany 93 tony barta an honorary research associate at la trobe university argues that the herero genocide was an inspiration for hitler in his war against the jews slavs gypsies and others described as nonaryans 94according to clarence lusane eugen fischer s medical experiments can be seen as a testing ground for later medical procedures used during the nazi holocaust 54 fischer later became chancellor of the university of berlin where he taught medicine to nazi physicians otmar freiherr von verschuer was a student of fischer verschuer himself had a prominent pupil josef mengele 95 96 franz ritter von epp who was later responsible for the liquidation of virtually all bavarian jews and roma  dubious – discuss as governor of bavaria took part in the herero genocide as well 97mahmood mamdani argues that the links between the holocaust and the herero genocide are beyond the execution of an annihilation policy and the establishment of concentration camps and that there are ideological similarities in the conduct of both genocides focusing on a written statement by general trotha translated as i destroy the african tribes with streams of blood  only following this cleansing can something new emerge which will remain 17 174mamdani takes note of the similarity between the aims of the general and the nazis according to mamdani in both cases there was a social darwinist notion of cleansing after which something new would emerge 34 12see also  edithuman rights portal namibia portal germany portal
