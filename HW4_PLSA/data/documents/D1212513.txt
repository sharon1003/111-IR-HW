1000amthank you for reporting this comment undozl700no easy answer all are wound differently depending on desired output at different loads and rpms the average 60a could be about 1400 to 2000 rpm at shaft to achieve 50 rated output which on average consumes 34 hp like save february 17 2009 at 1005amthank you for reporting this comment undoihatenoise like what if i put it on a pedal bike saw something like it on tv but they never went into details about it like save february 17 2009 at 115pmthank you for reporting this comment undogarymunson2008hmmm sound like youre expecting to get 2530 amps off a bicyclenot going to happen you need between 1215 hp to get 2530 amps from a 110 volt generator rpms are not the only issuewhen you talk amps you should really talk watts as that is the true measure of power watts  amps x volts also when you say alternator are you thinking of using an automobile alternator those can provide 30 amps but at 12 volts 110 the power of 30 amps in your house at 120 volts in addition the automotive unit includes diodes that rectify the ac to dc dc isnt too handy especially at 12 volts like save february 19 2009 at 558amthank you for reporting this comment undopjb999nonsense for anything pedal powered you will need to make dc because youll need a battery arrangement to bufferfilter it if you were looking at a direct generation to ac you would have to keep up a steady speed not very practical there may be special alternators built now for alternate power generation but i would think the vast majority are just repurposed automotive ones looking at it roughly most car engines idle around 750rpm or so and idling is not considered adequate to charge a battery with the load of ignition accessories etc although i guess a car should be able to run at idle indefinitely but there would be little or no current left over to charge the battery a pedal arrangement is not going to be driving much else so 750rpm is not looking quite so bad i dont know what the op is looking at doing but say heshe wants to exercise whilst watching tv and wants an incentive to do so  ive always thought thisd be the perfect system as youd need to charge your battery in order to watch either use a 12v tv or a decent inverter that would connect to the battery again the battery operates as a buffer looking at a car and most pulley arrangements the driving pulley on the engine is a fair bit larger than the pulley on the alternator which means the alternator gets more rpms of course at the cost to the engine of more hp needed no free lunchive attached a spec sheet for bosch alternators just the first thing i came across again dont know what the original poster wants to do i think youd be pedalling pretty hard and youd need an arrangement with a flywheel to smooth out the rpms i guess looks like youd need to be pedalling pretty hard but depending on what you want to do its possible i guess if youre looking at some sort of offgrid application it could only be a supplement unless youre talking about charging a cellphone or laptop or something the best sorts of alternative energy setups that i know of are a bit diversified for stability ie a mixture of wind and solar if possible a bike could be a possibility but itd be like chopping wood  it warms you at least twice here is a link that might be useful bosch alternators like save february 19 2009 at 1211pmthank you for reporting this comment undogarymunson2008pjb i was looking at both his posts where he mentioned 2530 amps and the bicycle idea those together dont work my point was the bike wasnt going to provide the power he seemed to be looking for it takes a lot of work to turn a generatoralternator connected to a load true you can use the bike to charge a battery then use an inverter but you are still talking about a very small amount of generated power right now any alternative source is still trumped by increasing how efficiently you use energyyou never realize how cheap the power company is providing power until you try to make it yourself like save february 20 2009 at 506amthank you for reporting this comment undopjb999that is very true and i guess the major reason

watts of power when turning ac generators at 110v at 30 amps this is  11030746442 hp but this is only the power you put in to get out one thing people forget is the amount of power needed to get up to the 3600 rpms needed to get 60hz 36006060hz a average 5kw will need about 10 hp to keep up with loads and rpms 500074667hp  it takes about 12hp just to turn a generator at the speed of 3600 rpms the

bythebook math in the real world youll need a 1215hp motor to provide a usable 30 amps since that 30 amp load is going to also need some more ummph to get whatever it is going there is so much efficiency lost in all the converting whether from gas engine to electric output or 12 volts dc from an alternator one conversion there already to an inverter to provide 110ac again most activity directed at alternate energy would be put to better use tweaking the final loads efficiency we need a real breakthru such as eestor or nano solar before the alternate energy scenario becomes really cost effective irritates me so seeing reporting on some yahoo spending 100k and having an energy hog house completely offline why he could have spent a fraction of that on practical efficiencyboosting strategies and paid the remaing power bill on just the interest of the money he had left like save may 25 2009 at 300amthank you for reporting this comment undoseeklfnyahoocomi know for a fact that if

you for reporting this comment undodoug9694on the average the alternator runs two to three times faster then the engine if you notice that the lights dim when idling then you need a little more rpm to get the alternator to charge above the battery voltage about 135 volts the average alternator is now between 1300 to 2100 rpm i set up an old 35 amp alternator to run off a 13 hp 1750 rpm washing machine motor at a 11 belt ratio using the stock regulator would stall the 13hp motor i put a large adjustable resister on the field connection of the alternator the output was adjusted by the field resister so the motor would start charging a low battery and not get too hot this was about 20 amps in my case a human can only put out about 14 hp so that would be about 14 amp how long could the average humane do this i would guess about 5 minuets 135v x 14 amp  189 watts or about 14 hp like save july 20 2013 at 205pmthank you for reporting this comment undo siddanth chikmath if i connect the
