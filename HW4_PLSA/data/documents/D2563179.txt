three major revisions in february 1891 awards with swords were authorized to distinguish wartime awards whether for bravery or military merit from peacetime awards 3 this was made retroactive for wartime awards from the austroprussian war of 1866 and francoprussian war of 187071 in 1905 the statutes of the military merit order were revised and the military merit cross was divided into two classes 4 the former military merit cross became the military merit cross 1st class and a new second class was created which had no enamel on the medallion the distinction in classes was based on the rank of the recipient in 1913 another revision of the statutes of the military merit order divided the military merit cross into three classes the old nonenameled 2nd class became the 3rd class and was changed from silver to bronze the old 1st class became the 2nd class the new 1st class was identical to the 2nd class except that it was gilt rather than silver in addition all classes were authorized to be awarded with a crown the crown could be used for a second award to an nco or soldier who already had received a particular class and whose rank precluded award of a higher class or to recognize greater merit there were then effectively 12 combinations 3 classes each with or without crown and each with or without swords this doubled when one takes into account that there were two possible ribbons one for soldiers and one for officials  beamtenband  world war i broke out the following year and the military merit cross became bavarias main decoration for bravery and merit by
