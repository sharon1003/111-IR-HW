back together again suggests that something or someone in your current life that is bringing out similar feelings you felt during the relationship with your ex the dream may be a way of alerting you to the same or similar behavior in a current relationship what you learn from that previous relationship may need to be applied to the present one so that you do no repeat the same mistake alternatively past lovers often highlight the positive experiences you had with that person it could also signify aspects of yourself that you have xd out or neglected to dream that you are making out with your ex signifies your acceptance of certain characteristics of your ex the dream does not necessarily mean that you want to get back together with him or her consider what were the things you

still engaged in thinking about him the strong emotional attachment you hate him also adds fuel to the fire the true opposite of love is apathy not hate so in some ways you still have feelings for him hate is a feeling and though you might never go back with him you do need to find an outlet for these feelings talking with someone might be a good way to fix this problem good luck and i am glad your

search on this site httpsshorturlimaxt ju you can be remarry to another person but that doesnt mean that inside of your heart there is regret and pain that things never got resolved between you two you must of loved him enough to marry him so there is deep concern within yourself that when the two of you walked away from each other there was no fixing the marriage that was a commitment that you made too each other you made a promise unto god to love each other for better or for worse for the rest of your life it isnt something you keep repeatingyour wedding vows when you walk away from a marriage you have alot of unresolved issues and when you both didnt work it out with each other it caused alot of hurt inside of youdespite the fact you get along it still a broken relationship that ended in a heart breaking way that is why divorce is very painful unresolved hurt and pain whatever happened in your marriage i think that unresolved issues and hurt in the marriage has caused you to dream about him there is alot that happens when you are divorce i too am divorced and there is alot of resentment and pain that a divorces will cause i think when you see your ex i take it you see him sometimes so maybe that is why you are dreaming about him since you said you and your ex are friendly and we dont fight or argue it is just making you think of what could of been if you and him would of worked it out usually when we dream and from my experience if you are dreaming about someone in your life at one time that was important to you it trying to tell you something at this point since you are married to someone else there isnt much you can do except dont hold unto unforgiveness and bitterness from the marriage you think you let things go but if you have you wouldnt be dreaming about him for your subconscience mind is letting you know something is wrong the fact you still dream about your exhusband when both of you decided not to work it out between you two it is a very painful thing you are breaking a holy bond this isnt just a boyfriend and girlfriend relationship this was a marriage even though you fought alot in your marriage maybe you are holding unto regret that it could of worked out but now both of you made the choice to go your seperate ways you could say sorry to each other for whatever happen but you are married to another person so ask the lord jesus for his guidance and his will about this your past marriage the lord jesus is real and you can call his name out any time i think you even say lord jesus if you are real then send someone who can answer this question for you any marriage that ends in divorce is very painful no matter how good of friends you are with him that you are friendly with him seek god in prayer about it i hope that i answered your question about what has been going on when you married again you still have unresolved issues and hurts from the previous marriage it doesnt have to always show up right away how you feel because you met your second husband you hide your pain and certain things can have away of showing up again in your life from your past marriage all you can do is forgive say sorry to him and him to you if that is what needed anne · 2 years ago27 0 comment hard to sayyou dont say what the dreams are about or what role your exhusband plays in them the reverend soleil · 1 decade ago1 0 comment i did that too for a long while i guess as time went on i really got over him when he had no more influence on me i really let go i didnt miss him i just had so many worries in the back of my mind that i guess he kept popping up as i built up my career and stopped counting and depending on him thoughts about him vanished pia · 1 decade ago1 1 comment1 2 3 next
