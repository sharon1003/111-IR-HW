process intaglio etching acid zinc plate design create a precise rendering the same scale as the print 6”x9” plate select metal zinc is a good student grade copper is used as a studio grade if you are using the commercial ground on your plate skip to 9degrease plate clean metal of oil film with ammonia water or commercial metal cleaner if water continues to bead the metal needs further cleaning water should sheet off the plate avoid touching plate with fingers warm up plate optional place the plate onto a hot plate and get it warm minimum of one minute on low temperature coat plate with ground acidresistant substance hard grounds hold fine linear work without chipping or flaking from the surface the plate should be sitting diagonally with a soft brush apply liquid hard ground across the plate beginning at the top think of applying wash to a watercolor a brayer may be used the ground asphaltum should appear brown if it appears black it is too thick and tan will not withhold multiple runs false biting takes place if pinholes appear on the plate warm up again optional heating the plate after the liquid hard ground has been applied will help soften and even out the coating allow cooling before printing smoke the plate optional to make the ground darker so the exposed metal is more visible you may smoke the ground let the flame not the wick dance on the surface of the ground as the carbon mixes with the ground it hardens slightly transfer drawing you may use a projector white chalk on the back of your sketch on tracing paper works well for transfer you may run it through the press or burnish with a wooden spoon black or white carbon paper can be used facedown and traced from the back with a pencil red conté or white chalk on a thin paper also works well draw with needle draw on the ground with an etching needle well rounded and not too sharp exposing the metal stippling and hatching with needle and various mezzotint tools create variations of tone use light but sufficient pressure a pencil may be used 6h open bite remove larger areas with a qtip and turpentine block out the sides and the back with ground the acid bath fumes from most acids are dangerous flush with water if an accident occurs when mixing always pour the acid into the water wear polyurethane gloves an acid bath can be used several times for the same type of metal but separate baths must be made for each metal nitric acid turns brilliant bluegreen after etching copper or brass and a cloudy gray after etching zinc the mordants most commonly used for etching copper zinc steel and other metal plates are ferric chloride most safe nitric acid and the dutch mordant if using the ferric chloride bath face the plate upside down on small pieces of wood about ¼ from the bottom allowing the iron oxide to fall to the bottom of the bath the nitric acid is mixed at 15th ratio with water use a baumé hydrometer to find the solution strength in saturated form it comes in 45 degrees baumé adding water reduces the density of the fluid dry crystals are also available lower plate into bath the plate should be lowered into the acid bath with a stick or a piece of polyester string at the very least do not drop rather lay gently the plate in the bath splashing issue the plate is placed into the acid bath so the drawn areas are exposed by the needle are etched out the length of time in the acid and the strength of the solution determine both the width and the depth of the line a line bitten slowly in a weak acid will be much sharper than one bitten for a short time in strong acid wipe away bubbles with a feather during the bite examine the plate during printing to check the depth of bite the plate may occasionally have to be dipped into a 20 acetic acid bath to remove any residue optional use stopping out method by applying stopout varnish or liquid ground the lightest lines are stopped out after a brief time in the etching bath then in successive stages the other lines are covered until the stopping out is completed use a good brush with a fine point remove plate and rinse under water faucet clean off ground the remaining ground is removed with solvent and the plate prepared for printing oil based clean procedure polish plate with a charcoal block jeweler’s rouge or liquid metal polish and a soft cloth crocus cloth to ensure an even printing of surface bevel edges file the rough and sharp edges after the acid bath steel wool removes file marks from edge of plate sharp edges will cut your print fill in ink with dauber rolled felt and scrape off extra with a piece of cardboard use tissue to finish wiping remember to wipe the edges clean handsthe paper must dampen without falling apart and must pick up the finest detail on the plate rag paperseither handmade or mold madeare traditional for intaglio printing they have longer fibers than the cheaper woodpulp papers as well as low sizing content goodquality paper is made of recycled or new cotton fibers select from the following american etching archestest or cover stock copper plate deluxe german etching italia lenox 100 murillo riveslightweight heavyweight bfk cover strathmore etching j barcham green ink good ink is buttery heavily pigmented and neither too coarsely nor too finely ground graphic chemical and ink company makes good ink ink is applied with a roller a dauber or a card made from mat board push the ink into all the lines and crevices of the plate a roller works well avoid excessive rubbing and pressure get three or four pads of tarlatan ready wash the starch out of the tarlatan first consider plate tone as you wipe you may use newsprint or pages from an old telephone book clean hands dampen paper with sponger or dip in water bath and use blotter paper heavyweight paper will need considerable more water than a thinner one place paper in water and place under weight print after making sure that the edges of the plate have been wiped cleanlay paper towels on press put inked plate face up on towels newspaper will leave image use some paper tabs to pick up the damp printing paper and place it on the plate lay damp paper on top of inked plate use a sheet of registration paper under the plate if print is large or if using multiple plates only run a print through the press one time allow print to dry for a few days on drying rack print must never stay on drying rack more then one week add dry point andor engraving afterwards flatten paper under weight for a day note wateretch® acidless plates are an acid free option they are light sensitive plastic coated plates with a steel backing the photopolymer emulsion is biodegradable and can be etched with light other project etching copper use pcb etching solution from radio shack
