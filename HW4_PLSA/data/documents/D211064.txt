informationfableticscom11 august 2015 member id 77077701 i contacted fabletics to cancel my membership after realising it deducted monthly payments off my credit card i am aware the initial confusion is my own fault for assuming it was a onceoff purchase after i contacted them asking for the easiest way to cancel my membership someone responded asking me to call a phone number as it can not be processed via email i called the phone number on my mobile optus server and my work landline telstra server and both were unable to connect to the phone number with the message saying this number is incomplete or incorrect i emailed again saying i was unable to get through and asked if there was any way it could be resolved via email they responded saying the phone lines are working in australia contact your carrier i contacted both optus and telstra who both said there was nothing they could do and it had nothing to do with the carrier i emailed again saying there was absolutely no way i was able to contact them via telephone and they would have to come up with another option regarding canceling via email i said i didnt understand why something can be done via telephone and not email in this day and age they responded telling me to call the number please refer to emails 11 august 2015 first email from emilie hi there i would like to cancel my membership please let me know the easiest

the exact same problem apparently the number is incorrect and i tried calling about 20 times from both my mobile and landline honestly starting to believe that my life will now have to be controlled by this website ill have to make sure i skip every single month since they are giving numbers that dont work work of a scam artist in my opinion they are clearly taking advantage of the fact that nobody reads the terms and conditions and just agrees to them as people do a lot of shopping online but they never have to face such a ridiculous commitment to an online shopreply13th of feb 2016 by ep e pumba 1 votes hi all you need to remove the 61 and dial 1800 668 512 i called and finally someone answered they said that they are open 9am9pm australian time i asked them to cancel my membership and they did i had to force them to refund my money as it will cost us aussies 75 not 4999 and they said they will refund it to my bank account in 34 working days i really hope that they will because if not i will loose it and take this further i have never heard of an online shop that membership have to pay their clothing isnt that great anyway i would rather pay more and realised that i am not being ripped offreply13th of jun 2016 by me melanie stengewis 0 votes i cant get thru either with the 61 or without it   i have no idea what to do next reply13th of jun 2016 by me melanie stengewis 0
