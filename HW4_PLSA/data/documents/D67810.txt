the gmc terrain shares many mechanical components with the equinox including the same drivetrain and platform they both have meager acceleration but ride quality is smooth just like the equinox the terrain has android auto apple car play a wifi hot spot and a touchscreen infotainment system gmc is an upscale suv and truck brand of general motors with this you can expect their models to be classier and cost more than chevy models if you want a more luxurious vehicle go for the terrain otherwise the equinox is a fine pick which is better chevrolet equinox or ford escape the ford escape and equinox sit near the top of the compact suv class but the ford is the slightly better vehicle the escapes base engine wont blow your socks off but it doesnt suffer from the slow acceleration as the base equinox both models have two optional engines but each is slightly different the escape offers two powerful turbocharged gas engines and the equinox is available with a turbocharged gas engine and a turbodiesel engine the equinox has better fuel economy estimates but the escape has sportier handling and wide comfortable front seats both models cost about the same but the escape has extra cargo room for a few more grocery or shopping bags that said the equinox comes with a standard touchscreen infotainment system with smartphone integration which is better chevrolet equinox or honda crv the honda crv is the epitome of what a compact crossover should be and its a superior choice to the equinox the chevy has good passenger space but models with a sunroof come up short on rearseat headroom thats not the case in the honda the crv has one of the most spacious cabins in the class compared to the equinox it has 10 more cubic feet of cargo space despite the fact that the equinoxs cabin was updated for 2018 the crv has a much nicer interior it was redesigned for 2017 the crv’s cabin is filled with softtouch materials and higher trims have woodgrain accents making it well worth the extra 500 dollars compare the equinox terrain and escape »equinox interior how many people does the equinox seat the redesigned 2018 chevy equinox seats five the redesigned seats are adequate but not as comfortable as those in the outgoing model the standard front seats only offer a handful of manual adjustments though they remain supportive and snug through corners cloth seating is standard but the optional leather upholstery is cozier you can also opt for eightway poweradjustable front seats that make it easier to find an ideal seating position most passengers should find enough head or legroom wherever they sit though an optional sunroof takes away a couple valuable inches of headroom in the back seat making it tight for tall passengers equinox and car seats the equinox has two complete sets of latch carseat connectors in its second row and a top tether anchor to use for the middle seat the system hasn’t been evaluated yet for its ease of use equinox interior quality in redesigning the equinox chevy took cues from some of its most popular models like the malibu and cruze for the interior lowerend trims feature ample amounts of plastic surfaces but they feel high quality especially compared to the previous generation higher trim equinox models feature softtouch surfaces – like vinyl covering on the dash – throughout the cabin equinox cargo space the chevy equinox has 299 cubic feet of cargo space which you can expand to 635 cubic feet by collapsing the splitfolding rear seats those values are down slightly from the previous generation the second row folds nearly flat and opens up a wide and convenient area there are also hidden spots for storage under the trunk floor a power liftgate is optional and so is a handsfree power liftgate while the equinox has enough storage space for daily use rival compact suvs offer more the honda crv has the largest cargo hold in the segment with 392 cubic feet and a maximum of 758 cubic feet the ford escape offers 34 cubic feet of space which doubles when you fold the seats equinox infotainment bluetooth and navigation like many other gm models the 2018 equinox stands out for its wealth of standard tech features even in the base equinox you’ll get a 7inch touchscreen infotainment system with android auto and apple car play which allow you to connect your smartphone to infotainment system and access things like apps contacts media and texts directly on the touch screen in a layout similar to that of your phone rivals like the ford escape and honda crv don’t come standard with a touch screen

your passengers can keep all your devices juiced read more about interior »equinox performance equinox engine weak base engine but theres more the 2018 equinox comes with a turbocharged 15liter fourcylinder engine that produces 170 horsepower thats actually a downgrade from the 2017 model and its 182horsepower 24liter engine a sixspeed automatic transmission is also standard the base engine delivers sufficient power but the transmission will likely hamper your driving experience with its slow shifts push the pedal and the throttle can be slow to respond the sixspeed also tends to jump into higher gears quickly stifling spry acceleration however the transmission works well at higher speeds two additional engines are available theres a more powerful turbocharged 20liter engine that produces 252 horsepower a fuelefficient 16liter turbodiesel engine with 138 horsepower is also available the 2017 equinox was one of the few small suvs with an available v6 engine chevy axed that big power plant for the redesigned equinox and is focusing on other smalldisplacement turbocharged engines a 137horsepower 16liter turbodiesel engine will be available at a later date as will a turbocharged 20liter fourcylinder that produces 252 horsepower the 20liter engine will feature a new ninespeed automatic transmission equinox gas mileage better than most according to the epa the base 2018 equinox gets 26 mpg in the city and 32 mpg on the highway which are good estimates for the class going with optional allwheel drive reduces those estimates to 2430 mpg cityhighway the 20liter engine gets 2229 mpg cityhighway and the turbodiesel gets 2839 mpg cityhighway like the equinox the honda crv gets great mileage for the class 28 mpgcity and 34 mpghighway the ford escape on the other hand performs worse at just 21 mpgcity and 29 mpghighway equinox ride and handling smooth and stable the 2018 equinox isnt exactly sporty but its ride hits all the right marks for a compact suv over rough pavement or jarring bumps in the road the equinox rides comfortably the cabin also stays quiet and serene when driving even at highway speeds with its precise steering its easy to pilot the equinox through curvy roads or around turns and it exhibits much less body roll than you might expect from an suv equinox towing capacity if you plan to do any light towing choose the equinox with the 20liter turbo engine it offers the most torque 260 poundfeet of the threeengine lineup and a towing capacity of 3500 pounds thats the same maximum amount as the ford escape and should be enough to tow a small motorboat a couple of jet skis or a smaller camping trailer read more about performance »equinox reliability is the chevrolet equinox reliable there arent any predicted reliability ratings
