1 my vacuum pump runs but i cannot get a vacuum the coupler between the shaft of the pump and the shaft of the motor is either broken or slipping make sure the set screws are tight on the flats of the two shafts back to top2 why is it so important to change the oil often in my vacuum pump the proper oil in a vacuum pump acts as a blotter and absorbs all of the moisture and noncondensables as the oil becomes saturated with these contaminants the efficiency of the pump is dramatically reduced maintaining clean oil in the pump ensures that the pump will operate at peak efficiency and prolong its life back to top3 can i use any oil in my vacuum pump no jb black gold oil is extremely pure and nondetergent black gold is hydro processed which means it goes through a series of catalytic steps rendering the oil extremely refined more viscous and more stable the result is a clear mineral oil that will alert you to contamination sooner as it becomes cloudy or milky back to top4 why is it important to change my oil when the pump is hot as the pump cools the moisture and contaminates start to separate in the pump and when drained the contaminants cling to the walls of the pump when you refill the pump with new oil those contaminants will mix in with the new oil as the pump warms up resulting in the new oil quickly becoming contaminated back to top5 if i am always pulling a vacuum on clean dry systems is there a way to check my oil in the pump to see if it is contaminated and not have to change it so frequently it is recommended that a micron gauge be attached directly to the pump and should pull to 50 microns or lower if the oil is clean if the micron gauge does not pull to 50 microns it is an indication that the oil is becoming contaminnated and should be changed back to top6 other than pulling air out of the system how does my vacuum pump get rid of the moisture in the system most two stage vacuum pumps will go low enough in vacuum and reduce the atmospheric pressure within the system thus allowing boiling of the moisture at a lower temperature once the moisture is in a vapor form it is readily removed by the pump back to top7 what is a gas ballast and how do i use it on the initial pull of vacuum on a system the gas ballast is open allowing the initial volume of air in the system to bypass the oil so as to not contaminate the oil immediately when the pump starts to quiet down close the gas ballast and the pump will start reducing atmospheric pressure in the system to boil the moisture and noncondensables back to top8 what is a blankoff valve the blankoff valve acts no different than a water valve open it and with the pump running you will get your desired vacuum close it and with the pump running there is no vacuum back to top9 if i use a larger cfm pump will i be able to pull a vacuum on a system faster in most cases no using a vacuum pump on air conditioning systems from 1 ton to 10 tons you will not see the difference between a 3 cfm pump and a 10 cfm pump for example if you put a pump on a system and you notice within 2 minutes the pump quiets down and you cannot really feel any air leaving the exhaust this means that there is no more cfm left in the system and you are now working with molecules thus at this point if you replaced a 3 cfm pump with a 10 cfm pump there is no change in vacuum or time back to top10 what is a micron there are 25400 microns in an inch therefore with a compound gauge reading 0 inches to 30 inches there are 762000 microns back to top11 i have been using my low side gauge to pull a vacuum is this wrong yes the low side gauge knows only atmospheric pressure and cannot sense moisture or noncondensables a micron gauge is a heat sensing device that not only reads atmospheric pressure but also measures the gases created by the vacuum pump as it boils the moisture for example if you were to pull a vacuum on an enclosed bottle of water the low side gauge when pulling a vacuum will read a perfect vacuum using a micron gauge it will immediately tell you with a high reading the you have a problem in you system back to top12 i have been pulling a vacuum on my system using a micron gauge and cannot get it down to a low reading see faq 1 another possibility is that some oil may have entered the micron gauge and is giving false readings the remedy is to pour regular rubbing alcohol into the connector on the micron gauge shake and pour out do not use a qtip rag or any other material  use the liquid alcohol only do this about three times then try to pull a vacuum with the gauge back to top13 i am able to pull a vacuum on my system but when i blankoff the micron gauge rises rapidly unless you are using jbs dv29 copper tubing or flexible metal hoses it is not recommended to use your existing manifold and hoses for blankingoff a system to check for leaks hoses work very well under high pressure vacuum is very critical in leaks more so than pressure all charging hoses including the black hoses 14 or 38 permeate where the crimp is on the brass to the hose also has possible leak issues and the gasket at the coupler is a major leak offender the vacuum industry uses orings on most couplers when you screw down on a gasket it goes into many contortions and will not seal when using an oring you screw down on it to get a metal to metal seat and the oring lies around the lip of the flare giving it a positive seal back to top14 can i mount my micron gauge onto the vacuum pump it is not recommended to do so as you are reading what the pump is doing and not what the pump is doing to the system see dv29 it is suggested that you tee off on the suction side of the system and mount the gauge there back to top15 how low of a vacuum should we pull on a system jb recommends that a system be pulled to at least 250 microns and held at least five minutes on any polyester oils in a system it is recommended to pull a much lower vacuum as moisture is very difficult to remove even with heat and vacuum back to top16 why does the micron gauge slowly fall back and then start to hold after pulling a vacuum and blankingoff the reason for this is there is equalization within the system if you pull a vacuum lower it will then fall back at a shorter range and hold back to top17 why do i need to check the oil level when the pump is running the reason for this is that if the vacuum is not broken before pumps are shut down the oil in the cover will seek the vacuum still in the cartridge and intake chamber then the oil level will drop in the sight glass and give the appearance of a low oil level then if the pump is refilled to the oil level line and the pump started the oil that got sucked back into the cartridge and intake chamber will be kicked back into the cover and now youâ€™ll be over filled and the oil will shoot out the handle exhaust port back to top was your question not listed ask the expert
