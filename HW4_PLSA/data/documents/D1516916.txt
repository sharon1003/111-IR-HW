3 comment askers rating short answer  socialism is a few steps away from communism but hasnt quite gotten there yet longer answer  socialism is what you get when youre trying to move towards communism but havent quite gotten there yet social programs such as welfare medicare and other such government freebies are an offshoot of socialist ideology the main idea here is that the government will supply aid to those truly in need currently this is done through taxation although in the original view it would be people donating their time effort and resources to help others the basic idea of it is this karl marx the father of communism saw the world as a nasty and evil place where the workers proletariat toiled for their rich masters bourgeois as the bourgeois made more and more money theyd wind up buying up the mills and factories of the smaller bourgeois and sending them down to the proletariat in the end youd end up with a few really rich people and a lot of poor pissed off workers there would be a revolution the workers would become the new bourgeois and the cycle would repeat itself he saw the only way to fix this was to eliminate property so that nobody could actually own the factories and mills but instead it would be owned by the collective or general population each person would then donate his or her time effort and resources to the collective depending on their ability to do so everybody would work to better the collective and in the end such services as the police would no longer be necessary as everybody would police themselves once this state had come about it would be known as communism and would be a veritable utopia of course we all know that this idea failed because it was flawed from the very beginning java joe · 1 decade ago2 0 comment

the aclu httpwwwworldnetdailycomnewsarticl one of the greatest myths about the aclu is that they started out as a noble cause the roots of a tree go deep there is no question that it was founded on communistsocialist principles there is no question to the founder of the aclu roger baldwin’s ideals “i have been to europe several times mostly in connection with international radical activitiesand have traveled in the united states to areas of conflict over workers rights to strike and organize my chief aversion is the system of greed private profit privilege and violence which makes up the control of the world today and which has brought it to the tragic crisis of unprecedented hunger and unemployment therefore i am for socialism disarmament and ultimately for the abolishing of the state itself i seek the social ownership of property the abolition of the propertied class and sole control of those who produce wealth communism is the goal” httprepublicanbydesigncomwordpress
