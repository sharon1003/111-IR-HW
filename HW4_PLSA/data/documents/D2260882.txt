formulas physics formulas kinematics formulas velocity formula tangential acceleration formula tangential acceleration formula the rate of change of tangential velocity of an object traveling in a circular orbit or path is known as tangential acceleration it is directed towards tangent to the path of a body tangential acceleration formula is given by where a t is the tangential acceleration dv is the change in angular velocity dt is the change in time tangential acceleration in terms of distance is or where v is the linear velocity s is the distance covered t is the time taken tangential acceleration formula is used to calculate the tangential acceleration and also the parameters related to it it is expressed in meter per second square ms 2 tangential acceleration problems back to top below are problems based on tangential acceleration which may be helpful for you solved examples question 1 a car accelerates uniformly on a circular path from a speed of 30 ms to 60ms in 10s what is its tangential acceleration solution given initial velocity v  30 ms final velocity v f  60 ms change in velocity dv  v f  v  60ms  30 ms  30 ms time taken dt  t f  t  10s  0s  10s the tangential acceleration is given by a t    3 ms 2 question 2 a runner starts from rest and accelerates at a uniform rate up to 15ms in the time interval of 8s moving on a circular track of radius 40m calculate the tangential acceleration solution given initial velocity v  0 final velocity v f  15 ms change in velocity dv  v f  v  15ms  0  15 ms time taken dt  8s the tangential acceleration is given by a t    1875 ms initial velocity formula tangential velocity formula
