reputation management on the blockchain find out how it works today in our review what is repu repu or the repu system describes itself as “a revolutionary project that allows you to completely rethink the way social networks are perceived”it’s a feedback and rating system based on decentralized blockchain technology essentially repu wants to replace traditional social media “likes” with a social media rating that rating can be used “as an assessment tool in various areas of the individual’s life” some of the areas where the rating could be used include “with professional skills financial stability and ending with all possible aspects of behavior and interaction with the public”in that sense repu feels like the episode of black mirror where everyone rates each other and someone’s social value is based on their rating out of 5 stars use cases for repusome of the proposed use cases for repu include banks banks could adjust their credit rating based on values from the repu system insurance companies insurance companies could adjust the size of insurance payouts based on the client’s rating recruiters recruiters can assess individuals in terms of their professional skills and social adaptation based on their rating law enforcement agencies police can assess an individual’s rating to determine if they’re a danger to society ordinary citizens ordinary citizens can assess repu ratings when meeting new people advertising industry advertisers could target users who have a specific rating level hotel industry hotels will be able to set conditions for the accommodations of customers if a customer’s rating is below a certain level for example then they might face stricter conditions all of these use cases are outlined in the repu whitepaper how does repu work the main goal of repu is to create a reputation system where users – including ordinary citizens employers recruiters government officials police etc – can use a rating and feedback system in everyday life the platform is being developed as a separate project although the goal is to integrate it into social networks – like you tube instagram and linked in – in the future the basic function of repu is to replace the existing “like” systems with the repu system based on blockchain technology and smart contracts every time somebody likes your facebook post for example you can enhance your repu rating one of the important things to note about repu is that all reputation data is built on the blockchain which eliminates the possibility of forgery or deletion of reviews and ratings repu features repu’s features include all of the following providing ratings scores instead of likes for social content end users receive a new tool assessing someone’s value instead of the traditional number of subscribers you can check someone’s number of subscribers and their repu score for example to see if they’re worth following on social media better rating system for companies today’s customers struggle to review companies it’s an annoying process to login to yelp and write a carefully worded complaint or positive review for a company the repu whitepaper also mentions the fact that only 2 out of 10 positive experiences are shared via reviews while 8 out of 10 negative experiences are shared via review repu will provide a better rating and feedback system for companies better feedback system for job seekers and employees employees can enhance their repu rating by identifying themselves through a smartphone app meanwhile all types of businesses can assess job seekers based on their repu score managing the company’s reputation for owners managers can see “weak spots” within a company through the ratings of specific employees and departments they can improve the company’s overall reputation by eliminating these weak spots professional ratings for recruiters in addition to the traditional social rating of a particular user repu can introduce a professional rating from clients when hiring an employee a recruiter might see the history of the applicant then make a decision based on the applicant’s previous work how do repu coins work repu coins are a virtual currency used inside the platform to pay for the company’s reputation management services including monthly quarterly half year and annual subscriptions they can also be used to reward users for ratings or to make internal payments for goods and services within the repu ecosystem repu coins are automatically generated by the repu smart contract when a company pays for reputation

we perceive employees businesses friends acquaintances and strangers repu wants to replace existing social media “likes” with a global rating system every social media “like” you get would add to your repu rating higher repu rating would be equated with higher social status – including better insurance and banking rates better job offers and even better hotels if you’ve ever seen black mirror then repu sounds a lot like the episode “nosedive” from season 3 where we see an individual’s life descend into chaos as she unsuccessfully attempts to maintain her high rating in any case you can learn
