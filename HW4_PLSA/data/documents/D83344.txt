top teeth when you bite down neither of these conditions is good for your jaw or your bite if you have a bite that isnt right you could experience jaw pain and even headaches headaches can be caused from many different types of dental issues if you have noticed you have either an overbite or underbite it may be causing you to have recurring headaches that start during breakfast and last until bedtime since you are not chewing or eating while you sleep this is the only time your jaw can rest and the headache subsides when you wake up the next morning you usually feel pretty good until you start to eat once you start the process of mastication and chewing your food your abnormal bite starts to interfere and cause your jaw to be off center which in turn causes you to develop a headache sometimes these headaches can even turn into migraines if you are developing jaw pain when you eat or speak or if you have a popping sensation in your jaw when you open your mouth you may be suffering from a condition called tmj or temporomandibular joint tmj pain can develop in your jaw and can be referred to your face and jaw people mistakenly go to the doctor for a sinus infection or a headache when really it is the joint in their jaw that is causing all the trouble symptoms of tmj dysfunction include pain that is localized to the jaw or spreading pain to include the face head and neck there is usually a grinding or clicking noise when the jaw opens to either eat or speak the jaw may even lock in severe casesif you believe you are suffering from headaches or jaw pain due to tmj make an appointment with your dentist to get to the bottom of the headaches if your dentist cannot find anything wrong with your dental structures teeth or jaw bone he or she may refer you to a primary care
