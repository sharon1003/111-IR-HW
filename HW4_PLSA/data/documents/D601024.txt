although warts are very common and may be frightening at first it is important to know that most warts are generally harmless however there are times when a wart will be diagnosed as a cancerous wart which can be potentially deadly it is for this reason that it is important for you to understand how to tell when a wart is a cancerous wart what to look for there are several different features that you can use to tell when a wart is a cancerous wart for one the color is very important and normal warts are typically a flesh color while a cancerous wart may be dark brown black or another unusual color treating warts because warts can become cancerous if left untreated it is therefore imperative that you treat any warts immediately after they develop most people would be willing to try almost anything if it meant getting rid of their unsightly and uncomfortable warts but it is important that you choose the right specific treatment for you and one that is not going to cause scarring cryotherapy is one of the most popular choices when it comes to the treatment of warts in this treatment the attending physician will use liquid nitrogen to freeze the warts and kill them off there is also dinitrochlorobenzene which is similar to liquid nitrogen but which is a much more severe treatment it must be used more cautiously because the chemical is able to cause mutations if used incorrectly remember that warts can be treated in a number of different ways and that the only real way you can determine which specific treatment is going to be best for your cancerous wart is to discuss your condition with your doctor they will be able to make a proper diagnosis and assessment and then help you decide which treatment is going to work best keep in mind that the fact that so many methods for treating warts have been used greatly reflects the difficulty in treating them as well as the poor response rates in other words often warts can be stubborn and will stick around even after a variety of treatments have been used warts can be incredibly unsightly and uncomfortable but there is nothing more important than taking care of cancerous warts if left untreated they can be potentially deadly and they can also spread to others so it is imperative that you deal with them immediately
