appropriate keywordscation–chloride cotransporters cell volume homeostasis aminobutyric acid kcc2 nkcc1top introduction since the 1960s electrogenic voltagegated and ligandgated ion channels have been a major focus of neuroscientific research these channels are responsible for the generation and propagation of action potentials through dissipation of ionic gradients which are established by atpburning ion pumps and utilized by electroneutral ion transporters the recent development of genetic techniques that permit the cloning transgenic overexpression and knockout of genes that encode these ion transporters has created a burgeoning awareness of the pivotal roles of nonelectrogenic modes of ion transport in the development and function of the mammalian nervous system chloride is the primary permeant anion in mammals and the homeostasis of its flux across cell membranes is important for a range of neurophysiological processes neurons regulate their intracellular chloride level  cl  i to ensure appropriate electrical responses to the neurotransmitter aminobutyric acid gaba in addition cl  i needs to be manipulated to counterbalance changes in cell volume arising from fluctuations in extracellular osmolality and intracellular solute content the precise regulation of cl  i is achieved in part by cation–chloride cotransporters cccs encoded by the slc12 gene family which include the inwardly directed na–k–2cl cotransporter nkcc1 and various outwardly directed k–cl cotransporters 1 2 3this review will consider the importance of cccmediated modulation of the cellular chloride gradient for proper gabaergic neurotransmission and for cell volume homeostasis in the developing and mature nervous system and we will discuss how breakdowns of chloride homeostasis resulting from mutations in cccencoding genes or from derangement in ccc activity might contribute to the pathogenesis of seizures neuropathic pain cerebral edema and neurodegeneration we also highlight the emergence of cellular chloride homeostasis as an attractive target for the treatment of certain neurological disorders and explore how existing drugs that target cccs might be used for this purpose top cation–chloride cotransporters cccs are targets of some of the most commonly used drugs in medicine—the loop and thiazide diuretics—and the genes that encode these cotransporters are mutated in several inherited human diseases 4 these cotransporters are intrinsic membrane proteins that transport chloride ions together with sodium andor potassium ions across plasma membranes transport is driven energetically by the combined transmembrane gradients of sodium and potassium established by na  –k  atpase and of chloride given the large electrochemically favorable inward gradient for sodium the sodiumcoupled cccs which include the na–k–cl cotransporters ncc nkcc1 and nkcc2 load chloride ions into the cell to raise cl  i above its electrochemical equilibrium conversely by coupling chloride transport to the outward gradient for potassium the potassiumcoupled cccs—the k–cl cotransporters kcc1 kcc2 kcc3 and kcc4—primarily transport chloride ions out of the cell thereby lowering cl  i below its electrochemical equilibrium the relative activities of the various cccs determine the cl  i in numerous cell types and these molecules consequently have key roles in the regulation of neuronal excitability cell volume homeostasis and the transepithelial transport of salt potassium and water 3in the developing nervous system nkcc1 is expressed in neurons and glia in the cerebrum and cerebellum whereas in adults it is expressed in the spinal cord pns and choroid plexus and in cerebral vascular endothelial cells and principal neurons 5 in many animals studied kcc2 expression predominates in mature neurons in the retina cortex cerebellum and the dorsal horn of the spinal cord 6 kcc3 kcc4 and kcc1 are collectively coexpressed with kcc2 in several neuronal subtypes with additional expression in glia oligodendrocytes and the choroid plexus 7 8consistent with the opposing directionality of the chloride they transport as shown in in vitro studies the na–k–cl and k–cl cotransporters are reciprocally regulated by cellvolumesensitive and chloridesensitive serine–threonine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events 9 10 cell swelling triggered by extracellular hypotonicity high intracellular levels of chloride and activation of protein phosphatases all promote dephosphorylation of the cotransporters thereby stimulating the k–cl cotransporters but inhibiting nkcc1 leading to a decreased cl  i conversely cell shrinkage triggered by extracellular hypertonicity low intracellular chloride and inhibition of protein phosphatase all promote phosphorylation of the cotransporters thereby activating nkcc1 but inhibiting the k–cl cotransporters leading to an increased cl  i kcc2 has been shown to exhibit basal activity in the absence of cell swelling in xenopus oocytes similar basal activity might explain the cotransporters capacity to transport chloride in neurons exposed to isotonic conditions 11 12 the cellvolumesensitive and chloridesensitive kinases that regulate the na–k–cl and k–cl cotransporters have been identified as the wnk lysinedeficient serine–threonine kinases and the ste20type serine–threonine kinases spak and osr1 13 14 15 acute dynamic modulation of ccc function is likely to be accomplished predominantly through protein phosphorylation membrane trafficking and protein degradation whereas modulation of cccs over a lessrapid time scale probably occurs through regulation of gene transcription top developmental switch in cation–chloride cotransporter expression in adult mammals gaba is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the cortex in the developing nervous system however gabaergic neurotransmission is excitatory and is critical for the maturation of neurons and their integration into circuits 16 17 the mechanisms that determine the neuronal response to gaba are summarized in figure 1 figure 1 a developmental switch in cation–chloride cotransporter expression renders gaba hyperpolarizing during neuronal maturation  a during embryonic and early postnatal life immature hippocampal and spinal neurons express the chlorideintruding na–k–2cl cotransporter nkcc1 owing to high activity of this cotransporter and minimal activity of the chlorideextruding k–cl cotransporter kcc2 cl  i is high and e cl is positive relative to the v m of the neuron when cl  i is high opening of chloride channels by gaba a receptor activation results in chloride efflux thereby depolarizing and exciting the neuron  b during neuronal maturation nkcc1 activity decreases and kcc2 activity increases kcc2 maintains a low cl  i and the e cl is negative relative to the v m therefore activation of the gaba a receptor results in chloride influx hyperpolarization and inhibition of the neuron

channels gaba triggers conformational changes in these receptors that facilitate the passive inflow or outflow of chloride ions depending on the cells equilibrium potential for chloride  e cl  cl  i is a key determinant of the neuronal response to gaba when cl  i is high such that e cl is positive relative to the neurons membrane potential  v m  the opening of chloride channels by gaba a receptor activation results in chloride efflux which consequently depolarizes the neuron when cl  i is low such that e cl is negative relative to the neurons v m activation of the gaba a receptor results in chloride influx leading to hyperpolarization of the neuron depolarization increases the chance that the neuron will fire an action potential whereas hyperpolarization is associated with a decreased chance of it firing an action potential therefore high neuronal chloride concentrations are generally considered to subserve gabamediated excitation and low concentrations to facilitate gabamediated inhibition there are however exceptions to these considerations such as shunting inhibition mediated by depolarizing conductances and action potentials triggered by proton currents after hyperpolarizing conductances so it is sometimes preferable to assay the net effect of endogenously released gaba on the rate of action potentials in the neural network rather than extrapolate from the effect of gaba on membrane potential 18influx of chloride into neurons is mediated largely by na–k–2cl cotransport via nkcc1 in embryonic and early postnatal life neurons show robust expression of nkcc1 but minimal expression of kcc2 19 20 21 this predominance of inwarddirected chloride transport increases the cl  i resulting in a positive e cl relative to the v m of the neuron so that gaba stimulates an outwarddirected chloride current that triggers neuronal depolarization and excitation removal of excitatory gabaergic signaling during development by sustained pharmacological inhibition or genetic disruption of nkcc1 results in a lack of morphological maturation of cortical neurons fewer mature spinal neurons reduced dendritic arborization disrupted motor activity fewer motor neurons and interneurons a reduction in the elaboration of axonal tracts and smaller brains and spinal cords 22 23 24efflux of chloride out of neurons is mediated largely by the k–cl cotransporter kcc2 in many species this cotransporter is expressed at very low levels at birth 25 in rat hippocampal and neocortical pyramidal neurons a negative shift in the gaba reversal potential  e gaba is paralleled by a robust increase in kcc2 expression near the end of the second postnatal week 26 dzhala et al demonstrated that kcc2 expression in the human neocortex begins to increase at 40 weeks after conception 27 this increase in kcc2 expression accompanied by a concurrent downregulation of nkcc1 expression results in the dominance of chloride efflux over chloride influx which decreases cl  i such that e cl is negative relative to the neurons v m thereby rendering gabaergic signals hyperpolarizing kcc2  mice have seizures and die at birth in part owing to malfunction of the respiratory center 28 kcc2 might also play a role in neuronal development beyond its transport function the carboxy terminus of kcc2 through its interaction with the cytoskeletal protein 41n promotes dendritic spine development 29how is the increase in kcc2 activity relative to nkcc1 activity controlled one possibility is that gaba itself by acting as a selflimiting trophic factor might promote this switch by triggering specific intracellular cascades that upregulate kcc2 gene expression 30 the increase in kcc2 and the negative shift in e gaba can however take place in the presence of gaba a receptor antagonists indicating that other factors are involved in this transition 31 spontaneous cholinergic activity by triggering calciumsignaling cascades that upregulate kcc2 downstream of the acetylcholine nicotinic receptor has been shown to be important for the gabaergic excitationtoinhibition transition 32 synergistic with the newly established inhibitory gabaergic signaling cholinergic signaling then triggers later events of neuronal development 32 factors such as brainderived neurotrophic factor bdnf acting on the trk b tyrosine kinase receptor have also been implicated in the upregulation of kcc2 during the excitatorytoinhibitory transition of gabaergic signaling 33 34topimmature neuronal chloride gradients in seizures neurons function in interconnected circuits and increasing neuronal excitation via increased glutamatergic signaling or decreasing neuronal inhibition via decreased inhibitory gabaergic signaling or increased excitatory gabaergic signaling can cause the circuit to become hyperactive when the electrical firing of a small population of hyperexcitable neurons becomes synchronized progressively larger networks become entrained so that seizures ensue recent experimental and neuropathological studies have implicated excitatory gabaergic signaling in the genesis of neonatal seizures temporal lobe epilepsy tle and seizures that occur after ischemic–hypoxic insult a feature common to these disorders is that neurons adopt transmembrane chloride gradients that phenotypically resemble those of immature neurons which consequently renders gaba activity excitatory instead of inhibitory this pathologic shift results from an increase in the relative abundance andor activity of nkcc1 compared with kcc2 which causes cl  i to be elevated such that e cl is positive relative to the neurons v m neonatal seizures neonatal seizures epileptic episodes experienced by newborn infants in the first 28 days of life can have devastating consequences for brain development agents that are efficacious for quelling seizures in adults are often ineffective—and can even potentiate seizures—in neonates 35 36 in adults barbiturates and benzodiazepines decrease seizure activity by increasing the duration andor frequency of the opening of the gaba a receptor chloride channel leading to membrane hyperpolarization due to passive influx of chloride immature neurons however have a high cl  i so gaba a receptor activation leads to chloride efflux and membrane depolarization this depolarizing action of gaba might contribute to the lowered seizure threshold and increased seizure propensity among neonates if this is indeed the case the depolarization would provide a compelling explanation for the poor efficacy in the immature brain of drugs that activate gaba a receptors 37 38 gaba a receptor agonists have also been noted to produce the curious phenomenon of electroclinical dissociation in neonates whereby the clinical manifestations of seizure activity eg convulsions are silenced but cortical seizure activity as measured by eeg is either unaffected or exacerbated 39 40 41 for all these reasons the current treatment of neonatal seizures is suboptimal in view of the fact that elevated cl  i in immature neurons is attributable to robust nkcc1 activity 42 this cotransporter is being explored as a target for anticonvulsant therapy in neonates theoretically reduction of cl  i by inhibition of nkcc1 could block gabamediated excitation under these conditions the chloride channels opened by gaba would only serve to shunt or shortcircuit excitatory inputs 43 so the inhibitory function of gaba would be recovered bumetanide an inhibitor of nkcc1 related to loop diuretics has recently been shown to reduce cortical seizure activity in neonatal rats at doses that have been safely used in human neonates 27 38 the highest single dose of bumetanide used in these animal studies 010 mgkg has previously been shown to produce no adverse effects such as electrolyte abnormalities hemodynamic instability hypovolemia or significant elevations in bilirubin in humans 44 bumetanides anticonvulsant effects correlate with a reduction in the level of intraneuronal chloride and can be attributed specifically to nkcc1 inhibition because bumetanide suppresses triggered epileptiform activity in hippocampal slices from normal neonatal mice but not in hippocampal slices from neonatal nkcc1  mice or adult mice 27 investigators have also rendered phenobarbital an effective anticonvulsant in the immature brain by coadministering it with bumetanide which reverses the chloride gradient in immature neurons to a level such that gaba a potentiation by phenobarbital results in membrane hyperpolarization and neuronal inhibition 27 clinical trials are currently underway to examine whether human neonates respond similarly to bumetanide fda investigational new drug 101690 temporal lobe epilepsy tle that is refractory to medical treatment is common and often necessitates the neurosurgical removal of epileptic foci mesial temporal sclerosis mts is a common finding in tle and is characterized pathologically by gliosis of the hippocampal ca1 region while the adjacently situated hippocampal subiculum remains intact the mechanism underlying epileptogenesis in mtsassociated tle and other medically intractable forms of tle is still unclear cohen et al have provided evidence indicating that excitatory gabaergic signaling resulting from perturbed neuronal chloride transport might have a role in epileptogenesis in tle 45 the researchers demonstrated that excitatory interictal depolarizations are present in subicular gabaergic neurons in temporal lobe slices from patients with mtsassociated tle these subicular gabatriggered excitatory impulses were shown to serve as a nidus for the spread of other interictal depolarizations in adjacent regions of the hippocampus during seizure activity in vitro and in vivo studies in animals and humans have demonstrated that the nkcc1 inhibitors bumetanide and furosemide are effective at reducing interictal activity 46 47 in patients undergoing temporal lobectomy for mtsassociated tle intravenous administration of furosemide sharply reduces interictal spike frequency 48 and a large epidemiological study has shown that diuretic use is associated with a decreased risk of developing epilepsy 49 these data have prompted further investigations into the specific role of nkcc1 and the k–cl cotransporters in tle the contribution of altered nkcc1 and kcc2 activity to epileptogenesis has been explored both in model systems and in adult humans a kcc2 knockout in drosophila melanogaster results in flies with an increased susceptibility to seizures because of excitatory gabaergic signaling 50 mice with a knockdown of a major kcc2 isoform exhibit generalized seizures and die shortly after birth because of hyperexcitatory gaba responses in the ca1 region of the hippocampus and they exhibit gliosis and neuronal loss in the hippocampus and temporal lobe 28 51 several groups have demonstrated increased nkcc1 andor decreased kcc2 expression in the subiculum compared with the hippocampus proper or the temporal lobe neocortex in patients with mtsassociated tle relative to normal individuals 52 53 54 55 56in patients with mtsassociated tle gaba reversal potentials have been shown to be more depolarized in the subiculum than in other hippocampal regions and bumetanide shifts these potentials to morehyperpolarized values 53 a substantial number of subicular neurons in hippocampal slices from patients with tle harbor excitatory gabaergic potentials and elicit interictal depolarizations due to a lack of kcc2 expression bumetanide administration produces a hyperpolarizing gabaergic shift and suppresses epileptic activity in these neurons 52 e gaba shows a positive shift immediately after a severe episode of experimental status epilepticus suggesting that alterations in chloride transport might underlie the pathogenesis of this condition 55 increased nkcc1 andor altered kcc2 expression has been noted in medically intractable epilepsies associated with malformations of cortical development including focal cortical dysplasia hemimegalencephaly and ganglioglioma 57 5859together these data suggest that activation of nkcc1mediated chloride import andor decreased kcc2mediated chloride export with the attending change in neuronal e gaba drives epileptogenesis and seizure intractability in epilepsy associated with mts or developmental malformations seizures after hypoxic–ischemic insult like neonatal seizures and various types of tle seizures resulting from hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy respond poorly to anticonvulsants that activate gaba a receptors 60 these seizures occur during the period of cerebral reperfusion rather than during the acute hypoxic episode in rat models of cerebral hypoxic–ischemic injury eg oxygen–glucose deprivation ogd reoxygenation lead to a prolonged rise in cl  i in hippocampal neurons causing the gabaergic neurons to become hyperexcitable 61 62 this increase in cl  i was associated with increased expression of the phosphorylated and active form of nkcc1 and was prevented by administration of low doses of bumetanide 63 bumetanide also prevents ogdinduced neuronal damage 64 and cell swelling 65 66 glutamate receptor activation and high extracellular levels of potassium—factors known to contribute to the pathogenesis of ischemic damage and neuronal excitotoxicity—cause activation of nkcc1 through serine–threonine phosphorylation 66 67 together these data suggest that a pathologic increase in nkcc1 activity due to an increase in serine–threonine phosphorylation of this cotransporter contributes to the ischemiainduced increase in cl  i that triggers neuronal hyperexcitability excitotoxicity and injury following ischemia 64 68 69 70 the finding that bumetanide is neuroprotective after an ogd episode raises the possibility that this drug could reduce morbidity and mortality after an acute cerebral hypoxic episode eg stroke in humans mechanism of altered cation–chloride cotransporter activity in seizures it is unclear whether the changes in nkcc1 andor kcc2 activity that promote gabaergic hyperexcitability in seizures are the primary events underlying disease pathogenesis or whether they are merely one component of a complex secondary cascade of events that propagates seizure activity the mechanism underlying the changes in ccc function andor expression in these seizure types is also poorly understood it is well known however that neuronal trauma eg excitotoxicity or ischemia leads to a dedifferentiation of the neuronal phenotype with respect to ion transport properties and the composition of gaba a subunits 71 72 73 this immature molecular phenotype which includes high nkcc1 expression low kcc2 expression elevated cl  i and depolarizing gabaergic responses is potentially advantageous for neuronal repair but might predispose neurons to seizure activity 2 74bdnf and its receptor trk b are thought to be involved in the shift of neurons to a more immature phenotype  figure 2  seizures themselves might produce longterm depolarizing shifts in e gaba by triggering activitydependent downregulation of kcc2 andor upregulation of nkcc1 via bdnf signaling through trk b sustained epileptic activity leads to an increase in hippocampal expression of bdnf and trk b 75 76 following the kindling of seizures in vivo kcc2 shows a rapid dramatic decrease in expression in the same parts of the epileptic hippocampus that exhibit robust bdnf and trk b upregulation 77 this seizureinduced downregulation of kcc2 requires the activation of the trk b receptor and the two main trk bmediated signaling cascades the phosphoinositide–phospholipase c and shcactivated map kinase pathways 78 downregulation of the tyrosine phosphorylation of kcc2 and of kcc2 activity is also seen after seizures and this precedes the bdnfmediated decreases in kcc2 protein or messenger rna expression 79 whether seizures trigger activitydependent upregulation of nkcc1 is not yet known figure 2 possible mechanism underlying the pathological modulation of chloride homeostasis by bdnf in seizures and neuropathic pain  a in the normal adult cns cl  i is sufficiently low such that gabainduced activation of gaba a receptorassociated chloride channels triggers chloride influx into neurons causing hyperpolarizing inhibition  b in pathological conditions such as seizures or neuropathic pain following peripheral nerve injury as shown in the figure microglia and possibly other cells in the cns express purinergic p2x 4 receptors become activated and secrete bdnf by binding to trk b receptors on neurons bdnf triggers intracellular signaling cascades that ultimately lead to the downregulation of kcc2 decreased expression of kcc2 results in a diminution in the capacity of neurons to extrude chloride thereby increasing cl  i and decreasing the strength of gabainduced hyperpolarizing inhibition this robust increase in cl  i leads to a reversal in the polarity of gaba signaling causing gaba to become depolarizing and thereby substantially enhancing the excitability of the cells blockade of microglial bdnf–trk b signaling has been shown to restore normal chloride homeostasis by normalizing the expression of kcc2 in seizures and other pathological states

legend 75kfigures  tables index download power point slide 140kwhy do adult neurons stressed by seizures adopt neonatal features one hypothesis is that this phenotype is an attempt to provide repair mechanisms and enable the targeting of neuronal projections during damagerelated rewiring in the chronically epileptic human hippocampus the depolarizing and excitatory gaba responses that characterize subicular interictal activity resemble the early largescale spontaneous discharges that have been implicated in the formation of neuronal networks 2 74 whereas excitatory gabaergic neurotransmission during development leads to the activation of voltagegated calcium channels and subsequent increases in intracellular calcium that have a role in neuronal growth maturation and repair such excitatory gaba neurotransmission might maladaptively contribute to seizure activity and neuronal damage resulting from excitotoxicity 2 74top cation–chloride cotransporters in the spinal cord and pnscccs are expressed in the spinal cord and pns and they have important roles in sensory perception particularly for pain 80 the importance of gabaergic signaling for spinal nociceptive processing is well known yet it has only recently been recognized that modulation of neuronal chloride gradients by cccs is pivotal for proper functioning of this system the spinal cord uses two different gabaergic inhibitory mechanisms to modulate pain input from the periphery gabaergic inhibition in dorsal horn neurons of the spinal cord lamina i region involves hyperpolarization whereas gabaergic inhibition in dorsal root ganglion neurons ie primary sensory afferents involves a depolarizing mechanism in the dorsal horn inhibitory neurons release gaba and glycine to diminish the neuronal excitability of postsynaptic neurons which express gaba a receptors these postsynaptic neurons have a low cl  i owing to greater kcc2 activity than nkcc1 activity so gabaergic or glycinergic signaling triggers chloride to flow down its electrochemical gradient 80 the resulting hyperpolarized membrane potential limits the neuronal output of the lamina i pain pathway to the brain loss of inhibition in dorsal horn neurons has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain kcc2 is highly expressed in lamina i pain neurons 81 hypomorphic kcc2 deficient mice have altered sensitivity to tactile and noxious thermal stimuli but they exhibit normal locomotor activity and coordination 82 coull et al used a model of neuropathic pain following peripheral nerve injury to demonstrate that a transsynaptic reduction in the expression of kcc2 and consequent disruption of chloride homeostasis in lamina i neurons underlies the pathogenesis of the exuberant disinhibited signaling of dorsal horn neurons in neuropathic pain 81 the resulting increase in cl  i causes a loss of the gabaergic inhibitory tone and in some cases promotes actual depolarizing gabaergic synaptic chloride currents that substantially augment the net excitability of lamina i neuronal output to the brain pharmacological blockade of kcc2 or knockdown of kcc2 expression in the spinal cord markedly reduces the nociceptive threshold in rats confirming the pivotal role of kcc2 in lamina i neurons 81in contrast to its stimulatory effects on kcc2 expression and activity in the developing cortex bdnf seems to cause a decrease in kcc2 expression in neuropathic pain following peripheral nerve injury  figure 2  activated microglia around the site of injury release bdnf 83 which acts on neuronal trk b receptors to reduce kcc2 expression blockade of the bdnf signaling pathway from microglia to neurons alleviates neuropathic pain following peripheral nerve injury in rats 83 chronic peripheral inflammatory pain also induces downregulation of kcc2 in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord via bdnf release from damaged tissues and intrathecal injection of kcc2 small interfering rna into rats leads to a type of behavioral hypersensitivity similar to the hyperalgesia induced by peripheral inflammation 84 these data suggest that disinhibition in the spinal cord is a common feature of neuropathic and inflammatory pain indicating that these conditions might respond to similar therapeutic agents it is tempting to speculate that therapies targeting bdnf or trk b in the spinal cord could be effective against neuropathic or chronic inflammatory pain in adult humans nkcc1 also has a role in sensory perception and is responsible for the intracellular accumulation of chloride in dorsal root ganglion and sympathetic ganglion neurons 85 86 87 several recent studies have demonstrated a role for nkcc1 in nociceptive processing as well as in the generation and maintenance of hyperalgesic states nkcc1  mice exhibit increased response latencies to the hot plate test an increased threshold to noxious heat and a reduction in stroking hyperalgesia touchevoked pain or allodynia triggered by intradermal capsaicin injections 88 recent studies have shown that the expression and phosphorylation of nkcc1 in primary afferent and spinal cord sensory neurons is increased in experimental arthritis and in acute and chronic inflammation 89 90 this upregulation of nkcc1 activity following inflammatory insult might produce excessive gabaergic depolarization in primary afferents possibly leading to crossexcitation between lowthreshold and highthreshold afferents 89 90top cation–chloride cotransporters in cell volume regulation braincell volume is challenged by alterations in extracellular osmolality anisosmotic or intracellular solute content isosmotic the resulting transmembrane ion gradients result in the passage of water into or out of the cells causing them to swell or shrink anisosmotic volume changes can be triggered by hypernatremia or hyponatremia which commonly occur after intracranial surgery or brain trauma as a result of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone or cerebral salt wasting isosmotic volume change is an important problem for neurons which experience shifts in their ionic gradients during inhibitory and excitatory postsynaptic potentials and to a lesser extent during generation and propagation of action potentials membrane depolarization is particularly threatening to neuronal cell volume because the normal negative resting membrane potential that provides an electrical counterbalance to chloride influx is dissipated providing a favorable electrochemical force for the inward movement of chloride activation of gabaergic and glycinergic ligandgated chloride channels also challenge cell volume by causing transcellular shifts of chloride owing to the fixed volume of the rigid skull even small changes in cell volume are hazardous to the brain in the acute setting cells respond to perturbations in their cell volume by rapidly raising or lowering cl  i sodium andor potassium are transported concurrently with chloride to maintain electroneutrality followed by transport of water which is driven by osmotic gradients 91 these acute responses are achieved by altering the balance between chloride influx and efflux through regulatory volume increase rvi and regulatory volume decrease rvd figure 3  92 failure of these mechanisms results in excessive cell swelling or shrinking thereby imperiling the structural integrity of cells via disruption of the actin cytoskeleton swelling of the brain parenchyma and the vascular endothelium can also compromise cerebral perfusion causing ischemia and infarction 93 94figure 3 regulation of cell volume by cation–chloride cotransporters cation–chloride cotransporters regulate neuronal and glial cell volume via the mechanisms of regulatory volume increase rvi and regulatory volume decrease rvd cell shrinkage triggered by hypertonicity is counterbalanced by rvi which induces the activation of nkcc1 resulting in the influx of

cccs are robustly swellingactivated and are widely expressed in both neurons and glia 95cells activate rvi or rvd when their volume deviates from a normal set point the stimuli that activate nkcc1 eg cell shrinkage hypertonicity or low intracellular levels of chloride reduce the activity of the k–cl cotransporters 96 and vice versa 9 10 this is a far more efficient process and consumes much less atp than transporters with antagonistic actions that function continuously the cellvolumesensitive and chloridesensitive serine–threonine kinases that dynamically alter cotransporter function are crucial to these homeostatic counterresponses 14 97 mutation or alteration of ccc activity can have a profound impact on cell volume homeostasis and might underlie several neuropathological conditions role of nkcc1 in cell volume regulation nkcc1 mediates rvi in neurons glia and cerebral endothelial cells 98 pathologic activation of nkcc1 seems to be an important mechanism of cerebral edema following ischemia nkcc1 is stimulated by hypoxia aglycemia arginine vasopressin high extracellular levels of potassium and other factors that are present during episodes of cerebral ischemia 68 99 100ischemiainduced nkcc1 activation is associated with the phosphorylation of two of nkcc1s aminoterminal threonines 100 the same nkcc1 residues are phosphorylated during both rvi and ischemia suggesting that the kinases that mediate ischemiainduced nkcc1 phosphorylation also regulate nkcc1 in rvi cytokines which are known to mediate edema and neuronal damage in ischemia might have a role in the ischemiainduced activation of nkcc1 interleukin 6 il6 which is released from astrocytes in response to ischemia has been shown to facilitate vasogenic edema by triggering activation of nkcc1 in nearby endothelial cells of the cerebral microvasculature 101 fk506 an immunosuppressant that inhibits glial production of il6 reduced nkcc1 activation and infarct size in the rat middle cerebral artery occlusion model of cerebral ischemia 102in the rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion stroke pharmacological inhibition of nkcc1 by bumetanide or genetic disruption of nkcc1 reduces neuronal and glial cell swelling edema formation and total infarct volume 103104 105 bumetanide was effective even if administered 20 min after the ischemic ictus suggesting that this drug could be beneficial in reducing the infarct size and associated edema of stroke even if administered long after the primary thrombotic event has occurred bumetanide or knockout of nkcc1 has also been shown to attenuate the cell swelling accumulation of intracellular sodium and injury of cortical and hippocampal neurons triggered by either ogd or excitatory amino acids such as glutamate 64 69 99 106 nkcc1

neuropathy hypotonia hyporeflexia and progressive distal and proximal symmetrical weakness with muscle atrophy agenesis of the corpus callosum is another characteristic feature of the disease although this is more variable and less penetrant than the universal peripheral neuropathy mice with a targeted deletion of kcc3 have a locomotor defect resembling the human accpn phenotype with an attendant degeneration of peripheral nerves 110 111 one kcc3  mouse strain showed evidence of central neurodegeneration with lesions showing a peculiar vacuolizing pattern suggestive of a fluidrelated axonopathy in the spinal cord hippocampus and cerebellum 110 synapses were found in degenerating hippocampal axons suggesting that these cells had established synaptic connections before degeneration how might loss of kcc3 function cause peripheral and central neurodegeneration in kcc3  mice the rvd response of hippocampal neurons is severely impaired consistent with the observation of neuronal degeneration and vacuolization of neurons in the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus along the hippocampal fissure 110 by use of detailed morphometric analysis of sciatic nerves from kcc3  mice byun and delpire demonstrated progressive axonal swelling consistent with a defect in cell volume regulation by postnatal day 3 111 axonal development migration and myelination were normal at this time 111 between postnatal days 8 and 30 sciatic fibers began to accumulate fluid periaxonally these initial cellswellingrelated pathologies were followed by axonal and myelin degeneration in adult nerves the progressive neurodegeneration was correlated with a progressive reduction in nerve conduction velocity and decreased sensitivity to noxious pain in kcc3  mice analysis of sciatic nerves and ventral and dorsal roots of the spinal cord indicated degeneration of axons of both motor neurons and sensory neurons it seems therefore that the absence of kcc3 during a critical postnatal window leads to impaired cell volume regulation which triggers axonal and periaxonal swelling and subsequent peripheral neurodegeneration 111 together these studies suggest that cell volume regulation via kcc3mediated rvd is important for the structural maintenance of both central neurons and peripheral nerves 110 111top cation–chloride cotransporters as therapeutic targets bumetanide is a relatively specific inhibitor of nkcc1 at low concentrations  2–10 moll and has wellestablished pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties in humans with few side effects 27 thus the use of this diuretic—alone or in combination with other drugs—presents a real possibility for treatment of neurological diseases in which increased nkcc1 activity contributes to disease pathogenesis no published works have studied bumetanide accumulation in the cns after systemic administration but its documented effects on seizure or interictal activity in vivo in animals and humans 27 48 suggest that this drug can cross the blood–brain barrier sufficiently to inhibit nkcc1 in cortical neurons further studies are needed to study the permeability of bumetanide across the blood–brain barrier pilot studies are now underway to study the efficacy of bumetanide administered with phenobarbital for the treatment of neonatal seizures fda ind 101690 113 a trial of bumetanide is also taking place in adults with medically intractable and surgically unresectable tle associated with mts or various cortical malformations 114 in addition bumetanide might be useful for seizures that occur secondary to hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy and it could possibly aid in the prevention of cerebral edema following traumatic brain injury or stroke 70 in these conditions coupling bumetanide with an agent that inhibits its action in the periphery to limit systemic side effects eg renal electrolyte or fluid disturbances might optimize the desired pharmacotherapeutic effects the determination of potential side effects of nkcc1 inhibition in the human nervous system is important given the importance of gabamediated excitation for neuronal development it seems prudent to proceed cautiously with the use of bumetanide in neonates infants with congenital renal failure are frequently treated with diuretics 115 and they often harbor a host of developmental abnormalities although it is difficult to ascertain which of these abnormalities if any are attributable to direct effects of the diuretic on their nervous system as opposed to metabolic consequences of their renal failure pharmacokinetic studies of bumetanide in term and preterm neonates have not revealed any acute neurological adverse effects 44 116 but longterm followup of these patients is needed to uncover any subtle alterations that could occur later in life it should be noted that other anticonvulsants currently in use exert far greater effects on the developing nervous system than bumetanide for example substantial increases in neuronal apoptosis have been shown to occur after loading doses of barbiturates benzodiazepine or phenytoin 117 it will also be important to weigh up the detrimental effects of bumetanideinduced inhibition of gabamediated excitation against those of seizureinduced abnormalities in synaptic signaling the nkcc1  mouse is an ideal model system in which to assess the effects of blocking gabamediated depolarization on neuronal development no drugs have yet been identified that specifically inhibit k–cl cotransport or that differentiate between multiple k–cl cotransporter isoforms furosemide and dioa r   2nbutyl67dichloro2cyclopentyl23dihydro1oxo1hinden5yloxy acetic acid have been used to inhibit k–cl cotransporters experimentally in vitro but these drugs are morepotent blockers of nkcc1 than of kcc2 and they also inhibit carbonic anhydrases 118 k–cl cotransporter agonists might be more clinically efficacious than k–cl inhibitors a specific kcc2 agonist might in combination with nkcc1 inhibitors synergistically augment gabamediated inhibition to treat seizures or other conditions in which neuronal hyperexcitability results from derangement in cellular chloride gradients drugs that augment kcc2 activity could also be useful for restoring the normal inhibitory gabaergic neurotransmission in the spinal cord that is altered in neuropathic pain 80 in addition specifically augmenting kcc3 in the pns might prove useful for treating fluidrelated axonopathies and neurodegeneration 111 in the cns such a drug might be beneficial for treating cerebral edema occurring after trauma or ischemia the endogenous regulators of nkcc1 and the k–cl cotransporters should be explored for their roles in the pathogenesis of diseases characterized by altered ccc activity bdnf which is released on seizurelike activity causes downregulation of kcc2 resulting in a decreased capacity of neurons to extrude chloride and thereby propagating further seizure episodes 78 release of bdnf from injured microglia in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord following peripheral nerve injury also triggers a downregulation of kcc2 which causes the depolarizing shift in e gaba that underlies neuropathic pain 119 inhibition of bdnf action via blockage of the trk b receptor reverses depolarizing shifts in e gaba 119 consequently trk b inhibitors might help to treat various seizure syndromes or chronic pain by increasing the endogenous expression of kcc2 in addition the cellvolumesensitive and chloridesensitive regulatory kinases of the cccs—the wnks spak and osr1—might be inhibited to treat pathological conditions in which cell swelling predominates drugs that target cccs in the nervous system might have specific advantages over current drugs for seizures neuropathic pain and neurodegenerative diseases 120 such drugs would restore endogenous gabaergic inhibition rather than actively depressing excitability by imposing exogenous inhibition thereby yielding morespecific treatments with fewer detrimental side effects in addition by acting upstream of n methyldaspartate or other calciumdependent mechanisms the common detrimental side effects that result from targeting these pathways might be avoided with drugs that target cccs 120121top conclusions the important neurophysiological roles of cccs the profound defects that result from their mutation or dysfunction and the existence of drugs with favorable pharmacokinetic and dynamic profiles that alter their activity are all factors that mark these cotransporters as potential targets for the treatment of a diverse group of neurological diseases future investigations should focus on the effects of existing drugs such as bumetanide on specific types of seizure syndromes cerebral edema following traumatic or ischemic insult neuropathic or chronic inflammatory pain and other diseases that share the common molecular phenotype of deranged intracellular chloride homeostasis key points in mammalian neurons the strength and polarity of aminobutyric acid gabamediated neurotransmission is largely determined by the intracellular chloride concentration  cl–ication–chloride cotransporters cccs have important roles in determining the cl–i of both neurons and glia the na–k–2cl cotransporter nkcc1 transports chloride into cells and k–cl cotransporters such as kcc2 and kcc3 transport chloride out of cells altered cl–i homeostasis resulting from mutation or dysfunction of nkcc1 andor kcc2 can cause hypoexcitability or hyperexcitability of neurons such derangements have been implicated in the pathogenesis of ischemic seizures neonatal seizures temporal lobe epilepsy and neuropathic pain nkcc1 and the swellingactivated k–cl cotransporters are important regulators of cell volume cccs are potential targets for novel therapeutic strategies in various neurological disorders that are characterized by deranged cellular chloride homoestasis the nkcc1 inhibitor bumetanide has been shown to decrease epileptiform activity in models of neonatal seizures and temporal lobe epilepsy and to decrease cerebral edema after traumatic brain injury or
