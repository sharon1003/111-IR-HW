soon please rethink your prospects regarding your lifelong goals the government is crashing us hard with previdentiary refit and new brazilian labor outlaw reform more or less changed during the course of acceptance in the senate httpswwwlatlegalcom201708brazillaborreformwhatyouneedtoknowaboutlawno134672017 pay attention also to the fact that the criminality has escalated on a surge rate due to the massive unemployability rate the worst of all this is the fact that our science and technology fund system has been collapsed httpwwwsciencemagorgnews201710brazilresearchersstrugglefenddeepeningbudgetcuts so forget to do rd here dont get fooled by despaired hiring staffs seeking mad for workforce all the world around cheers david on oct 14 2017  the 7000 reais is not a net income from oct7 post in dollar is 1768 us dollars per month is middle to lower middle class lifestyle to be living blocks away from even more crime than what is the norm is likely thus be alert of location of where your 4 month life is going to be negotiate more than this amount before taxes são paulo is first worlddeveloped city for 2 million people the other 11 million are struggling as in comparison of new delhi which it do you desire to experience my city in usa pays 37000 real per month or 11700 us dollars per month you are worth more than 7000 reais forcefully request what you are worth ps on oct 07 2017  does your package include housing if not i guess 7000 reais net salary per month is enough for a decent stay and food but you wont save any money of corse it all depends on your hability to manage money and what you consider being decent though going out in this city isnt cheap good luck on your stay in brasil rahul on sep 21 2017  hi i am an it guy from india and i have an assignment in sp for the next 4 months my package is 7000 breal without taxes will i be able to afford decent stay and food during my time of stay here will there be enough money to save or will i be spending all my money here medeiros on jul 15 2017  if i were you id think twice before landing in são paulo if you intend to work there as a ceo manager supervisor doctor or a top engineer your life will be reasonable good i mean net salaries over r6000 are good enough for brazil of course youd need to find a rent of max r2000 which means a workingclass neighborhood however social inequality is the main trouble there everything is made for the rich ones i mean you must be rich to make ends meet as the rich ones dont care of paying a fortune for anything the prices are always high everything here is more expensive including food although brazil is the food top producer as a result of this inequality são paulo is violent there are many nogo zones even next to luxurious neighborhoods a solution is living in the surrounding cities but our network transport system is inefficient and overcrowded not to say that if you commute by car our traffic is the worst in brazil and most drivers are crazy murders and you might be robbed at traffic lights i forgot to mention that our gas is the worst of the world and one of the most expensive if you knew that many people have already left sao paulo because living there was not worth id ask for a huge salary if the employer doesnt want to pay it you stay at you are easy isnt it unfortunately the city itself keep the poorest ones away juno on jun 14 2017  the website says the average salary in são paulo after tax is r224727 this a massive joke most working class people i know do not make more than r200000 per month i would say r1600 is a more realistic number but never forget loads of people still work under the minimum wage which is currently r93700 maris on apr 09 2017  to people who are considering moving to sao paulo beware to the continuous hike of living cost first it really depends on your lifesytle  location that you are staying if you are staying in sao paulo centro cost of living are much higher than neighboring city the amount you are willing to spend will determine if youre going to heaven or hell a meal at an inexpensive restaurant will cost you r15r20 where as highend restaurant can cost you up to r100  r200 per person been living in sao paulo for 4 years i used to spend around r2500r3000 in 2013 today accounts to a spending of r4000r4500 barely maintain the same qualitystandard i had in 2013 excluding rent to give you an idea cost of my electricity bill used to be r40 now im paying r120 with the same amount of usage take a look at the bus fare it certainly reflect the ridiculous hike of price here in brazil anonymous on mar 17 2017  lila haha welcome to brazil  thats our reality unfortunately you guys should quickly find a job and move to australia dont waste more time in brazil  all that you mention is true and also you forgot about the security problem i am moving to japan soon sandy on mar 05 2017  what is the average

safely i would really appreciate your help thanks anderson carlos d sanches on jan 16 2017  xavier good school r 1300  child weak school r 650 top school r 2500 kevin barnes on nov 11 2016  in brazil city centers are usually bad and poor in sao paulo for example the most luxurious areas are outside the city center and the center is where there are old buildings and a lot of poverty so when you see city center apartment costs in sao paulo they look unrealistic you should classify as first class property mediumclass property and working class property the same is true for a lot of cities in the world rio mexico df etc xavier on aug 07 2016  how much would i need to pay private school for my three kids in sao paulo they are between 6 and 9 years old ioannis on jun 06 2016  only for the purpose of guidance for those who wish to come and live in sao paulo i am brazilian i was born and live in sao paulo im 55 years old i am an architect and i live in alto de pinheiros next to vila madalena we can consider two neighborhoods of middle leg my salary is approximately 8000 rmonth to close my accounts of the month i need help from my wife our monthly cost is approximately 14000 rmonth and we have an outstanding standard of living when when we go out to eat is mostly in shopping malls the apartment in which we live is our property 2 bedrooms living room and a garage total 70 square meters we have two lowstandard vehicles a gol anda a an old fiesta  we need daily from internet and cell phone services which in brazil are very expensive and of poor quality without at least a car a cell phone and a computer you are nothing in sao paulo so forget come here who imagines that live with quality in the most simple neighbourhoods our which can be considered a privileged neighborhood is deluding yourself attention quality in brazil is not the same in europe or united states good luck to all vimal on apr 09 2016  im a nd indian boyim in relationship with a sao paulo girl im going to hershe is a nurse i ill be only 21 years old i ill not have a job is it possible to live with a nursewhats the salary of a nurse therea lab technician please tell me guys reinaldo gomes on mar 21 2016  i was born in sao paulo and live here for 30 years now though im planning to move on to canada currently im managing to live off my r2000 1600 after discounts salary and still i have to milk it for a little saving if i want to get to canada someday thats only possible as i live quite next to the slums on my own and im not paying for a rent since i live in my relatives house if youre coming to sao paulo by all means you should totally avoid living in berrinivila olimpia unless youre filthy rich as these are the most expensive places over here you foreigners who are invited to have a job over here are most likely getting top salaries anything above r5000 most of the population has a salary lesser than r3000 with the average being way way below that the prices listed here are about right but the stating that cost of living is higherlower than in x country is absurdly wrong i would say r3000 is the very minimum for a single person with an awful quality of life r5000 should be totally ok for a single person living midway between most expensive places and the slums having minimal fun on free time and decent quality of life comparing to other people here not other countries  but little to nothing to spare so many people manage to survive over here with r2000 or less while some other think r10000 isnt enough its up to you to find a neighbourhoodlifestyle where your salary fits in my final advice is if youre not getting paid at least 3x more in reais than you were in dollar dont even bother coming here adri on mar 18 2016

9000 reais as basic salary and a few extras that we didnt put in contract including nanny for our baby and travel to europe 2 times a year since the company is in vila olímpia área  i want rent

to stockholm  please help guys do you think 9000 as basic can be enough for me and family many thanks lila on feb 13 2016  hello i am an australian living here in são paulo with my brazilian fiancé who is a biomedical researcher i work a little bit teaching but we mainly live off his salary which is 6000 reais per month this isnt enough for us to live comfortably by comparison with a 1st world country we live in a small apartment smaller than ive ever lived and not even in a nice area of the city just average we spend 300 every 5 days at the supermarket and this is our main treat as we like to buy fresh produce we mainly eat at home and we still have no money left to save we dont go out much as we cant afford it neither of us have health insurance and we dont buy any clothes or personal items here as they are frightfully expensive anything imported here costs a fortune for anyone thinking to come here with a family living off 6000 a month right now is crazy as just a couple we struggle cost of living has gone up a lot with the economic situation here also you often cant rely on employers to pay salaries on time i really dont know how people with more simple jobs afford to live here i can only assume they live in a favela we cant afford to travel anywhere or eat at nice restaurants maybe once a month and when you do decide to go and do something in this city you battle with crowds of people doing the same thing bad traffic and some of the worst drivers in the world brazil is a country of beauty and nice to see for tourism but living in their cities is not a good lifestyle at all unless your earning double what we earn to have a fancy apartment and so you can travel to get away from the dirty hectic city life sorry but i would deter people from choosing to come here unless they are highly paid as i feel living off 6000 a month we are still poor not as poor as millions of people i know but theres nothing worse than only having enough to eat and put a roof over your head with minimal luxuries oldshark on jan 19 2016  hello to everybody im italian and living in são paulo since 2011 just to present some real data we need to consider that this town

way to save money if youre there for a short stay and youre american is to put most of your money in an american bank account and use your debit card the curren reality check on jun 16 2015  not to be a total wet blanket but costs in sao paulo vary significantly depending on the area you live and because the very definition of decent is intrinsic for the same quality of life i had in santa cruz ca in sao paulo it would be necessary r35000month approximately one can estimate the value of a regular apartment between r7000 and r14000 per square meter rent will cost 05 to 15 of that id say that for a two bedroom apartment in an ok area one would fork around r4 to r5000 rent  water  electricity  condo tax  city tax another couple of thousands for groceries if nothing too exotic comprises your menu  that would drive the prices up also for parents private schools arent cheap and in my opinion they are indispensable depending where in sao paulo one lives they could cost up to r4000 times 13 per year per kid id say that if one is middleclass in a 1st world country he would need some r25000 per month to keep the same quality of life in são paulo however if moving from a 3rd world country less would be needed same as carolina scagliotti id disagree with those that estimate a decent living in sao paulo for less than 5000 carolina scagliotti on jun 11 2015  maxwel and i hope im not too late but i have to disagree with andrew 4100 will barely cover your rentcondominioservices such as water eletricity and phone transportation and maybe groceries school this is a big deal are you

17 2014  jimmy the rent average calculated in numbeo is not accurate expect to spend more than 2500 brl or half of your salary just to keep an apartment in a reasonable neighborhood i recommend looking for places near metro stations in green yellow or blue lines the rest of your salary would be enough for transport and groceries i think 4900 brl for two is not enough to save any money an accepted ratio of rentsalary would be less than 40 or at least 6000 brl of salary after taxes from this point it would be easier to save money jimmy on jun 16 2014  hi everyone i want to go to sao
