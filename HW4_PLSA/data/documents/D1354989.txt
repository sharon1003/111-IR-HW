related articles what factors slow the absorption of carbohydrates does white rice affect diabetes types of amylase  carbohydrates list of slowrelease carbohydrate foods the absorption of too much sugar too quickly can cause your pancreas to produce extra insulin to facilitate glucose transport from your blood into your tissues some of the extra glucose may be converted into triglycerides in your liver and the fat may be shipped to your tissues thoughtful food choices and careful meal planning can help to prevent sharp rises in blood glucose that end up expanding your waistline glycemic index choose foods with a low or medium glycemic index or gi which is a numerical measure of how much and how quickly a single carbohydratecontaining food raises your blood glucose level individual foods are scored relative to pure glucose which has a gi of 100 foods with a value of 55 or less are considered low gi foods while medium gi foods have a value between 56 and 69 in general most lowstarch foods such as vegetables legumes and nuts and even some fruits have a low gi wholegrain breads and pastas have a medium gi and potatoes and refinedgrain breads and pastries have a high gi cooking a food usually increases its digestibility and its gi dietary fiber choose foods that contain natural dietary fiber especially the watersoluble forms of dietary fiber that are found in legumes vegetables fruits and some whole grains fiber is not digested in your intestines soluble fiber tends to increase the viscosity or thickness of the intestinal contents after a meal which slows carbohydrate digestion and glucose absorption oats and barley contain a soluble form of fiber called betaglucan and this type of fiber can lower the rise in your blood glucose level following a meal additionally soluble fibers are fermented in your colon to produce shortchain fatty acids that help to prevent your liver from secreting too much glucose into your blood during overnight fasting complex meals your meals are likely a complex combination of a variety of foods the fats in your meals can affect glucose absorption from starchy foods the simple act of putting butter on your baked potato can lower the rise in your blood sugar after eating the potato the smaller rise in blood glucose caused by combining fat with starch appears to be independent of the type of fat as polyunsaturated fats can have the same effect as saturated fats therefore try adding almonds which contain healthier polyunsaturated fat to your brown rice and including in your meal fatty fish such as salmon which is rich in omega3 fatty acids phytonutrients in addition to carbohydrates proteins fats vitamins and minerals plant foods contain many small molecules called phytonutrients that play important nutritional roles in your body polyphenols are a type of phytonutrient that can help to control your blood glucose levels polyphenols are present in whole grains but not in refined grains green tea and fruit berries are especially rich in polyphenols phytonutrients such as polyphenols lower the increase of blood glucose after eating starches because polyphenols may inhibit carbohydrate
