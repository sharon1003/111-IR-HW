understanding uninsuredunderinsured motorist coverage uninsuredunderinsured motorist insurance “um’ is a critical optional coverage that you add to your own policy that will cover you in the event that another driver causes an automobile accident and the driver has no bodily injury bi insurance or has less coverage than the value of your claim with an estimated 23 of florida drivers driving with no insurance at all you should consider this coverage mandatory you can purchase umuim coverage up to the same limits as you carry for bodily injury bi coverage you should always purchase the maximum available to protect yourself and your passengers to the same extent you pay to protect the other driver umuim coverage is usually much cheaper to buy than bodily injury bi coverage if you have more than one car on your policy you should elect to “stack” the coverage which efectively doubles the limits without doubling the cost of the coverage often when we meet with new clients they think they have umuim because they were told they have “full coverage” unfortunately in the industry “full coverage” is referred to as “fools coverage” this is because “full coverage” usually means the absolute minimum required by florida law which consists of personal injury protection and property damage coverage because umuim coverage is provided by your own insurance company there are additional contractual obligations on your part you have a duty to cooperate with your insurance company during their investigation of your claim this investigation can include an examination under oath euo or even an independant medical examination ime with a doctor selected by your carrier because um coverage is based on contract and not tort law the statute of limitations is five years whereas the claim against the at fault driver must be filed within four years if a claim requires litigation suit is usually filed against both the at fault driver and the umuim carrier within the four years if the claim is settled against the at fault driver but not with the umuim carrier permission must be obtained from the umuim carrier prior to accepting the settlement from the at fault driver in some cases where the at fault driver doesn’t have adequate coverage but they have personal assets the umuim carrier may not agree to waive their subrogation rights in order to exercise their right of subrogation the umuim carrier must pay you the client the amount the settlement with the at fault driver would have been this allows you to recover that portion of your damages without having to execute a release in favor of the at fault driver and your carrier may still pursue the at fault driver for those assets to pay any verdict in excess of the coverage in litigation we are not allowed to talk about insurance in most cases however in a umuim case the insurance company is the named defendant in these cases a jury must be more carefully screened to make sure there is no bias against either party ie won’t award you money because they are afraid their premiums will go up additionally we are not allowed to bolster our clients claim by stating they have faithfully paid their premiums on time for twenty years filing suit against your own insurance company may sound unusual however it is important to remember that you paid for this coverage to protect you in these types of unfortunate situations if your insurance company does not respond properly or handle the claim in an appropriate manner it is your right to pursue the claim in court in fact here in florida a law has been passed that specifically addresses “bad faith” situations where a carrier improperly denies the claim of an insured we help our client’s trigger that statute by filing a civil remedies notice along with the law suit when necessary question categoriesauto accidentsboating  pwv accidentsdog bite  injurylongshore harbor workers’ compensation actnegligent securitypremises liability  slip and fallvictim of a crime  duiworkers compensationwrongful death did you find the answer you were looking for if not email us your auto accident related question and we will send you back an answer auto injury attorneys at brumbelow drechsel in st petersburg florida represent clients throughout florida and most frequently the tampast petersburg metro area including clearwater tarpon springs palm harbor largo st petersburg tamapa lakeland pinellas park duneden safety harbor st pete beach madiera beach treasure island kenneth city seminole spring hill holidy new port richelyand odesa from counties including pinellas county hillsborough county citrus county manatee county sarasota county hernando county polk county and pasco county
