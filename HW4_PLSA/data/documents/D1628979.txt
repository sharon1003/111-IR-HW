managers are now expected to coach workers every day  nearly nine out 10 firms expect their managers and supervisors to deliver performance coaching as part of their daytoday work according to a new survey by the institute of personnel and development the vast majority of employers believe coaching can deliver tangible benefits to both individuals and organizations said the institute the majority of employers planned to increase the use of coaching over the next few years but not necessarily update the training of their managersleaders as coach it added the research also found that performance coaching provided by a manager or supervisor is becoming increasingly popular as the value of sustainable on the job learning is recognized in the workplace however research also suggests that if coaching is to deliver these significant benefits employers need to ensure that their line managers are provided with updated cuttingedge training as the manager as coach to be able to deliver the results because organizations are not investing enough in helping their managersleaders develop cuttingedge performance coaching skills there are some significant bottomline consequences in a recent large industrywide study it was found that most managers reported that they were confident in their ability to coach however the study showed that the managers’leaders’ skills levels as coaches were typically poor and that as a consequence they were not nearly as effective in their coaching as they believe themselves to be often times they believed that coaching consisted of just providing 1to1 instructional feedback to their staff members on what to do in a given situation to perform better however a welltrained managerleader as coach also supports their staff by using advanced developmental and learning tools and providing them with personalized selfcoaching strategies to achieve sustainable levels of performance most managersleaderssupervisorsteam leaders believe they are providing performance oriented coaching by simply providing positional technical skills training and feedback  many recent studies have shown that “technical skills” our natural skills and learnt skills through training and experience only represent at best 20 of the input into our performance the remaining 80 which affects our performance comes from our personal skills those crucial other elements such as our thinking and our behavioral aspects such as ability to choose or make a decision assertiveness authenticity commitment to grow concentration emotional stability enthusiasm judgment energy level resourcefulness honesty integrity openmindedness optimism persistence performing well under stress reliability selfconfidence selfcontrol selfreliance selfrespect initiative or drive etc few managersleaders understand just how deep rooted their own behavior patterns are let alone how to positively change them in other people peak performance coaching tools and techniques to create lasting performance change it is necessary to first understand the positive and negative influence that a persons personal skills has on the execution of their technical skills only when we fully understand a persons behavioral patterns and create positive selfmanaging coaching strategies can we assist a person to create lasting performance change performance coaching is frequently confused with other types of coaching such as executive coaching or leadership coaching performance coaching is a form of directive coaching versus executive coaching or leadership coaching which is a form of nondirective coaching broadly speaking coaching methodologies are either directive or nondirective in approach directive coaching involves the busy manager who sometimes acts as a coach telling instructing giving advice offering guidance giving feedback making suggestions etc nondirective coaching involves helping someone to solve their own problems the key to the success of nondirective coaching is that the responsibility for deciding and taking action on the outcome remains with the coachee throughout the nondirective approach places greater emphasis on the learning process with a specialist fulltime executiveleadership coach acting more as a catalyst for new awareness the directive style of coaching has been adopted as the model for coaching for performance such as helping provide people with direction guiding them in how to master new skills procedures tasks and meet performance goals etc performance c oaching methods have changed little in 10 years perhaps even 20 years the traditional performance coaching formula has many limitations for example the traditional approach focuses on a singleissue problem and assumes all individuals can work through it for themselves in a short time the traditional approach is also passive the traditional coach doesnt have time nor the techniques to help a person understand why they may be stuck with an unhelpful mental framework or unproductive behavior many poor performing individuals and teams who seem stuck never really change until the coach can assist them to think differently when managers are trained using outdated traditional coacheducation manuals the results are greater myths and confusion rather than improved clarity of knowledge if something  works  at least once in an important setting it is likely to be repeated as a  valuable  coaching procedure despite completely ignoring all the times it may not work it also follows that when an employee achieves some level of performance success the manager feels justified in hisher style of coaching however if an individual does not reach their set goals there can be a blamegame around what they and the manager did and did not do to cause the unsatisfactory result coaches need to understand the value in staying ahead of the rapidly evolving process of performance coaching the only way to improve coaching knowledge is to change the many unfounded beliefs into valid ordered knowledge that is coaching bestpractice processes and standards the introduction of orderliness if it is accepted also reduces error organizational team and individual performance results will remain disordered and inconsistent unless a standardized coaching approach and the same coaching methodologies are adopted by all managers with their employees it is imperative that coaching bestpractices and evidencebased principles are introduced to the coachs knowledge base a failure to keep abreast of an ever expanding knowledge base of performance coaching bestpractices will halt any progress in personal achievements and performance outcomes some definitions performance can be seen as the actual results vs desired results any discrepancy where actual is less than desired could constitute the performance improvement zone performance planning occurs when goals and objectives are established performance evaluations provide a comparison of actual onthejob performance to established performance measurement standards as a best practice the supervisor and the employee regularly discuss expectations performance standards and objectives set expectations gather data and provide on going feedback to employees to assist them in utilizing their skills expertise and ideas to produce results to provide this direction performance records and a coaching log are guides that can be used by supervisors in addition to their own best practices to gather data to provide ongoing feedback to employees regarding their performance performance measurement standards are communicated to employees with expectations for each position performance measurement is the process of assessing progress toward achieving predetermined goals while performance management is building on that process adding the relevant communication and action on the progress achieved against these predetermined goals to provide this direction managerssupervisors communicate to employees what is expected of them define satisfactory performance for those expectations and then monitor and evaluate the performance on an on going basis performance appraisal occurs when individual performance is formally documented and feedback is delivered performance coaching occurs when a managersupervisor using the indirect coaching model intervenes and provides feedback for the purpose of improving performance see below for further detailsperformance improvement is any effort targeted at closing the gap between actual results and desired results performance management is an ongoing dialogue between the managersupervisor and employee that links expectations ongoing feedback and coaching performance evaluations development planning and followup performance management should be both strategic about broader issues and longerterm goals and integrated linking various aspects of the business people management and individuals and teams it should provide the means to link individual and team performance with organisational effectiveness and the organisations mission performance coaching feedback is a process by which the coach provides effective and constructive feedback on the coachees performance of learned skills effective performance is reinforced and lessthandesirable performance is worked on to improve feedback should be information that highlights strengths positive behavior and a means for skills critiquing encouragement of new learning and the explanation of the relationship between what is expected and what has been accomplished after the work is performed or an action is taken feedback can take many forms it can be informal or formal
