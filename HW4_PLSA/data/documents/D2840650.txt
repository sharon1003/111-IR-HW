tightly packed group of stars within a larger formation the term almost exclusively refers to the central group of stars found in most spiral galaxies see galactic spheroid  bulges were historically thought to be elliptical galaxies that happened to have a disk of stars around them but highresolution images using the hubble space telescope have revealed that many bulges lie at the heart of a spiral galaxy it is now thought that there are at least two types of bulges bulges that are like ellipticals and bulges that are like spiral galaxies contents  hide 1 classical bulges2 disklike bulges3 central compact mass4 see also5 references6 external links classical bulges  editan image of messier 81 a galaxy with a classical bulge the spiral structure ends at the onset of the bulge bulges that have properties similar to those of elliptical galaxies are often called classical bulges due to their similarity to the historic view of bulges 2 these bulges are composed primarily of stars that are older population ii stars and hence have a reddish hue see stellar evolution  3 these stars are also in orbits that are essentially random compared to the plane of the galaxy giving the bulge a distinct spherical form 3 due to the lack of dust and gases bulges tend to have almost no star formation the distribution of light is described by de vaucouleurs law classical bulges are thought to be the result of collisions of smaller structures convulsing gravitational forces and torques disrupt the orbital paths of stars resulting in the randomised bulge orbits if either progenitor galaxy was gasrich the tidal forces can also cause inflows to the new merged galaxy nucleus following a major merger gas clouds are more likely to convert into stars due to shocks see star formation  by mass about 80 of galaxies in the field lack a classical bulge indicating that they have never experienced a major merger 4 the bulgeless galaxy fraction of the universe has remained roughly constant for at least the last 8 billion years 5 in contrast about two thirds of galaxies in dense galaxy clusters such as the virgo cluster do possess a classical bulge demonstrating the disruptive effect of their crowding 4disklike bulges  editastronomers refer to the distinctive spirallike bulge of galaxies such as eso 498g5 as disctype bulges or pseudobulges many bulges have properties more similar to those of the central regions of spiral galaxies than elliptical galaxies 6 7 8 they are often referred to as pseudobulges or diskybulges these bulges have stars that are not orbiting randomly but rather orbit in an ordered fashion in the same plane as the stars in the outer disk this contrasts greatly with elliptical galaxies subsequent studies using the hubble space telescope show that the bulges of many galaxies are not devoid of dust but rather show a varied and complex structure 3 this structure often looks similar to a spiral galaxy but is much smaller giant spiral galaxies are typically 2–100 times the size of those spirals that exist in bulges where they exist these central spirals dominate the light of the bulge in which they reside typically the rate at which new stars are formed in pseudobulges is similar to the rate at which stars form in disk galaxies sometimes bulges contain nuclear rings that are forming stars at much higher rate per area than is typically found in outer disks as shown in ngc 4314 see photo a hubble space telescope image of the central region of ngc 4314 a galaxy with a starforming nuclear ring properties such as spiral structure and young stars suggest that some bulges did not form through the same process that made elliptical galaxies and classical bulges yet the theories for the formation of pseudobulges are less certain than those for classical bulges pseudobulges may be the result of extremely gasrich mergers that happened more recently than those mergers that formed classical bulges within the last 5 billion years however it is difficult for disks to survive the merging process casting doubt on this scenario many astronomers suggest that bulges that appear similar to disks form outside of the disk and are not the product of a merging process when left alone disk galaxies can rearrange their stars and gas as a response to instabilities the products of this process called secular evolution are often observed in such galaxies both spiral disks and galactic bars can result from secular evolution of galaxy disks secular evolution is also expected to send gas and stars to the center of a galaxy if this happens that would increase the density at the center of the galaxy and thus make a bulge that has properties similar to those of disk galaxies if secular evolution or the slow steady evolution of a galaxy 9 is responsible for the formation of a significant number of bulges then that many galaxies have not experienced a merger since the formation of their disk this would then mean that current theories of galaxy formation and evolution greatly overpredict the number of mergers in the past few billion years 3 4 5central compact mass  editmost bulges and pseudobulges are thought to host a central relativistic compact mass which is traditionally assumed to be a supermassive black hole such black holes by definition can not be observed directly light cannot escape them but various pieces of evidence suggest their existence both in the bulges of spiral galaxies and in the centers of ellipticals the masses of the black holes correlate tightly with bulge properties the tightest such correlation the m–sigma relation relates black hole mass to the velocity dispersion of bulge stars 10 11 other correlations involve the total stellar mass or luminosity of the bulge 12 13 and the richness of the globular cluster system orbiting in the galaxys far outskirts 14 15until recently it was thought that one could not have a supermassive black hole without a surrounding bulge galaxies hosting supermassive black holes without accompanying bulges have now been observed 4 16 17 the implication is that the bulge environment is not strictly essential to the initial seeding and growth of massive black holes see also  editdisc galaxy spiral galaxy galactic coordinate system galactic halo galactic corona galaxy formation and evolution mass deficit m–sigma relation
