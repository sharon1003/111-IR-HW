mariah carey’s entire octave range is not seven or five submitted anonymously for those of you who remember mariah was in the guinness book of world records not to long ago for having a five octave range and singing a g7 when she sang the national anthem but that’s not true the note she sang was a b6 you can play this note on the piano if you don’t believe me however it was later found out that there was some tampering going on with the sound equipment and so she’s supposedly no longer in the book if you’ve been musically trained you know that octaves are arranged c d e f g a b and then c’ there are 8 octaves on the piano and to count octaves you start with the lowest note and count to the same note in the next octave until you get the range now in order for mariah to sing all eight octaves she’d have to be able to sing several notes lower than what any man can which is impossible even for someone with her range the lowest most men can sing is a g2 while there are those like viktor wichniakov a male opera singer who can sing c2 c1 in european standard mariah’s lowest note she ever sung was c3 at the end of my all and the beginning of emotions and you’re so cold–not a2 or d3 like some people keep saying a singer’s true range is measured by the number of notes they can actually sing–not necessarily hit you see in actuality mariah can only sing up to d7 the e7 she hit on emotions album version the f7 she hit on all in your mind and the g7 she hit in 2 live versions of emotions were all done when she was either congested or sick you see in order to access what is called the flageolet register the vocal cords are held closely together and a high pitched sound moves up into the sinus cavities when a singer is sick or congested the vocal cords become swollen making it easier to access this range but it can throw a singer off a little when this happens this explains why none of mariah’s songs with the exception of emotions and all in your mind have been written to go higher than d7 mariah herself has said that she’s hit notes she can no longer do if you’ve ever heard the clip of mariah singing all in your mind acapella you’ll notice she can’t go higher than d7 you can find that clip by going here wwwgeocitiescomnotesandoctavesmariahcareyhtml you’ll also find a clip of mariah singing her g7 and a g7 it was unintentional because it didn’t match the melody but i doubt some of the accuracy of what the author has written about mariah’s range that’s why i’m telling the information now so that nobody will get confused now if you have been paying attention mariah’s range c3 to d7 is 4 octaves and 1 note next mariah has 2 top vocal registers she can use one is called the “whistle voice” and the other is called “super head voice” contrary to popular belief whistle voice can be used by both females and males that’s right–men can do it too the only reason hardly anybody uses it is because the voice can be hard to control since the sound is moving into the nasal cavity and so it sounds soft and has a low volume super head voice on the other hand has a higher volume and a sharper sound and it doesn’t really move up in the sinus cavities it does take a little more effort than whistle voice but it’s easier to control it also sounds higher than whistle voice but it’s the exact same range–whistle voice has a lower volume because the tone of the voice is airy while super head voice isn’t and guys can sing as high as women and woman can learn to sing as low as men alto’s are most likely able to do this the lower your is the wider you can develop your range with practice if you’ve heard of adam lopez then you probably know he can sing d7 using super head voice technically he doesn’t hold the record for highest note ever because betty wright also uses super head voice and when she appeared on making the band ii when she was teaching sara how to control her voice she sang eb7 which is higher than d7 by a semitone so if anybody holds the record for singing the highest note ever it’s neither mariah or adam it’s betty wright mariah could hit those notes when she was sick but she couldn’t hold them because the notes in the 7th octave are almost impossible to actually sing i don’t expect many people to know this but this is the reason why no opera has ever been written in the 7th octave in conclusion i would also like to say that it is possible to have a range wider than mariah mariah fans don’t hate me for this because i’m a fan of her too i have a range wider than mariah since i’m a baritone i can sing down to a bb1 and up to a g6 or higher but neither whitney houston or christina aguilera have a wider range whitney has a 3 octave range c3 to c6–she did c6 on how will i know and christina has close to a 3 and a half octave range e3 to g6–the note she sang on the christmas song was d6 in super head voice august 18 2004 jeff c news 276 comments mariah carey« britney spears’ dildo shocker backstreet boys house of

i’m not a mariah’s fan but her range is g2 made during an interview and a2 in some songs her highest note is g7 made in a performance of emotions in 1991… so that her range goes from g2 to g7 moreover christina’s lowest live note is c3 made in some performances of at last her highest live note is a6 during por siempre tu live in caracas so her live range is c3a6 it’s true that in the christmas song she hit a d6 but after that note there’s her famous c7 search some videos on you tube to understand i leave you three videos in particular that you must see – ityoutubecomwatchvs0a hdcs hcg …this is

july 29 2008 at 549 amit’s not true some people care about octaves how many times do you hear people talking about mariah’s octaves i think a million times on you tube there are lots of videos about octaves gina says july 30 2008 at 1056 am what makes a good singer apart from measured by the number of notes they can actually sing and hold not necessarily hit i agreemoreover the ability to interpret the lyrics turning into a ‘believable’ live performance without overdoing it versatility good technique and fresh whitney is the voice of our time and sorry the rest is just a footnote below hergiacomo says july 31 2008 at 354 pmi love whitney’s voice is my second favorite singer but the first is christina aguilera she has such a strong voice such a high whistle register moreover the highest live whitney’s note in chest voice is g5 while christina did a g5a5 in this place we are talking about whistles don’t you think that christina goes pretty high i really love whitney but here

it runs awaygiacomo says september 10 2008 at 344 amwe are talking about whislte register so don’t talk about whitney cause she can’t whistle we are talking about mariah carey and christina aguilera and their vocal ranges whitney has just 3 octaves even if she has a great voice and she is the best singer with christina and mariah anyway i’m sure christina can hit an e7 in fact even herself said that she never forcd hr voice actually her range is 4 octaves and a semitone c3c7 while mariah has 5 octaves g2g7 jennifer s says september 17 2008 at 348 pm what about pat benatar she had a 45 octave range i believe you’re right about mariah and she christine aguilera both are nasal – comment on that pat benatar was never nasal she and whitney both had better tone joven says october 10 2008 at 110 am mmmm i just wanna point out some things about the low note thingies and wichnakov thing…uhmm hello she’s a woman…do you really expect that she can reach bass and as far as i know nobody claims that she can singhit 8 octaves…as far as i know the claim is only 5 octaves…and yeah let’s just say the highest notes were just some luck but she sang them with ease and she can hit them easilyand she sings so easily not like others who push and push…pierre says october 15 2008 at 744 am this post if full of a jealous whitney lover you don’t have to be sick to sing the whistle register you just have to have talent it is classified a gift when your sick and your throat is hurting please try to access it i wonder how you throat will feel plus she has done it live many many times and she wasn’t sick…pedro says october 18 2008 at 153 pm you are wrong check out for “you and i” tribute to stevie wonder where she hits a g2 lol and she has hit g7 and wasn’t sick because she can’t do the whistle if she is sick… besides she no longer is on the guinness book because georgia brown can hit a g9 and got the throne now…get your facts straight before talking giacomo says october 22 2008 at 1230 pmno mariah’s lowest note is g2 and georgia’s highest note is g10 and not g9bleak says october 29 2008 at 949 am she can’t really sing but people think that she can because she sings in her highest register the only reason she can sing in that is because she has nodules that make it easier for her to zip up her vocal chords toot says november 4 2008 at 621 pm she’s an amazing singer beyonce has a 32 octave rangemammamia says november 7 2008 at 534 pm mariah carey h8rsif its dat easy 2 sing like her n its not a gift then pleasefeel free 2 show me wot you gotgiv it ur best shot let’s hear…thot sou can h8 all you want bt she’s stil makin n breakin recordsshe’s beat elvis presley’s record n hopefully she’l beat d beatles’ record soon n u’l stil b arguin about disget a life bleak says november 10 2008 at 1024 am beyonce and jennifer hudson are both better singers jennifer hudson is better at singing than beyonce and mariah carey what i mean on the she can’t sing part is that she can’t sing as well as people really think she can she can sing but mostly sounds better in studio at times than she does live like when she sang the “star spangled banner” she can sing thoughbleak says november 10 2008 at 1049 am minnie riperton is and was definitely better than mariah carey tee says november 14 2008 at 910 amwhat a load of shcrackhead says november 16 2008 at 724 pm lmfao some people are just…ok…mariah’s vocal range is exactly 5 octaves nothing more nothing less her lowest note was sung during an interview when she did a vocal run going down to g2 she has sung a a2 during a “yours” performance in a uk tv show in 2003 in the “you and i” performance she hit bb2 a couple of times and loads of sustained with vibrato c3 and eb3 notes her highest note was a g7 which she clearly did with complete ease and effortless it was on the emotions performance in the mtv awards in 1991 on that final run she did a g7 followed by a g7 she also did g7’s and f7’s in other live performances of the same song and there is proof to substanciate these claims…both video and audio proof the whole “notes that are hit shouldn’t count” argument is pathetic bullsh there’s a lil’ technique called “staccato” used in opera as well…it’s where you ony hit notes it’s what mariah did in those g7 g7 and f7 runs in “emotions” and also what she did in “all in your mind” with those f7 notes she also proved more than able to do this song live with the high notes with ease…and she surpassed even the studio recordings so yes hit notes are obviously counted as well as long as they’re incorporated in the music and no i’m not a fan of hers used to be but no longer am however facts are factsbleak says november 18 2008 at 721 am minnie riperton had a five and a half octave range who do you think has a wider range bleak says november 18 2008 at 1029 am minnie riperton of course she sang higher than mariah ever has crackhead says november 18 2008 at 137 pm wrong minnie had a 45 octave range it is said she once hit an a7 in a live performance but there’s no proof at all of that the highest she displayed was d7 even if she did to have a 55 octave range she’d have to be able to go down to d2…when her lowest note is d3 that’s actually 4 octaves but i believe she was able to go a few more notes above d7 so yeah let’s say 45 octaves ash says november 21 2008 at 101 am mariah carey is the best singer in the world no matter what anyone says she has every special characteristic any good singer has plus a million of her own in other words if she sang someone else’s song she would sing it even better than the original singer but if someone if anyone tried to sing any of mariah’s songs – they would like idiots and sound like fools not only that but mariah’s lyrics are amazing they’re inspiring emotional so well written and beautiful totally her own unique style and her 18 number one hits are the support she’s just one around the beetles and just so happened to come out with an album this year after being in the music industry for 20 years now she writes her own songs produces them and sings them she’s got the hugest range best control most gorgeous voice she’s definitely the best singer in this world no doubtash says november 21 2008 at 106 am she has so many albums the most beautiful christmas album which is also the most successful xmas album of all time – and we get to listen to it next month yay and i don’t even know how many songs she began in the 1990’s and she’s still around with better music than anyone she never loses trend stays in with what’s going on and keeps coming out with music that fits the crowd she can go so low yet so high and all the bullsh about nodules she may have that make it easier to hit high notes or her being sick during performances in order to hit those notes is all crap said out of ignorance and jealousy for her one and only voice she’s the most talented person on earth for anyone that doesn’t understand or agree listen to at least 10 of her number ones google it if you must and prove me wrongash says november 21 2008 at 109 am find one singer that has as many songs as mariah carey who wrote the lyrics to each and every one of thembleak says november 21 2008 at 714 am whitney houston and beyonce have the better voices mariah carey definitely doesn’t have the best or widest range minnie riperton did have a wider range than she did she’s just said to have a wider range because of her million dollar insured legs and boob job the fact is that she’s a marketing genius like britney spears she has a nice voice and everything but the reason why she sold so many albums was because she’s so interesting to the public of course whitney had the bigger and better voice and beyonce has more control one of the reason’s why she had gotten to where she is today was because she did you know what with her first husband and that’s the truth bleak says november 21 2008 at 715 am there are a thousand more girls who can sing better than she can billy123 says december 16 2008 at 824 pm um a piano has a little over 7 octaves not 8guess you weren’t musically trained…hahhahaha says january 9 2009 at 1158 pm lmao at this article who cares get a lifeace music says january 13 2009 at 604 am this is humorous what is intriguing me is how some say within this article which includes the author is stating that hitting the note is not singing the note last i checked in my musical and singing theory when you hit the note with a certain technique to shape the note which is known as stacatto is singing the note  i absolutely agree with crackhead in her live version of emotions in mtv 1991 i believe she sings the notes melodically correct she goes up the scale a portion where thereby proves that she sings it as well as even belting the note which she does is classified as singing what confused me as well is that she was supposedly “sick and her voice was congested” according to my piano teacher and my theory books there is no way you can belt a whistled register note if your sick that is obviously stupid your sick and your whistling a f7g7 yeah ritio i’m sick and i can sing a1 yeah totally… and the statement of how men and female can hit the same notes as well as sing that is true but many males this is basically generalised used the falsetto to hit female notes for example males trying to sing mariah carey’s “we belong together” which is set around more than 12 bars of belting e5 highly unusual to see a male to belt e5 correctly without falsetto many males tend to utilise falsetto when it passes the c above middle c5 also when people are saying that there is a significant difference between hitting a note and singing the note true but we are talking about vocal range that thereby means your range of hitting and singing which last time i checked she can do both with her 5 octave range sheesh people… get your facts straight before twisting mariah carey’s vocal range around…bleak says january 15 2009 at 711 am any mezzosoprano can hit the same set of notes she does with a full voice without making that stupid squeal she has the same range as yma sumac you don’t have to squeak or scream to hit an a7 dianara torres says january 17 2009 at 1155 am so you have a range wider than mariah can we have a proof like a video… just so you can prove people including me wrong for thinking that’s a load of bullsht…alex says january 18 2009 at 500 amfu y’all you don’t know anything about music so don’t pretend that y’all do… and for the author of this article research everything before you post dumb ass sheralda says january 18 2009 at 425 pmwhat is minnie ripperton musical range because i saw somewhere where she was pitching d7 and there is a rumoured e flat 7does anybody know if that is truebleak says january 23 2009 at 657 am first of all alex all that i’m saying is true about her vocal nodules don’t get it twistedbleak says january 23 2009 at 658 am and i did do research i don’t need a video for whai i said to be true if you want proof do the research like i did don’t you feel motedbleak says january 30 2009 at 1021 amyou can look it up for yourself of course rachael says february 16 2009 at 518 am omgg cann all you’s stop hating on mariah seriously you obviously know nothing about her i will give you my reason why she is the best singer in this world she writes all her songs and they all are inspirational emotional moving touching and unforgetable they help a lot of people get through hard times in their life including me mariah has a god given talent and i am thankful to god for blessing such a beautifl inspiring talented women mrs mariah carey  shee isnt just the best seling female artist she has also more 1 hits then elvis presley she has 18 going on 19 if we can makee my love 1 wich i’m sure we can make it happen coz her fans lovee her and will suport her in anything she does jus lke me mariah also has a great personality and the best sence of humour and she is a very fun person even tho i dnt know her personaly i can tell in her interviews i lke to see you try sing one of mariah’s song hmm i wonder what u’s have achived in life besides being on the computer hating on celbes and arguing over something so small that propably isnt worth it but by the looks of it you’s have all the time in your life ohh and mariah also was poor growing up she had nothing she didnt go on american idol to be noticed she did it the hard way the best way and the smart way look at her now she is a world wide celebrity and one of the best role models so i think it about time you’s all stop hating unless you dnt have a life or nothign better to doo but do waht u want coz it dnt effect anyone not even mc she dnt take no notice to the haters coz she knows she has a lot of realcommiteddevoted fans and i am one of them and proud of it lol and yeah i propbably went a bit over board p but that’s what happens when peoplee dis mariah or hate on her pleasee mariah i wish for you to come to australia one day  god bless mariah some mroe i lovee mariah careyyy  mariah carey lamb for life ybleak says february 17 2009 at 1044 am she just has marketing smarts she’s definetely not the best singer in the world and she got to the top by dating her manageri can go higher says february 18 2009 at 404 am well the highest note i can hit is the c8 same as adam lopez … dammit   but the highest note i can hold is g7 just a few notes lower anyway apparently when mariah hit that g7 live the sound had been tampered with which was one of the many reasons she got removed off the guinness world records book but indeed she has got quite a great voice and yes i am a fan of her but she hasn’t got the highest vocal range but … on another note … there’s a singer called camille with a song called money note where she goes into the 8th octave in the back and you can hear it on you tube if you wish to listen to the song and see a singer with a higher vocal rangei can go higher says february 18 2009 at 408 amoh and forgot to say i could hit the c8 when i had a cold too because i practice it a lot lol but anyway when your sick you have to put a little more effort if you’ve got phlegm blocking your airways but yeah i can go high whilst sickbleak says february 19 2009 at 710 am the only reason why mariah was able to hit these notes was because of her nodules what happened to her voice she sounded terrible on xfactor and obama’s inaugural ball she has been seen smoking a few times juddy says february 25 2009 at 506 am sorry everybody but i have to update all of you georgia brown is the official holder of 2 vocal range records on guinness book she’s a great rbsoul singer she has 8 octaves g2 to g10 check her voice at youtubecomgeorgiabrown and her my space myspacecomgeorgiabrownsinger  i was searching for singers whistlers and i descovered her powerful and impressive artist it will be great you know this wonderful singer bleak says march 3 2009 at 917 am i’ve heard her sing and she cannot sing good she only has a wide range you can have the widest range and still not know how to sing britney spears makes better music than georgia brownsos says march 5 2009 at 951 amall i’ve gotta say is ‘mariah carey o holy night from the chritms album 1994 find it and listen to it’ in my opinion that took her to a higher level i’ve ever herd from anyone in my life whitney jennifer etc it put her up their with pavaroti obvi not the vocal range but the power of the sound i’ve never found whitneys voice that good its amazing but very limited there’s only power in whitneys and jennifer voices listenin to mariahs early 90s stuff fu the mainstream singles everything else on the albums i was fuin fascinated she sounded super human she can’t do it no more but the point is she did it the cor says march 8 2009 at 558 pm i can sing and hold c7 pretty easy and when i’m sick i can go off the piano but i’m not alloud to sing in the house in case i brake the crystal glasses not to mention it kills my earsdd says march 14 2009 at 123 pmcome to divadevoteeblogspotcom to hear her lowest g2 and highest note f7cruznicoyahoocom says april 22 2009 at 529 amim nikko  i love music  and i even do whistle  but i don’t know how many octave that i can hit but i can reach the whistle of mariah in “mine again” atlast 78 seconds with curls is anybody can tell me any way i re aly love this site even your discussions guys am gonna read every comments of each participantscutie  nikko shocked says may 11 2009 at 848 pm what about greg pritchard he was featured on britain’s got talent he’s very rough and received a shock factor award in this arena due to his agelooks henry 4m s africa says may 17 2009 at 1257 pm rapheal thanks bro  i couldn’t have said it better  if mariah sing it or hit it g7 doesn’t matter  because no one else has done what she does  and for you haters  back the hell of because if you have ever notice when searching for vocal abilities you would find mariah name there  even though you hate her doesn’t it mean that you have to write lies of her  because you know what  her lambs will always be here to back her up  and last but definitely not the least  she is the best in everythingmaxine says may 23 2009 at 514 pm first of all bleak i love you i heard about that other woman who has a range like mariahs your right i searched wikipedia there’s a lot of talk about how high carey’s voice is is someone really the best singer in the world because they can hit high notes i bet mariah fans hate toni braxton and have a lot to say about her mariah carey is a soprano not everyone is a soprano to aspiring singers this is kind of sad if they don’t fit your mold of what a singer’s supposed to be  high notes selfwritten songs y’all say ef em when did good singing become all about range maxine says may 23 2009 at 524 pm even god sings in his spare time i guess god doesn’t make people better than him he’s already the best at everything he blesses people like carey to inspire the world that’s why she can definately be the best singer in the world but hardly be better than the creater who could sing much better in a heavenly duel god blesses robin says june 6 2009 at 911 am at maxine mariah carey is an alto beacause what matters the most determining a range is the lowest note not the highest and g2 is about as low as it gets for a womanlook it up about mariahs range a hit is a hit 5 octaves it is but what really matters is the quality of a voice mariah careys’ voice has good quality but some singers have better qualtities that why i must say that mariah may have a huge range but it is not the best range i listen to her songs 2 though and to all people telling their own vocal ranges here idiots i bet you can’t even sing robin says june 6 2009 at 913 am correction what matters the most are the lowest note and the the sound light or deepfull judging mariahs natural voice she is definently an alto she said so herselfbleak says june 9 2009 at 617 am there are singers that can sing better than mariah carey jenn hudson fantasia beyonce… need i go on just because you have a wide range doesn’t mean your the best singer just look at georgia brown she can’t sing at all she sounds like one of those dog whistles she doesn’t have 5 octaves and she only gets so much recognition cause she’s a marketing commercial geniusash says june 13 2009 at 125 pmbleak…jenn hudson is only louder than mariah which doesn’t mean better fantasia can’t sing better beyonce can’t sing better so…yeaphillip says june 23 2009 at 610 am actually mariah holds notes in her live concerts like singing vision of love whistle note in c7 during teom tour…shd get your facts right if you are writing on your favorite singer…no offence derrick says july 10 2009 at 406 am helloi love mariah and whitney actually and at least i now know how their voices ranges but what about tina arena i have been looking for her voice profile and couldn’t find any except that people are saying that she’s a dramatic soprano but i actually want to know tina arena’s range in octaves anybody musically trained here could possibly help thank you derrick xxxporcelain cougar says july 12 2009 at 929 am all of you are talking about the mariah carey of the early ’90’s she was back then nothing short of amazing what we heard in the studio she could easily do live as evidenced by mtv’s “unplugged” and at the “grammy” shows vision of love if it’s over her technique back then was flawless at around 1995 she on her own admission said she was a workaholic in the studio till 5 am only to do morning shows singing talking back to the studio so on and so forth technique goes out the window and you end up with nodules on your vocal chords nodules are bumps caused by singing incorrectly what results is a scratchy dry sounding vocal and the worst part of nodules the singer is left with half the range they had this is exactly what has happened to mariah it is not age i know to you folks 14 19 think 40 is old not true the sad part of the whole story here all of this could have been prevented with rest the damage is permanent axlhehe says july 18 2009 at 349 amhello mariah carey’s voice is so fresh that she hits the g7 whistle trademark effortlessly i think if you let other singers to perform the g7 they would need to take a deep breath and shoutin the just stand up take it as a sample for it you could hear that she is performing the g7 in the line of fergie at the last part you could hear her singing with the g7 up up up up …so the octave 5 is it and bleak you thin that mariah is not the best octave singer so go on with your feelings…will says july 25 2009 at 1107 pm you are all wrong the live performance of emotions she hit a g7 her lowest note was a bb2 she has never tried to break her own record her old vocal coach said she could sing off the piano if she tried to break it i’m sure she could she has a 5 octave range as far as we know she could have a wider range thoughgabriel says august 23 2009 at 424 am the best voice is julie andrews she isn’t modern pop but she can slay a legion of mariah careys with he natural modal vocal range many may disagree with me but i don’t think falsetto and whistle register should be considered part of someones range because it’s not part of their natural or modal voice that being said mariah’s range is ony about 2 octaves of natural modal singing voice she can’t hit b6 but julie andrews canriil says september 7 2009 at 923 amwill… you r the real one… hey… falsetto n whistle register r part of singing n someone range… n whistlin is not the only great thing bout mc… her vocal tone is very rich n soulful…  she is one of some rare female singer who can sing in the lowest note for female… n even toe there r svrl female singer who can hit whistle note but mc can sustain her whistleup to 18 scnds… her chest voice is really rich the same goes to her low note voice…bleak says september 9 2009 at 617 am beyonce fantasia and jenn hudson all have stronger voices and mariah mariah has a nice voice and all the other three are better and it’s not just them so yeah and if ya didn’t know now ya dobleak says september 9 2009 at 622 am i like mariah crey’s voice and all but she’s no better than any other singer she can sing but let us be honest her voice and singing ability has gone down since her first coming outpaulo says september 23 2009 at 413 pm mariah carey has already been considered the best singer or the woman with the best voice of all time by people who know what they’re talking aboutnot a bunch of ” i know it all in this blog” she does not have 7 octaves as firtly credited to her but it is around 5 and 55 also the whistle register is not something common the experts say it is something unique and very few singers can do it so her voice is considered to be very special indeed unique in factryan smith says september 25 2009 at 1248 pmyou people have absolutely no lives bleak says october 9 2009 at 1035 am she can’t touch aretha franklin or whitney houston there are a lot of singers who are better than her just because you have a wide range doesn’t make you the best she doesn’t have the widest range either don’t cise her laura says october 9 2009 at 1240 pm does it really matter b e f g c whatever mariah can hit some very high notes and let’s just leave it at that misterbee says october 15 2009 at 1122 pm anybody that says that fantasia beyonce and jennifer hudson are better singers are delusional mariah is a trillion times better than all of them despite the fact that i love beyonce and i like jennifer hudson they are not nearly as good however fantasia is very whiny exxtremely mariah is one of the greatest out there and those of you that think otherwise are jealous haters she is better than whitney but nobody beats aretha franklin craig says october 27 2009 at 618 am mariah is the greatest she proved that many times the best female’s voice in the history of musicchronoxelsis says october 29 2009 at 1007 pmhmm mariah is definitely the best singer “emotions” was also one of her greatest songs proved that she could sing “low” notes and very “high” notesbleak beyonce has only louder voice and that doesn’t mean that beyonce is better than mariahand by just listening to the two voices you can already compare who has better voice is it beyonce or mariahanother question bleak can beyonce really hit the g7 have you heard her singing the whistle registerand also mariah can hold whistle register notes long but steady which is rare to normal singers like her you can hear her performing that in the song “we belong together remix feat jadakiss and styles p even she consider herself as an alto with 5octave range but her voice quality is really for sopranos…chronoxelsis says october 29 2009 at 1012 pmand i also think that beyonce could not even do he “falsetto register” rightjames says october 30 2009 at 818 amobviously speaking it is mariah who won this pact… she is a mile ahead than any singer in this world… whitney’s voice is too common it’s easy to imitate… christina’s is too loud and a kinda eardrumbreaker they’re both terrible singers have you ever heard a voice similar to mariah’s none… because mariah is mariah she is gifted and deserves to be in prominence… she is very rare and we’re proud to have her…nobody can beat her… her super head voice can flush away whitney and christina how come if we consider her whistle talents all haters you’re very annoying… you don’t understand the principles of choosing the bestest singer ad it’s mariah carey foreverchronoxelsis says october 31 2009 at 129 amgo james your the man tpballer3361 says november 3 2009 at 1038 pm james said it all mariah is and always will b the best nobody can touch herbleak says november 20 2009 at 1115 am you have to be delusional if you think mariah’s voice is better than jennifer hudson fantasia or whitney they all have stronger better sounding voices just because you have a wide range doesn’t mean you can sing great whitney influenced mariah not the other way around fantasia is more souful sounding than mariah and her hoarse dried up vocal chords mariah’s easy to imitate except for when she squeals beyonce’s voice is definetely musch more stronger than mariah’s voice mariah’s performances ain’t lookin to good whitney will emberass mariah on stage beyonce is not the one who screams mariah is mariah does have a beautiful voice but it definitely is not the best whitney jennifer aretha fantasia and beyonce can sing circles around her whitney houston had a drug problem and still sounds better i tell the truth and nothin but it person says november 20 2009 at 432 pm i am a big beyonce fan… i was blown away by jennifer hudson’s ‘and i am telling you’ … who is fantasia   i like whitney and aretha  and i adore celine dion but my favorite is still mimi you all have your own opinions but when it comes to chest belting they are better than her although none of them can beat her with the rest of the registers mariah has strength and control in her voice definitely better than minnie when it comes to the whistle register i believe that mariah’s voice his downgraded but she did hit those notes i’m not a music expert but i’m trying to make a point that each one of these singers have gifts that shouldn’t be argued about because they are all unique axels axiom says november 21 2009 at 1028 pmhi to all i’m a big mariah fan a great thing a singer must have is hisher vocal range who could a singer sing soulfully if heshe has poor vocal range it’s true that beyonce whitney houston and fantasia sings louder but mariah can throw them off by her super head voice says november 22 2009 at 334 pmit depends on the piano to say how many octaves it has it can range from as little as 5 octaves to as big as nearly 9nicole says november 23 2009 at 725 am i myself can be said to have almost a 5 octave range however the power of my notes is poor although i can hold them in a sound studio or with sound equipment then it would be fine but you can’t compare that to pure raw voice as found in the opera mariah and christina wouldn’t be able to sing most of their range over an ochestra without sound equipment check out joan sutherland for “the voice of the century”ezekiel says november 25 2009 at 242 ammariah’s range is 55 octavesit’s from f2c8she reached c8 in her charmbracelet tour as she sings with a man playing the organ from a whistle headtone to that note f2 was recorded in sweetheart though actually in dreamlover she reached a note lower than f2her highest claimed note is g7 and that was in a live performance of emotions and that is realthe studio version of all in your mind’s highest is at f7 while whwn she sings it liveshe does it at a d7divadevotee says november 26 2009 at 955 amcome see heres and others ranges at divadevoteeblogspotcom her newest album has her showcasing just under 5 ocataves diamond boy 69 says december 3 2009 at 322 am i think mariahchristinabarbara minnie whitney in her hey day arewas all great singers when it comes to live performance christina and before whitney voice was ruined have performed the best live i wanted to know what is vanessa williams and maxwell vocal range diamond boy 69 says december 3 2009 at 332 am if you guys are real vocal buffs check out rachel ferrel talk about a range she is a jazz singer that would sit them all down lol i don’t think you can say any of these people are not good or this blog would not exist  – bleak says december 4 2009 at 1112 am mariah carey does have a wide range but whitney beyonce aretha and jennifer have stronger and better voices i’ve heard of rachell ferrel and she couldn’t sit a person down if she had a chair sarah vaughn is better than her so is ella fizgerald and billie holidaybleak says december 4 2009 at 1112 am whitney sings circles around christina richrrs r southwick says december 9 2009 at 109 am hey has anyone heard of linda lewis from the uk she was at her best in the 70’s i think she has a 5 octave rangederek simmons says december 11 2009 at 1133 ammariah has a 5 octave range for sure i personally witnessed this so lets put doubt to rest on thisderek simmons says december 11 2009 at 1134 amhas anybody remember lisa fisher crazy vocal range jama says december 16 2009 at 1136 am i think that you are a hater first of all it is possible that mariah carey did sing that note in the national athem her mother can sing 7 octaves…you should take into consideration jama says december 16 2009 at 1138 amblek your crazy if you think that beyonce sing better than mariah carey doeslameof1991 says december 21 2009 at 1136 pm mariah is mariah…and she really sang the note g7 and that’s the proof that her vocal range is 5 octaves or something like that… and for god’s sake is there a human compare her to beyonce what on earth is goin on… beyonce is not singing properly she keeps on screamin and it hurts my ear everytime she belts the note…and futhermore she’s an entertainer just like madonna or shakira…you knowshe dances but not sings so if someone thinks that beyonce is better than mariah … it means that heshe is kinda deaf or somethin… so sad but it’s true…loldinchh says january 4 2010 at 203 amoh god there are lot of noncommissioned judges here… bleak all of you have to accept that mariah is the best singer ever…no one can compete her even whitney also definitely whitney is great…somehow she is under mariah…morover mariah has won a lot of awards and it was from by the commissioned judgeand not from judje like bleak who wasn’t knew anything about music… however mariah carey has 5 octave range… 5 octave range…all of you here can’t hit n defeat herso why don’t just shut up and try practice how to be a superwomen like her… s judah says january 8 2010 at 758 amdinchh are you insane you think it’s the octave range that makes a great singer i have news for you its the centre of gravity of the voice and it is that which gave elvis the ability to sing songs of a range that no recording artist has even come close to to quote“presley’s range albeit impressive in its own right did not in itself make his voice that remarkable at least in terms of how it measured against musical notation what made it extraordinary was where its center of gravity laid by that measure and according to gregory sandows music professor at columbia university elvis was all at once a bass a baritone and a tenor a most unique attribute amongst singers of any gender both in the classical and popular music fields ”as for trying to compare the no 1 hits  actually she and elvis are  despite what billboard says however she will have more no 1 in the us outside the us she is far behind elvis and the beatles eventually than elvis and the beatles but to get no 1 singles these days you sell less than a 13 compared to when the beatles and elvis had their charting records so her sales will never ever get close to elvis’s or the beatles and this is only partly reflected by the fact that elvis has 89 singles certified gold and platinum by the riaa compared to mariah’s 35 don’t get me wrong i like mariah but there is only one kingdinchh says january 9 2010 at 123 amwhatever but back to our real topic mariah careyagain mariah carey… and agian its all about mariah s judah we are not talkin bout king or elvis or beatles n so on… dunt know la if you can’t read or misinterpret whatever it is mariah is the real queen… not king yeah s judahjudah says january 9 2010 at 118 pmdinchh mariah is the real queen…i am not going to disagree with you too much she has a hell of a voice and i really admire her return after all the slack she tookjake says january 10 2010 at 603 amyeah…who cares about that she has made great songs and recorded incredible vocals…nobody can beat her…she’s the voice hits talent diva songbird great and the best selling female artist of all time to remind you mr anonymousdinchh says january 10 2010 at 940 pmjudah why don’t you just agree that mariah is the real queen hell of voice oh my god…are you crazy know whatdon’t you ever came out with statement that can kill yourself lorh… can u please stop dreaming… huhu…seems like you are the greatest singer… by saying mariah’s voice like hell… beware lorh…all people in tiz world might say you are crazy dude… christianus says january 15 2010 at 118 am mariah carey has the synchronised whistle ever she can control a very high deep and parallel whistle don’t belive listen to the emotion bridge part whistle my saving grace  bridge part whistle also no one canm perfectly whistle like her it’s hard to make ur whistle nice eventough you have the ability to whistle poor whistle disastrous the song minner ripperton having another tune of whistle even she possessed a high octave than mariah possessed…memoirs of an imperfect angel says january 26 2010 at 711 am let me tell you guys that range really does matter to a singer if mariah has a 5octave range who are the singers that can beat her yeah of course all of you will say that georgia brown does but what a terrible voice she has beyonce on the other hand may sing louder than mariah but is loudness important to a great singer beyonce has a scrunchy voice whitney houston an easytoimitate voice fantasia hehehehe i don’t know her well mariah the greatest female voice she has a high range melismatic style of singing and a good looking girl as everyone knows she already sold 160 million albums thoughout her career and who knows that her latest album could pack up a punch to the record and s judah we’re talkin’ her about mariah and she is a female why did you reach into discussing elvisdinchh says january 30 2010 at 553 amno need to relate s judah in this article… s judah definitely can’t read carefully and always misinterpreted what are people been saying of… we were talked about mariah but it was suddenly been worst by involved elvis… so people… can you imagine how ‘stupid’ s judah is…jenpuff says january 30 2010 at 1106 pm i love whitney mariah christina and beyonce as far as i’m concerned it’s apples and oranges and peaches and plums does anyone else feel this way they are like colors of the rainbow in regards to the octave discussion all of these ladies sing an awful lot go through physical ups and downs and like with athletes things change sometimes on a daily basis one thing about going low though is that it’s a question of size of chords… that explains why men can sing as high as women by training to reduce the vibrator “mass” to sing higher notes think of the thinner strings on a guitar or violin playing the higher notes while women can’t really “enlarge” their chords… they can merely train to sing some low notes without distortion which can in fact be several semitones lower that without training it but not like an octave lower back to the guitar analogy your thickest string is the lowest… try loosening it and then try to play it without it sounding like a fartdavid says february 1 2010 at 1129 pm ok so you people who say her live range is g2 to g7 false that’s a line of all the notes she’s ever hit when she sings she can really actually only go down to an a2 just a semitone higher then what she’s ever hit and as for her whistle notes well it was explanned a range is based on the ability to sing a note and not to hit it so technically she can only sing up to e7 it’s not d7 she’s proven sometimes to hold her own on e she sang f7 and g7 while being sick g7 was not intended and was never attempted or hit again by her after that one performance also her live range would be b2 lowest ever demonstrated while singing and d7 highest she’s been able to consistenty show i am a fan don’t get me wrong but there is a difference between being actual and living in a fantasy studio proven range – a2f7 actual consistent notes – b2e7 range of notes ever hit wether sick or lucky or just speaking – g2g37anthony lindo says february 2 2010 at 239 amyeah…l8s say so that she cnt have he octave range of 7 or 8 but we cnt deny that idol mariah carey can reach an extraordinary high pitch voice which an ordinary person hardly cnt perform…for me nothing’s more than her…she’s the greatest 1 singer 4 me ever…anthony lindo says february 10 2010 at 429 amits really obvious 4 a singer to reach a 8 octave voice…butremember idola mariah carey can reach an extraordinary high pitch voice…especially whistle voice…always think that mariah is the only singer who almost use each of her songs accompained with high pitch whislt voice…mcanthony lindo says february 12 2010 at 346 amam hi guys wil you please oll of you to col or txt me 4 we cn communic8 about the comments…tnx in advanceanthony lindo says february 12 2010 at 350 amam 8s relly funny to hear that idol mariah cnt have the 5 or 8 or watever octave voice is that but we ol knw that she cn hit an extraordinary high pitch voice…the question is “who are the other singer you can comment to beat har pitchanthony lindo says february 13 2010 at 309 amam…hai guys gud pm am heres my  am don’t 4get to col or txt me huh 4 we can talk about the voice of my idolyour idol our idol… mariah careyricki says february 16 2010 at 1110 pm i think its hilarious how you are all on your high horses about how you are supposedly better than her and how this person is better than her etc etc whoever claimed beyonce has a better voice i cannot stop laughing at mariah has a voice like an angel and yeah it may not be as loud as whitney but it is beautiful to listen to and at least she writes her own songs she has a distinct voice and people who keep hating her are just jelous i have one question if you are a better singer than her then y aren’t you as near famous as her or even better as even successful as her and the stupid comment on how she only did well due to being married to tommy you know deep down you sound stupid people don’t love artists because of who they are married to but love them for their talent and i can definately say her songs have touched many and have given inspiration to manymitchievous12 says february 18 2010 at 1209 pmi love mariah carey she is 5 octavemarjoriergolden says february 24 2010 at 1234 pmyo dumbass mariah vocal range is a g2 to a g7 5 octvaes not 4 you idiotanthony lindo says february 27 2010 at 125 amhai…guys…we all really knoe that idol mariah carey can reach certain high notes which a normal person can’t hardly to reach……we know that she have the g2g7 vocl range…plus she can access easily the whistle voice in any stylish notes…like a calling bird ezekiel says february 28 2010 at 954 pmmariah’s voice now isn’t as good as the 90’s but it has a different soundher voice when belting especially the f5s and g5s sound so much different from most singers todaybeyoncejojopink and other singers cite mariah carey as their greatest influence…and she “initiated” the use of vocal runssustaining g4bb4 for 18 secondsa f6c7 for 18 seconds…a c5 for 1415 seconds…and mostly e5s…her voice is hard to mimicher voice was produced by her vocal nodules she had all her life…and she even sounds like a young boy sometimes…her voice today is “edgy” than raspy…and she puts so much letters in her songs and if you try to sing these fast paces songs of heryou will run out of breath…robin says march 6 2010 at 656 am oh and for those in doubt… listen to this this is the range of 8 octaves youtubecomwatchvl ka qzgwxy vg john doe says march 21 2010 at 620 pm mariah carey has a 5 octave range either way it goes it is impossible for a male to have a wider range than a female especially when referring to mariah carey any note that you may hit that may be higher than any that she hit… is simple like you said… sickness congestion etc… moral of the story… mariah carey does have a 5 octave vocal range find something more constructive to do with your time rather than writing a paragraph about someone’s vocal rangebleak says march 30 2010 at 1102 am actually it whitney houston who started the vocal runs lol she influenced mariah carey and the only one who i’ve heard sing and run out of breath while singing mariah carey on her own songs lol beyonce sings james smoksweedingswerth says april 10 2010 at 629 pm as far as i’m concerned a singer’s range is their natural fullvoice range – period head voice superhead voice “whistle voice” wtf is that  i’ve been around professional music for 30 years and never heard that term basically falsettos of any type don’t count toward a singer’s “range” mariah if she is lucky has a three octave range not four five or any other such nonsense lately she can’t get into her higher false registers at all which just makes my point james smoksweedingswerth says april 10 2010 at 636 pm ps – your “range” is just that… the ability to sing consistently up or down diatonically to a note mariah hits some very high falsetto notes but they come out of nowhere and she cannot enunciate words in those pitches iow it’s just a form of vocal trickery – a gimmick and as most gimmicks go hers is gone she can no longer “sing” in “whistle voice” at all… which proves my point it is not part of her natural vocal range any more than david lee roth’s high pitch squeals are part of his actual range james smoksweedingswerth says april 10 2010 at 645 pm mc does not have a 5 octave modal natural range that’s just ridiculous and frankly ignorant of all you douchebags who insist on spreading that misinformation go to any music school on the planet and ask one of the voice professors they will concur with me a “normal” human range is two octaves really good singers can take it a few steps either direction for three octaves she has a maybe 3octave modal range – maybe – and two octaves of trickery ie “head voice” whistle voice – whatever nikki says april 15 2010 at 231 am and how do you know that she was either congested or sick when she sang singing emotions where you even there bleak says april 20 2010 at 219 pm whitney houston could always sing better than mariah carey and mariah carey has a wider range than whitney does you could have the widest range in the world and there’ll still be more talented singers than you have you ever heard of georgia brown lol laurie says april 25 2010 at 750 pm finally people who know about octave voices there are not to many singers who can do this whether the singer has an octave 3 4 5 or whatever not to many have that octave at all mariah carey i understand what heshe is trying to say and yes she did have that voice and the guinness book or records would not post something not proved she now has a lower octave voice since her accident which is why some people say no and yes the others with this voice are mj and at the age of 10 talking about men hitting it whitney in her day christina aguilera kelly clarkson is almost there then there is the amazing powerful voice of which we must remember she didn’t even win that year and i don’t even know who did i am taking jennifer hudson amazing voice mj also noted james brown back then for hitting that note then there is the singer that sang solo with mj in “this is it” unbelievable he does know how to pick them can you see brit up there she can’t sing she’s to squeaky and mousy i don’t like her voice at all i have no clue why the girl with mj didn’t go solo and make albums she’s unbelievable go listen carefully to her voice so that’s it whether it be 3 4 or 5 and 6 they are the only ones tony says april 28 2010 at 841 pm“a singer’s true range is measured by the number of notes they can actually sing–not necessarily hit”absolutely i’ve been saying this for years but whenever i said it in regards to a specific singer i was deemed a “hater” people sometimes fail to consider that studio recordings are not necessarily indicative of a singer’s range  ability as those recordings are often altered or enhanced technology during live performances can also enable editing of a singer’s output if you’ve ever played around with mics hooked up to modern sound systems you’ll know about the various vocal effects you can achieve by modulating a few audio settingsnicho says may 8 2010 at 617 am i can’t stand reading this bullsh but i have to correct one false statement mariah did hit g7 during her live performance of “emotions” at mtv vma 1991 not on national anthem anyone wants to correct all of this sh daniel avila agt says may 13 2010 at 912 pm actually mariah s lowest note is an eb2 e2 in studio and live is gb2 g2 but during her live performances she always plays around with her voice and singshits all these crazy notes she has also done a g7 in a rare recording of emotions in 1991 so her full range counting studio and live simply because mariah can sing and she is not a studio altered voice her range that she has displayed in her career so far is e2g7  that’s 52 octaves her recent highest  which was in a live performance of iwkwli on the view she sang not hit she sang an eb7 e7 and couple of times in her tour so the song in which she displayed 2 e2 is in sweetheart  her 1998 rendition she did it in an octave unison and in background an she does ann e2 in bliss and a bunch of f2s and few e2s … and she hit an f7 in mine again so that’s a semitone away from a g7 so she can definitely sing a g7 with ease daniel avila agt says may 14 2010 at 645 am bleakmariah s primary influences are the following steve wonder aretha franklin al green the clark sisters gladys night and minnie riperton she also enjoys patty labell diana ross michael jackson michael bolton shirley ceaser mariah got signed with colombia records in early 1989 and began on her album then whitney could be like someone she heard on the radio and was blown away and was like ” now i’ve got competition” but she defiantly surpassed her in terms of artistry vocality musicality originality lyrically sales etc etc yes whitney did popularize melasma and runs but she got it from her mother and her cousin dionne warwick whitney houston is a better version of her mother and her cousin mariah made it so much better in my opinion mariah has been ranked twice as having the greatest voices of all time mariah carey is so immensely diverse and versatile she has sung country reggae pop hiphop rock jazz doo wop auto tune soul blues rap etc she has covered and mastered every register with in her range and adds beauty and spark and originality and creativeness and her studio work and artistry is impeccable just because whitney sings louder doesn’t make her better just because beyonce dances better doesn’t mean she is the better singer just because jennifer hudson is louder doesn’t make her better etc etc but many people in the music world credit as mariah as having the best voice alive whitney has ruined her voice have you seen the you tube videos of her current tour daniel avila agt says may 14 2010 at 651 am mariah also began singing in the studio since 1987 she actually got signed in november of 1988 but began major production in 1989 anyway mariah covers all the notes… and doesn’t space out and that’s how she has a full 5 octave range and then some she has hit or sustained numerous e7s and e7s the f7f7s are usually rare and her g7g7 are a treasure when heard i like how she doesn’t display her full range capacity because if she would it would be kind of like showing off also she is always consistent with her music and mariah was already big before she even married tomyy mattola so don’t go thereand she also returned to prominence in 2005 and was she married with tommy mattola in 2005 absolutely notgeorgieboy says may 14 2010 at 848 pm i’ve had a wonderful time reading everyone’s scratching and clawing on octaves and ranges who is better — whitney or mariah i’m not sure…they are both pretty good i say in all things considered karen carpenter is queenhtoohtoo says may 16 2010 at 1102 pm mariah carey is the best singer than any other singers in the world marish carey is a princess of pop and rb i really know mariah carey has 7 octaves a r says may 19 2010 at 938 am let me make this simple mariah carey is 40 years old you can’t expect her to have exacaly the same voice she had 20 years ago i mean that’s impossible for anyone have you actually heard mariah carey performing without you this year that’s right on the 17th may 2010 she performed ‘without you’ in eygpt in front of thousands at a private party and she sounded awesome and it wasn’t lipped she hasn’t lost her voice she’s just sings a different style now and her voice has adapted to that style but as soon as she performed ‘without you’ it sounded like the classic she released in the 90s…haters f off go pick on whitney houston chris says may 29 2010 at 736 am mariah carey got the best voice ever whatever you saymusical experts or notyou can’t deny that’s it a obvious fact the songs of mariah talk by themselves just listening emotions you’re so cold bliss so blessed etc…and you ‘ll hear what i talk about whitney houston also has a huge voice as mariah carey at 1980 and 1990 decadebut we must recognize that mariah get the whistle register over whitney mariah’s voice is also more toneful and more sensual than whitney’s mariah’s voice also emit more emotions than any other’s female artist  and her voice stay today almost the same since her debut at 1990it’s proved by her 2009 release single i want to know what love is this song is one of many others which deny all rumors sayin’ that mariah’s voice declined in facther voice still tonefulsensualversatile and very young for her age  at 40mariah carey’s voice still unique and beautiful she stay till nowthe best female voice worldwide  listen her performance in the song everybody hurtseven leona lewis voice is average next to mariah’s mariah keeps the freshness and the velvety of her voice the qualities of her voice appears more obviously when she sing pop songs  balladssoultraditional rb and gospel  about her vocal rangethere is no doubt for everyone who already listen her songs live or from albums  mariah got the largest vocal range ever  there is no need to be a professional in musical background to recognize it before to listen mariah’s songspeople would think that it’s impossible for human voice to reach such high notes  emotionsblissall in your mindetc…again for a female voice to reach such low notes you’re so coldmelt awayo holy nightetc… her voice is very extensible in both directions  high and low anywaywhether she have 54 or 3 octavesthe facts is that mariah got at least 3 octaves over all other female singer voices for examplein emotionswhen she sing “ you make me feel so hihihihihiiigheer “we see that there are 5 different level of high notes who represents the 5 octaves of mariah’s voice maybe there are a few of skilful vocalists who could reach the first and the second high note butnobody could reach the 3th level  even christina aguilera which have the most extended vocal range behind mariah can’t  see her at you tube christina aguilera high notes vs mariah carey this prove clearly that mariah’s voice got at least 5 octaves and that she surpass other female voices with 3 octavesrunnie says june 25 2010 at 941 am what can you say about celine’s voice is it unique somehow some people says she is technically the best singer ever chris says july 1 2010 at 720 am to runnie firstthese three artists are my favorite singers and i know many of their respective songs celine dion got a very great and beautiful voiceshe’s a huge vocalistbut her voice is slightly nasal and a little bit less perfect than mariah carey’s and whitney houston’s as you may observe it yourself when you listen their respective music mariah and whitney respective voice is more beautifulemotionalversatilepowerfuland sexy than celine’s mariah’s voice is the bestobviously  mariah’s voice is tonefulsensualand adaptable to all musical genres  popballadsdancesoulgospelrbraptechnorocketc… its very stretchable in both senses  high and low moreovermariah have so much skills and ability on singwhitney too whitney voice reached higher notes and lower ones than celine’s  furthermoreceline is a few less skilful than mariah and whitneyparticularly in gospel and popdance songs  whitney and mariah got more agility in dance songs  i wanna dance with somebodyemotionshow will i knowfantasylove will save the daynow that i knowetc  they also release most sensuality  feminine grace and allure in their sing style celine is a very good vocalistbut her voice is relatively drylacking of tone velvety and sensuality her sing style is often too “ serious’ and “straight” whitney and mariah sing style is so sexy and glamorous  both combine sing skills vocal power and beauty proving that persons can be sexy in their sing style as mariah and whitneyceline’s voice got volume and power but her loud screams are almost all that she got in common with mariah and whitney  mariah carey voice beat the both on beauty powerversatility flexibilityhability  skill and vocal range i listen and i love the three but i can make a difference about their respective voice and talent soceline isn’t technically the best singershe just a very good performer  when you watch her singingit seems like she do something nobody could doas she release much energy and determination when she perform however when you just listen this same performance  and no watch it you realize that her vocal performance wasn’t so much extraordinary  and if you compare her voice and her vocal runs from this performance to a mariah’s  live performance you’ll see that mariah is obviously the best singer and got the best voice  i’m objective as i love the 3 very very much howeveri recognize that mariah voice is better in accordance with my observations on those 3 artistsmariah is the bestwhitney is the secondceline is the third for methose 3 female singers are the best female artists of all times and surpass all others if you doubt in what i sayjust listen these songs with much objectivity and neutrality then compare them1the power of love saving all my love for you – vision of love 2 misled – i wanna dance with somebody emotions 3if you asked me to all the man that i need can’t let go 4 declaration of love – how will i know you’re so cold 5my heart will

ask why –miracle forever 14 love can move mountains so emotional make it happen 15the star spangled banner of the three moreovermariah carey sing and many different genres that whitney and celine can’t she’s really uniqueyuli says july 2 2010 at 818 pm i agree with chris i used to be mariah’s fan but still i enjoy these three singers’s mariah whitney and celine songs i like christina also but i kind a have a feeling that somehow and sometimes she tried to imitate mariah still i have to omit there is one of xtina’s live show forget which one her whistling was so good but as whole christina would never surpases mariah probably coz’ mariah is already famous before christina or perhaps coz it was mariah who popularize whistling more than any other singers and it makes her legend i also agree with some of you who said that mariah can sing any other singer’s songs even better than the original ones but no one can sing mariah’s songs sound right lol i suppose coz’ mariah sings a wide range of oktaves in one song she also sings more genres than any other singer you’ve mentioned mariah and whitney sing technically higher than celine but in term of powerful loud whitney and celine are better i wonder when will another legend singer like mariah used to be would come… i keep waiting since i am not being a fans of any singers since 3 years ago coz for me most of today singers they more like entertainer than a real singer however mariah is a trully unique legend it is my opinion as a common listener not mean to offense any other singer’s fans out there pisssss megan says july 5 2010 at 1030 am yeahmariah got not only the best voiceshe also got talent and creativity over her rivals but whitney and celine are goo tooalthough mariah is the best  christy says july 6 2010 at 505 pm my favorite songs from mariah are  my saving grace your girl loverboy mine again fly like a bird o holy night fourth of july for whitney  greatest love of allone moment in timemiraclewhere you are

356 pm ok if you don’t like mariah don’t like her i’m pretty sure she’ll get over it just let her fans love her her fans are always defending her becuase people go and bash her whereever they see her name if you like mariahs so caled “rivals” go love and like them her fans are perfectly fine loving who she is becuase through her music she as touched them in some way you’ll never comprehend i believe mariah carey is a beautiful singer that does not get enoguh credit for her music becuase people are so highup on her personal affairs mariah carey too me is the most brilliant singersongwriterperformer of my generation steve says july 9 2010 at 835 am for all of you who think that whitney’s and celine’s voice got more volume louder than mariah’sit’s a misunderstanding the three got the same level of volume just listen if it’s overwhenever you callo holy nightagainst all oddsmake it happen to be around you santa claus is comin to townjesus oh what a wonderful child with attention oftenthe volume’s voice of whitney and celine just seems more obvious than mariah’s because their voices are less highpitched than mariah’sand very often the both emit long loud screams in her songs when mariah emit her high notes in factwhen mariah emit a long loud screamit’s as louder as whitney’s and celine’s and its got as much volume even more louder than them’s sometimes  mariah release incredible loud screams in many of her songs  often with rippling and wave celine’s and whitney’s volume screams seems most obvious than mariah’s because they are very extended and straightnevertheless they doesn’t got more volume than mariah’s truth time says july 10 2010 at 126 pm amy lee has a full 6 octave range she blows all other female singers away music lover says july 12 2010 at 816 am it’s music which can prove the vocal range of an artist in which music amy lee prove that she really had 6 octaves she already show it live mariah had already show her talent many times don’t let fanaticism make you say anythingokloverboy says july 13 2010 at 551 pmmariah goes down to an e2 and then goes up there to g7her vocal range is something more than 5 octavesher vocal coach said that she can reach a g8it’s sure that she can that notes like nobody elseperfect pitch phewphonics says july 15 2010 at 1006 am i was just discussing all this with my niece 13yrs tonight  found this page while searching some info to pass on to her we just stumbled upon this young phillipino singer called ‘charice pempengco’ can’t comment on her octave range but she sings with the future potential to match a young whitney mariah  celine note i said young – she’s only 1617 atm sorry my musical theory memory is a bit flat so to speak but what do yu guys think of her voice in these two clips interested in some feedback from some of yu that are quite up on musical talent  octave ranges etc i got goose bumps when i watched this first clip  – charice is the one in the hat  wait till the end of the song before yu make an assessmentyoutubecomwatchv7cxi r5a9r8i youtubecomwatchvf4fjte gyym uglama says july 27 2010 at 859 am well in my opinion rachelle ferrell’s voice tops all of these people including mariah carey and she has a higher octave range encompassing the deep male notes and the super high notes3rd boleyngirl says july 28 2010 at 1105 am i’m sorry but i do not think christina aguilera ever tries to imitate anyone she does her own thing and that’s that as far as i’m concerned wile she might have been inspired by some of the ‘greats’ like mariah or whitney and though her range may not be quite as big as mariah’sshe has shown there ain’t no other singer like her for examplewhat other famous singer could have sang ‘it’s a man’sman’s world’ by james brown live at the ’07 grammys and completely nailed it i admit to mariah’s talent but she just doesn’t do it for me christina sings with so much soul and that i lovecyruz says august 1 2010 at 730 amnow adays mariah sustains e7 in her i wanna know what love is…she didn’t hit itshe sustains… in the philippines a singger named nina can also sustain e7 and hit up to f7…also jonaly viray sustains a bb6 in her oh holy night mariah carey versionrachelle ann go sustains d7 on her never too far mariah carey version they are great filipina singers…range says august 1 2010 at 953 pm she has said herself that she is an alto however to say her whistle register is a gimmic and not that special is just going to far its not fair to discredit her voice like that imo opera singers train their voices for years to reach the higher registers also on that note some of you seem to be obsessed with whitney houston she’s overrated and hasnt’ had a good vocal performance since the 90’s so don’t act like she can outsing anyone now her voice peaked in the early 90’s like mariahdiego says august 24 2010 at 420 am christina aguileras has the best voice out of all those names you have guys mentioned christina is so powerful stephanie says august 25 2010 at 941 am diegothere is any female artist who can beat mariah vocally  believe memariah’s voice is more powerful than any woman you could cite you want proofs  go and listen emotionsvision of loveall in your mindmake it happenwhenever you callsanta claus is comin to townto be around youmy saving gracefly like a birdetc…psycho says september 4 2010 at 604 am lol what an idiot her live range is exactly 5 octaves the lowest she’s gotten is g2 and the highest g7 now you do the math…there are videos on you tube showing this in case you need proof igot it says september 5 2010 at 1026 amlameof1991 i cannot believe that you are the only one who pointed out that beyonce can’t sing for a second there i was wondering if i was deaf i completely agree she is a performer not a singer yes she has a pretty strong voice but that doesn’t mean she has a high quality voice i don’t know why you all even allowed her to be in this “race” for the best voice her music is good but her voice… eh not so much she couldn’t sing for me even if it was free…stacy says september 24 2010 at 1119 am hi everybody  i’m pretty excited about mariah’s new christmas album  i expect for this new christmas album impatiently this diva have a unique manner to remake christmas songs  i guess that it will be amazing and beautifulas we already have an idea from her first christmas albumwhich stay unbeatable for its quality till today  who could forget her divine remake of “o holy night” which any other singer had never manage to remake as sublime as her version even not the great whitney houston  mariah masters and knows the secrets of singing better than anyone else she accomplished so many extraordinaryincomparable and matchless musical feats pattigurl says september 27 2010 at 823 pm i read that mariah and whitney were almost neck and neck in octave ranges whitney being slightly under mariah i’m surprised no one mentioned deneice williams who was noted by the ny times as having a 5 octave range while i believe that jennifer hudson christina aguilera and beyonce have great voices i don’t think they have equally great range i was impressed by jennifer hudson’s version of i will always love you i didn’t think she could do it well until i heard her performance and i’ve never heard anything about celine dion’s range although i think it would be just under whitney anyway i am one who does find the octave ranges interesting sh says september 29 2010 at 1131 pm i am no vocal expert so this is all confusing as hell to me lol but i do know a little bit i just wanna know why some say she has 7 octaves  then some say 5 octaves i also wanna know has mariah lost any of her range since her prime if so whats her real range now  her actual range overall sidenote beyonce has 35 octaves  is by far my favorite singer she’s so under rated as a vocalist then we have singers that are overrated in this department j hudson  xtina to me the best singers of all time are whitney mariah  beyonce bar none sh says september 29 2010 at 1138 pm igot it beyonce can sing  ie you are deaf if you don’t like her voice that’s your problem she has a beautiful voice is very versatile  is an excellent vocalist  my personal fav any idiot that thinks she can’t really sing should just watch these 2 videosyoutubecomwatchvih ttd mwmzx i youtubecomwatchvla znrg5sk shes a singer dancer  performer the whole entire package jax1fdr says september 30 2010 at 817 pm you guys all need to listen to minnie ripperton’s “only when i’m dreaming” then you can stop talking about mariah and whitney they all can sing but minnie is untouched with the octave range 55 with the semitone kb18 says october 8 2010 at 1207 am y’all r all trippin mariah carey can’t song better than whitney houston the only reason why she sold so many records is because she was sold as da white chick wit da black voice whitney houston’s voice only got bad because of da drugs n she cud always sing better than n her prime mariah n still can n her worse voice patti labelle has da same voice she’s had since 4ever n sings better than mariah n always has so the age thing is no excuse aretha n patti r regarded as the greatest singers of all time just because you have a wide range don’t make you a better singer mariah carey can’t even sing all da notes under her whistle register she only can sing 3 octaves n then da whistle register i remember when her and whitney were doing da prince of egypt duet on oprah n of course whitney sung better than mariah even though they were both offkey don’t get it twisted people mariah is one of the greatest singers not the greatest melina says october 9 2010 at 809 am hieverybody personallyi prefer mariah over all the girls you mentioned  mariah sings with more allure more femininityyouthness and grace than all othersbesides her voice got more smoothness her whistle resgister is so…so…so… mariah is a model of femininityshe make me proud as such a girl mariah make me very proud of my feminity by her songsand men are always amazed when the heard her sexy voice  although i respect all other female singers tooi must say that mariah is better than others  mo says november 3 2010 at 215 pm mariahs a great singerartist but i’m not sure she’s the greatest people like rippertonfreddie mercuryjeff buckleymichael jacksonprince and many many others are also brilliantmikesm735 says november 9 2010 at 703 pm i love mariah whitney and other female singers mariah has a voice that is flexable and higher than whitney but whitney has the powerful voice that can stand out well she used to mariah can sing well in any genre tho she chooses rb now she did well in pop but if this is about highest voices then i would go with the lesser known rachelle farrell who can sing higher than mariah and she can sustain those notes longer with better vibrato than mariah but still mariah still has the best career going and i still want to hear more from her i wish she would go back to popmike says november 21 2010 at 525 am some of your comments crack me up people are talking about michael jackson prince and beyonce let’s keep it real they arewere brilliant popsingersartists but they are far from great singers michael jackson when singing live was often off pitch he had a weak voice and a tiny vocal range beyonce is often on pitch she has ha pretty good range but she is a little screamy i’m no fan of mariah carey but her tribute to stevie wonder was a vocal masterpiece she showed great pitch control power and great range she lacked little emotion though but nowadays she sings like a crow whitney had beautiful instrument in her voice she had decent pitch and lots of energy but she looked bad when she sang beside someone with great pitch like luther vandross for example when talking about the best singers you must look further than poprnb and sometimes outside america singers like pavarotti jussi björling frank sinatra tony bennett donny hathaway and even elvis presley became a powerful singer at the end and there are of course many more bibi says december 4 2010 at 306 am anybody who has the nerve to compare carey to huge legends like the beatles presley or even michael jackson is simply out of line please look up on wikipedia “list of bestselling music artists” just to see who the real players are carey is not even in the same league as such artists no matter if she has had many 1 hits in the us sales figures is what really matters also claiming that carey is the “best singer ever” is just ridiculous because that’s a matter of subjective opinion i think there are more people who don’t like how she singsbelts notes than people who do yet she sells a lot because she has a marketing machinery behind her many people simply don’t like highpitched annoying female voices while others do some people have a very short range and still are considered better singers than somebody with a huge range frank sinatra’s singing range was about 15 octaves only he could maybe sing 2 octaves tops but they were 100 high quality and unique notes many people consider him the best male singer ever his detractors say he couldn’t even sing but i’m sure more people like his voice than the opposite same goes for karen carpenter her songs were only maybe 2 octaves in general her whole singing range was “only” some 3 octaves but the quality and beauty of her voice set her apart from everybody else michael jackson had a 35octave range they say but the quality of his voice was unique a very pleasing mixture between childfemale and male almost impossible to be imitated just as the previous two singers mentioned so who cares about breaking range records it’s more about the quality that is how pleasing and melodic a voice is and as always it’s a subjective thing jerkel says december 4 2010 at 325 am i likedid the constipation of mami it really moved me bowelshigh says december 6 2010 at 1220 amcan her voice attract batsvalleygurl says december 9 2010 at 425 am hello first mc is one of the greatest singers of our time whether you like her sound or not when she deliver she really brings it give credit when due stop hatin start prayin’i am a singer says december 12 2010 at 1137 pm people your head voice is different from your chest and lower registers you can singhit high notes like normal even when you have a sore throat…… because you don’t use your throat to sing in your head voice i am a soprano i’ve done it many times however i’m not debating mariah’s vocal range because there is no way to prove it unless she’s standing in front of me with no member of her management team microphone nor studio equipment around the entire world knows that “artistes” are created from recordings to photographs everything is refined whatever is on you tube or the net is what the management team wants the public to see and hear because people especially americans believe everything they are told about celebrities stardom is 80 marketing and 20 talent there are other people with wider vocal ranges than mariah and better voices than many stars this game is about creating an image and selling it ask tyra banks she has dared to tell people the truth about how supermodels are “created” by the industrysongbird says december 13 2010 at 1053 pm mariah is not the best singer in the world but she is much better than whitney though whitney was very good in the 80s and 90s her new stuff sucks sorry to say this but her ship has most definitely ran it’s course she ruined her voice with all that crack rock in my opinion celine dion and barbara streisand are better than all the aforementioned to songbird says december 23 2010 at 949 am it’s just your opinion eryone worldwide knows that mariah is the best singer in the world celine dion and barbra doesn’t deserve to compete with mariah on sing abilitythey’re so far from it this is only whitney who is very close to mariah on this point mariah is the topall her songs proves it mariah and whitney rules  says december 30 2010 at 850 am mariah and whitney are the very best singers ever slyx207 says january 4 2011 at 820 pm to end this if mariah carey doesn’t really have her gifted voice and faking us for all these years i’m sure that she wouldn’t be blessed as much as like this she had her downfall but then again she rose up thanking god in her song my saving grace in every album she puts up she had songs for god  it is very inspirational in every performances  award acceptance speech she never forgets to thank the lord she is truly blessed even though she had a sexy image before i think her christianity makes her a better person more  more god bless mariah carey more “the world hates the godly doersfollowers”barbra the best  says january 8 2011 at 931 am do you think this ugly pig named susan boyle can compete with great vocalists like arethabarbrawhitney or mariah  i don’t really see why everyone is crazy about this pigreece says january 17 2011 at 521 am sad sad it just seems that so many of you people are hating on mariah and whitney and celine and anyone famous  that is sad sad sad as for the person that posted the article all this is about – he must honestly analyze mariah’s voice so hard and try to find flaws in it just sad you may be a baritone but i bet you aspire to try to sing like mariahthe honest one says january 23 2011 at 1222 am the truth is no one knows mariah’s complete range just because you take all her songs find out the highest and lowest parts doesn’t mariah’s range first of all she’d have no reason to exude her highest potential in a recorded song because if she did and had to perform it that would exhaust her voice people are forming opinions based on their own logic be content with not knowing kee says february 24 2011 at 1045 am i’m just glad someone knows the difference between how high a person can sing and their actual range it’s annoying when people confuse them people are always talking about a sopranos range when likely they can only sing on a small pocket of the piano i’m a woman who sings almost baritone to mezzo soprano plus whistle notes and super head voice so i think range should be accredited to those who have it adriano says february 25 2011 at 830 am europe would like mariah to come and live here ’cause even thou she is the world wide legend americans want her to be perfect all the time even thou she is just a human she is not appreciated for her unique gift and career which will never be duplicated all new singers suck in comparison to mariah and whitney christina is roaring like a lion instead of singingleone is great but doesn’t have that star presence and her voice is just not that interesting so mariah come herelamb for life marcus says march 2 2011 at 819 am so sad that you people judge people’s singing abilities and compare i wonder how an audience of over 10 000 people would criticize your voices if you sang live i’m a mariah fan and she honestly doesn’t care about these stupid blogs which were all wasting our time on because she knows she’s got an amazing voice and is filthy richliving the high life and is loved by so many people so go ahead and keep spilling more crap about singers because they sure as hell don’t have the time for negative and critical people like you all manila with love says march 8 2011 at 838 am its simply mariah is the best singer during the 90’s and nobody can be compared to her whitney and mariah set the standard for the vocal ability  quality range  strength and style emma says march 14 2011 at 722 pm someone above mentioned julie andrews i completely agree mariah can hit 5 octaves but can she hold strong beautiful notes in 5 octaves no not really julie had over 4 octaves sometimes credited as 5 when she was 10 at age 60 she still had 4 but she didn’t just hit notes she held out strong notes with a gorgeous vibrato that never sounded forced or fake as mariah’s often do mariah does not have the kind of talent that many performers from julie’s time did unfortunately julie now has a halfoctave range but that is besides the point not her fault blame stuart kessler nika says march 17 2011 at 416 am i can sing 45 octaves and can do easily the first high note in emotions – end of 1st minute never tried the highest one ’cause just heard this song but it is all training it is not singing it is indeed hitting and i would better call it screaming the music teacher of my son who also have 4 octaves said she has the highest voice she had worked with – practically the end of piano she confirmed very high notes he does is hitting but not singing the lower you put you head down the higher notes you can make that’s why when you are afraid and scream you even sometimes you fold your arms next to the body in order to make more pressure on the vocal cords – it is a reflex like this you can actually make higher notes but then you loose the force of the voice because of lack of air to manipulate with this is exactly what you hear when mariah did it – you hear that her voice suddenly lost power it sounds less louder then you do not sing it’s a scream when you sing you can also pronounce some words at least relatively correct she screams the notes – only “a”“i” no consonants it is unlikely she could play with her voice on that frequency play – i do not mean to go from one note to another but loudersilent “hard”“soft” it is all the same level you can see the difference if you listen for ex to inva mula in the 5th element this is explained by the fact that when you sing then you use your diaphragm as well not only your voice then you can manipulate with the voice make it vibrate “jump” pronounce different sounds when you scream then your playing possibilities are very limited because you do not use a diaphragm basically you have only 1 sound – something between “a” and “i” in order to test her real voice capacities she should sing a melody as they do “miiiiiiiii” during the lesson not immediately from the last octave but start from the beginning then you see that on high frequences you effectively more hit than sing and that’s why sopranos often sing something inrecognisable charis m says march 19 2011 at 501 pmpff most of the comments are ignorant 1 mariah carey is a world class singer her vocals are not perfect but they are very impressive unique and soulful it has what it takes to make world records in the music scene 2 she is a lyric coloratura soprano not an alto or contralto and etc… she had used some of her lower notes in songs but she doesn’t actually sing all the time in those notes 3 beyonce and other today’s singers are not better singers than mariah who is the 15 year old little ignorants here who say stuff like that 4 her range is 5 octaves and she is not the only one many have 5 octave range some are pros and working as singers and some dont why because range doesn’t make you a singing career the quality of the voice does the songs the lyrics and mariah has all that 5 she married the sony producer guy because he fall in love with her and she did the same nobody is 20 years a successful singer just because they slept with the manager i mean common ask around 6 the article is little hateful but it is ok also the person who wrote this is right in one thing when i am cold i can also hit easy above c7 i have went up to g7 it depends the voice other than that i’m a singer as well classically trained and with sls i am expecting my natural vocal range with practice and i can say it is possible to expand your range up to 4 or 5 or even 6 octaves lopez has 6 octave of vocal range brett manning as well and i can go in scales from g2 up to g6 and randomly i can hit above g6 up to g7 especially when i have rest my voice for days and have done some aphony so i love mariah carey she has inspired me a lot as a singer indeed i have heard better quality voices like maria callas donna summer etc etc but another thing to be a great singer and another a great vocalist mariah has bothpeace love and abundance people just be happya random visitor says march 21 2011 at 1044 pm hello we have a saying “over smaak valt niet te twisten” which means you can’t argue about taste there’s always somebody who thinks someone is better than another does that even matter does that take away from the reason why you think someone is good it might be interesting to speculate about range but how often does it actually happen that your finest and best moment is recorded and broadcasted on the internet and how often is a studio recorded song not tampered withedited mariah obviously has a lot of followers and haters it’s all a matter of taste something that isn’t is her range it’s there except for what the range exactly is since you can never really know you can’t really argue about her range it isn’t good or bad unless you think it is someone might have a bigger range but is it really better that’s also a matter of tasteso it’s really pointless to give each other such a bad time over this everybody has an opinion on this and nobody will change it just for you because somebody does or doesn’t love something as much as you do and there’s nothing you should want to have a grip on it doesn’t make anything better and it never should a random visitor says march 21 2011 at 1113 pm“barbra the best  says january 8th 2011 at 931 am do you think this ugly pig named susan boyle can compete with great vocalists like arethabarbrawhitney or mariah  i don’t really see why everyone is crazy about this pig”i’m suprised… since when did singing turn into a beauty contest sure she’s ugly and insane for that matter well she is but her voice brought tears to my eyes it moved me one without actual training from a village in the middle of nowhere comes to the stage to sing like one can only imagine angels would sound like this is my opinion but her looks might not compare to any of those you mentioned very true but her talent is worth mentioning as much as those this “pig” has the talent i can only dream of don’t know what her reach is don’t know wether she’s an alto or a freaking trumpet but she can move me and a lot of people around me therefore she is worth mentioning despite her looks she’s no less than any of those singers susan rules  says may 16 2011 at 1119 am susan boyles is 100 times better than mariah i don’t think mariah could sing the song “i dream a dream” as good as boylesneither whitney anyone could sing mariah’s songs like emotionsblissagainst all oddsetc…by just giving voice and loud screams but no one can sing a susan’s song susan as a wider range than mariah in spite of her age 58 octaves some people said 7 octaves boyles is the better vocalist that ever lived carey sucks chinsky says may 25 2011 at 954 am“i have a range wider than mariah since i’m a baritone i can sing down to a bb1 and up

do “love takes time” whistle as fluent as herchocolate says may 28 2011 at 1233 pm loserselle says june 1 2011 at 813 pm mariah got the best voice than any other female artist she’s also the female artist that can sing very highly  not just hitting or belting  she have not only the whistle over other female artists  there is any other female artist that sing the way mariah sings  she does a lot of things with her voice that others females can’t  her vocals release so much femininitygraceallure  she sings beytter than all others her voice sounds like a true musical instrumentfor example in the songs fourth of julyalways be my babyo little town of bethlehem…her runs are perfect  she’s thebest female vocalist that ever lived moronia says june 7 2011 at 1128 am susan’s whistle notes are better than mariah’s susan outsing mariah’s emotions effortless susan has 8 octaves of vocal range while mariah has just 6 octaves mariah is just behind boyles susan boyles all the way tane says june 8 2011 at 1106 pmmoronla you are wrong dear child susan white has no proof of hitting notes over g7 whereas marah carey has hit that note several times in live performances such as the emtions in 1992 the arsenio hall i think and the live renditon of star spangled banner where she did in fact hit g7mariah has more control over her whistles than susan watevernot telling says june 15 2011 at 953 am opinion much “mariah carey is the best singer in the world no matter what anyone says she has every special characteristic any good singer has plus a million of her own in other words if she sang someone else’s song she would sing it even better than the original singer but if someone if anyone tried to sing any of mariah’s songs – they would like idiots and sound like fools not only that but mariah’s lyrics are amazing they’re inspiring emotional so well written and beautiful totally her own unique style and her 18 number one hits are the support she’s just one around the beetles and just so happened to come out with an album this year after being in the music industry for 20 years now she writes her own songs produces them and sings them she’s got the hugest range best control most gorgeous voice she’s definitely the best singer in this world no doubt”miriah has about 5 octaves ann says june 24 2011 at 1235 pm mariah is the best singer whitney can’t touch her her voice is not as unique as mariah’s and whoever brought beyonce into this is clearly cluelessuneducated ann says june 24 2011 at 1239 pm lol susan boyle now we’re comparing the winner of tv show with a world renowned singer jj says june 28 2011 at 455 am beyonce is a better singer than mariah and is a better live performer with her powerful ass voice ce ce peniston can sing better than mariah can mariah was always only 100 in the studio not on the stage on the stage throughout her career she’s made more vocal mistakes than any other singer but that doesn’t take away the fact that she’s “one” of the best singers alive because there are singers who are better than her and i wish y’all retards would stop saying she has a 5 and above octave range because that’s impossible sure there are gifted people that have great rangers that either start way below middle c or go way above it people claiming they have 5 octave ranges are either full of it or just don’t know what they talkin about to all the delusional and retarded people saying mariah’s the best singer news fah all youse…she’s not…the endfee says july 4 2011 at 200 pm there are a lot of mariah haters on here mariah is the best to ever do it charles says july 7 2011 at 416 am i would have to completely agree with this post i see a lot of truth to this post because my voice is basically mariah’s voice lowered by 6 whole steps i have nearly 5 octaves but i can only comfortably sing up to a d6 the last note of my head voice much in the same way mariah can only comfortably sing a6 the last 5 notes of any person’s range are generally the “outer limit” notes think of where you feel your chest voice “tug” and where it gives out for tenors probably e4c5 for baritones probably d4a4 for altos b4f5 mezzos c5g5 sopranos e5a5 there are more notes within comfortable full voice range in males because males utilize more full notes than females females use head voice more often than full voice even in everyday conversation mariah’s highest comfortable note the note she can hit over and over and over without fail seems to be b4 c5 c5 c5 c5 and d5 these are her most powerfulopen chest note i put extra emphasis on c5 because it’s a 5th lower than her g5 extreme cannot be maintained my f4 is my most open note and my c5 cannot be maintained see a trend same spacing between “opened powerful comfortable note” and “pushed shortlived note”proof she loses it after g5 mariah starts straining after e5 and that’s where i begin to mix unlike the a written for women which mariah has trouble hitting in full voice because she’s a true alto i can hit a4 in full modal voice slight tenor the most comfortable note i can “sing” and maintain is a headvoiced d6 like the climax of i still believe but i can sing from c6c7 in whistle i don’t count these notes a true baritone couldn’t hit whistle notes much like a true alto couldn’t hit them either for this reason mariah’s “comfortable range” is alto but her dramatic range carries into mezzo although her tonal quality drastically diminishes i am not a “soprano” or “sopranist” but a baritenor with extended lower and upper range my full voice stops at about a bb4 much like mariah’s stops at g5 6 steps apart and my comfortable high notes stop at a b5 much like mariah’s stops at a g6 this isn’t to say that she more i can’t go any higheryoutubecomwatchvotr8f42l hpo that video proves all of mariah’s vocal transitions listen for the changes in tone for her key notes like chest b4c5d5 and head g6a6but the truth is that her comfortable range much like my comfortable range is not 4 or 5 octaves just because someone can force out an f6 both mariah and myself doesn’t mean that note is in our “normal” arsenal of notes this was long winded sorry lol twinkly star says july 14 2011 at 313 am although i am not a fan of either freddie mercury had over a fouroctave range wiki and is often regarded as the greatest singer in many polls and micheal jackson with a 35 octave range and also comes high on polls too those i prefer listening to diego says july 16 2011 at 120 am stupid children why are you screaming about this like the life on earth depends on it… they are all very good singers period listen what you like but do not pretend you are some knowall smart sh because you are only sh no brains if you had some the brain you would have been popular singers too since you are not shut the hell up the women you bicker over are all good and successful unlike every single one of you sad idiots pat says july 16 2011 at 349 pmjj and all other mariah’s haters comparing

unique nobody can do as much mariah is really the greatest vocalist ever and the greatest singer of all timestane says july 20 2011 at 1107 pmcharles you are wrong mariah is quite comfortable hitting notes bigger than a5 just look at the song emotions love takes time live 1993 she hit notes up to f5 quite often without strain and fail mariah carey’s highest note ever hit is a g7 she hit that note 3 times to prove her range not one of you people who say you have a bigger range than mc can compare to her i mean yous are just a bunch of amateurs compared to her no offense but its true loltane

moronia says august 14 2011 at 151 pm talking about voice and sing abilitymariah carey and whitney houston are the very best  they are untouchable and i think there will never be other female

muhamad says september 1 2011 at 658 am mariah carey is the voice jj says september 6 2011 at 508 am mariah is definitely nowhere near as close when it comes to beyonce when it comes to the looks and beauty department let’s keep it real  pat mariah is the mouse with that high pitched noise she makes beyonce has a stronger voice and more beautiful voice and she has rhythm jennifer is a better singer also anyone with ears can tell ya that…good ears anyway ps if mariah wasn’t marketed as a white chick they wouldn’t have played her music on all those white radio stations and her album would have flopped and she wouldn’t have gotten where she had today…once again…let’s keep it real sh says september 8 2011 at 754 pmi agreefu range so what beyonce the underrated1 is just as great as mariah

beyonce herself claimed she wanted to be a singer when she listened to mariah careyis nowhere close to whitney houston and mariah carey in anything keep dreaming whitney and mariah are vocal icons and

with them on vocal capabilities nobody can touch them expertsartistswanna be artists recognize and still claim whitney and mariah are vocal phenomenons this is so silly to try talking about beyonce next to these legends keep dreaming dearsyour delusions can change nothing on factsjhana says october 4 2011 at 1007 am you are obviously a mariah carey hater did you do your research very well your brain just below your knee whistle register is a note fyi yes she is not in the guinness book cause it is adam lopez which is male has the highest note which is take note a whistle register … now mariah is one of the few singer who can sing whistle register therefore she is the best recording female singer gold says october 5 2011 at 944 am mimi is unreachable  she’s incredible marijo says october 9 2011 at 332 pm mariah is the toplambily says october 22 2011 at 801 pm regardless whether mariah can whistle or not she has a beautiful voice her sound and tone are amongst the bests her voice is very distinctive and she’s one of the very few people who has perfect pitch and yes she can really hit really high notes but she is also able to hit very low notes and she always does either one beautifully magazines websites tv shows ranked her as the “best voice” she is whitney’s only rival on the honorific title “the voice mariah is one hell of a singe the ones who hate are just jealous of mariah’s talent and successlambily says october 22 2011 at 811 pm mariah’s voice is the best and if you don’t agree with that that’s fine however denying mariah’s singing talent is stupid she has been dubbed as the “songbird supreme” haters can hate on mc as much as they want but they can never ever deny what she has and that’s a godgiven gift and you know what makes mc even greater than the rest she writes her own material her lyrics comes from the heart and they touch people’s lives just keep hating sad haters btw all i want for christmas is you officially started the christmas season  1 just like every year since its release mariah is also the queen of christmas and of course the bestselling female artist of all time her net worth is 500 million dollars so haters just hate more 3synner says october 24 2011 at 223 pm when it comes down to it this whole page is supposed to relate to mariah’s range not tone not control etc however range alone makes for a boring discussion so… yes there are singers with wider ranges i’m a baritone and can sing notes in parentheses are not truly in full voice the rest are those that are fullcontrolled from roughly eb1 a1 to a5 f6 but in reality no one is paying me millions of dollars to do it mariah has a range tone lyrics and anything else under the sun that people want to hear she is a great talent plain and simple her whistle register is so distinct and no one can truly pull off mariah’s style particularly full mid range except for mariahanonymous says october 27 2011 at 1251 am as a classically trained former opera singer what determines your range is that you can maintain notes sufficiently with vibrato which is simply the air correctly passing through the vocal chords as a result most of the “belters” lose their so called “massive” ranges not to say they’re not talented but they do not have the ranges they supposedly possess they also must be able to accurately hit these notes and sustain these notes multiple times and be able to hit these notes without going up via a melisma or hit descending yma sumac is the only singer in recorded history with a five octave range even professional opera singers such as leontyne price beverly sills or james morris have on average a two and a half to three octave range singers who use the techniques that mariah carey christina aguilera and others use obtain what are known as vocal nodules because they sing so incorrectly it upsets me because they have tremendous talent and amazing instruments but they just don’t know how to use those instruments not to go the opera route necessarily but they should take care of them and learn at least how to harness whistle voice since you can damage your voice singing in it incorrectly it’s why many belters have such iffy voices and cannot always hit those crazy notes whereas classically trained can also belters are generally flat whereas most classically trained singers are on the pitch or perhaps slightly sharp if even some of the weird things you learn to listen for when you spend countless hours listening to singers… i do have several christina c ds so don’t think i’m not a fan  and i listen to rush so i endure geddy lee and his crazy voice ha talk about voice problems but boy can he shred the basstane says october 30 2011 at 835 pm oh you so called opera singers mariah carey and her 5 octave range is truly incredible opera singers can barely reach 4 octaves its a wonder you see opera singers hating on mc” have you seen her live performances in 91 and 92 where she hit g7 or her live rendition of star spangled banner 2004 where she hit f7 and g7 i think you haveits true and its stated trough out the world mariah has a 5 octave range if you opera singers or trined singer don’t believe then stop fuing reading these posts you just wanna prove it wrong so you know you are on top”kyle says november 3 2011 at 902 amyou dont know about her  ur ignorant jay says november 20 2011 at 837 pm this post was ignorantly written while i agree that mariah may not have the largest range in the entire universe it is just stupid and sadistic to go off on how she shouldn’t be crediting something that she has if she is able to hit a note more than once it is not by accident that she can incorporate it into her performances she is a stellar singer and that is without doubt you can not argue this fact she is certainly not the best singer in this world i am admitting this as a mariah fan but she can sure as heck sing her butt off you don’t just earn 18 number ones for nothing and about the “i have a wider range than mariah” comment you are going to need some serious proof backing up that one because you are blatantly lying to yourself and it is quite hilarious to see you claiming to own a 5 octave ranged voice … jj says december 25 2011 at 151 am i actually don’t know what to think because so many people are saying so many different things but i’m 13 and i have a 4 octave range and i would just like to know how coolrare that actually is haha maria says december 25 2011 at 227 am can you post a video of you showing your vocal range i’d like you to prove that yvette white says december 28 2011 at 435 am i stumbled across this conversation and i find it interesting that there are so many people here that know about voice and octaves i have been telling people that my daughter sings in 6 octaves because one vocal coach and one producer has determined it after reading this discussion i want to know how can we find out for sure i don’t want to be accused of “false advertising” allie says january 4 2012 at 1257 pm the obviousness of the majority of you not being classically trained singers is so blatant remember mariah is not classically trained hence why she has go to on vocal rest so often and has even injured her vocal chords several times… so what she does with her voice sick congested or otherwise is extremely damaging and unnatural she is a soprano the most common of female voices and also the one that must be handled most with care and in classical terms she’s a coloratura soprano meaning her voice is very agile but because she is untrained classically controlling these leaps and bounds is very difficult what i am trying to say is before you make comments get your facts straight there is no way she can have an 8 octave range just like the author said she would have to be able to go into bassbaritone range which is impossible for a soprano as an alto i can but i must be warmed up and i could never even dream of singing mariah’s soprano range albeit even if it is forced if singers in today’s world were more classically trained not only would their careers be more fulfilling but they would also know how to not hurt themselves and make mistakes source i am a classically trained operatic dramatic contralto with a comfortable 3 octave range my chest and head voices can reach higher and lower respectively and yes once warmed up i can sing down into bassbaritone range mariah cannot  nahym says january 7 2012 at 1236 pmwhistle register is disconnected from the voiceonly the modal register counts’which makes mc have a 45 octavewhitney has 36 octvtaher says january 8 2012 at 1238 pmi like celine dion so muchmanman says february 8 2012 at 922 am mariah has 65 octaves of vocal rangeevery experts already stale it severall times andre says february 14 2012 at 822 pm found this article after googling “octaves whitney houston” i have always said that whitney is the greatest female vocalist ever and not just because of her very unfortunate recent passing i have always thought she had amazing range with rich depth and control whitney owns her songs like no other vocalist has lynn says february 22 2012 at 551 pm ok… rachelle ferrell…has the most octave range…the highest range for a female…check her out… whitney or mariah could not touch her…be honest…i like mariah n whiteny too …but i gotta be honest…patrick m says february 24 2012 at 150 am mariah is a very good singer she has amazing range however range isn’t everything whitney houston had much more power and control ever wonder why she was called “the voice” she is the artist that every other female artist is measured by not mariah i like mariah a lot don’t get me wrong she has both power and range but whitney had perfect tone in her prime christina aguilera is a very good singer and i would put her equal if not a little less than mariah christinas problem is that she tries to do one to many runs while singing she needs to understand that she is not black and its okay to not try to emulate that to all you people who are putting beyonce fantasia and jennifer hudson in this subject need to go back to the late 80’s to mid 90’s none of them are even close to whitney mariah and christina… brian l says february 26 2012 at 607 am no one ever says that mariah hit a g7 when singing our national anthem she actually hit that note in the emotions performance in 1991you are clearly musically retarded as the note she hit in you’re so cold was indeed a2she also hit g2 during the emc2 era abdul says february 26 2012 at 1002 pm what is chante moore vocal range i was surprised but she has a strong whistle register or superhead that is not known to most people youtubecqoc fj mj df qa440 says march 12 2012 at 905 am mariah’s voicebest by far whitney’s voiceused to be the best christina’s voicewhat voice nahym says march 14 2012 at 624 pm whitney houston will always be the greatest singers ive ever heard in my earssurely yes mariah is impressive with her multi octave noteshe’s not the only one who can reach them high notesclassicaly trained operas can hit as high as a b6 in head voiceand further when using whistleall this doest make you a great singer like miss whitney houstonwho had a range of 35 octaves a2c6that had power to make people understand that she does not make music for the eyesshe makes music for the ears naomi says april 18 2012 at 100 pm some of you guys are idiots mariah was successful way before marrying her first husband mariah’s demo was handed to tommy by branda k starr at a party he played it after the party and went back to get her long story short she became a very successful artist and a few years later married tommy she wrote her own music and always had she’s been singing since she was 3 her mom was an opera singer and taught mariah when she was younger her vocals were stronger its still strong today but 20 years ago she was definitely stronger she is a great artist her number one singles vocals and whistle register can back her up speaking of her whistle register she’s done it in almost every song she sang if you’re gonna judged mariah’life make sure you know the facts not the lies some of you people make up i don’t even know why whitney was even mention in this…jack soden says april 19 2012 at 754 am to s judah you forgot to mention that most of mariah carey’s number one hits were the result of pay for play aka payola an investigation was conducted in the mid 90s and carey’s name was mentioned as was madonna’s so therefore she nor madonna broke any records jack soden says april 19 2012 at 756 am to s judah you forgot to mention that most of mariah carey’s number one hits were the result of pay for play aka payola an investigation was conducted in the mid 90s and carey’s name was mentioned as was madonna’s so therefore neither she nor madonna broke any records jimmie lee says may 12 2012 at 939 pm glad to hear someone appreciates donna summer she is so underrated she’s very much “the voice” to me than whitney but i like whitney’s music just love donna’s more in regards to someone referring to susan boyle as a pig how rude just because she’s not thin should have no effect on how you like or dislike her voice you either like it or you don’t her weight however has nothing to do with your ears lol by the way the lates donna summer vocal contribution can be found on rapper o’mega red’s single “angel” hereyoutubecomwatchvzm vv hlk ta rs henna says june 8 2012 at 735 pm there is a singer born every day…there is no such thing as “the world’s greatest singer” or “the greatest singer of all time” the thought there is such a singer is absurd… and it would be an impossible thing to measure anyway this entire thread is embarrassing it sounds like kids arguing about who’s better justin bieber or nick jonas i appreciate someone talking intelligently about vocal ranges and octaves but when it turns into “my singer is better than your’s neener neener neener” it’s honestly weird all the ladies mentioned on here are great singers for their own unique reasons…and this list will only continue to grow over timemushroom says july 10 2012 at 739 pm you must be a fan of christina aguilera… lolsamir says august 18 2012 at 1127 pm vanessa williams has 3 octaves youtubeg ls rl veh6dqi says september 4 2012 at 1105 pm i think lisa fischer is the best vocalist ever how she never gets mentioned or credited is sad and it is do smooth and effortless nothing less than beautiful listen to how can i ease the pain live on you tube enough said manuel says september 22 2012 at 1013 pm i’m also going to add that celine dion has a 34 octave range higher than whitney people alway underestimate celine because she sings the “sappy” songs but that bitch has sold over 200 million albums worldwide and has 43 1 hits she didn’t get to that place by just being nice stan says september 24 2012 at 526 pm except she’s hit and sung e2s on the song bliss on her rainbow album and has hit a g2 live on the radio and has hit eb7 live in recent performancesjosie says january 8 2013 at 510 am it doesn’t matter what anyone says let the facts speak for themselves mariah has sold over 200 million albums not single tracks world wide she is the best female vocalist of all time more number one hits than any other female artist a career that has spanned over two

16 2013 at 740 am according to internationally acclaimed spanish operatic soprano montserrat caballé “carey is such a musician perfect timing divine accuracy subtle and refined phrasing melismas always connected to the rhythm and structure of song infallible ability to establish and resolve musical ideas and theme and effortless combination of climax and resolve”mariah carey whitney houston  beyonce are certainly technically superior singers to celine dion anyone with a professional ear can hear this lando says february 3 2013 at 110 pm people if a singer is sick or has nodules it does not help them to sing being sick does not allow them to hit higher notes in fact if they are sick or have nodules they need to rest their voice until they are no longer sick when you have nodules in your throat and you force yourself to sing through it you will hurt yourself and possibly lose your all of your ability to sing nodules can turn into bloody polyps and can tear up your vocal chords many singers have lost the ability to sing because of nodulepolyp issues irvin says february 26 2013 at 239 am that’s not true  mariah have a high and beautiful that can reach five octave voice  she can sing on a opera that need a high voice  watch her five octave voice  it can prove that mariah is a real diva with a high tone carolyn says march 10 2013 at 1157 pm kelly clarkson…just sayin’ girl can sing anythingdjstar says march 31 2013 at 1256 am wow i can and cannot believe this thread has been going on for hold on let me scroll back up 2004 – that’s 9 nine years for the person who started this i hope you are honored that a blog like yours is still receiving attention wanna know why because mariah carey has something that’s called charisma class and can still showcase her range ie her 2nd xmas album where she sings live with her mother we as fans and even the “nonfans” aka liars melt every time she so much as hums a tune her voice is unparalleled and effortless thanks for the “octave lecture” but it will never change what any of us feel about her music if you’re a musician let go of your technical obsession and learn how to appreciate excellent music ciao bren says april 17 2013 at 945 am he didn’t say she can’t hit a g2 he is saying she can’t sing it and she can’t also those of you talking about opera singers vs mariah carey need your basic brains examined opera singers don’t use whistle register it’s not a connected register  opera singers can resonate over an orchestra live without a microphone mariah cannot so please stop saying crap like mariah can sing opera or opera singers don’t hate on mariah for having a 5 octave range because opera singers are vastly superior vocalists than she or any pop female they have no reason to be jealous not in the slightest steve says may 17 2013 at 1154 am i’ve never really heard mariah carey or whitney houston so i probably wouldn’t know one from the other but i do like a nice tune i have wide  varied tastes but seem to somehow avoid mainstream pop music monrepos says june 1 2013 at 1255 pm i think that cher and celine are better singers than mariah since mariah can’t touch any of their songs songs live believe or my heart will go on are the hardest ever monrepos says june 1 2013 at 110 pm anyone can sing love takes time or emotions but nobody could sing celine and cher hardest songs that’s why i love these both beautiful legends mike says june 19 2013 at 203 pm i loved watching mariah’s head explode when she hit a8youtubecommariahsheadblowedup ninette dismon says july 30 2013 at 606 pm what great posts i’m reading here regarding mariah carey’s vocal range i believe that it is at least between 45 and 5 octaves – but no more than that anything more would be considered an exaggeration on the part of some people minnie riperton and chante moore are or were great vocalists who also used “whistle”pitch register and male vocalists such as michael jackson – to give one example are mentioned in some comments they have totally different voicetypes than female singers do and it’s sort of like making a comparison of “apples to oranges” so to speak a male voice whether speaking or singing is much deeper than the female voice most men cannot normally except in very extremely unusual and rare cases sing in the registers as high as most women can what do you think ninette dismon says july 31 2013 at 323 am while it is true that opera singers can be heard over an orchestra and they don’t use microphones that’s because they use a different method of vocal production than a pop singer or vocalist would also an opera singer has many more years of vocal training but that alone – in and of itself – doesn’t make one genre or style of singing either superior or inferior to any other genre the two are just different that’s all can terminology that applies to classical music and opera be applied to pop vocalists maybe not i really don’t know mentor54 says january 12 2014 at 1227 pm in pop music vocal range isn’t as important as in classical music the main focus lies on personality and the ability to express emotions according to this criterion there are much better singers than mariah carey to me adi says january 7 2015 at 839 pm guys don’t argue first of all not all the high octave singers are celebrities don’t forget that adelle has a vocal range of 2 octaves and she won so many grammy awards and opera singers like vitas with 5 octaves or pop star from eurovision mihai traistariu 51 octaves are not so on the wave there are many other factors that makes a great singer – vocal stamp volume air capacity from the lungs attitude self control good psychic  good compositions with message and of course vocal range check it out john legend – all of me live he does have a nice voice but his air capacity from lungs is so low – but who cares nice song well sold but concerts are not so many and so big like justi bieber’s… however if you search for artists vocal range you will find thousands of opinions like mariah carey has 4 octaves – up to 7 wikipedia says that she’s got 53 who cares she’s greatest for some and great for others cheers thi hills says july 20 2015 at 345 pm mariah carey updated live vocal range is f2 – bb7 5 octaves 2 notes and 1 semiton you can take a search no name says april 26 2016 at 727 pm i love mariah but i have heard way better singers so no need to argue elijah e says july 11 2016 at 718 pm this post is so wrong it should be taken down mariah did go past d7 when she was singing ‘all in your mind’ accapella she hit eb7 mariah didn’t just hit g7 in that performance of ‘emotions’ in 1991 either she hit b7 also she sung the note mariah’s lowest note is f2 which she hit sing ‘my all’ in 2014 her full range is f2b7 which equals 53 octaves 5 octaves  3 notes she does have 5 octaves she is singing all of it there not exclaimed when you talk about mariah’s vocal range you have to take into account that she has nodules she isn’t going to have the same vocal range all the time rested or not if you have nodules you won’t be able to hitsing the same notes all the time the nodules are just not going to let you also mariah didn’t sing c3 at the end of ‘my all’ studio version it was b2 mariah’s supported range is e3eb7 you need to just go away goodbye zeke says may 17 2017 at 1137 am congrats you have a big vocal range so do i and mariah has a bigger range i can sing an f2g7 she has a larger range from the f2 to the b7 you have a big range because you can sing lower than she can but she can sing 12 octaves higher than you shut up and when you have been a pop icon for almost 3 decades you can start to brag about your vocal range ok zeke says may 17 2017 at 1147 am just so you know your little comment on the whistle note saying it is soft and low volume is completely wrong i say this because it is high and sometimes it is soft for a whistle higherlouder well in most cases at least i can say this because i have the whistle register am classically trained and for your information you are getting told off by a 13yearold boy a 13yearold is proving you wrongleave a reply your email address
