that said the kids and i are safe alex  justin chambers spearheaded the search calling cristina who hadnt heard from mer since the funeral her dad and even hospitals looking for her on top of trying to reach meredith over and over again for months the only time he heard from his missing friend was on thanksgiving when she answered and told him not to call anymore because she and her kids were

searched for mer alex spearheaded the search for a missing meredith on greys anatomy calling cristina who hadnt heard from mer since the funeral her dad and even hospitals abcmitchell haaseth callie callies  sara ramirez initial reaction was tough because she had to hold in the tragic news when she was in surgery with amelia due to protocol most of her time was spent with her patientturneddate dan  kevin alejandro  who stopped trying to woo her and ended up being a great distraction during the tough time by christmas she had to amputate his leg and then he was fitted for a prosthetic leg after he walked for the first time she broke down sobbing because it was dereks technology that made the leg possible your brain can tell your leg what to do because it all started because of these badass sensors made by an amazing neurosurgeon who… she cried unable to get her words out i wouldnt be here without him he was a brilliant surgeon he was a good friend and he would have loved this photos hot tv doctors arizona arizona  jessica capshaw showed her grief with anger when she overheard a doctor saying the board needs to get off their asses and hire a new neurosurgeon already she freaked out you think that we need to get off our asses she screamed we should do you that solid because the loss of our colleague and friend is all about your needs your schedule you think we should be sensitive to that how about you take a minute to think about the person the talent the life that we lost how about you think before you start complaining that derek shepherds death has been inconvenient for you owen and amelia even though these two arent dating they are very much connected owen  kevin mc kidd was the one to tell amelia  caterina scorsone about dereks death — and she reacted coldly saying ive done this before i know the drill not a big deal — then he immediately went off to war to lead trauma care for soldiers amelia used jokes to cope like saying if derek saw this he would roll over in his grave it made everyone especially stephanie very uncomfortable and she continued using this coping mechanism until she had a meltdown at the hospital apparently she could not leave the hospital even to go to a narcotics anonymous meeting because she was so worried one of her patients would die like derek and the families would hate her she questioned why everyone you give a crap about walks away or is ripped from your world without warning without reasons in convenience stores and plane crashes and podunk hospitals with podunk doctors who dont do what theyre supposed to do which is save people amelia used jokes to cope with dereks greys anatomy death like saying if derek saw this he would roll over in his grave abcmitchell haaseth this is when owen came back and amelia revealed to him that she had a bag of oxycontin in her pocket and she was deciding whether to take it or not every man ive ever loved has died even my baby she told him he told her to move through the pain and grieve instead of running away from it realizing he did the same thing by going to war we do these things we run off we medicate we do whatever we can to dull the situation but we have to feel owen told amelia and even though she screamed i cant do this it seemed like they could do it together now jackson and april instead of coping with her feelings april  sarah drew decided to run off too leaving for what was supposed to be three months helping owen in the war but she ended up extending her tour three times frustrating and upsetting jackson  jesse williams  their last phone call was on christmas when she exclaimed were supposed to have a child were supposed to be celebrating christmas as a family before bombs sounded off around her and the call was lost jackson was worried but thankfully she came back to surprise him at the end of the episode photos tvs best couples richard richard helped everyone with their grief and took care of them like a father — particularly amelia he put everyone in their place saying that meredith grey is not a missing person and told them she was gone because she was taught to run by her mother his coping mechanism was to embrace the love in his life catherine avery  debbie allen  but she wouldnt let him propose his heart was broken but she made it up by the end of the episode with an epic proposal at the hospital with flowers and candles and lights i love you richard webber i love you and i would very much like for you to be my husband that is of course if you would like it too she said his response about damn time at first bailey sobbed and couldnt control herself when she got the news of dereks death on greys anatomy abcmitchell haaseth bailey at first bailey  chandra wilson sobbed and couldnt control herself but she eventually calmed down the entire episode centered around her argument with her husband ben  jason george  about wanting to be hooked up to ventilators or not if this happened to them she just wanted to be unplugged and he wanted to keep praying for a miracle there was a funny line where miranda questioned what if i meet idris elba  and asked if she could cheat on her brain dead husband then and ultimately ben caved and gave her a will that stated she could unplug him it turned out that bailey was just bottling in her feelings because she thought he didnt love her enough to hope for a miracle anymore i love you too much … ever since derek died i wake up desperate for air having these terrifying dreams something happened to you she cried on valentines day but ben eased her fears joking i promise that i will let you die first meredith while shes gone heres what happened to meredith in the subsequent months from easter through christmas we didnt see or hear from
