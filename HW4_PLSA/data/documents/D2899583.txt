benefits of stem cell nutrition stem cells and aging expanding the possibilities frequently asked questions stem cell research what is plant based stem cell therapy plant based stem cell nutrition are nutritional substances from plants that have been shown to support the release and activity of your bodys own adult stem cells this supplement supports wellness by assisting the body in its ability to maintain healthy stem cell physiology production and placement just as antioxidants are important to protect your cells from free radical damage stem cell nutrition is equally important to support your stem cells in maintaining proper organ and tissue functioning in your body plant extract stem cell enhancers is the ideal alternative to the embryonic stem cells therapy as ethical concerns have slowed embryonic medical research into applications for stem cells also the embryonic stem cells can unpredictably cause cancer in the treated patient the theory that adult stem cells are nothing less than the human bodys natural selfrenewal system has profound implications for every area of modern medicine the idea that heart disease diabetes liver degeneration and other conditions could be things of the past is no longer science fiction because of recent adult stem cell research breakthroughs these are real possibilities in the short term new research demonstrate that plant based stem cell extract derived from aqua botanical source supports the natural role of adult stem cells these plant stem cell extracts are typically derived from certain edible algae that grows in fresh water when there is an injury or a stress to an organ compounds are released that reach the bone marrow and trigger the release of stem cells stem cells can be thought of as master cells stem cells circulate and function to replace dysfunctional cells thus fulfilling the natural process of maintaining optimal health the health benefits of having more stem cells in the blood circulation have been demonstrated by numerous scientific studies it would be too long here to summarize this vast body of scientific data i simply suggest you research the work of dr donald orlic at the national institute of health dr robert sampson md on stem cell nutrition   we have a product that has been shown and demonstrated in the patent to increase the level of adult circulating stem cells by up to 30 it seems to me were having a great opportunity here to optimize the bodys natural ability to create health the amazing power of stem cell nutrition stem cells are defined as cells with the unique capacity to selfreplicate throughout the entire life of an organism and to differentiate into cells of various tissues most cells of the body are specialized and play a welldefined role in the body for example brain cells respond to electrical signals from other brain cells and release neurotransmitters cells of the retina are activated by light and pancreatic ßcells produce insulin these cells called somatic cells will never differentiate into other types of cells or even proliferate by contrast stem cells are primitive cells that remain undifferentiated until they receive a signal prompting them to become various types of specialized cells stem cell supplements dr cliff minter  stem cells are the most powerful cells in the body we know that stem cells once theyre circulating in the bloodstream will travel to any area of the body that has been compromised or damaged and turn into healthy cells there have been controversial discussions about the new stem cells found in embryos but the truth is that everyone has adult stem cells in their own bodies we are all created from stem cells as a child or a young adult your body automatically releases stem cells whenever you injure yourself thats why you heal so fast when you are younger after about age 35 we dont heal as fast anymore because the stem cells arent released the same way as when we are younger stem cell nutrition helps all of us heal our bodies if you look at the new england journal of medicine youll find that the number one indicator of a healthy heart is the number of stem cells circulating in the body stem cell nutrition is the organic and allnatural way to stimulate the bone marrow to release adult stem cells into the bloodstream by taking stem cell nutrition you can maintain optimum health and aid your body in healing itself its certainly a better way to recuperate from an illness than using prescription drugs because even when a medication works it can often be hard on your liver and the rest of your body stem cell nutrition has no negative side effects this makes it a powerful approach to healing and good health in general i found out about stem cell nutrition after someone asked for my opinion on it i did some research and found it to be one of the greatest ways to slow down aging that we have aging is nothing more than the breakdown of cells stem cell nutrition combats that action as cells break down stem cell nutrition replaces them with healthy cells this is the greatest most natural antiaging method i know i was skeptical at first but the results ive personally seen in people ive talked with have been wideranged lots of people have reported an increase in energy and better sleeping patterns ive seen people with arthritis in various parts of their bodies reverse the disease and people with asthma end up with their lungs totally clear one person that was on oxygen almost 247 is now totally off of oxygen two ladies who suffered badly from pms told me they were 100 percent symptomfree within weeks of starting the stem cell nutrition two people i know had tennis elbow which usually takes about six to nine months to heal within weeks of taking stem cell nutrition both report their tennis elbow is gone it makes sense because stem cells go to whatever area is compromised and turn into healthy cells i use stem cell nutrition as a preventative ive noticed an increase in my energy level and an improved sleeping pattern stem cell nutrition has zero negative side effects is very powerful and we know how it works its good for children as well as adults this is the best most natural way i know to optimum health if you just want to use it for prevention this is the best thing i know for staying healthy and if you do those and regaining optimum health i recommend it to everybodydr cliff minter retired graduated from illinois college of podiatric medicine he completed his residency at the hugar surgery center in the hines veteran administration hospital in illinois before going into private practice in ventura ca dr minter is a national and international speaker on the subjects of business and nutritional products the stem cell theory of renewal the stem cell theory of renewal proposes that stem cells are naturally released by the bone marrow and travel via the bloodstream toward tissues to promote the bodys natural process of renewal when an organ is subjected to a process that requires renewal such as the natural aging process this organ releases compounds that trigger the release of stem cells from the bone marrow the organ also releases compounds that attracts stem cells to this organ the released stem cells then follow the concentration gradient of these compounds and leave the blood circulation to migrate to the organ where they proliferate and differentiate into cells of this organ supporting the natural process of renewal most of the cells in the human body are specialists assigned to a specific organ or type of tissue such as the neuronal cells that wire the brain and central nervous system stem cells are different when they divide they can produce either more stem cells or they can serve as progenitors that differentiate into specialized cells as they mature hence the name because specialist cells can stem from them the potential to differentiate into specialist cells whose populations in the body have become critically depleted as the result of illness or injury is what makes stem cells so potentially valuable to medical research the idea is that if the fate of a batch of stem cells could be directed down specific pathways they could be grown harvested and then transplanted into a problem area if all went according to plan these new cells would overcome damaged or diseased cells leading to healing and recovery the life of a stem cell can be viewed as a hierarchical branching process where the cell is faced with a series of fate switches schaffer says our goal is to identify the cell fate switches and then provide stem cells with the proper signals to guide them down a particular developmental trajectory stem cells have the remarkable potential to develop into many different cell types in the body serving as a sort of repair system for the body they can theoretically divide without limit to replenish other cells as long as the person or animal is still alive when a stem cell divides each new cell has the potential to either remain a stem cell or become another type of cell with a more specialized function such as a muscle cell a red blood cell or a brain cell when a stem cell divides each new cell has the potential to either remain a stem cell or become another type of cell with a more specialized function scientists believe it should be possible to harness this ability to turn stem cells into a super repair kit for the body scientist and author christian drapeau explains how the stem cell enhancers function to maximize human performance  supporting the release of stem cells from the bone marrow and increasing the number of circulating stem cells improves various aspects of human health for very active and sports focused people stem cells are the raw materials to repair microtears and microinjuries created during training the results according to drapeau are that active people whether former nba stars or amateur weekenders can exercise more intensely at each training session with the ultimate consequence of greater performance theoretically it should be possible to use stem cells to generate healthy tissue to replace that either damaged by trauma or compromised by disease among the conditions which scientists believe may eventually be treated by stem cell therapy are parkinsons disease alzheimers disease heart disease stroke arthritis diabetes burns and spinal cord damage stem cell nutrition therapy in veterinary care both of my big dogs have gained their youth back i am a true believer in stem cell nutrition for pets as it has provided a spectacular change in both ginger and rowdy sonya instem cell nutrition for dogs horses and other animals are specially formulated to be a delectable treat for your animal the pet chewables and equine blends make it easy to provide your animals with this valuable nutritional supplement the most common story is that of old tired and sluggish dogs turned — within a week or so — into active alert dogs running around like puppies the same was observed in horses old horses who used to remain standing in the barn or under a tree sluggish or stricken by too much discomfort to walk around suddenly began moving about and at times running and bucking like young colts one of the most common reports was obvious improvements in hoof health and coat appearance stem cell supplementstimes when there is an injury or a stress to an organ of your beloved pet or horse compounds are released that reach the bone marrow and trigger the release of stem cells stem cells can be thought of as master cells stem cells circulate and function to replace dysfunctional cells thus fulfilling the natural process of maintaining optimal health as they do in humans adult stem cells reside in animals bone marrow where they are released whenever there is a problem somewhere in the body looking back on stem cell research we realize that most studies have been done with animals mostly mice but also with dogs horses pigs sheep and cattle these studies have revealed that animal stem cells conduct themselves the same way human stem cells do when there is an injury or a stress to an organ of your beloved pet or horse compounds are released that reach the bone marrow and trigger the release of stem cells the stem cells then travel to tissues and organs in need of help to regain optimal health equine stem cell nutrition evemarie lucerne  evemarie keeps nine horses all older thoroughbreds and was eager to participate in the trials of a new stem cell enhancer for horses she shared her allotment of test products with a few large commercial thoroughbred farms veterinarians and other horse people she knows and has been pleased with the consistently excellent results she has seen and others have reported to her this product will help so many animals she says adding people and animals are more alike than we are different so it makes sense that a stem cell enhancer for animals with promote their health too evemaries equine stem cells nutrition show dramatic results for several horses facing serious physical challenges cases where the animals might have to be put down we saw a return to quality of life this did not happen before equine stem cell nutrition evemarie says that this turnaround was quick less than two weeks in many cases and that the subject horses were back to health and enjoying pasture life within a month one of the unofficial trial subjects for the equine stem cell nutrition was a 30year old donkey who was in bad shape evemarie reports he had chronic respiratory difficulty and could move about only haltingly his owner had stem cell enhancer supplements to help with her own serious health challenges and shared it with the donkey the donkeys owner says this is the first time she wasnt sick and her donkey is walking all around feeling great an enjoying life againfarrier and national hoof practitioner stephen dick received some of the trial product from evemarie and had good results with the two horses he selected for trial for a 12yearold quarterhorse stallion the equine product brought dramatic results this horse used to lie down twentytwo hours of the day because he suffered discomfort whenever he stood steve reports continuing after a couple of weeks with equine stem cell nutrition he was getting up and moving around showing no discomfort for a highspirited mare with a leg problem the equine product brought about a whole new lease on life steve says this horse had been in a stall for 8 months after about 6 weeks taking the equine product with her grain her condition had improved and she was out of the stall walking around in the pasture again little joe a small 18yearold quarter horse that judy fisher bought when he was nearly 400 pounds underweight you could count his ribs judy says remembering and his backbone stuck up like a ridge all along his back he was very very thin little joe also suffered from breathing problems that kept him lethargic and inactive vetrecommended remedies were unsuccessful in changing little joes physical problems and the vet told judy he didnt expect little joe to live through the winter i figured little joe was in such bad shape that anything was worth a try she says she began giving the horse stem cell nutrition with his feed and grain twice a day within a couple of weeks judy was surprised to see little joe beginning to gain weight and run buck snort and kick his breathing was no longer labored and his skin and coat were improving within six weeks little joes overall appearance had changed dramatically he had put on almost 300 pounds when his former owner came to visit judy says he didnt recognize little joe thats how different he lookedsara participated in the stem cell nutrition product trials with her two horses and her 80pound mixedbreed dog she noted significant improvement in the health and quality of life for all three animals during the time of the trials for jj saras 18year old quarterhorse the equine product brought about improvements in his overall mood appearance and alertness quickly he really liked the product from the beginning sara reports pointing out that hank her 16yearold thoroughbredquarterhorse had not taken to the taste of it too readily i was able to slowly wean him on it though she says for hank the equine product was a balm for the skin problems resulting from his allergy to fly bites his skin condition improved dramatically sara reports noting that before the equine product the horse had scratched and bitten himself into ope wounds after the equine product the scratching and biting dropped off to almost nothing sara also noticed an increase in hanks energy and liveliness in the first week on the equine product the horses foot and hip discomforts also responded well leading to a noticeable increase in his mobility and an overall improvement in his quality of life throughout the twomonth study sara gave the pet product to her dog roxy who had suffered for two years with ear problems that led to scratching often until her skin was raw vetrecommended remedies had been temporary quickfixes sara says but the discomfort always returned with a vengeance for the pet trials sara gave roxy two tabs of the product a day for two months noting this is the only supplement she was getting sara says roxys problem with her ears definitely improved the hair as grown back on her head and ears and the ear problem has not recurred adding that roxy is happier and engaging more playful health science helping your body heal itself the national health institute lists seventyfour treatable diseases using ascs in therapy  an invasive and costly procedure of removing the stem cells from ones bone marrow or a donors bone marrow and reinjecting these same cells into an area undergoing treatment for example this procedure is sometimes done before a cancer patient undergoes radiation healthy stem cells from the bone marrow are removed and stored only to be reinserted after radiation into the area of the body in need of repair this is a complex and expensive procedure not accessible to the average person however there is now a way that every single person no matter what their health condition can have access to the benefits of naturally supporting their bodys innate ability to repair every organ and tissue using stem cell nutrition david a prentice ph d  within just a few years the possibility that the human body contains cells that can repair and regenerate damaged and diseased tissue has gone from an unlikely proposition to a virtual certainty adult stem cells have been isolated from numerous adult tissues umbilical cord and other nonembryonic sources and have demonstrated a surprising ability for transformation into other tissue and cell types and for repair of damaged tissues stem cells restore memory in mice experiments point to ways to treat injury stroke and even alzheimers experts say a new u s study involving mice suggests the brains own stem cells may have the ability to restore memory after an injury these neural stem cells work by protecting existing cells and promoting neuronal connections in their experiments a team at the university of california irvinewere able to bring the rodents memory back to healthy levels up to three months after treatment the finding could open new doors for treatment of brain injury stroke and dementia experts say this is one of the first reports that you can take a stem cell transplantation approach and restore memory said lead researcher mathew blurtonjones a post doctorate fellow at the university there is a lot of awareness that stem cells might be useful in treating diseases that cause loss of motor function but this study shows that they might benefit memory in stroke or traumatic brain injury and potentially alzheimers disease in the study published in the oct 31 issue of the journal of neuroscience blurtonjones and his colleagues used genetically engineered mice that naturally develop brain lesions the researchers destroyed cells in a brain area called the hippocampus these cells are known to be vital to memory formation and it is in this region that neurons often die after injury the researchers explained to test the mices memory blurtonjoness group conducted place and object recognition tests with both healthy mice and braininjured mice healthy mice remembered their surroundings about 70 percent of the time while braininjured mice remembered it only 40 percent of the time for objects healthy mice recalled objects about 80 percent of the time but injured mice remembered them only 65 percent of the time the researchers then injected each mouse with about 200000 neural stem cells they found that mice with brain injuries that received the stem cells now remembered their surroundings about 70 percent of the time  the same as healthy mice however mice that didnt receive stem cells still had memory deficits the researchers also found that in healthy mice injected with stem cells the stem cells traveled throughout the brain in contrast stem cells given to injured mice lingered in the hippocampus only about 4 percent of those stem cells became neurons indicating that the stem cells were repairing existing cells to improve memory rather than replacing the dead brain cells blurtonjoness team noted the researchers are presently doing another study with mice stricken with alzheimers the initial results are promising blurtonjones said this has a huge potential but we have to be cautious about not rushing into the clinic too early one expert is optimistic about the findings putting in these stem cells could eventually help in agerelated memory decline said dr paul r sanberg director of the center of excellence for aging and brain repair at the university of south florida college of medicine there is clearly a therapeutic potential to this sanberg noted that for the process to work with alzheimers it has to work with older brains there is clearly therapeutic potential in humans but there are a lot of hurdles to overcome he said this is another demonstration of the potential for neural stem cells in brain disorders health benefits of stem cell nutrition dr nancy white ph d   ive always been interested in health generally and in particular the brain focusing on the balance of neurotransmitters i often do quantitative eegs for assessment of my patients im impressed with the concept of a natural product like stem cell nutrition that could help release adult stem cells from the bone mass where the body would have no objection and no rejection ive tried stem cell nutrition for general health antiaging after taking it for a time i fell more agile and my joints are far more flexible i was astounded while doing yoga that i was suddenly able to bend over and touch my forehead to my knees i havent been able to do that comfortably in probably twenty years i noticed how much better my balance has become i believe stem cell nutrition is responsible for these effects because i certainly havent been trained extensively in yoga also since taking stem cell nutrition i feel better and my skin is more moist and has a finer texture a bald friend of mine who is also taking the stem cell nutrition had several small cancers on top of his head his doctor had removed one from his arm already and his dermatologist set a date to remove those from his scalp before the appointment my friend was shaving one morning and looking in the mirror saw that the cancers were all gone they had disappeared within a few weeks of starting the stem cell nutrition and his skin is better overall also his knee which hed strained playing tennis was like new stem cell nutrition seems to go where the bodys priority is you never know what the affect is going to be but you notice something is changing another friend of mine seems to be dropping years her skin looks smoother and her face younger after about six weeks on the stem cell nutrition she looks like shes ten years younger a woman who gives her regular facials asked what she was doing because her skin looked so much different stem cell nutrition is remarkable and could help anybody everybody should try it because its natural and there are no risks as we grow older in years we still can have good health thats the ideal even if you dont currently have a problem stem cell nutrition is a preventative dr white holds a ph d in clinical psychology an ma in behavioral science and a b f a in fine arts magna cum laude in addition she is licensed in the state of texas as a psychologist  a marriage and family therapist and as a chemical dependency counselor fernando aguila m d  due to a heavy patient load i have recently found that i tire more easily my legs are cramping and by the time i get home even my shoulders and rib cage hurt i knew i had to find a way to increase my stamina energy and vitality a friend gave me information about stem cell nutrition and how it promotes the release of stem cells in the body one of the components apparently promotes the migration of the stem cells to tissues or organs where regeneration and repair is needed most my attention was drawn to the fact that it can increase energy vitality wellness concentration and much more it sounded just like what i needed since then ive heard reports of people experiencing excellent results in a number of different areas in their health the improvements sounded dramatic because of all of their testimonies i was willing to believe it could promote wellness in the human body i tried stem cell nutrition myself after a day of hard work i realized i wasnt tired at all my legs were not aching and i didnt have any shoulder pain i decided the stem cell nutrition must be working i continued to take it and was able to work so efficiently and steadily that one surgeon commented that i was moving like a ball of fire stem cell nutrition gives me support physically and mentally i look forward to seeing what the major medical journals have to say about the studies being done with this new approach to wellness fernando aguila m d graduated from the university of santa thomas in manila  philippines he finished his internship at cambridge city hospital cambridge ma and

cell nutrition he holds a bs in neurophysiology from mc gill university and a master of science in neurology and neurosurgery from the montreal neurological institute one particular stem cell enhancers that was studied was found to contain a polysaccharide fraction that was shown to stimulate the migration of natural killer nk cells out of the blood into tissues the same polysaccharide fraction was also shown to strongly stimulate the activation of nk cells nk cells play the very important role in the body of identifying aberrant or defective cells and eliminating them nk cells are especially known for their ability to detect and destroy virally infected cells and cells undergoing uncontrolled cellular division the same polysaccharide fraction was also shown to stimulate macrophage activity macrophages constitute the front line of the immune system they first detect an infection or the presence of bacteria or virally infected cells and they then call for a full immune response adult stem cell nutritional enhancer also contains a significant concentration of chlorophyll and phycocyanin the blue pigment in afa phycocyanin has strong antiinflammatory properties and therefore can assist the immune system the release of stem cells from the bone marrow and their migration to tissues is a natural process that happens everyday stem cell enhancers simply support that natural process and tips the balance toward health everyday it does not do anything that the body does not already do everyday so far no instances of cancer or any similar problem have ever been observed when using in vivo natural release of stem cells from the bone marrow each day stem cells in the bone marrow evolve to produce red blood cells white blood cells and platelets these mature cells are then released into the bloodstream where they perform their vital lifesupporting functions when bone marrow stem cell activity is interfered with diseases such as anemia red blood cell deficit neutropenia specialized white blood cell deficit or thrombocytopenia platelet deficit are often diagnosed any one of these conditions can cause death if not corrected scientists have long known that folic acid vitamin b12 and iron are required for bone marrow stem cells to differentiate into mature red blood cells vitamin d has been shown to be crucial in the formation of immune cells whereas carnosine has demonstrated a remarkable ability to rejuvenate cells approaching senescence and extend cellular life span other studies of foods such as blueberries show this fruit can prevent and even reverse cell functions that decline as a result of normal aging blueberry extract has been shown to increase neurogenesis in the aged rat brain green tea compounds have been shown to inhibit the growth of tumor cells while possibly providing protection against normal cellular aging based on these findings scientists are now speculating that certain nutrients could play important roles in maintaining the healthy renewal of replacement stem cells in the brain blood and other tissues it may be possible according to these scientists to use certain nutrient combinations in the treatment of conditions that warrant stem cell replacement stem cell supplements these studies demonstrate for the first time that various natural compounds can promote the proliferation of human bone marrow cells and human stem cells while these studies were done in vitro they provide evidence that readily available nutrients may confer a protective effect against todays epidemic of agerelated bone marrow degeneration dr robert sampson md on stem cell nutrition   we have a product that has been shown and demonstrated in the patent to increase the level of adult circulating stem cells by up to 30 it seems to me were having a great opportunity here to optimize the bodys natural ability to create health recent scientific developments have revealed that stem cells derived from the bone marrow travel throughout the body and act to support optimal organ and tissue function stem cell enhancers supports the natural role of adult stem cells stem cell enhancer are typically derived from certain edible algae that grows in fresh water stem cells and aging expanding the possibilities the possibility that a decline in the numbers or plasticity of stem cell populations contributes to aging and agerelated disease is suggested by recent findings the remarkable plasticity of stem cells suggests that endogenous or transplanted stem cells can be ‘tweaked in ways that will allow them to replace lost or dysfunctional cell populations in diseases ranging from neurodegenerative and hematopoietic disorders to diabetes and cardiovascular disease as you age the number and quality of stem cells that circulate in your body gradually decrease leaving your body more susceptible to injury and other agerelated health challenges just as antioxidants are important to protect your cells from free radical damage stem cell nutrition is equally important to support your stem cells in maintaining proper organ and tissue functioning in your body stem cell biology section from the national institute on aging mahendra s rao m d ph d a fundamental breakthrough in our understanding of nervous system development was the identification of multipotent neural stem cells neurospheres about ten years ago dr weiss and colleagues showed that egf epidermal growth factor dependent stem cells could be harvested from different brain regions at different developmental stages and that these could be maintained over multiple passages in vitro this initial finding has lead to an explosion of research on stem cells their role in normal development and their potential therapeutic uses many investigators have entered this field and the progress made has been astounding frequently asked questions how does an increase in the number of circulating stem cells lead to optimal health circulating stem cells can reach various organs and become cells of that organ helping such organ regain and maintain optimal health recent studies have suggested that the number of circulating stem cells is a key factor the higher the number of circulating stem cells the greater is the ability of the body at healing itself scientific interest in adult stem cells has centered on their ability to divide or selfrenew indefinitely and generate all the cell types of the organ from which they originate potentially regenerating the entire organ from a few cells adult stem cells are already being used clinically to treat many diseases these include as reparative treatments with various cancers autoimmune disease such as multiple sclerosis lupus and arthritis anemias including sickle cells anemia and immunodeficiencies adult stem cells are also being used to treat patients by formation of cartilage growing new corneas to restore sight to blind patients treatments for stroke and several groups are using adult stem cells to repair damage after heart attacks early clinical trials have shown initial success in patient treatments for parkinsons disease and spinal cord injury the first fda approved trial to treat juvenile diabetes in human patients is ready to begin at harvard medical school using adult stem cells an advantage of using adult stem cells is that in most cases the patients own stem cells can be used for the treatment circumventing the problems of immune rejection and without tumor formation why do we hear much in the news about embryonic stem cells and very little about adult stem cells the first human embryonic stem cells were grown in vitro in a petri dish in the mid 1990s rapidly scientists were successful at growing them for many generations and to trigger their differentiation into virtually any kind of cells ie brain cells heart cells liver cells bone cells pancreatic cells etc when scientists tried growing adult stem cells the endeavor was met with less success as adult stem cells were difficult to grow in vitro for more than a few generations this led to the idea that embryonic stem cells have more potential than adult stem cells in addition the ethical concerns linked to the use of embryonic stem cells have led to a disproportionate representation of embryonic stem cells in the media but recent developments over the past 23 years have established that adult stem cells have capabilities comparable to embryonic stem cells in the human body not in the test tube many studies have indicated that simply releasing stem cells from the bone marrow can help support the bodys natural process for renewal of tissues and organs the bone marrow constantly produces stem cells for the entire life of an individual stem cells released by the bone marrow are responsible for the constant renewal of red blood cells and lymphocytes immune cells a 2530 increase in the number of circulating stem cells is well within physiological range and does not constitute stress on the bone marrow environment the amount of active bone marrow amounts to about 2600 g 57 lbs with about 15 trillion marrow cells stem cells that do not reach any tissue or become blood cells return to the bone marrow effectiveness of stem cell enhancers was demonstrated in a tripleblind study volunteers rested for one hour before establishing baseline levels after the first blood samples volunteers were given stem cell enhancersor placebo thereafter blood samples were taken at 30 60 and 120 minutes after taking the consumables the number of circulating stem cells was quantified by analyzing the blood samples using fluorescenceactivated cell sorting facs consumption of stem cell enhancers triggered a significant 2530 increase in the
