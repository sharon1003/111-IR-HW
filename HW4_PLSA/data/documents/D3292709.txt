rap music hip hop music music what is lyrical hip hop6 answers harley lesley former marketing consultant answered aug 3 2017hip hop was created from the streets of big cities the dance was targeted and used by the youth and has been growing ever since there really isn’t one kind of force in lyrical hip hop because you use different force to express different emotions when they are near each other there is more tension on the dancers because they rely on each other how did lyrical hip hop start from what i know hip hop began in the late 1960′s lyrical dance started at the same time because people were dancing to express themselves and tell stories so back to your question “ what is lyrical hip hop ” hiphop dance refers to social or choreographed dance styles primarily danced to

it all answered jan 16 2018originally answered what is lyrical hiphop turn on the television and observe what you see that talk show host wants to be the greatest darn host to ever appear on t v that sitcom actress wants to be the best character on set that basketball player wants to lead his team to every ring he can fit on his finger we are humans of a competitive nature and the sport of hiphop is no different the sport is born with hiphop being vocal proving to be the better rapper meant becoming more lyrical this gave birth to wittier punchlines metaphors double entendres and anything else that seemed unorthodox the aim of the rapper was to position his or her bars in a manner that felt impossible to be duplicated by the competition however during this time rap was only rap there was no subgenre to be considered lyrical hiphop either you were good lyrical or you were trash until the money started pouring in to sell or not to sell that is the question if their’s any unspoken rule of the american dream it would be anything that becomes about the dollar more than the craft becomes watered down as the brands sponsors and middle america got a hold of hiphop the culture lost its competitive nature in the eyes of rappers it was he who got the biggest check that was now the best the sport went from skill set to the bank accounts so here we are now so now we have the term lyrical hiphop a line in the sand was blatantly drawn get with the program and make music that appeals to the woman kids overseas etc or focus on your diminishing niche of lyrical hiphop lovers yes lyrical rappers can still be about the money however the difference between the two are that they still put forth mental effort into forming their verses whether it’s through a message vivid storytelling or simply enhancing production ie kendrick lamars vocal effects they make it an obligation to challenge themselves each and every time they touch the mic868 views · view upvoterspromoted

no offense lyrical rap hip hop is just when the artist puts effort into the lyrics of their music it does not necessarily need an uplifting or socially conscious message or telling your life story they could be talking about how much money they have but if they use good lyricism wordplay like metaphors alliteration similes strong imagery etc then i would call it lyrical rap they could talk about taking a crap on a car but if they use good lyricism it’s lyrical rap thats just what you think if you disagree let me know in the comments325 views reshav chauhan writerpoetnovelist 2013presentanswered jan 16 2018originally answered what is lyrical hiphop to express your lyrics in a rhythm on a hip hop beat is called lyrical hip hop in my opinion but the lyrics of the song should have power to touch the hearts the beat should energise you up and flow or rhythm should click up your mind the lyrics of a hip hop song should always be a reality only that way it ‘ll reach your heart and can be called a real hip hop song or rap reality attitude perfection in other sense125 views gurmel singh grewal answered jul 19 2016lyrical hip hop is a form of modern dancing in which the
