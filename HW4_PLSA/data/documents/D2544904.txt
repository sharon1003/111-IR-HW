basement the problem comes when i get the synths i need to set free i cant talk to them and when i try they say thanks for sparing us this results in me not being able to complete the quest objective deal with the escaped synths any idea on how to fix this25 comments share save hide reportall 25 commentssorted by best want to add to the discussion post a commentcreate an account – bacon marmalade 7 points 2 years ago i had the same thing from what i could tell they stay there so that you can kill them and choose that path and to take the other path you have to go back to the cit ruins and confront father on the ceilingpermalink embed save – misterdisco 6 points 2 years ago i informed the brotherhood and the railroad then killed the courser immediately nobody attacked me and i walked to the synths without killing anyone now it says deal with the synths and talk to father however when i talk t the synths they have nothing to say and when i got to the c i t ruins the quest marker tells me immediately to go back out then back in so hes nowhere to be foundpermalink embed save – mikey2012 8 points 2 years ago the marker is unclear when you enter to the right there should be a side room with a staircase follow the staircase up to a door which leads to the roof father will be on the roof took me ten minutes of running around to figure that out lolpermalink embed save parent – the ghost stalker buffout with your muff out 2 points 2 years ago go to the roofpermalink embed save parent – trip6god 5 points 2 years agolol my game glitched on this quest too but it just allowed me to walk past everyone without any enemies but later on i went back and theres a brotherhood member thats glitched and wont die and now i cant talk to anyone because theyre all hostile towards himpermalink embed save – lockjawz the institute  s 3 points 2 years ago i just figured it out once you get to the room with the synths meet father on top of the cit ruinspermalink embed save parent – brokedownsystem 3 points 2 years ago i have a large piece of plywood blocking me from going to the roof to go see father also couldnt talk to synths in basement properlypermalink embed save – phantom liberty 3 points 2 years ago if theres conflict still going on try and put an end to it the way i did the quest was i ran past everyone and everything until i got to the quest synths told them they were free to go and the courser showed up i forget what happened here but i either told it something to initiate combat or it was hostile already so i killed the institute synths and finished the rest of the quest there could have somehow been a break in the scripting when you initially killed the courser  other synthspermalink embed save – brokedownsystem 3 points 2 years ago ughwhat a mess first the glitch where my personal room at the institute cant be examined immediately followed by this bunker hill one i have a situation where i killed the courser immediately siding with the railroad but not informing the bos the bos showed up anyhow anyhow i cannot talk to the synths at the basement they just say whatever default thank you the turrets are strangely hostile to me i have strong as a follower not sure if that affects anything the kicker here is that i subsequently went to go see father at the cit wasted a bunch of time trying to where to go bc of the conflicting marker directions and i cant get to the roof bc there is a piece of plywood blocking off the doorwaylol shakes head in disbelief im going to try and destroy the hostile turrets back at bunker hillpermalink embed save – tyrssons 2 points 2 years agowere you ever able to find a workaround i just ran into the same plywood issuepermalink embed save parent – brokedownsystem 2 points 2 years ago hi tryssonsits been awhile already i honestly couldnt tell you what went down i believe the problem has to do with the how the final endgame comes down you have to be hostile to 2 out of 3 factions in order for the game to run smoothly the reason why i saw the plywood was probably bc i wasnt yet hostile to the institute and desperately trying to find a way not to fight them sorry im not the best of help this is what happens when you stay up too late to play video games in my case i often cant remember what transpired after only a few months the answer is likely elsewhere on google too thoughpermalink embed save parent –

point 2 years ago hi guys im trying to talk to father but when i go up the stairs the game crashes and application closes i tried the suggested actions which says to look for updates and cant find an update every time i try to walk around the building it will crash in specific spots as well anything i can do or is it just crashed forever really want to finish this quest  permalink embed save – elisabetesr89 1 point 2 years ago read somewhere that playing offline would stop the error code i get from happening but im still getting this and unable to progress with the quest im right by the door to speak to father but every time i open the door to get to the roof the game gets an error code and application closes pretty gutted as this is the main quest i wanted to dopermalink embed save – b4r3lytry1ng 1 point 2 years ago for me when i enter the c i t building i glitch and fall through the floor anyone elsepermalink embed save – brando171 1 point 2 years ago same thing for me thats what brought me here have you had any luck in finding out a fixpermalink embed save parent – brokedownsystem 1 point 2 years ago hmmm my long post errored out damnit anyhow i sided with the railroad with strong as my follower couldnt talk to the synths and the turrets were strangely hostile to me after the battle was over i went to go see father at the cit but the rooftop doorway is blocked off by an impenetrable piece of plywood xdpermalink embed save – kittifizz 1 point 2 years ago actually not being able to talk to those synths is not a glitch you have the option to use said synths recall codes dealing with them or turn on the institute and go talk to father sparing thempermalink embed save – pawniac 1 point 1 year ago late reply but you must not kill the courser if you do the quest gets bugged instead head inside the basement kill all the turrets or wait until either the synths or the brotherhood do and talk to the escaped synths if you want to oppose the institute tell them theyre free to go and then the quest will update asking you to kill the courserpermalink embed save – ddjj0022jjrr welcome home 1 point 2 years ago i have that problem a lot trying to talk to someone for a quest or something and they just say some default phrase and walk offpermalink embed save – spookyscarymoonstar 0 points 2 years agoi really need help with this i got the mission and didnt align with either bos or railroad and killed the courser and let the synths go but theyre just standing in the same room thanking me and whatnot it wont complete the synth part of the mission and then when i go to meet father hes nowhere to be found in citpermalink embed save – lockjawz the institute  s 2 points 2 years ago did you check on the roof of the cit buildingpermalink embed save parent
