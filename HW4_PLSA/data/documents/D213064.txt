indian oceans from japan to australia 2 they can be identified by their yellowish skin and characteristic blue and black rings that change color dramatically when threatened they eat small animals including crabs hermit crabs shrimp and other crustaceans they are recognized as one of the worlds most venomous marine animals 3 despite their small size—12 to 20 cm 5 to 8 in—and relatively docile nature they are dangerous to humans if provoked and handled because of their venom which contains the powerful neurotoxin tetrodotoxin contents  hide 1 classification2 behavior21 feeding3

hapalochlaena maculosabluelined octopus  hapalochlaena fasciatahapalochlaena nierstraszi was described in 1938 from a single specimen from the bay of bengal with a second specimen caught and described in 2013 5behavior  editblueringed octopuses spend much of their time hiding in crevices while displaying effective camouflage patterns with their dermal chromatophore cells like all octopuses they can change shape easily which helps them to squeeze into crevices much smaller than themselves this along with piling up rocks outside the entrance to its lair helps safeguard the octopus from predators variable ring patterns on mantles of hapalochlaena lunulata if they are provoked they quickly change color becoming bright yellow with each of the 5060 rings flashing bright iridescent blue within a third of a second as an aposematic warning display in the greater blueringed octopus  hapalochlaena lunulata  the rings contain multilayer light reflectors called iridophores these are arranged to reflect blue–green light in a wide viewing direction beneath and around each ring there are dark pigmented chromatophores which can be expanded within 1 second to enhance the contrast of the rings there are no chromatophores above the ring which is unusual for cephalopods as they typically use chromatophores to cover or spectrally modify iridescence the fast flashes of the blue rings are achieved using muscles which are under neural control under normal circumstances each ring is hidden by contraction of muscles above the iridophores when these relax and muscles outside the ring contract the iridescence is exposed thereby revealing the blue color 6in common with other octopoda the blueringed octopus swims by expelling water from a funnel in a form of jet propulsion feeding  editthe blueringed octopus diet typically consists of small crabs and shrimp but they may also feed on fish if they can catch them the blueringed octopus pounces on its prey seizing it with its tentacles and pulling it towards its mouth it uses its horny beak to pierce through the tough crab or shrimp exoskeleton releasing its venom the venom paralyses the muscles required for movement which effectively kills the prey reproduction  editthe mating ritual for the blueringed octopus begins when a male approaches a female and begins to caress her with his modified arm the hectocotylus a male mates with a female by grabbing her which sometimes completely obscures the females vision then transferring sperm packets by inserting his hectocotylus into her mantle cavity repeatedly mating continues until the female has had enough and in at least one species the female has to remove the overenthusiastic male by force males will attempt copulation with members of their own species regardless of sex or size but interactions between males are most often shorter in duration and end with the mounting octopus withdrawing the hectocotylus without packet insertion or struggle 7blueringed octopus females lay only one clutch of about 50 eggs in their lifetimes towards the end of autumn eggs are laid then incubated underneath the females arms for about six months and during this process she does not eat after the eggs hatch the female dies and the new offspring will reach maturity and be able to mate by the next year toxicity  editthe blueringed octopus despite its small size carries enough venom to kill twentysix adult humans within minutes their bites are tiny and often painless with many victims not realizing they have been envenomated until respiratory depression and paralysis start to set in 8 no blueringed octopus antivenom is available 9venom  editblueringed octopus from new south wales australia the octopus produces venom containing tetrodotoxin histamine tryptamine octopamine taurine acetylcholine and dopamine the venom can result in nausea respiratory arrest heart failure severe and sometimes total paralysis blindness and can lead to death within minutes if not treated death if it occurs is usually from suffocation due to paralysis of the diaphragm  citation neededthe major neurotoxin component of the blueringed octopus is a compound that was originally known as maculotoxin but was later found to be identical to tetrodotoxin 10 a neurotoxin also found in pufferfish and in some poison dart frogs 11 tetrodotoxin is 1200 times more toxic than cyanide 12 tetrodotoxin blocks sodium channels causing motor paralysis and respiratory arrest within minutes of exposure the tetrodotoxin is produced by bacteria in the salivary glands of the octopus 13a person must be in contact with the octopus to be envenomated faced with danger the octopuss first instinct is to flee if the threat persists the octopus will go into a defensive stance and show its blue rings only if an octopus is cornered and touched will a person be in danger of being bitten and envenomated  citation neededeffects  edittetrodotoxin causes severe and often total body paralysis tetrodotoxin envenomation can result in victims being fully aware of their surroundings but unable to breathe because of the paralysis that occurs they have no way of signaling for help or any way of indicating distress the victim remains conscious and alert in a manner similar to curare or pancuronium bromide this effect however is temporary and will fade over a period of hours as the tetrodotoxin is metabolized and excreted by the body the symptoms vary in severity with children being the most at risk because of their small body size treatment  editfirst aid treatment is pressure on the wound and artificial respiration once the paralysis has disabled the victims respiratory muscles which often occurs within minutes of being bitten because the venom primarily kills through paralysis victims are frequently saved if artificial respiration is started and maintained before marked cyanosis and hypotension develop efforts should be continued even if the victim appears not to be responding respiratory support until medical assistance arrives ensures the victims will generally recover  citation neededit is essential that rescue breathing be continued without pause until the paralysis subsides and the victim regains the ability to breathe on their own this is a daunting physical prospect for a single individual but use of a bag valve mask respirator reduces fatigue to sustainable levels until help can arrive  citation neededdefinitive hospital treatment involves placing the patient on a medical ventilator until the toxin is removed by the body  citation neededvictims who survive the first twentyfour hours usually recover completely 14popular culture  editthe blueringed octopus is the prominent symbol of the secret order of female bandits and smugglers in the james bond film octopussy appearing in an aquarium tank on silk robes and as a tattoo on women in the order 15 16 the animal was also featured in the book state of fear by michael crichton where a terrorist organization utilized the animals venom as a favored murder weapon the adventure zone featured a blueringed octopus in its petals to the metal series 17references  edit
