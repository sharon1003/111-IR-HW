breaking ‘jeepers creepers 3’ still not in production legions of fans continue getting excited over nothingby josh millican january 9 2015i am pleased to announce that as of september 11 2015 the thesis of this article is no longer true jeepers creepers 3 is officially in preproduction read the official announcement here  before proceeding any further please make sure you read the headline correctly in early july 2011 imdb caused a glorious uproar among horror fans when they announced that jeepers creepers 3 had at long last gone into production too bad it wasn’t remotely true the unnews even came as a surprise to franchise mastermind victor salva who said at the time “it has come close several times to going before the camera and i hope someone sees the wisdom in shooting this according to imdb we already started shooting i guess they started without us”this misinformation is just one example of many false rumors regarding jeepers creepers 3 reportedly subtitled cathedral that have caused first elation and then devastation among horror fans when reports are disproven occasionally an excited fan will stumble across one of the fanmade trailers for jeepers creepers 3 on you tube inevitably he or she will share the news all over facebook or twitter—which only adds to the confusion listen fans i’m not mad at you there’s a lot of bs out there on the internet and it’s difficult to separate fact from fiction established horror sites that purposely stoke false hope among unsuspecting fans with the goal of increasing internet traffic however you guys suck background it’s time to get the story straight despite it’s pitiable 45 freshness rating on rotten tomatoes jeepers creepers released in 2001 was an amazing success grossing almost 60 million worldwide the film succeeded in no small part thanks to the villainous antagonist the titular creeper a chilling hybrid of man and demon jeepers creepers was further bolstered by a crackling script and amazing chemistry between the film’s lead actors justin long and gina philips play a brother and sister duo on a roadtrip through rural florida who run afoul of the dangerous beast the film firmly established writerdirector victor salva as an up and coming horror practitioner of unusual promise the sequel simply titled jeepers creepers ii and helmed again by victor salva was released in 2003 and picks up three days after the events of the first film this time the action centered on a family seeking vengeance against the creeper and a broken down bus full of high school kids who find themselves easy prey while hardcore fans weren’t as impressed with salva’s second jc effort the film was another undeniable success this time grossing over 63 million worldwide in the years since silva has gone on to direct the horror films rosewood lane 2011 and dark house 2014 but he and fans have been holding out hope for a 3 rd chapter in the jeepers creepers franchise for ages considering the confirmed profitability of the franchise and the documented legions of followers it seems like producing part 3 would be a nobrainer so… wtf is going on development limbo hollywood hell the push for jeepers creepers part 3 began almost immediately after the release of part 2 in 2003 the first reports to surface claimed the next installment would serve as both a prequel and a sequel starting off in the old west and ending 23 years after the events of the first two films it was implied that gina philips would team up with ray wise and luck edwards who played the protagonists in part 2 for a no holds barred battle royale against the insidious creeper salva was clearly deeply inspired telling fans and online news outlets that part 3 would be the most ambitious of the franchise since then a whole lotta nothing the project seems to be stalled at the source mgm who owns the franchise balked at salva’s requested filming budget the project was downgraded a theatrical release was scrubbed and plans were made for an eventual directtodvd release for jeepers creepers part 3 this callous treatment of an established cashcow franchise by the studio is utterly mindboggling as the years slogged on with no progress hopes began to fade things seemed to be looking up when in 2011 salva reported“though i’ve been beating this drum for so long that people have started not to believe me i am told that they are very close to a financing deal for the third film in the trilogy so i want to say the film is moving forward but let’s not jinx it by saying anymore” maybe he should have kept his mouth shutyou jinxed it victorsince then rumors have circulated about a possible jeepers creepers tv series that would pick up wherever part 3 ends other rumors said mgm had decided to move forward with the film reinstating a theatrical release as long as it’s produced in 3d an option that does not please salva one bit another postulated that it was being filmed in secret other more likely rumors involve squabbling over casting decisions script rewrites and as always money jeepers creepers click bait this morning the horror site i horror posted an article on their facebook page triumphantly proclaiming justin long confirms ‘jeepers creepers 3 plot offers project update just like i’ve seen dozens of time before excited fans many of whom probably didn’t even read the actual article start gushing with similar sentiments “finally” and “i can’t wait” and “i’ve been looking forward to this for years” getting people’s hopes up with a misleading headline isn’t the worst crime in the world but it definitely toys with our emotions those who did click on the link discovered first of all that this article was published months ago back in early september 2014 so this is hardly recent news furthermore they give credence to “facts” presented by someone who’s not remotely involved in the film’s production justin long may appear in a flashback but he’s an actor not a producer so he’s in absolutely no position whatsoever to “confirm” anything and what were his supposedly jawdropping revelations you ask“there is a script it’s called jeepers creepers cathedral  gina philips plays the lead in it it’s been tough getting off the ground financially unfortunately”this is for getting my hopes up justinin other words more of the same old same old thanks for nothing nothing but the facts here’s what we know there is a script for jeepers creepers part 3 victor salva wrote the screenplay and is attached to direct unfortunately mgm seems at the moment unwilling to ponyup the funds necessary to bring this project to fruition anything else you’ve heard about the progress of jeepers creepers 3 is an unsubstantiated rumor so how can we separate fact from fiction first of all unless the news comes from an established industry site you should doublecheck it before rushing to the internet to stir the pot with unfoundedexcitement i keep telling folks when jeepers creepers 3 finally does go into production we’ll all know it—because it’s going to be a huge news story you won’t be able to escape itanother rumor the creeper’s truck will return in part 3feel hopeless about the entire situation wish there was something you could do about it a way to convince mgm to do right by fans i’m reminded of the occupy midian campaign a group of dedicated genre fans who almost singlehandedly brought the director’s cut of clive barker’s nightbreed to the masses jeepers creepers needs a champion or better yet a movement fans need to let mgm know that we’re still here and just as excited as ever for the jeepers creepers saga to continue without an organized high profile effort hell may freeze over before cathedral ever sees the light of day have you been looking forward to a 3 rd chapter

hypocritical post about something i wrote really guys once again it is this post that is the clickbait – not my valid news story about the movie you guys baffle me you really do josh millican9 january 2015 at 133 pm  reply john  it has nothing to do with you it has to do with the timing and i horro’s decision to publish an old article as recent news the only way you are even connected to this article is by leaving a comment claiming ownership this article is about confusion over jc3 in general the i horror post was just one of several examples i learned my lesson last time old chap please don’t take this one personally as for clickbait you need to understand that the feelings i present are genuine and the title of this article is obviously ironic if you felt singled out or attacked please accept my sincerest apologies josh john squires9 january 2015 at 638 pm  reply you can’t write a post accusing sites like i horror of clickbaiting by writing up nonnews stories about jeepers creepers 3 when you yourself are writing a nonnews story about jeepers creepers 3 that’s just silly and the post you’re criticizing was written by me which is how this has something to do with me i’m not butthurt about it but come on man you keep writing stories calling out people me specifically for doing the very thing you’re doing by writing those stories how does that make any sort of sense josh millican9 january 2015 at 656 pm  reply first of all john you’re welcome to contact me off line if you’d prefer i’d welcome this discussion but i’d like to quote something you said during our last spat “just do me a favor and don’t publicly assassinate my character when you write posts about things i write feel free to offer up your differing opinions on your own site but please don’t try to make me look like some sort of cyber terrorist” i granted you the professional courtesy you requested by not naming you or anyone and the only entity i levied blame at is the site so unless you identify yourself as i horror i’m not sure why you you feel attacked i supposed i could have made more of a point to say “i’m griping about site promoters not writers” but i thought it went without saying i’m not sure how a headline informing people that there is nothing new to report is click bait it’s obvious irony this article is a discussion about jc3 that includes reasons for fan confusion one reason is headlines that imply the film is actually in preproduction i like you john and i have a of respect for your work i feel bad that we got off on the wrong foot but i learned my lesson i may gripe about institutions or companies but i’m keeping the names of individuals out of my articles i didn’t post a link to the i horror article so the only way anyone would no you had anything to do with it is your own comment sorry not trying to write a novel here in closing understand that i am a maverick and i don’t shy away from expressing my sometimes controversial opinions also please address your issues to me josh millican not “you guys” i do not represent the bloodshed no one here asked me to write this and we represent a divers group of writers with different styles and opinions i hope we can put this one behind us as well best regardsjosh jb9 january 2015 at 725 pm  reply victor should look into doing a kickstarter campaign similar to how veronica mars got the funding to shoot their film as many news articles as i’ve seen go around about ‘fake’ news i’m sure the horror sites would promote the hell out of it and victor would get all the money he needed josh millican9 january 2015 at 730 pm  reply good point jb he might be worried about getting backlash similar to what spike lee experienced when he attempted crowdfunding a lot of folks thought he didn’t have the right to ask others for money since he’s already well off i’m torn personally while i think crowdsourcing should mostly be utilized by those without other means i think that these campaigns create a real sense of community and excitement which could be exactly what this movie needs thanks for your commentssteven19 january 2015 at 1024 pm  reply dude i don’t mean to come across as a snob but please don’t ever lump jeepers creepers and crowdfunding into the same category again this is a franchise that is and was dramatically successful at the box office if you think about it the last thing people need to do after waiting so long is to pay out of their own pockets to get it made because mgm pretends to be in financial crisis what would make them think we’re not not to mention the people who can only afford to spend a few bucks like me will miss out on the surely grandiose rewards set up for people with more money crowdfunding is a pisspoor trend at best and that goes for any type of crowdfunding holding art ‘hostage’ and threatening not to release it unless you collect profit from the fans is simply unethical tim t22 february 2015 at 1135 pm  reply thanks for the update i don’t understand why or how their is so many trailers for the movie but yet no movie mgm i guess doesn’t think 60 million is enough revenue to make jc3 i have waited and promising other’s we were gonna to see this as soon as it is released well thank you for shedding the light on all the bs and sites falsely portraying its release thanks again…josh millican22 february 2015 at 1159 pm  reply most of those trailers are actually made by fans with good intensions of keeping interest alive and generating support unfortunately they get passed around so much people think they’re real and that the film already exists it can be frustrating for surelisa25 february 2015 at 345 pm  reply ugh apparently right now hot tub time machine 2 is more worth mgm’s money than jc3 which is ridiculous seeing as how i haven’t met a single person who even liked the first httm as for this article being “click bait” i disagree this is the first site i’ve seen that didn’t promise me a false “update” or an exclusive yet vague quote from salva or long in which they don’t even explain the whole situation with the production issues this article wasn’t deceitful in any way was written pretty recently and actually provided some information concerning the film’s holdup that i couldn’t find anywhere else i think we should show mgm what kind of money since that’s apparently all they care about they’re missing out on by not moving forward with jc3 don’t know how we’d do that but if someone were to make a “bring the creeper back” shirt i’m not saying i wouldn’t buy it joey29 march 2015 at 734 am  reply i’m gonna have to agree i been google searching jeepers creepers 3 news or updates forever this is the first time i seen something in 2015 that right off the top told me there is a production issue and i found the whole read very informative so thank you for that maybe i don’t understand all this movie production talk but with all the crappy ass movies that come out constantly this just doesn’t make sense to me who wouldn’t want this and if mgm is putting other movies out than their main focus should be to make the most money back from a movie and that would be putting a jc3 out lastly every trailer not most of them are fan made you can’t find me an official jeepers creepers 3 trailer if you could they would be a movie coming out please bring the jeepers creepers back josh millican29 march 2015 at 1054 pm  reply thanks joey you’re absolutely right that mgm’s lack of interest in perpetuating this franchise completely flies is the face of rational reasoning it’s just doesn’t make sense i’m not in “the industry” either so we’re equally perplexedarsalan9 april 2015 at 130 am  reply come on people let’s start a petition or something you said to sound off on the comments let’s start something jean21 april 2015 at 454 pm  reply i guess we are waiting for the creeper to feed looks like it will be 23 years before jeepers creepers cathedral hits the screen how disappointing we have allwaited too longcreeper fan30 may 2015 at 551 pm  reply don’t understand the hate towards this movie series i liked the first one and thought the sequel was even better which rarely are nowadays come on mgmkami3 june 2015 at 801 am  reply come on everyone wants jc3 the first one is one of my all time favorite movies i wish there was a way i could directly talk to them and tell them how not disappointed they would be if they made it tyrus sanders6 june 2015 at 1258 pm  reply well this is very shocking to me my name is tyrus i’m 16 years old and for the most part movies have always been my favorite occupation since i was a young boy i’ve always had a fascination about horror films its just how they give you chills and goosebumps while watching them and jeepers creepers was one of those movies i grew up on both of the movies jc and jc2 were absolutely incredible i still have both of them on vhs and dvd so why not bring back a jeepers creepers 3 or 4 i would love to see that as many others would i believe that mr victor salva would love to bring it back as well but mgm is not willing to cooperate in bringing it back so needless to say i ask mgm to please bring back this horror franchise it would make not only other jeepers creepers fans around the world happy but for a kid like me i would love to see it once again apart of my childhood so please whoever is on this site i urge you to help bring back jeepers creepers so share this please sincerely tyrus sanderspoobrainhorse10 june 2015 at 821 pm  reply i have loved the first two films for years been waiting for a third instalment just as long it being june 2015 i have completely given up anything i hear about the film being in production i will automatically assume is a lie until mgm confirms the film or i see it on a shelf i’ll be putting jeepers creepers 3 in the back of my mind however i waited a long time for tremors 5 and my prayers were answered… so who knows susan25 june 2015 at 427 pm  reply i love the jeepers movies i have been watching horror movies since i was 5 my parents obviously didn’t know because i have been watching horror movies for so long it takes a really good storyline to make me jump the jeepers movies did it for me i even turned my husband onto the jeepers movies i have been patiently waiting for 3 and will continue to wait patiently but come on mgm… give your head a shake jeepers has cult status now so making some serious dough is a no brainerphysc30 june 2015 at 405 pm  reply bassically what they need to do is make it in the next 2 yrsthrow a huge budget at itdon’t base it on the prior movies but let it stand apart another town another duo a more frightening creeper and his truck updated and more dark they should just reinvision it but keep major ties to the prior 1st movieanother creative scene like the scarecrow scene from number 2 the revenue you could get from that kind of film makes the original revenue nothing it should be a 15 end of story not this quick cash 1212a generic tripe of late that is a mustas the current younger audience where likely not even aware of the original movies and 1212a is killing it’s production companies reputation to even come up with a single movie now that is not generic and is not1212a damn it lol physc30 june 2015 at 413 pm  reply if you want a prime example of why 1212a certification destroys a film by watering it down for kidsjust look no further than the robocop remake compared to the original movie as a good start point the gore the slight realism and adult humor and the absolute much needed clarence bodicker character made the film and then 12a destroyed it i’d love to see them make a jaws remake that actually was good but right now would be a bad bad time to let a production company get there 1212a slapped all over it to cash inalthough the special effects would abliterate itthe age censorship would just beat it back down to a watered down kids film and destroy any chance of it being original or remotely scary physc30 june 2015 at 417 pm  reply even as an average guy i bet you a grand to a penny i could write a far superior story to be made into a script than half the garbage out therei think it far better if the director keeps to his vision without them forcing it to be 1212a i guess is what i am saying to end on tim hughes23 july 2015 at 1107 pm  reply i dont understand how this movie cannot get financed the last two movies were so goodoscar24 july 2015 at 1224 am  reply go cry some where else john jenny10 august 2015 at 514 pm  reply come on and just make it already we
