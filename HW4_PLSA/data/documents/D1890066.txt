caines cardboard arcade caine monroy is a 9year old boy who spent his summer vacation building an elaborate cardboard arcade in his dads used auto parts store he spent months perfecting the game designs making displays for the prizes designing elaborate security systems and hand labeling paperlunchgiftbags unfortunately his dads store is in an industrial part of east l a and gets almost no
