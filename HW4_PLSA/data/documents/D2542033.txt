the united states 5 the issei japanese brazilians are an important part of that ethnic minority in that south american nation american issei  editmain article japanese american the first members of the issei did not emigrate directly to the mainland united states but to hawaii when it was americancontrolled but not yet one of the united states these emigrants—the first of whom arrived on board the steamship city of tokio in february 1885—were common laborers escaping hard times in japan to work in hawaii their immigration was subsidized by the hawaiian government as cheap labor was needed for important commodity crops especially its sugar plantations numerous japanese eventually settled in hawaii 6emigration of japanese directly to the united states began in 1885 when studentlaborers landed on the west coast of the united states 7 the earliest of these emigrated to san francisco their numbers continually increased in the late 1880s and early 1890s their purpose in moving to america was to gain advanced knowledge and experience in order to develop the modern society at home both students and laborers were attracted by the image of the united states as a country that welcomed foreigners when they first arrived in the u s they had not intended to live there permanently but rather to learn from americans and to take that knowledge back home while they encountered discrimination they also made opportunities and many settled in california and later in washington and oregon as well canadian issei  editmain article japanese canadians within japanesecanadian communities across canada three distinct subgroups developed each with different sociocultural referents generational identity and wartime experiences 8 9 the narrative of issei japanesecanadians include postpearl harbor experiences of uprooting incarceration and dispersal of the prewar japanesecanadian communities 10peruvian issei  editmain article japanese peruvian among the approximately 80000 peruvians of japanese descent the issei japanese peruvians comprise a small number former peruvian president alberto fujimori was the nisei son of issei immigrants from kumamoto japan fujimoris political opponents tried unsuccessfully to prove that he was born in japan persons must be nativeborn peruvian citizens to qualify for the presidency 11cultural profile  editgenerations  editjapaneseamericans and japanesecanadians have special names for each of their generations in north america these are formed by combining one of the japanese numbers corresponding to the generation with the japanese word for generation  sei 世 the japaneseamerican and japanesecanadian communities have themselves distinguished their members with terms like issei nisei and sansei which describe the first second and third generation of immigrants 9 the fourth generation is called yonsei 四世 and the fifth is called gosei 五世 the issei nisei and sansei generations reflect distinctly different attitudes to authority gender involvement with nonjapanese religious belief and practice and other matters 12 the age when individuals faced the wartime evacuation and internment during world war ii has been found to be the most significant factor that explains such variations in attitudes and behaviour patterns 8the term nikkei 日系 was coined by a multinational group of sociologists it encompasses all of the worlds japanese immigrants across generations 13 the collective memory of the issei and older nisei was an image of meiji japan from 1870 through 1911 newer immigrants carry much different memories of more recent japan these differing attitudes social values and associations with japan were often incompatible with each other 14 the significant differences in postwar experiences and opportunities did nothing to mitigate the gaps which separated generational perspectives generation cohort description issei 一世 the generation of people born in japan who later immigrated to another country nisei 二世 the generation of people born in north america latin america australia hawaii or any country outside japan either to at least one issei or one nonimmigrant japanese parent sansei 三世 the generation of people born to at least one nisei parent yonsei 四世 the generation of people born to at least one sansei parent gosei 五世 the generation of people born to at least one yonsei parent 15in north america since the redress victory in 1988 a significant evolutionary change has occurred the nisei their parents and their children are changing the way they look at themselves and their pattern of accommodation to the nonjapanese majority 16there are just over one hundred thousand british japanese mostly in london unlike other nikkei communities in the world these britons do not identify themselves in such generational terms as issei nisei or sansei 17issei  editthe first generation of immigrants born in japan before moving to canada or the united states is called issei 一世 in the 1930s the term issei came into common use replacing the term immigrant  ijusha  this new term illustrated a changed way of looking at themselves the term issei represented the idea of beginning a psychological transformation relating to being settled having a distinctive community and the idea of belonging to the new country 8issei settled in close ethnic communities and therefore did not learn english they endured great economic and social losses during the early years of world war ii and they were not able to rebuild their lost businesses and savings the external circumstances tended to reinforce the pattern of issei being predominantly friends with other issei 8unlike their children they tend to rely primarily on japaneselanguage media newspapers television movies and in some senses they tend to think of themselves as more japanese than canadian or american 8issei women  editissei womens lives were somewhat similar despite differences in context because they were structured within interlocking webs of patriarchal relationships and that consistent subordination was experienced both as oppressive and as a source of happiness 18 the issei women lived lives of transition which were affected by three common factors the dominant ideology of late meiji japan which advanced the economic objectives of the japanese state the patriarchal traditions of the agricultural village which arose partly as a form of adjustment to national objectives and the adjustment to changes imposed by modernization and the constraints which arose within a canadian or american society dominated by racist ideology 19 substantive evidence of the working lives of issei women is very difficult to find partly for lack of data and partly because the data that do exist are influenced by their implicit ideological definition of women 20within the framework of environmental contradictions the narratives of these women revealed a surprisingly shared sense of inevitability a perception that the events of life are beyond the control of the individual which accounts for the consistency in the way in which issei women different and individual in many ways seem to have structured their emotions 21 —and this quality of emotional control was passed to their nisei children aging  editthe kanreki 還暦 a traditional premodern japanese rite of passage to old age at 60 was sometimes celebrated by the issei and is now being celebrated by increasing numbers of nisei rituals are enactments of shared meanings norms and values and this japanese rite of passage highlights a collective response among the nisei to the conventional dilemmas of growing older 22japanese american photographer and former social worker mary koga documented members of her parents generation in their twilight years her portrait of the issei in illinois series shows koga at ease with these people in a relaxed atmosphere done over a long period from the 1970s to the 1990s the images show her elderly subjects at the day care facility and the senior citizens work center of the japanese american service committee jasc and at heiwa terrace a japanese american senior residence both located in chicago 23history  editthe experience of emigrants is inevitably affected by a range of factors directly related to the japanese society they left behind as immigrants the conflicts between the old country and the new played out in unique ways for each individual and yet common elements do begin to appear in the history of the japanese canadian and japanese american communities emigrants from japan  editjapan was a closed country for more than two centuries 1636 to 1853 since military rulers from the tokugawa family wanted to keep foreigners away from japanese society 24 the only exceptions were chinese and some dutch but even they were discouraged from associating with japanese citizens also it was strictly prohibited by law for ordinary japanese citizens to go abroad change came around the early 19th century when the visit of an american fleet commanded by commodore perry caused the new japanese government to replace the tokugawa system of economics and politics during the meiji era in order to open its door to trade and contact with the outside world after 1866 the new japanese government decided to send students and laborers to the u s in order to bring back the knowledge and experience necessary for the nation to grow strong 25after 1884 emigration of working classes was permitted and the first issei began to arrive in north and south america soon after for example in 1890 only 25 issei lived in oregon by 1891 1000 japanese lived in oregon in 1900 2051 japanese had come to live in oregon 25 by 1915 japanese men with savings of 800 were considered eligible to summon wives from japan 26immigrants in america  editmain articles history of japanese americans japaneseamerican life before world war ii and japaneseamerican life after world war iifew japanese workers came to north america intending to become immigrants initially most of them came with vague plans for gaining new experiences and for making some money before returning to homes in japan this group of workers was overwhelmingly male many issei arrived as laborers they worked in employment sectors such as agriculture mining and railroad construction the issei were born in japan and their cultural perspective was primarily japanese but they were in america by choice despite a certain nostalgia for the old country they had created homes in a country far from japan if they had not been prohibited from becoming citizens many would have become citizens of the united states 27in 1913 californias alien land law prohibited noncitizens from owning land in the state and several other states soon after passed their own restrictive alien land laws this included the issei japanese residents born in japan but not their children the nisei who were born in united states or hawaii and who therefore were american citizens by birth many of the issei responded to the law by transferring title to their land to their nisei children 28americans first impression of issei  editamericans generally viewed the issei as a crude illeducated lot 29 possible reasons for this may be the fact that most japanese were forced to work in menial jobs in the u s such as farming since there were many immigrants working in the u s americans were relatively predisposed to have a negative view toward the immigrants in fact most of the issei were welleducated most of them were better educated than the general japanese public and also compared with the average american population back then sixty percent of them actually completed middle school and 21 percent were high school graduates whether christian buddhists or nonbelievers the issei almost never caused trouble in the civil authority the arrest rate for the issei from 1902 to the 1960s was relatively lower than for any other major ethnic group in california 30 the only exceptions were that some young issei committed crimes relating to gambling and prostitution which stemmed from different cultural morals in japan since buddhist social morals were deeply ingrained the issei tended to refrain from antisocial behavior also they were concerned about the japanese government that the national image should not be sullied by misbehavior in the u s racial segregation and immigration law  editmain article antijapanese sentiment in the united states the post1900 cause to renew the chinese exclusion act became generalized protests against all asian immigrants including the issei 31 since many chinese immigrants left the u s hostility fell on the issei american labor organizations took an initiative in spreading antijapanese sentiment white americans wanted to exclude them since they did not want any asians to take their jobs away as a result they formed the asiatic exclusion league that viewed japanese and chinese as a threat of american workers the protest of the league involved picketing and beatings of the issei in october 1906 amid this antijapanese milieu the san francisco school board carrying out a campaign promise of the mayor ordered all japanese and korean pupils to join the chinese students at a segregated school 32 the issei were displeased with the situation and some reported to japanese newspapers this caused the japanese government to protest against the former president theodore roosevelt and as a result they signed the gentlemens agreement of 1907 this agreement led the period of settling and family building to come by 1911 almost half of the japanese immigrants were women who landed in the u s to reunite with their husbands after the gentlemans agreement a number of nisei the secondgeneration japanese were born in california yet it did not stop some white americans from segregating japanese immigrants the issei were a role model of american citizens by being hardworking lawabiding devoted to family and the community however some americans did not want to admit the virtues of the issei the immigration act of 1924 represented the isseis failed struggle against the segregation the experiences of the issei extend from well before the period before july 1 1924 when the japanese exclusion act came into effect 33the issei however were very good at enhancing rice farming on unusable land japanese californian farmers made rice a major crop of the state the largest issei community settled around vacaville california near san francisco internment  editmain articles japanese canadian internment internment of japanese americans and japanese peruvian § world war iiwhen the canadian and american governments interned west coast japanese

canadian parliament in 1988 most of the issei were dead or too old for it to make any significant difference in lives that had been disrupted notable individuals  editsee also list of japanese americans the number of issei who have earned some degree of public recognition has continued to increase over time but the quiet lives of those whose names are known only to family and friends are no less important in understanding the broader narrative of the nikkei although the names highlighted here are overrepresented by issei from north america the latin american member countries of the pan
