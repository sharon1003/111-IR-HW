designtocost july 1 2015 by yariv sade designtocost dtc is one of the most important aspects of a product design after all in an average product every dollar in cost equals five dollars in sales see calculation most product designers and engineers know how to design costeffective products in terms of engineering and production but tend to overlook the other aspects of dtc in this article i list the main components of dtc and explain how to deal with them during the product design process materials overuse of material has a triple penalty the excessive material cost the excessive production process cost and the excessive ecological footprint this is why you have to be very careful with overengineering good engineering is an accurate engineering – it reaches the sweet point between underengineering and overengineering smart design cad analysis and performance tests are aligned to reach the expected quality with minimal material cost manufacturing a wise designformanufacturing dfm process can reduce costs dramatically my main tip in this matter is get your manufacturers involved in the design process as early as possible  before it is too late or too expensive to take their advice and make design changes labor for some products mainly ones with manual assemblies testing packaging or other processes labor cost can be a major part of the total cost don’t overlook it the labor time should be defined and calculated as part of the product design process and the design should aim to minimize it shipment  logistics in some industries the product’s logistics costs could be a significant part of its total cost the product’s size weight shipment storage parts variety and more could be a barrier to success make sure to consider all these aspects during the rd process procurement procurement might seem to be solely a commercial element well in most cases that’s the way it is – the person in charge of purchasing is involved much too late and therefore has no impact on the design if you only knew in advance you could have made some minor design changes and enabled him to buy alternative parts at the same quality for lower prices make sure to involve your purchaser early in the product design process maintenance in certain industries maintenance costs a lot the product designer can reduce this cost in two ways 1 a more reliable design – one that requires less maintenance 2 maintenance friendly design – one that is easier and faster to maintain sideproducts most products have some sideproducts – tools accessories spare parts packaging user manuals etc these product costs are part of the main product total cost don’t disregard these products some of them are a direct derivative of the main part design and therefore should be integrated as part of the main product design process quantities production quantities have a major impact on efficiency and costs designing a product without considering the expected production quantities might reduce the production efficiency and increase costs the production quantities estimation should be part of the product brief and the design should be created accordingly finance don’t forget to consider the finance factors – customs taxes vat currency exchange rates etc you do not want any surprises in these areas posted on july 15 2015six working methods and techniques for costeffective product design1 create an mbom create the mbom manufacturing bill of materials as soon as possible in the design process the mbom includes the nonengineering aspects suppliers prices quantities etc the sooner you have the mbom data the bigger the chances to update the design according to commercial parameters2 know the product’s cost before it is too late for design changes it doesn’t have to be a final or even accurate cost but you must have a general idea of the product’s cost when you still have the option and the time to make design changes3 calculate the cost yourself before sending rfqs i find it is quite common for product managers to compare between different quotes but much less common for them to compare quotes to their calculations it’s difficult to negotiate without knowing the cost details doing your own calculations will teach you a lot about the cost parameters and will give you a much stronger negotiation position4 make a pareto graph of costs this will lead you to effective cost reduction opportunities reducing product costs requires work and time make sure to spend your costreduction work in the right places5 don’t miss the hidden costs hidden costs might have a great impact on the product’s total cost and they tend to be skipped in cost calculations during the design stage hidden costs are the product’s indirect costs such as by products shipment logistics customs taxes funding etc6 time is money in many cases short timetables cost much more than the same work done over a longer period you have two options one is paying in time and the other is paying in dollars both are fine – make a decision just do not be tempted to take shortcuts and think that you can win them both categories product design management tags bom management business product
