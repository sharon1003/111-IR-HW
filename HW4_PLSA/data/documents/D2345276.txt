how is flexural strength calculated print email save image credit httpwwwzignegocom flexural strength is a mechanical limitation for brittle material such as concrete which is defined as a materials capacity to defend against bend or twist under load flexural strength is the measure of the tensile strength of concrete it is measured in terms of stress whose symbol is σ flexural strength is a measure of an unreinforced concrete beam or slab to resist failure in bending it is measured by loading 6 x 6inch 150 x 150 mm concrete beams whose length is at least three times the depth the flexural strength is expressed as modulus of rupture mr in psi mpa it is also known as b end strength or fracture strength the oblique bending test is most often done using a three point flexural test technique in which a rod specimen having either a circular or rectangular crosssection is bent until fracture or rupture the flexural strength symbolizes the highest stress in the material at its moment of rupture or fracture three point flexural tests gives values for the modulus of elasticity in bending flexural mr is about 12 to 20 percent of compressive strength though the greatest correlation for particular materials is got from the laboratory experiments for given materials and mix design the mr predicted by thirdpoint loading is inferior sometimes as much as 15 than the mr predicted by centerpoint loading content how to understand flexural strength what is the necessity for testing flexural strength how to calculate flexural strength what are the specifications of flexural strength what are the issues with flexural strength how to understand flexural strength in case if an entity or an object which is made of a single material like a wooden beam or a steel rod is bent it undergoes a series of stresses across its profundity the stress will be at its utmost compressive stress value on the concave face inner surface of the bend and the stress will be at its utmost tensile value around the convex face outer surface these inner and outer edges of the beam or rod are known as the extreme fibers majority of materials are unsuccessful or they fail under tensile stress before they fail under compressive stress as a result the maximum tensile stress value that can be sustained before the beam or rod fails is considered to be its flexural strength what is the necessity for testing flexural strength a laboratory mix design based on flexure may be needed or cement content may be selected from early experience to offer the required design mr as the designers of pavements make use of a hypothesis based on flexural strength few of them may also utilize mr for field control and acceptance of pavements only a small number of them use flexural testing for structural concrete generally agencies which do not use flexural strength for field control find compressive strength to be useful easy and constant to evaluate the worth of the concrete how to calculate flexural strength the data required to calculate flexural strength are measured by experimentation with rectangular samples of the material placed under load in a 3 or 4 point testing setup the data such as maximum applied load known as p material span length between points in the test setup known as l width of the material specimen known as b and average depth of the specimen known as d” are collected from the load experiments change maximum applied load in pounds material span length in inches width of the material specimen in inches and average depth of the specimen in inches replace or substitute the numerical values for this data in the equation r  plbd2 for manipulating flexural strength in the equation r is the flexural strength in units of lbs per square inch and quantity ‘d’ squared further explanation is given by multiplying p by l and then dividing that quantity by the quantity of ‘b’ multiplied by‘d’ square the final result is the calculated flexural strength what are the specifications of flexural strength appropriate beam specimens should be done in the field pavement concretes should be rigid 12 to 2 ½ inch slouch after rodding is done the molds are tapped in order to release bubbles and along the sides are shoveled to merge to get an elevated slouch in any case the beam surfaces should not be left dry in order to achieve it it should be dipped in saturated lime water for at least 20 hours prior to testing for the higher variability of flexural strength results conditions and examinations of noticeable low strengths should be taken into account standard deviation for projects with good control range is about 40 to 80 psi values higher 100 psi shows testing problems and there is high possibility that testing issues or moisture variance inside a beam will result in low strength what are the issues with flexural strength flexural tests are tremendously responsive to specimen preparation handling and curing procedure beam specimens are extremely weighty and letting a beam to dry will give lower strengths so beams must be treated and tested in a typical method when it is still wet drying less time can produce a quick drop in flexural strength cylinder strengths are also used for concrete structures majority of state highway agencies have used flexural strength however are currently changing to compressive strength for job control on concrete paving for the purpose of designing flexure can be used however the equivalent compressive strength must be used to order and acknowledge the concrete external references
