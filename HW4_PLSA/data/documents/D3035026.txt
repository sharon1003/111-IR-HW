xxx hi natalie it sounds like youre having a really difficult time i was just wondering whether youre receiving any out of work benefits like jsa esa or income support if not have you checked to see whether youre entitled to these the whole system is quite complicated because housing and council tax benefits are completely income assessed so theyll probably go down as your income goes up check on your local government website theres normally a benefits calculator so you can enter different wages and see how this will effect your payments also tax credits can sometimes go up as you work more once you start to work over 16 hours you become entitled to working tax credits too and if your partner is classed as disabled you can also qualify for help with childcare it is all quite confusing but i hope that helps dont beat yourself up about the credit cards either needs must and sometimes you just have to do what you can to survive remember you were only doing your best for your family

myself this morning when working out that my outgoing each month are way over my incomings so just trying to see what i can do i have spoken to cab and it would appear to be very complicated as you said definately a minefield but basically it says for every pound i earn over £35 i would lose in benefits etc which isnt really the idea i just wanted to top uo what we get if that makes sense oh does get esa but not very much just waiting for him to be assessed for dla now thanks so much for your help will have to look at cutting back or earning some cash in hand i guess xxxxx101111 2144

this will make you a fair bit better off as even low rate care is around £18 per week carers is £55 per week although some does get deducted from ur is or whatever benefit u get also depending on what rate you get you may qualify for extra tax credits with a disabled element feel so lucky go have my wonderful and gorgeous children111111 0636 6natalie b 14view profile view forum posts member join
