thp a technology for the treatment of wastewater treatment plant wwtp sludge prior to anaerobic digestion june 2012 by drs lex menco the norwegian company cambi as has developed and installed worldwide its unique “steam explosion” thermal hydrolysis process thp a technology for the treatment of wastewater treatment plant wwtp sludge prior to anaerobic digestion cambi thp optimizes biogas production and has many other benefits which are described below along with a look at some reallife experiences at medium and largescale facilities introduction established in 1989 offices in norway denmark uk and usaglobal industry leader in our segment advanced biogas production from sludge and biowaste with 26 plants worldwide 530000 metric tons dsy and 5 plants under designconstruction treatment capacity for sludge and biowaste equivalent to 26 million people and 768000 metric tons of ds dry solidsyear production capacity of 1900 gwh thermal energy biogas and 760 gwh electrical energy when using gas engine cogeneration green energy production replaces760000 tons of fossile co 2 emissions avoidance of methane emissions from landfills less transport etc comes in addition about 25 mill tons co 2 equivalentscambi thp is an ecofriendly “paradigmshifting technology” dramatically improving design and operations of biogas plants worldwide the use of the thermal hydrolysis process in sludge treatment for wwtps presents some major advantages in terms of energy public health and environmental protection mediumsized plants can be converted with the import of sludge from other nearby plants into strategic sludge treatment centers here biogas production from anaerobic digestion is maximized using existing capacity generating a pasteurized sludge with high dry solids content the generation of electricity from renewable sources produced from biogas allows the energy costs of the wwtp plant itself to be reduced and the wwtp may even have surplus energy production thermal hydrolysis “steam explosion” process the thermal hydrolysis process thp patented by cambi as is a pretreatment of sludge combined with anaerobic digestion cambi thp works by dissolving and disintegrating sludge using pressure and temperature primary biological or mixed sludge is predewatered and introduced into a reactor where the direct application of saturated steam hydrolyzes and changes its internal structure this reduces sludge viscosity and increases its biodegradability and shortens hydraulic retention time the thermal hydrolysis increases the production of biogas in digestion reduces the volume needed for digestion increases the dryness of the final dewatering of digested sludge eliminates odors and provides pasteurized final sludge class a a valuable and natural fertilizer the thermal hydrolysis is part of a wastewater treatment plant as a pretreatment prior to digestion the cambi thermal hydrolysis process disintegrates the cellular structure of the bacteria in biosludge by solubilizing exopolymers proteins protecting the bacteria producing an easily digestible product this is done by means of a temperature of 165 degrees for 20 minutes at 6 bar followed by a sudden drop in pressure resulting in socalled “steam explosion” unique among all thermal hydrolysis technologies available in the market the steam explosion tears cells and fibers apart further improving the disintegration effect figure 1 thickened mixed sludge without treatment  photo  400x550 micras figure 2 thickened mixed sludge with thermal hydrolysis at 165ºc in 20 minutes – without pressure drop figure 3 thickened mixed sludge with “steam explosion” after hydrolysis process at 165ºc and 20 minutes the cambi hydrolysis system allows maximum disintegration of the cells and it enhances the production of biogas in the subsequent anaerobic digestion and allows high loads in digesters in the cambi plant at thames water’s chertsey wwtp london uk our process operators have tuned the plant to the exceptional capacities of up to 7 kg vs m3day and retention times as low as 1012 days the use of cambi thermal hydrolysis achieves the following generates more energy higher biogas production reduces the final amount of sludge it improves sludge dewatering up to 40 ds treat organic food wastes and edible fats and oils ensures sludge pasteurization ie a pathogenfree sludge produces a stabilized an compostlike product with 70 decrease in odour 1 increases the speed and capacity of digestion less digestion volume reduces carbon footprint a mediumscale sludge treatment center the case of lindum norway cambi hydrolysis system for medium capacities 1540 dry tonnes per day is based on 6 m 3 reactors the system is modular permitting its expansion up to 3 reactors for lower sludge productions cambi has developed an even more compact plant see press release ifat the whole system of hydrolysis is closed without leakage of odor and energy loss drammen norway has recently installed a mediumscale sludge treatment center for dewatered sludge from 9 municipalities 18500 wet tyear fats from the food industry 3000 tyear sludge from septic tanks 7000 tyear and other biological substrates 2000 tyear the project’s main objective was to generate biogas and produce a safe product investment operation and maintenance costs were also considered the use of the 2 reactor cambi b6 hydrolysis system in lindum allows the generation of 16 gwhyear of biogas and 12000 tyear of dewatered biosolids product used as fertilizer this plant shows that it is possible to develop sludge treatment centers on a medium scale where you can optimize the energy efficiency of equipment by importing sludge from outside the wwtp figure 4 cambi hydrolysis system with three reactors of 6 m3 figure 5 thp at lindum under construction largescale thermal hydrolysis the case of dc water washington dc usa the district of columbia water and sewer authority dc water in its blue plains plant treats a sewage flow of 370 mgd 15 m3s the largest wastewater treatment plant with advanced treatment in the u s dc water will be the first to build a thermal hydrolysis plant in north america this thermal hydrolysis plant will be the largest in the world and will be built by cambi as in washington dc with startup in 2014 the plant will treat up to 450 t ds sludgeday and 149000 t ds sludgeyear only four digesters each with a 14400 m3 capacity will be built the biogas will go to a cogeneration facility which will cover the entire steam needs of the thp process itself and generate 13 mw e of power with initial savings of usd 20 millionyear from the energy produced the reduction of the amount of biosolids to agriculture and by avoiding the use of lime the carbon footprint will be reduced by about 60000 t co2year the final dewatered biosolids quantity will be reduced from 500000 tyear to 200000 tyear with safe application to agriculture as a pathogenfree product with no odor problems the project demonstrates the effectiveness of feeding the digesters at a digester load of more than 4 kg vsm 3 twice that of conventional digestion with low retention time in the digesters the cambi thp consists of 4 lines of equal capacity figure 6 overview of project of cambi thermaly hydrolysis and digestion in dc water washington – usacomparative hydrolysis parameters vs conventional
