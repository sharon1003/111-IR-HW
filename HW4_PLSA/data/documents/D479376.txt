truth 6 alcohol and drug abuse spans all classes—the rich the poor and in between the idea of aid recipients as morally bankrupt drug addicts has been around for decades there is increasing legislation that makes drug testing mandatory in order to receive government aid 1 the motivation behind the tests is clear if you are given money we need to know you’re not using it for your next fix understanding why lawmakers feel the need to drug test is a bit more complicated why do we think that the poor are more likely to abuse drugs in order to answer this question we need to understand drug abuse and addiction in america according to the 2011 national survey on drug use and health 225 million americans age 12 and above—87 percent of the population—had used an illegal drug or abused a medication in the past month drug abuse is highest among people in their late teens and early twenties almost a quarter of all 1820 year olds admitted to using an illicit drug in the past month 2 marijuana is the most commonly used drug with 181 million people over the age of 12 using it monthly 3 the statistics for alcohol use are similar more than half of americans aged 12 or older report drinking alcohol in the past month of these people 583 million also admitted to binge drinking within the past month these statistics vary between education level income level and employment status but contrary to widespread belief 2011 statistics show that the rate of alcohol use was over 10 higher for employed people than it was for the unemployed further in 2010 96 of fulltime employed people used illicit drugs compared to only 26 of unemployed people however regular use by the unemployed was double that among those employed full time 84 vs 17 4in other words employed americans use alcohol and drugs at a far higher rate than the unemployed but when the unemployed do use drugs and alcohol they tend to use them more consistently for welfare recipients the statistics are mixed while heavy alcohol use is lower among aid recipients than the rest of the population 59 compared to 64 drug use is higher 96 compared to 68 5 in both cases however the percentages are below 10 further if the rate of drug use was reduced to the same level as nonaid recipients the decrease in participation in welfare programs would be only about 1 6some of the stories about welfare and drug and alcohol abuse and addiction in the media direct blame at the addict and further assume the addiction is part of a pathological culture of poverty but research suggests addiction is a result not a cause of poverty 7 the chronic stress from living in poverty may be addressed by some with illicit drug use and heavy alcohol use but it is important to distinguish the symptom—alcohol and drug use—from the problem—poverty people living in poverty may be characterized as addicts because they typically have less access to recovery programs fewer resources for support and are therefore less likely to recover from addiction than people living above the poverty line it is harder for the poor to bounce back from mistakes to what extent do we “allow” someone to make a mistake the member of a middle class family who has become addicted to alcohol or drugs has a number of options for recovery the same person in a poor family has far fewer options in fact if they admit their addiction they risk losing the benefits they currently have the average cost of a medical detox is 1707 per day 8 insurance may cover 14000 20000 of that amount but over 25 of americans do not have health insurance 9 paying for rehabilitation is a luxury that americans in poverty often cannot afford even with the large percentage of rehab facilities that offer free or reduced costs for treatment 10 time off from work transportation and unsubsidized costs can make treatment difficult to attain substance abuse and addiction is a problem for all americans—rich or poor aid recipients who are addicted to drugs—though they only make a marginal percentage of all recipients—need the same help and understanding that would be given to any other person with a disease sources1 “53 support automatic drug
