instructor joanne abramson joanne has taught middle school and high school science for more than ten years and has a masters degree in education this lesson discusses binocular vision and what it has to do with 3dimensional sight it compares binocular with monocular vision and explores the advantages of each using examples of animals with each type of vision binocular and monocular vision think about the last time you went to a 3d movie you probably noticed that before you put on the special glasses the movie was fuzzy then when you donned the glasses  bam three dimensions so how does this happen before we can answer this question we need some background information3d movies take advantage of the fact the humans have binocular vision animals such as humans that see with binocular vision have both eyes on the front of their head and focus both of their eyes on a single visual image since our eyes are a couple of inches apart we are actually seeing two slightly different images our brain then translates these two slightly different images into one single view without binocular vision we wouldnt be able to enjoy 3d moviesthis may not sound that interesting until you realize that many animals dont see like this many in fact do not see just one image at a time they actually see two separate images simultaneously this type of vision is referred to as monocular vision these animals have one eye on either side of their head one eye focuses on one image in one direction and the other eye focuses on a second image in the other direction the brain can then register two completely separate scenes at the same time the bearded dragon for example has one eye on each side of its head so it has monocular vision the horned owl on the other hand has binocular vision because it has both eyes on the front of its head binocular comes from the latin word bini meaning two and the greek oculus meaning eye so the term refers to two eyes focusing on one visual image monocular comes from the latin root mono meaning single so a single eye focusing on one image advantages of binocular vision is one type of vision better than the other well it depends prey animals such as rabbits small birds fish and deer tend to have monocular vision this is because monocular vision provides a much larger field of view which is very useful for spotting predators since the eyes are on each side of the animals head they can see in both directions at the same time additionally using peripheral vision or the sides of the eye these animals can also see in front and behind them though there are often blind spots in these directions so the rabbit can see the fox approaching on his right the snake hiding in the grass to his left and the burrow where he can hide in front of him a pigeon has a field of vision of 340 degrees while an owl has a field of vision around 110 degrees predators such as cats owls apes and humans however tend to have binocular vision since our eyes are both located on the front of our head our field of vision is decreased however binocular vision allows for greatly increased depth perception or the ability to distinguish the distance of an object it also allows for stereopsis or the ability to see in three dimensions stereopsis is greek in origin and combines stere meaning three dimensional and opsis meaning sight to unlock this lesson you must be a studycom member create your account register for a free trial are you a student or a teacher i am a student i am a teacher
