gallbladder removed each year in most cases the pain of a malfunctioning gallbladder becomes so bad that surgery is the only viable option most people are under the impression that once their gallbladder is taken out the pain and discomfort they’ve been living with will be gone sadly that’s often not the case it is common to have just as much discomfort after the gallbladder is removed people without a gallbladder are more prone to digestive problems and liver problems they can even form stones within the ducts of the liver the risk of developing a fatty liver is also greater in people without a gallbladder some herbs and nutritional supplements are extremely beneficial if you don’t have a gallbladder are you confused about which supplements to take or which foods you should avoid the function of the gallbladder your gallbladder is important your liver continually manufactures bile which travels to your gallbladder where it is stored and concentrated bile helps you to digest fat therefore your gallbladder secretes a lot of bile into your intestines after you’ve eaten a fatty meal bile is also your body’s way of excreting wastes and toxins bile contains cholesterol and other fats that your liver has broken down and wants to excrete a well functioning gallbladder helps your body excrete cholesterol other fats and fat soluble toxins what happens when you don’t have a gallbladder your liver continues to manufacture bile but there is no longer a place to store it or concentrate it therefore bile continually slowly trickles into intestines if you eat a fatty meal you will not be able to secrete a large enough amount of bile into your intestines therefore the fat will be poorly digested this means many people experience diarrhea bloating nausea or indigestion not digesting fat well means you will not be able to digest essential fatty acids including omega 3 and omega 6 fats it also means you’ll have a hard time absorbing fat soluble vitamins
