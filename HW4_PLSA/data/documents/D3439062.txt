how fast does technology change posted by udayan banerjee on february 6 2012 · 4 comments5 votes how fast does technology change what is its impact it is something like the hour hand of a clock if you keep staring at it you would feel that it always remains stationary if you go away and come back after sometime you will see that it has moved a lot the same thing is true with technology amara’s law“we tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run” – roy amara was a researcher scientist and past president of the institute for the future the photo of roy amara is taken from pete steege ‘s blogmany people including bill gates have repeated these words but my search result points to roy amara as the originator of this statement  see wikipediajoseph licklider who is considered by many as the person who brought the idea of cloud computing to the forefront also said something similar – “… people tend to overestimate what can be done in one year and to underestimate what can be done in five or ten years…”  see wikia  look at gartner’s priority matrix along with the hype cycle of emerging technologies gartner also releases a priority matrix which ranks all the listed technology on 2 dimensions – “ benefit” and “years to mainstream adoption” the top left corner indicates transformational technologies which will go mainstream in next 2 years here is a snapshot of the priority matrix for 2009 10  11 most curious thing about these priority matrixes is the empty square at the top left corner 2009 contains almost defunct term web 20 what is being said loud and clear is that for last 3 years there has been no technology which is expected to have a transformational impact in next couple of years looking 10 years back however if you step back 10 years and rewind to beginning of 2002 you will see a picture which was quiet different wikipedia was still an experiment – for serious stuff you looked into encyclopedia britannica the term web 20 had not yet been coined there was no gmail social media or social networking was not invented – so obviously no facebook the terms cloud computing saa s iaa s paa s where still 5 years into the future google ipo was still 2 years away apple had just reported a loss of 25 million usd in 2001i pod has just been launched – i phone and i pad where nowhere in sight the leader in mobile phone was nokia motorola samsung  siemens – no black berry yet here is a collection of mobile handsets from that era – taken from in pictures a history of cell phones look at some of the technology related predictions made by gartner for 2002 full detail here “…across industries geographies and businesses the use of it as an engine for efficiency growth and opportunity will remain undiminished in 2002 although it will be accompanied by healthy skepticism and smarter planning…”consumers will go online finally with the number using online account management doubling by 2005through 2004 businesses will continue to view the discipline of crm as a critical component of corporate strategy more than 50 percent of mobile applications deployed at the start of 2002 will be obsolete by the end of 2002by 2004 web services will dominate deployment of new application solutions for fortune 2000 companies during 2002 leadingedge businesses will exploit application integration to generate business innovation compare it with the 2012 list“…gartner defines a strategic technology as one with the potential for significant impact on the enterprise in the next three years factors that denote significant impact include a high potential for disruption to it or the business the need for a major dollar investment or the risk of being late to adopt…”media tablets and beyond mobilecentric applications and interfaces contextual and social user experience internet of things app stores and marketplaces nextgeneration analytics big data inmemory computing extreme lowenergy servers cloud computing are we living in the same world therefore…if you are into predicting technology change it is very safe to make a prediction for next one year you can confidently say that thinks will remain the same … well more or less only exception is when a “black swan” event like i phone launch happens anyway black swan by definition cannot be predicted but if you want to make prediction for next 3 to 5 year you will be in much more difficult wicket for those of you who do not care about cricket the game – it means it would be much more difficult to predict try predicting for next 10 years…however the moral of the story is to step back and put every change in proper context – and not to “miss the wood for the trees” udayan banerjee on googleadvertisements share this
