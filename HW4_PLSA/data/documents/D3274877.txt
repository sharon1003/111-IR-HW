reply author comment heath preferred member registered 022008 posts 18posted 062510 1im working with a new lender that just conditioned an fha appraisal on my replacing the case number  for example 1051234567 with the same case number that includes the 3 digit extension that i think signifies whether the property is sf or condo  for example 1051234567703 i remember a loooong time ago finding documentation that clarified the proper format for the fha case number on the 1004 and it did not include the last three digits which again i think im remembering correctly 703 for sf and 734 for condo can someone point me to that documentation so that i can either understand why im being asked this or so that i can send the uw the source for why i report the fha case number the way i do i googled searched this forum searched hudclips searched the pdf of appendix d but didnt find anything that specifically mentions the format of the case number or what constitutes a complete case number thanks in advance for any helpguidancesuggestions have a great weekend heath00yoda platinum member registered 061108 posts 421posted 062510 2i would think that the case number used when the order was received is the case number to put on the report00bk43platinum member registered 021808 posts 1593posted 062510 3why are you making a mountain out of a molehill just add the last three digits and be done with it00benjamin platinum member registered 021708 posts 769posted 062510 4instead of fighting it what harm does it do just to add the extension like they ask and move on its like adding the extra four digits to a zip code or something no big deal to me00heath preferred member registered 022008 posts 18posted 062510 5i think you guys may have misunderstood im not fighting it at all but it made me stop and wonder whether i had missed a change in the requirements etc and when i went to look for it i didnt find anything that appeared to be relevant so in a measure to make sure that i was correctuptodatein compliance i thought id ask for some help in locating whenwhere it is required or relevant to include to last three digits i dont like to just do what they ask without understanding why im doing it thank you for reading my post and helping out it is appreciated if however anyone can point me to where theres documentation regarding the case number id still love to see it have a great weekend everyone heath00appraiser9000platinum member registered 012409 posts 394posted 062510 6i believe the 3 digit extension is the automated data processing adp code i dont know if it is technically part of the case number probably a good question for the atlanta hoc00anna platinum member registered 021908 posts 1783posted 062510

code identifies the insuring section and the applicable hud insurance fund indicates an assistance payment contract if any identifies cases where the lender has the option under its contract of mortgage insurance to receive benefits in cash and indicates which mortgages do not require payment of upfront mortgage insurance premium ufmip the lender must show the hud case number including the section ofthe act adp code on the note and the security instrument mortgage or deed of trust the adp code must be the same on these documents as on the firm commitment form hud929004 or direct endorsement de approval form hud92900a documents do not need to be redrawn to correct the case number or adp code this was written by hud a long time ago around 1995 of course there have been many revisions made since then but essentially this is the reason for the adp code go to httpwwwhudgov and in search write in adp code youll receive the most current adp numbers and their definitions as
