facilities were almost completely destroyed soichiro honda created a new company with what he had left in the japanese market that was decimated by world war ii his country was starved of money and fuel but still in need of basic transportation honda utilizing his manufacturing facilities attached an engine to a bicycle which created a cheap and efficient transport he gave his company the name honda giken kōgyō kabushiki kaisha which translates to honda research institute company ltd despite its grandiose name the first facility bearing that name was a simple wooden shack where mr honda and

ties with the government who urged them to absorb smaller carmakers into large brands that could be marketed internationally since the government had extensive control over the industry it was unheard of for a small independent company to mass produce vehicles thus making hondas success historical in the japanese economy though participating in international motorsport see racing honda was having difficulty selling its automobiles in the united states built for japanese buyers hondas small cars had failed to gain the interest of american buyers hondas first automobile imported to the united states was the n600 sold in hawaii in 1969 in 1970 the car was imported to california and beyond but its tiny 600 cc engine and minuscule dimensions made it very unpopular with the american public
