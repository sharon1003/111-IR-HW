in the calmer parts of this busy town frances l1425 1184share1 upright citizens brigade  franklin performing arts  comedy clubs5919 franklin ave los angeles ca 90028242011i could have sworn that i had already reviewed ucb wth im telling you sometimes its the places that you go to the most that you forget to yelp about with that out of the way the upright citizens brigade theater is fantastic easily the best comedy club in los angeles this small very small black box theater in hollywood is not only a great and inexpensive most shows are 58 place to go for some good laughs but it is also an awesome and intimate all ages arena for you to see some new comedians and some awesome seasoned veterans first timers should check out asscat during the weekends hosted by matt besser sean conroy matt walsh and others its a sure thing other great shows include shitty jobs on sunday nights the facebook show harold nights comedy death ray and more a lot of neat folks and high profile comics play here regularly including garfunkel and oats charlyne yi and sarah silverman there are often special guests too for example i went to a cage match competition a few months ago and out of the blue robin williams was added as a special member to both teams for 5 also be sure to check out paul f thompkins dead author readings which benefit the amazing 826la he plays h g wells and hosts various authors who have come back back in time tonight im seeing maya rudolph as anais nin tips check the calendar and if reservations or tickets are offered dont waste time most shows sell out cash only parking in this area my neighborhood is tough stuff a lot of the time so come early grab some awesome dinner on the block and valet if you need to its worth it get in line at least 20 minutes before your show starts esp if you dont have tickets and only a reservation that way you and your group are guaranteed to find seats next to each other have an open mind improv comedy is an art and it takes a hell of a lot for people to be good at it bring out of towners here its got quality shows unlike i owest down the road improv olympic may have a bar but the shows are prettyshrug if you need a bar to have a good timego to birds or la poubelle next door read more2 hollywood bowl music venues  stadiums  arenas2301 n highland ave los angeles ca 900689132010another summer bowl season has come and gone and my goodnessit was a delightful one going to the hollywood bowl has been something my family and friends and i have done since before i could even walk and its something that i truly treasure as a native angelino i love packing elaborate picnics copious amounts of wine no corkage  and a good sweater and walking yes walking up from my house to enjoy a beautiful summer night under the stars with the amazing los angeles philharmonic every now and then a good lease event comes to town and i am equally excited about those in a few weeks ill be going to the pavementsonic youth show theretruly a dream come true whether youre in the front rows the boxes or even in the nosebleeds the bowl is a wonderful experience to spend with friends and if youre lucky youll be serenaded by crickets during intermission my only gripe dont drive take their shuttles walk or take public transit and if you must drive park far away and walk itits not far from hollywood and highland but its definitely a whole other world read more3 wood  vine american new  bars6280 hollywood blvd los angeles ca 900283172011i was so excited about this place opening up near my house i completely forgot to write about it wood  vine is an amazing new american tapas bar located in the historic taft building on the infamous intersection of hollywood and vine this lowkey incognito space may look like a small bar from the outside but once you walk inside you will surely be taken aback by its super high ceilings long darkwood bar its secondfloor loftstyle dining area and most impressively an outdoor patio this place is massive yet somehow maintains a very cozy and intimate feel they offer a handful of very specialty cocktails at average highend prices i ordered the hunter which was an amazing bourbonbased drink with a cherry liquor and fresh lemon peel 12 and the boy got the black manhattan 12 the drinks were stiff but incredibly well mixed with a bit more practice i think these folks could easily rank among some of the best in town mixologywise if cocktails arent your fancy they offer a great selection of craft beers to go along with their absolutely scrumptious small plates menu i ordered a selection of 3 cheese  charcuterie plate w cowgirls mt tam tallegio and amazing i repeat amazzzzzzing terrine aux figues et au porto which is listed as fig and madeira terrine on the menu the serving sizes of the cheese were a little on the small size but the terrine was just so divine i could have used just a few more pieces of toasted baguette next up was the scallop dish which was very fresh and tasty and served on a little bit of grits my only gripes were that for the price one more little scallop would have been good but more importantly although the scallop was cooked well rare in the middle there wasnt a good sear and that awesome carmelization that i love in scallop dishes like this for dessert the profiteroles 5 because the proceeds to picking this dessert went to a nonprofit that wood  vine supports for children the presentation was nice and the ice cream and chocolate were good however the puff pastry tasty a tad burnt on one of them which was odd theyve got a few kinks to work out in the kitchen but the service was spot on and very attentive i got an open table no show i checked in though so that was a little annoying but other than that everyone was great and i am very much a regular who not only hopes they succeed but that they also stay as classy and lowkey as they are now seriously a lovely space that just has that nice 1940s industrial vibe read more4 arc light cinemas cinema6360 w sunset blvd los angeles ca 90028522011i just wanted to update on how amazing the customer service here is i dont usually get to interact with anyone at this theater very often because i buy my member tickets online and redeem them from the kiosks to save on time but my boyfriend the space case that he is lost my debit card here last night and as i freaked out about it and remembered to call the theater the nicest guy answered at guest services and let me know that my card was safe and sound in a vault in the theaters office when i came in to pick it up he knew exactly what i was looking for and had someone bring it out it was bagged and tagged with the location it was found the time and the date too how efficient i seriously love this theater read more5 hollywood blvd hotdog vendor hot dogs  food stands hollywood  highland hollywood ca 900284242011ive said it once and ill say it again baconwrapped hot dogs with grilled onions peppers and mayo are as much a part of being from la as los doyers in n out and remembering when our local programming was cut short because of news coverage of oj simpson trying to run away in his bronco in the 90s amazing how can you resist read more6 off vine restaurant american new  breakfast  brunch  wine bars6263 leland way hollywood ca 900289302010another amazing monday night dinner at offvine you can read my first review of this place to find out how great i think they are so ill keep this one brief we had appetizer duck sausage two grilled duck sausages served with some sort of horseradish mayo type sauce not too big on horseradish but the sausages were good rich and very dense a little on the mineraly side with hints of a little cilantro main courses special pasta of the day shrimp linguine boyfriend got the special and i stole a bite the white wine sauce was delicious and the shrimp and pasta were quite fresh generous amount of shrimp very plump and tender you could tell it wasnt precooked and frozen which is always a plus chicken marsala i havent had this in a long time and it was so satisfying the chicken breasts were cooked perfectly and the marsala wine sauce was just to the right consistency that i like it the mushrooms were a highlight not just a bunch of chopped baby bellas but a handful of fresh shitake and other mushroom varieties that just enhanced the sauces flavor mashed potatoes were yummy as always and the side of sugar snap peas were super sweet and crunchy the perfect way to have them dessert how could we come here without getting a soufflé of course we got one this time around we went for the chocolate which was equally as divine as my favorite the gran marnier the service was tiptop as always and the vibe was a little more low key than a few weeks prior reservations werent super necessary but its always good to make them just in case read more7 hollywood farmers market farmers market1600 ivar ave los angeles ca 900281252010urgent i just came back from my weekly trip to the hollywood farmers market to find out some insanely distressing news the los angeles film school is trying to get them kicked out of ivar street because they want access to their parking on sundaythe same parking lot that they charge marketgoers a whopping 7 to us what is with that dudes in any case the farmers market is in danger their permits for city street closures are up for review and if they are denied a renewal this means that there will be no more market there for the uninitiated the hollywood farmers market is one of the best farmers markets in all of southern california this is not a statement that should be taken lightly they have some of the most unique and consistently great vendors and have expanded greatly over the past 20 years 20 years folks whether you drop by for light grocery shopping browse through the artisinal handmade goods buy your flowers or your amazing home made jams and pestos here the hollywood farmers market has huge variety but a smalltown intimate local feel to it its an institution to not only hollywood but los angeles as a whole as today many folks signed petitions trying to save it i overheard so many sad people talking about how much this market means to them vendors talking about their 10 1520 years of selling their hard work here did i mention that this market also generates a lot of muchneeded revenue for the city of los angeles one of my favorite mushroom vendors told me that they pay 20 to the city in order to be a vendor here so it says a lot that this market has that many vendors to begin with another reason why you should support this and all farmers markets is because over the past few years even the local government has given them props for being a great and healthy way to feed your families the state has started campaigns to allow vendors to accept food stamps and the mayor has even begun an initiative to buy locally grown healthy foods so that it can both combat the growing numbers in childhoos obesity and stimulate local economies here is a blog post about it including the location to a meeting they are holding tomorrow 126
