installed from the kbox user portal software from kbox from the software library tab by an its technician after installation it will not run correctly until you restart the computer here is information on how it was configured for use at carleton personal machines nawho to call s nissen originally authored the windows information in this article but after april 1 2015 rebecca barkmeier will be responsible for the packaging of this application for windows so all questions should be directed to her questions tips and tricks read 1stwhen the lists of updates are presented its generally safe to check everything from the critical recommended and optional tabs however any updates with names similar to the following are lenovo software installations not think pad drivers or utilities these items should not be checked their default installations may mess up the carleton configuration access connections but access help is okayclient security suite fingerprint reader intel amt aka intel v pro support intel wireless drivers and utilities like proset are okaylenovo auto lock lenovo newsshop lenovo solution center lenovo think vantage toolbox aka pcdoctormessage center presentation director for windows xp and vista look for this on the kbox user portal for windows 7 use the builtin windows mobility center instead or hold down the windows logo key while you press prescue and recovery screen reading optimizer in july 2013 sande nissen last reviewed and updated this list anything not listed here is acceptable including bios updates think vantage active protection system anything ultra nav any features any drivers any utility and any windows update modules you dont need the item titled access help but its the online manual for this think pad model and contains useful information the user might want first run the first time you run system update from the lenovo menu under the programs menu it asks some configuration questions if you answer these correctly it will not ask them again first on windows xp only you may see a message that says a problem occurred while loading system update configuration settings please wait while system update restarts  this is normalpress ok then on any version of windows you will see a dialog box with this message under the title user information in order to determine the updates available for your system the following information must be sent to the system update server below that is a checkbox labeled  do not ask me again i agree on sending this information every time check this checkbox and then choose ok next you may see one or more dialog boxes which ask you to agree to a software license and you must accept every time if you see the following checkbox check it and then choose ok or accept and you may receive fewer license prompts in the future i agree to this license notice for all future packages do not show me this license notice again later if system update doesnt start when you launch it from an elevated command prompt try this net start suservice then try launching system update again finally if system update reports that it could not update drivers because it needs elevated rights quit system update then find its icon and rightclick it choosing run as administrator and entering administratorequivalent credentials when prompted for example the admin account set up for the primary user on collegeowned computers technical troubleshooting the system update service  suservice must be running for system update to work other think vantage services are not required system update may offer one or more bios firmware updates aka cmos or uefi updates accepting any bios firmware update will mess up the bit locker encryption on a laptop causing the user to have to use their bit locker recovery key the better approach is to temporarily disable not uninstall not decrypt bit locker do the firmware upgrades then reenable bit locker when system update starts the first thing it does is see if theres a newer version of itself and offer to update if allowed to update itself there is a possibility that this application will revert to its default settings rather than use the customized settings that come with our carleton package in the default settings system update is scheduled to periodically check for and install critical updates without user interaction on a laptop encrypted with bit locker this is a mistake see above this will also happen if system update is downloaded from lenovo and installed manually rather than using our carleton package to disable this scheduled automatic task in system update from the menu on the left choose schedule updates then uncheck enable monthly check for updates then choose save here is a vendor troubleshooting page
