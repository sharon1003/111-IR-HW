how old should you be to stay home alone parents are being warned they could get into trouble if they leave you home alone during the summer holidays part of the problem is theres no clear law that says when its ok to let you look after yourself for a little while so we want to know what you think how old do you think you should be before your parents can leave you at home while they go out should there be an age limit or does it depend on whether youve got older brothers or sisters to help out maybe you think its fine if theyre just nipping to the shops but not if theyd be leaving you all day unfortunately this topic is now closed but there are comments pages on other subjects on the main chat index your commentsi was fine staying at home at 11 but then i went and burnt the plastic on the scales with the toaster and now im not allowed to stay at home by myself ella 11 surrey englandi think you should be 9 because we are very sensible and were not going to open any doors to strangers because we are not stupid like adults treat us like we are ella 10 london englandi think it depends on the person some people may be ready at a really young age whereas some people may take more time to mature i think it depends on how much the parentguardian trusts the child they are leaving you should be at least high school age though emily 10 leeds englandi think that if there is no rule to go by why should there be any argument parents will decide how to deal with their own children and dont need anyone else interfering if they know that their child is trustworthy and responsible to be on their own for a few hours then what harm can it do to anyone else thamasha 13 london englandi think children should be left at home no matter their age if responsible grownups treat kids aged 12 like 3yearolds and this might be the way to treat them suitably for their age emma 11 london englandi think that when you are about 12 you become responsible enough to start looking after yourself definitely not under the age of 10 that is far too young tallulah 12 somerset englandwell i think you should be at least 11 but if youre not ready to stay at home by yourself then just say if you have to stay in the house all day by yourself then i think you should keep in touch with your parents lauren 12 belfast northern irelandi think at 16 you should be allowed to stay at home as long as you dont mess about and dont go near the gas but if you dont want to stay at home you shouldnt be pushed to david 13 manchester englandi think that having a law would be unfair and people would get in trouble a lot because some kids are ready when they are six years old but others still arent when theyre 14 nicola 12 waterloo canadai think you should be over 10 to stay at home alone for a few hours as long as you keep in touch with your parents you can be alone for a whole day i regularly fly longhaul on my own in an aeroplane with no adult accompanying me victoria 11 bristol englandi think that you should at least be 12 to stay at home for a couple of hours but i think that if you are sensible then you might be able to stay for a few minutes samina 11 luton englandi think that you should have a practice thing where your parents go to your neighbours before anything dont cook use knives or answer the door and know your parents phone number off by heart also dont be in charge of another child until you are at least 12 ruth 8 epsom englandi think you should be in high school as you are old enough to look after yourself by then if you are younger then you should have an older brothersister with you just to make sure youre safe hannah 12 stockport englandi think as long as they know how to get out in an emergency and they have a number to call for help then from 10 years old upwards its ok for a few hours ella 12 surrey englandif youre under the age of 6 you shouldnt be left at home at all if youre 8 then its ok for a few minutes if youre 11 then a few hours and no child under 15 should be left alone all day renee 11 ilford englandwell if the child is fully confident in staying in alone and knows about electricity uses and how to use appliances 10 and over is okolivia 10 lincoln englandi think that the minimum age of children being left home alone is changeable depending on how mature the child is but certainly not younger than 10 and only then for a very short length of time sam 11 birmingham englandmy class thinks that 16 should be the legal age yakya 8 bradford englandi think it should be up to your parents and depend on how mature you are claire 11 scotlandi think it all depends on the maturity of the child and whether they are in a fit state to be home alone in my opinion there shouldnt be a law as every child is different and in some cases a 12yearold can be more mature and sensible than a 16yearold chloe 13 somerset englandi think you should be at high school when you are left alone because you become a lot more mature when you go to high school you grow up a lot and part of growing up is not needing your parents to look after you all the time joanie 12 leeds englandi think if youve proven yourself responsible and youre over eight you can be left at home but only for a short trip you should be 12 to be left at home for a whole day zohra 9 london englandit depends how long for a child of 1012 could be left for up to half an hour maybe while their parents are just popping out to the shop or to quickly visit someone but any longer than that and i think the child needs to be in year eight plus 1314 years old maisiegrace 11 swindon englandwell im eleven and i think that children should be allowed home alone from the age of 10 but it depends on how mature the child is and how well the parents trust them becky 11 manchester englandi dont think there should be a set age as all children are different a parent could leave a mature 11yearold at home but you wouldnt leave an 11yearold if heshe was irresponsible and likely to misbehave it all depends on the child charlotte 13 stockport englandi think that children should be allowed to be left home when they are 15 or 16 this is because they might have done work experience and that would have helped them mature tasnia 12 birmingham englandi think it all depends on how much trust your parents have for you and how mature you are for your age but personally i think 10 and below is definitely too young however responsible you are grace 12 london englandi think that if you are 11 you can look after yourself for a bit emma 12 walsall englandabout 1315 years tamzinrose new york usai think you should be 15 because at that time you are mature tracy 9 london englandmy mum leaves me at home sometimes but only when shes going to the shop nick 11 corsham englandi think its all about how mature you are and how safe you feel in the house on your own a teenager should be able to though because you cant keep trailing around after your parents all the time jess 13 englandi think you should be 11 or older to stay at home alone for a day kerensa 12 beccles suffolki think that anyone can stay home alone if their mum or dad trusts them enough its not up to the government or what ever to decide what age to stay home and stuff jodieleigh 11 eastport englandi think you should be 13 and over because you should be responsible at that age but only for at least three hours if not 15 and over to be left at home at night times rebekah 13 australiai think that noone can judge on what age you have to be to stay at home by yourself because only your parents know you best and noone else so noone can make a law on deciding what age you have to stay at home ella 11 london englandi think you should be 14 or over louis 6 west kirby englandim 11 and my mum only lets me stay home alone for around 15 minutes to half an hour but i think that the parents should be able to do what they think is right with this matter aniela 11 cardiff walesmy mum has always said i need to be 12 but that is three years away long timerosa 9 london englandi think you should be 11 if your parents are only going out to the shops and are leaving you alone for 10 mins but at least a teenager 13 if youre alone all day lottie 11 surrey englandi think about 13 to 18 lucy 8 blackburn englandsome of us who are mature get let down by others who are not so i think that we should be allowed toby 10 cambridge englandi think that in a big city children should be 1314 years old but in a town 1213 iwan 9 penarth walesi think parents should only leave their children at home if they are 17 or older it might be all right if they go to the corner shop but not leaving you all day if you have an older brother then it might be all right they should prove they are sensible and wont answer the door or phone in case it is a stranger kids should never go near the gas or windows david 13 manchester englandi think 13 years old is ok for a few hours during the day 15 years old if its on a night time chris 13 englandi think it depends of how responsible the kids are i can stay home alone but not all night and not with my little sister josie 14 sheffield englandi think children should be at least 11 because if theyre younger then they might not understand what to do laura 10 rochdale englandi think you should be at least the age of seven before you are allowed to be left alone tom 6 london englandim happy to be left in the house by myself my mum doesnt leave me for any more than 15 minutes but id be happy to stay by myself for longer im not allowed to answer the door or the phone unless its my mum or dad phoning that way no one else knows im by myself and they cant try to get in to the house cameron 10 scotlandpersonally i think its parents who should decide if kids under 16 are allowed to stay home alone if theyre mature enough then it should be ok but if theres younger family to watch like under 10s then someone at least 16 should stay with them olivia 14 hartlepool englandwhen i was 11 if there was no other option my mum would leave me to look after my little brothers for a couple of minutes but now my brother is 11 and she never leaves him in charge when we both pop out for a couple of minutes i think it all depends on how mature the child is making it the parents own judgment charlotte 13 cambridge englandparents should be allowed to choose what age because they know us best  no one else sian 12 avon englandi think if your mum and dad trust you to walk to the shops on your own then you should be allowed to stay home alone lydia 13 essex englandi think that as soon as you can care for yourself eg get food i think you should be able to be left on your own for a short while james 13 london englandi think you should be 12 or over your parents should trust you and let you stay home alone obviously with basic house rules such as dont open the door to strangers and keep the house tidy etc alfie 13 englandi think 13 years is old enough sumaia 12 london englandi think that you should be at least 10 to stay at home but not for a long time and only if you are sensible but if not then you need to wait until you are until you should be able to stay at home without an adult sarah 10 englandi think you should be a teenager to be able to be left at home by yourself also if there are little kids in the house they should be kept with someone older than 15 at least erume 12 london englandi stayed at home when i was in year 4 and i was fine my dad and mum look after me well but they wanted me to look after myself alisa 12 lancaster englandyou should be allowed to stay at home but have your neighbours on watch in case something happens charlotte 9 cambridgeshire englandpeople should get the chance to grow up on their own instead of their parents trying to protect them too much i think about 11 years old would be okay for the first time megan 11 nottinghamshire england12 some children under that age could get worried if you have an older brother or sister who is 16 and over they should be able to look after younger children william 11 solihull englandi think you should let the parents decide but if a law does come in it should be 12 because i stay on my own rebecca 12 leeds englandpersonally and not to be stereotypical i think it depends on the area if you live in a lowcrime area then it should be about 12 and then in higher crime areas around 14 however i do think the parents should be the judge of how responsible the child actually is lizzie 12 englandi think you must be over at least 15 to be left at home alone mary 8 birmingham englandi dont think its to do with age so much  more to do with maturity and how much you can trust them alex 13 englandthis is a tricky question to answer because it all depends on different factors in the situation such as long your parents will be out for whether you have any siblings and so on i think when you start secondary school you are beginning to mature however i dont mean this to be sexist or anything but it is a known fact that girls mature earlier than boys so you also have to be aware of that lydia 13 enfield englandmy brother is 13 and he stays at home so i think 13 year olds at home alone is fine but anybody younger than 13 staying at home is not safe brad 9 rotherham englandi stay at home for a couple of hours after school without an adult with just my twin and its always fine i stay at home with my twin  i dont think my parents would let my stay at home by myself in the holidays though carla 13 newcastle englandwhen my mum goes out shopping she takes my 11yearold sister with her but she always asks me if i want to go i refuse all the time food shopping is boring i think it depends on whether the child is responsible or not there are some strange people who throw parties while there parents are away but it all ends up in a terrible mess  they are clearly irresponsible no matter how old they are i think you should be at least 12 and have no access to dangerous things eg fireworks stacey 13 kent englandprobably when youre 12 or 13 im never allowed home alone at the moment laura 10 englandi think it depends on how sensible you are or whether you have any siblings you might get into a fight with but im 13 and my parents can leave me alone if they go for an evening out because they know they can trust me lilly 13 london englandi think you should be 15 or over to stay at home for a whole day and 12 for a few hours jenny 10 rhyl walesi dont think that it would be right to put an age limit on leaving kids at home it all depends on the maturity of he kid and how much the adult trusts them jason 12 englandits not a question of their age but their maturity and responsibility if you have a sixyearold whos more mature than a 15yearold then let the sixyearold stay home alone i agree that you should be a teen if youre to be left at home overnight however not if its during the day for a short period of time adam 13 burnley englandi think it depends on the length of time the parents are away and where they are going i get left on my own but only when my mum is in the village emily 12 fife scotlandive been left in the house on my own since i was 10 and its because im mature enough to be trusted it all depends on the individual child in question rebecca 12 leicester englandwell im 11 and i stayed at home when i was 10 and i was perfectly fine it depends on the environment you live in and if you can be trusted it also depends on how long your parents are away for emma 11 hertfordshire englandi was 10 when i was first home alone and i was fine i didnt answer the phone if i didnt know the number and i dont answer the door if i go out or have just got in from school i ring my mum to say i am ok it settles her mind zoe 14 essex englandwell this is what i think children between 11 and 12 are only allowed alone for an hour 13 for three hours 14 for 6 hrs 15 for half a day 16 and over for all day once 17 longer than half a month lily 10 london englandi am 11 and i sometimes stay home on my own it is only for five to 10 minutes though adam 11 solihull englandi am eight and i stay at home on my own and have my own door key i think it is fine for me to stay at home because i am good matilda 8 bristol englandi think you should be 14 to stay at home by yourself because at that age you would probably be walking to school by yourself lorraine 11 surrey englandi think it depends on lots of things you might leave a 9yearold home alone if they had an older sibling or you might not leave a 16yearold home alone in case they had a wild party it depends on so much but really when youre in secondary school or if youre a mature year 6 it should be okclare 14 englandim 13 and asked my mum and she said i couldnt stay home alone she said i had to be another year older so i say 14 years old paris 13 crewe englandwell im 13 and my parents only ever leave me if they are just quickly going somewhere but never for over an hour also they bring the mobile so if anything happens i just call i think parents shouldnt leave their children for more than two or three hours if they are under 14 amy 13 francei think you should be 12 to stay at home for over an hour but i think you should be 15 to be able to stay on your own if your parents are out in the nighttime rosie 13 london englandi was left alone practically every day in the past two years and i survived just fine i think its perfectly all right to be left alone at home if youre at least 10 years old julie 13 edinburgh scotlandyour parents should get to say not the government michael 10 hull englandstaying alone all depends on who the person is and what the person staying alone is going to do if the adult decides that the child can stay on hisher own it is then the childs choice because they might be scared sophia 11 cambridge englandi think you should be 11 because i started going out alone then so why not stay at home alone then molly 13 london englandi think that if anyone wants to stay at home they should be at least 12 and prove that they are mature enough to stay at home alone and then maybe their parents will trust them in future to babysit or something kate 11 sheffield englandi would just say you should be in secondary school or with someone in secondary samantha 13 dorset englandyou should be able to be alone at home at the age of 13 because otherwise if you are younger then you might be scared that your parents arent going to come home if you are older then you will understand maria 10 worcester englandi think it depends on too much to make a clear law stating an exact age you get some nine year olds who are quite mature and happy enough to stay at home however you get some fifteen year olds who would tear a house apart if left alone it also depends on how long the parent is away what sort of house they live in who their neighbours are etc molly 12 london englandi think that kids should stay at home on their own at the age of 12 or over if its under they might get hurt and noone will be in the house so noone will know but if your parents trust you you should be allowed tiffany 12 manchester englandi think there shouldnt be a limit as long as the kid feels safe home alone as one of my friends hardly ever gets left at home and so in that way she isnt as responsible as other kids that get left alone more frequently louise 12 woking englandi think you should be 16 or over its the best age to look after yourself molly 9 belfast northern irelandi think that kids at the age of 10 or 11 who live in a small town maybe could be left home alone but if they live in a big city then maybe at 12 to 13 emily 12 inverness scotlandi think it is alright to leave a kid alone for a few hours when theyre 12 if the parents want to go somewhere overnight they should be 15 grace 12 gloucester englandi think you should be at least 10 to stay home alone rebecca 10 west sussex englandsensible children over 10 years old should be able to be left on their own for a maximum of 2 hours jamie 11 london englandi think that it should be any age over 10 if their parents trust them rebecca 10 near fife scotlandi think you should be over 13 amy 13 cowes englandi think that it is really up to you and your parents as they will be able to decide judge how sensible and mature you are i think that the child should definitely be comfortable with being left alone though as it is not fair on them to have to sit at home worrying and be scared about being alone cara 12 glasgow scotlandi stay at home on my own and i am 11 in a month i only stay for under half an hour emily 10 bristol englandi think that over 12s should be left at home but i think they should go to like a selfdefence class before so if anyone breaks in they know what to do chloe 12 torquay englandi think the least age you should be left on your own is around 13 beth 14 preston englandme and my sister are left at home quite a lot she is 14 but we are left at home because our mum can trust us and if anyone breaks in we have a rottweiler jacqueline 12 staffordshire englandwell i think 11 is old enough but you should have like another brother or sister with you josie 12 thailandit doesnt depend on their age it depends if the parent trusts the child or not ive been left on my own since about 10 and ive always been fine millie 13 wolverhampton englandi think it should be when you start secondary because thats when you start feeling older and you should be treated older and it will be a great opportunity ellie 12 salisbury englandi think you should be about 12 but if its for a long time like a day or more maybe about 14 because at that age you are able to do things for yourself anna 14 canterbury englandi think you should be 14 as you have been a teenager and should be responsible danielle 13 ramsgate englandi think children who are 12 should be allowed to stay home alone that is the most common age for most things tara 11 glasgow scotlandi think it should be when both the child and parent feel comfortable about it within reason eg when they are five is unacceptable emma 14 kent englandi think it really depends how mature you are if you are 10 but very mature you can be allowed to stay at home by yourself you could be 14 but immature and you should have an adult with you jahanara 10 london englandyou should be 12 unless youre a sensible 11yearold like me ben 11 stocktonontees englandi think the age children can stay home alone should be 10 or 11 because you should be sensible at that age and know what to do if theres a problem if not then adults should just find a sensible adult to babysit chloe 10 london englandi think it depends on how long youre on your own for but i think you should be at least 11 tasia 9 nottingham englandi think you should be 14 because then youre smart enough to know exactly what to do if something happens hannah 10 paisley scotlandi think that you should be at least 14 to stay at home alone charlotte 9 north yorkshire englandi think that 12 is the right age for kids to be left alone mature 11 year olds could be left for a bit i suppose but 12 is the right age for kids to be trusted hannah 12 york englandi think you should at least be a teenager isabelle 11 greater london englandi think you should be allowed to stay on your own at home at the age of 13 because you are a teen and old enough to look after yourself charley 13 birmingham englandi think children should definitely not stay at home by themselves michael 11 wandsworth englandits really just common sense i dont think it depends entirely on the childs age the parents should know how mature their child is and if theyd be comfortable at home alone a 12yearold could be more mature than a 15yearold peter 12 lisburn northern irelandi think it depends on how responsible or irresponsible a child is to know when theyre ready to stay home alone samira 10 london englandi think you should be left home alone when you are 16 years old i think that is a sensible age a younger age would be too dangerous to be left home alone jimmy 10 london englandi think children at the age of 12 and over should be able to stay at home but maybe not at night because it would be more dangerous at night then day danii 12 northolt englandi think that teenagers should be allowed to stay home alone but if its only 10 minutes i think 11 and 12 years olds can stay alone victoria 11 bristol englandi think if your parents are just leaving you for up to about half an hour to an hour then its fine from about 10 or 11 ish but if its a long time i think 13 rebekah 12 isle of wighti think that you should be at least 12 or over to be left at home alone if your parent are just nipping to the shops if they are leaving you there for the whole day you should be at least 14 the older you are the better chloe 11 lancaster englandi think you should be 13 to stay at home by yourself because thats when you become a real teenager daniel 9 reading englandkids should be at least 12 or over to be able to stay home alone but the problem is that it really depends on how long the child is alone for and how responsible they are holly 13 london england past stories row over leaving kids home alone most popular storiescat survives after getting arrow in its head
