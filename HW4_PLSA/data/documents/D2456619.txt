examples of elasticity tejvan pettinger may 4 2016 alevel economics price elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness of demand to a change in price see price elasticity of demand price inelastic – a change in price causes a smaller  change in demand price elastic – a change in price causes a bigger  change in demand examples of price inelastic demand we say a good is price inelastic when an increase in price causes a smaller  fall in demand eg if price of petrol rises 40 but demand for petrol only falls 10 the ped  – 025petrol – petrol has few alternatives because people with a car need to buy petrol for many driving is a necessity there are weak substitutes such as train walking and the bus but generally if the price of petrol goes up demand proves very inelastic salt if the price of salt increased demand would largely be unchanged it is only a small  of income and people tend to buy infrequently it is a good with no real substitutes at all a good produced by a monopoly any good produced by a monopoly is likely to be inelastic demand for example if sky increases the cost of premiership pay per view many football fans will pay the extra price though because it isn’t a necessity demand may be less inelastic than say petrol tap water for householders tap water is a necessity with no alternatives if the water company increase the cost of water bills people would keep buying the service it would have to rise to a very high price before people disconnected their water supply this is why tap water is regulated by the government diamonds bought very infrequently diamonds are the ultimate luxury with few exact alternatives you could buy other precious gems but others may not have the same allure as diamonds a cut in price wouldn’t increase demand very much peak rail tickets for commuters who rely on the train to get to work in london demand will be very inelastic if the price of fares from surbiton to london increase demand will only fall by a small amount the alternatives for commuting into london such as driving are limited cigarettes if cigarette tax increases and the price of all tobacco increases demand will be inelastic because many smokers are addicted and don’t have any alternatives to keep buying apple i phones i pads the apple brand is so strong that many consumers will pay a premium for apple products if the price rises for apple i phone many will continue to buy if it was a less wellknown brand like dell computers you would expect demand to be price elastic examples of price elastic demand we say a good is price elastic when an increase in prices causes a bigger  fall in demand eg if price rises 20 and demand falls 50 the ped  25examples include heinz soup these days there are many alternatives to heinz soup if price rises people will switch to less expensive varieties shell petrol we say that petrol is overall inelastic but if an individual petrol station increases the price people will buy from other petrol stations the only exception is if a petrol station has a local monopoly – eg at the service station on the motorway there is a captive audience but in a city centre with many alternatives people will have an elastic demand tesco bread tesco bread will be highly price elastic because there are many better alternatives if the price of tesco bread rises consumers will switch to alternatives such as kingsmill daily express if the daily express increases in price there are similar newspapers people will switch to for example the daily mail or daily mirror if it was a newspaper like the financial times of the economist demand would be more inelastic as there is no close substitute to the financial times kit kat chocolate bar if kit kats increase people will switch to alternative types of chocolate bar porsche sports car if a porsche increases in price demand will probably be elastic because it is a high  of income and so the higher price will put people off also there are other alternatives such as jaguar or aston martin however this is a little less clear cut some car enthusiasts may want to buy a porsche whatever the price income elasticity of demand income elasticity of demand measures how demand responds to a change in income if income goes up 10 and you spend 20 more on foreign holidays the yed  20 luxury goodsif income goes up 10 and you spend 5 less on tesco value baked beans the yed  05 inferior goodexamples of income elastic luxury goodsincome elastic – means a change in income causes a bigger  change in demand eg porsche sports car as income increases people can spend a higher  of their income on the car organic bread if income increases people may switch to the ‘luxury’ option of organic bread homemade soup if income increases people will buy the more expensive fresh soup rather than cheaper tins which aren’t as nice‘premium unleaded’ more expensive petrol which is supposed to be better for your engine most people stick with cheapest examples of income inelastic goods fruit if incomes increase people may buy more bananas but many already eat as much as they want but those on lower incomes may feel they can now afford to buy fresh bananas examples of inferior goods an inferior good has a negative income elasticity of demand when incomes increase demand falls tesco value baked beans if your income increases you stop buying tesco value beans and switch to heinz which are better quality instant coffee instant coffee is cheap if income goes up you may buy takeaway or switch to filter coffee milk powder a cheap way to drink milk elasticity of supply elasticity of supply measures the responsiveness of supply to a change in price inelastic supply inelastic supply means an increase in price causes a smaller  change in supply it means firms have difficulty increasing supply in response to a rise in price potatoes in the short term if the price of potatoes goes up farmers cannot increase supply because it depends how many seeds they put in the ground in march nuclear power it would take considerable time to increase the supply of nuclear power because you need skilled labour and it would take a long time to build elastic supply elastic supply means an increase in price causes a bigger  change in supply it means firms can easily increase supply in response to a change in price firms operating below full capacity if a car factory is operating at 70 capacity then it can easily increase supply and produce more cars in response to changes in price related different types of goods – normal luxury and inferior income
