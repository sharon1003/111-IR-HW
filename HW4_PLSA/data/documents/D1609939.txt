propagating roses from cuttingsby dr malcolm m manners once youve taken cuttings of old roses from a cemetery old house or vacant lot whats the next step most roses are easily propagated by rooting cuttings here are some tips for success age  make sure you take cuttings from firm but young stems on a repeatflowering variety that would be stems on which the flowers are fading or from which the petals have just fallen on a onceflowering plant you can use stems from which the flowers are fading in the spring or similarage wood from subsequent growth flushes throughout the summer or fall leaves  roses root best if the cutting has some leaves still attached to provide sugars from photosynthesis as well as rootpromoting hormones some varieties will root from leafless cuttings but its better to allow two or three leaves to remain keep a spray bottle of water handy to mist over the cuttings while working on them to keep them crisp since wilted cuttings often fail to root cuts and wounding  roses can form roots at any point along the stem so the exact site of the cut is not important many people wound the base of the cutting either by making 12 to 1inch vertical slits through the bark or by slicing a strip of bark off one or two sides of the base of the cutting with the clipper blade difficult varieties often benefit from such wounding sending out roots all along the wound rooting hormones  you can root most rose varieties without the use of hormone preparations this is because rose cuttings contain auxin indoleacetic acid  iaa a natural rootpromoting hormone it is produced by the leaves and growing buds or shoot tips and accumulates at the bottom of a cutting where the roots will form but some roses apparently dont produce adequate supplies of auxin and are difficult to root if they produce any roots at all they are few and weak so many growers apply a commercial hormone preparation to stimulate the production of strong roots these products all contain synthetic auxin usually indolebutyric acid iba andor naphthaleneacetic acid naa moisture  one of the most important factors in successfully rooting cuttings is maintaining adequate moisture both in the soil and in the form of humidity in the air place the cuttings in pots of moist sand or potting soil then cover them with a plastic bag mayonnaise jar or inverted twoliter soft drink bottle with the top cut off creating a small tent or greenhouse to maintain high humidity around the cuttings light  roses root best in bright light but when using the minigreenhouse method its important to avoid overheating by giving some shade from hot midday sun put the cuttings in bright shade such as against the north wall of a building or under a tree to allow rooting without too much heat buildup season  most cuttings root best in the spring or early summer when the weather is warm but not miserably hot you can root cuttings at other times of the year but it may take longer and a smaller percentage of them may take a few types such as the gallicas may root more successfully in the autumn timing  in may or early june some varieties will have good roots in as little as two weeks nearly any variety can be rooted in three to four weeks at that time of year at other times the process takes longer  up to seven or eight weeks there are several ways to tell whether a cutting is rooted you can tug lightly on it and if it resists being pulled out of the pot it likely has roots also roots growing out the drainage holes in the bottom of the pot are a sure indication of success cuttings that are actively growing new leaves usually have roots whereas unrooted cuttings tend not to produce much new top growth once the cuttings are rooted and have been removed from the rooting area harden them off for a few days by putting the pots in a cool shady area moving them immediately into hot sunshine may damage or even kill the plants once they have a good large root system and are putting out new growth they can be moved into brighter light dr malcolm manners is professor of citrus and environmental horticulture at florida southern college where he manages a collection of more than 400 rose varieties and teaches courses in plant propagation he is secretary and a trustee of the heritage rose foundation reproduced by permissionback
