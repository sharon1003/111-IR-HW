politics black vote seen as last hope for democrats to hold senate by sheryl gay stolberg oct 18 2014228the democratic leader of the georgia house stacey abrams second from left denounced as “voter suppression” the failure to process 40000 new applications john locherassociated press washington — the confidential memo from a former pollster for president obama contained a blunt warning for democrats written this month with an eye toward election day it predicted “crushing democratic losses across the country” if the party did not do more to get black voters to the polls“africanamerican surge voters came out in force in 2008 and 2012 but they are not well positioned to do so again in 2014” cornell belcher the pollster wrote in the memo dated oct 1 “in fact over half aren’t even sure when the midterm elections are taking place”mr belcher’s assessment points to an urgent imperative for democrats to keep republicans from taking control of the senate as many are predicting they need black voters in at least four key states yet the one politician guaranteed to generate enthusiasm among african americans is the same man many democratic candidates want to avoid mr obama now democrats are deploying other prominent black elected officials and other surrogates buttressed by sophisticated voter targeting efforts to stoke black turnout at the white house the president is waging an undertheradar campaign recording video advertisements radio interviews and telephone calls specifically targeting his loyal africanamerican base“anybody who looks at the data realizes that if the black vote and the brown vote doesn’t turn out we can’t win it’s just that simple” said representative marcia l fudge of ohio the chairwoman of the congressional black caucus referring to africanamerican and latino voters “if we don’t turn out we cannot hold the senate”related coverage in this election obama’s party benches him oct 7 2014recent comments sboctober 19 2014it is almost humorous to think about republican outreach to black voters in georgia the current voter suppression efforts have been fairly mark stone october 19 2014the black demographic is not monolithic alas being of the conservative persuasion my black neighbors and i feel hopelessly in despair steve the commoner october 19 2014so may americans such as rosa parks and martin luther king suffered for all americans to have the right to vote and yet today so few see all comments africanamericans could help swing elections in georgia louisiana north carolina and possibly arkansas a new york times analysis of voter data shows but only if they turn out at higherthanforecast rates they will also be important in kentucky where alison lundergan grimes the democratic senate candidate refuses to say if she voted for president obama — a stance that black leaders including ms fudge fear will depress turnout document a democratic pollster’s memo on africanamerican voters republicans who are expanding outreach to africanamericans in states like north carolina and georgia have their own aggressive getoutthevote effort mindful of the success of the obama campaign which turned out voters in record numbers black voters made history in 2012 exit polling and census data show when they turned out at a rate higher than whites to help reelect mr obama but fewer voters go to polls in midterm elections in 2010 a disastrous year for democrats blacks voted at a rate lower than whites creating a “turnout gap”the numbers are significant although more than 11 million black georgians went to the polls in 2012 only about 741000 voted in 2010 in north carolina democrats say there are nearly one million black registered voters who did not vote in 2010 mr belcher declined to discuss for whom he had written the memo saying it was private but the document was circulated by the democratic national committee in the memo he also argued that the turnout gap more than any republican tea party wave was responsible for democrats’ 2010 defeats so the challenge for democrats is to get midterm voters to the polls at presidential electionyear rates“if you tell me in georgia that on the closing of the polls the electorate is 32 percent africanamerican i’m going to tell you we have probably elected a democratic senator” he said “that’s not theory it’s basic math”but it is in no way easy sasha issenberg whose 2012 book “the victory lab” explored the science of winning campaigns said increasing turnout “is doable” but it is very expensive and timeconsuming on average he said a welltrained volunteer must have 14 contacts with prospective voters to produce one new vote mr issenberg said his rough calculation showed that in georgia alone such an effort would cost 30 million a national effort he said would be “resourceintensive on a scale that we’ve never seen executed in a midterm election”representative marcia l fudge of ohio said black voter turnout was essential t j kirkpatrick for the new york times republicans are skeptical “what the democrats were able to pull off with africanamerican turnout in places like ohio in 2012 was truly amazing” said whit ayres a republican pollster “accomplishing the same goal without the africanamerican president on the ballot at the top of the ticket is a totally different endeavor”still democrats are trying the democratic senatorial campaign committee has poured 60 million this year into its bannock street project a datadriven effort to target potential voters then make sure they vote in north carolina where senator kay hagan a democrat is fighting to retain her seat party field operatives have deputized more than 150 “captains” — the owners of black barbershops hair salons and other small businesses — to help register

anytime in georgia where blacks make up 30 percent of registered voters democrats identified 600000 unregistered black voters the new georgia project an officially nonpartisan effort founded by the democratic leader of the state house stacey abrams has helped register about 120000 voters but the effort is under attack from the republican secretary of state who has not yet processed 40000 of the applications — a move ms abrams denounced as “voter suppression”in louisiana where senator mary l landrieu appears headed for a runoff in a threecandidate race democrats worked to enlist more than 600 black and religious leaders to help with voter registration on sunday ms fudge and her caucus members will visit black churches there beginning a bus tour of six senate battleground states they will promote early voting which begins in louisiana on tuesday on the campaign trail ms fudge said she can defend the president in a way ms landrieu and other democrats cannot “i look at it this way” she said “i have a better opportunity to convince a black voter to vote than they do”bigname surrogates are also stepping in former president bill clinton hugely popular with black voters is in arkansas this weekend with stops in his birthplace hope and the heavily africanamerican cities of pine bluff and west memphis he goes to baton rouge la on monday midterm elections 2014the latest news analysis and election results for the 2014 midterm campaign the lack of awareness that mr belcher’s memo noted also set off alarm at the white house a senior official speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss strategy said the white house was “concerned that some of the campaigns are not focused enough on the importance of turning out presidentialyear voters including africanamericans”mr obama is acutely aware of his kinship with black voters this official said and eager to help democrats however he can last week he taped interviews with three black radio hosts — steve harvey yolanda adams and rickey smiley — and he sounded like a pitchman for voting“i’ll bet there are a whole bunch of folks listening to your show who may not even know that there’s an election going on” the president told mr smiley “i need everybody to go vote the election’s on nov 4 you can go to a website iwillvotecom to find out what your polling place is”but sophisticated targeting church visits highprofile surrogates and even direct appeals by the president may go only so far some democrats said when candidates are running away from a politician black voters adore ms grimes is but one example in louisiana ms landrieu ran an ad calling the president’s policies “simply wrong when it comes to oil and gas production” in georgia michelle nunn the democratic senate nominee has refused to say if she would have voted for the affordable care act — mr obama’s signature domestic initiative on the campaign trail black leaders like representative elijah e cummings democrat of maryland are offering a very different message they embrace the health care law — “i will never run away from the affordable care act” mr cummings said — and often invoke voting rights and the death of michael brown the unarmed black man shot by a white police officer in ferguson mo as a way to mobilize black voters and they defend the president“people understand that you have to walk a thin line” mr cummings said describing democratic candidates’ dilemma “but africanamericans do not want you denying any affiliation with the president because they love this president he is like a son to them”correction october
