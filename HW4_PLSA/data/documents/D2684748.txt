states thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura ttp is a clinical syndrome characterized by low blood platelet counts anemia and kidney failure doctors may refer to adult hus as ttp due to similar clinical features how are e coli infections caused e coli food poisoning is most often associated with eating undercooked contaminated ground beef since e coli can be found in the intestines of healthy cattle meat can become contaminated during slaughter the bacteria are then thoroughly mixed into the beef while it is being ground and processed other sources of infection include the consumption of nonpasteurized milk and juice sprouts leafy greens such as lettuce and spinach and salami swimming in sewagecontaminated lakes and pools or drinking inadequately chlorinated water persontoperson contact in families childcare centers and nursing homes is also an important mode of transmission bacteria in the stools of infected individuals can be passed from one person to another if hygiene or handwashing habits are inadequate how is ecoli infection diagnosed and treated according to the cdc infection with e coli o157 h7 is diagnosed by detecting the bacterium in the stool most laboratories

develops bloody diarrhea should have a stool sample tested for e coli o157 h7 the cdc also reports that individuals who have diarrhea as their only symptom usually recover completely most people recover without antibiotics or other specific treatment in 510 days there is no evidence that antibiotics improve the course of disease and it is thought that treatment with some antibiotics may precipitate kidney complications antidiarrheal agents such as loperamide imodium should also be avoided hemolytic uremic syndrome hus a lifethreatening complication of ecoli o157 h7 is usually treated in an intensive care setting blood transfusions and kidney dialysis are often required are there complications with e coli infections individuals who have diarrhea as their only symptom usually

such as high blood pressure seizures blindness paralysis and the effects of having part of their bowel removed with intensive care the death rate for hus is 35 how can e coli infections be prevented consumers can prevent e coli infection by thoroughly cooking ground beef avoiding nonpasteurized milk and juices and washing hands with soap and water because the organism lives in the intestines of healthy cattle preventive measures on cattle farms and during meat processing must be taken to avoid contamination the following precautions can help prevent e coli infection cook all ground beef and hamburger thoroughly use a digital instantread meat thermometer to ensure that the thickest part of the meat reads at least 160º f people who cook ground beef without using a thermometer can decrease their risk of illness by not eating hamburgers that are still pink in the middle however using a meat thermometer is still your best protection against e coli infection if you are served an undercooked hamburger or other ground beef product in a restaurant send it back for further cooking you may want to ask for a new bun and a clean plate too keep raw meat separate from readytoeat foods keep fruits and vegetables separate from raw meat when grocery shopping wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly especially those that will not be cooked wash hands counters and utensils with soap and hot water after contact with raw meat never place cooked hamburgers or ground beef on the unwashed plate that held the raw patties wash meat thermometers in between tests of patties that require further cooking drink only pasteurized milk juice or cider children under 5 years of age immunocompromised individuals and the elderly should avoid eating alfalfa sprouts drink municipal water that has been treated with chlorine or other effective disinfectants avoid swallowing lake or pool water while swimming make sure that people with diarrhea especially children wash their hands carefully
