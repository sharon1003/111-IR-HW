resistance of a resistor resistance of a resistor the function of a resistor is to oppose the electric current through it this is called electrical resistance and is measured in the unit ohm the resistance can be calculated with ohms law when the current is known and the voltage drop is measured the resistance of a resistor is dependent on its material and shape some materials have a higher resistivity causing a higher value the value is often printed on the resistor with a number or in the form of a color code what is resistance the concept of current voltage and resistance can be explained by a hydraulic analogy a flow of water through a pipe is restricted by a constriction this causes a pressure drop after the constriction the flow of water is equivalent to electric current the pressure drop is equal to the voltage drop the constriction is equivalent to the resistor and has a certain resistance the resistance is proportional to the voltage or pressure drop for a given current in the hydraulic example the resistance can be increased by for example reducing the diameter of the constriction for a resistor or wire the resistance is in general dependent on the material and the geometrical shape the influence of the geometrical shape can easily be explained by using the hydraulic example a long and narrow tube will have a higher resistance than a short and wide tube resistance of a rectangular crosssection resistor with crosssectional area a and length l the resistance property of a material is called resistivity the electrical resistance of a resistor is proportional to the resistivity of the material for a rectangular crosssection resistor the resistance r is given bywhere ρ is the resistivity of the resistor material w·m l is the length of the resistor along direction of current flow m and a is the crosssectional area perpendicular to current flow m2 resistivity is a property of materials for many materials the resistivity is constant and v and i are directly proportional to each other materials that meet this characteristic are called ohmic materials good resistor materials have resistivity’s between 2·108 and 200·108 w·m resistance in series the equivalent resistance of resistors in series is equal to the sum of each resistor the current through each resistor in series is equal but the voltage is not for a more detailed explanation and practical examples refer to the article resistors in series sometimes the desired value is not available with standard preferred values instead to reach the value two resistors can be connected in series or parallel resistance in parallel the equivalent resistance of resistors in parallel can be calculated with the following formula the voltage across each resistor in parallel is equal but the current not for a more detailed explanation and practical examples refer to the article resistors in parallel how to find the resistance of a resistor the resistance of a resistor is either printed on the resistor body or marked with a color code the combination of colors indicated the value and tolerance of a resistor for a calculator or full explanation refer to resistor code like this page rate and share it
