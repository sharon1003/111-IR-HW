original network cbcpbs 2000original release july 23 – july 30 2000chronology preceded by anne of avonlea followed by anne of green gables a new beginning anne of green gables the continuing story was a 2000 miniseries television film and the third installment in a series of four films the film was highly anticipated among fans of anne of green gables it borrowed characters from the anne of green gables novels by lucy maud montgomery it served as a sequel to two miniseries produced by cbc television in the 1980s it was the most controversial and heavily criticized of the three film adaptations written and produced by kevin sullivan the continuing story was criticized principally because unlike the 1985 anne of green gables and its 1987 sequel anne of avonlea the screenplay was not based upon montgomerys works but instead used montgomerys characters in a largely original world war i story by sullivan and laurie pearson montgomery had written an anne novel set in that same period rilla of ingleside a story focusing on annes youngest daughter and in which anne was a mother whose three sons were fighting in europe the chronology of sullivans anne of green gables films is not in synch with the lm montgomery novels largely because of the spinoff series road to avonlea over the course of developing original characters and stories for seven seasons of road to avonlea the time frame of sullivans fictional world evolved into a 20year difference from the montgomery novels as a result sullivan decided to make anne of green gables the continuing story a completely original work that took anne and gilbert to the battlefields of world war i instead of their children as in montgomerys novels the film was also criticised for introducing a continuity problem following colleen dewhurst s death in 1991 marilla cuthberts death was written into the series road to avonlea at marillas funeral hetty king refers to gilbert and anne blythe stating they were married anne does not appear in the avonlea episode because she is sick with scarlet fever the continuing story which takes place five years later attempts to resolve the discontinuity by revealing that anne had scarlet fever while she was teaching at an orphanage in nova scotia megan follows reprised the role of anne shirley with jonathan crombie reprising his gilbert blythe role several other cast members from the first two

the road to avonlea television series and the previous two anne of green gables films into a time period when each character was faced with personal turmoil as a result of world war i sullivan’s portrayal of anne and gilbert in this third film does not coincide chronologically with montgomery’s novels rilla of ingleside portrays annes sons going off to fight in world war i while anne and husband gilbert witness the war from the homefront of prince edward island rilla the youngest daughter raises someone elses little boy for a few years he is referred to by the family as rillas warbaby and he was presumably the inspiration for dominic in anne of green gables the continuing story  while the continuing story was set in new york england france and germany it filmed almost entirely in studio or on locations in montreal and southern ontario including toronto sequel  editin fall 2008 another film in the series anne of green gables a new beginning was released showing anne as an older
