everyday money tourism here’s how much it would cost to travel to mars by rob wile may 8 2017it’s being billed as the largest event ever dedicated to human exploration to mars from may 9 to 11 leading scientists and engineers will gather in washington for the humans to mars summit among the headline speakers will be buzz aldrinwilliam h gerstenmaier associate administrator for the human exploration and operations directorate at nasa and pascal lee the director of the mars institute an international nonprofit research organization partially funded by nasa money spoke with lee about the challenges facing mars missions and why it’s important to launch mars exploration missions despite them at this point what would it cost to send someone to mars pascal lee the apollo lunar landing program cost 24 billion in 1960s dollars over 10 years that means nasa set aside 4 percent of u s gdp to do apollo to put things in perspective we also spent 24 billion per year at the defense department during the vietnam war so basically going to the moon with funding spread over 10 years cost the same to run the department of defense for one year in wartime now 50 years later today’s nasa budget is 19 billion a year that’s only 03 percent of gdp so that’s less than 10 times less than what it was in the 1960s meanwhile the department of defense gets 400 billion a year so the number i find believable and this is somewhat a matter of opinion a ballpark figure doing a human mission to mars “the government way” could not cost less than 400 billion and that was going to the moon this is going to mars so you multiply that by a factor of 2 or 3 in terms of complexity you’re talking about 1 trillion spread over the course of the next 25 years as far as sending an ‘average jane’ to mars you’re talking even further out in terms of years mars is an incredibly lethal environment there are several things that can kill you and result in a horrible death if you’re exposed unprotected so talking about kids growing up on mars it’s not nearly as soon as you’d hope or think we instead envision something like antarctica where you have maybe a handful of people there at a time performing research for a few decades there’s another group that wants to turn a mars mission into essentially a reality show and fund it through commercials that has other cost estimates but i find those unrealistic what is the biggest cost at this point pascal lee it’s not rocketry — the rocket is actually the easiest part thanks to the private sector they are able to cut corners take more risk do a quick and “not as clean” version when elon musk presented his vision last october in mexico no one questioned his ability to make something big the biggest cost is actually to develop all the new systems that would allow us to go to mars and be productive explorers there for example right now we have a beautiful space suit but it weighs 300 lbs on the moon where gravity is six times less than earth’s the space suit has a feltweight of 50 lbs so that was manageable but on mars the gravity is only about onethird of the earth’s so you have a space suit with a feltweight of 125 lbs that’s way too heavy so there’s a technical challenge to cut the mass of the space suit we currently have in half that’s easier said than done we’d also be looking for life and for that we’ll have to develop technology that can dig down beneath mars’ inhospitable surface to find ice or water and also develop the means of transporting ourselves to locations where that water exists you’re looking at far more complex exploration setup than apollo so what should be the primary motivation for going to mars pascal lee the reality of mars is unforgiving but that’s what makes it interesting and challenging and exciting it’s like president kennedy said we would go to mars not because it is easy but because it is hard the biggest benefit from the apollo program at the time was to show the soviet union that the western way of life was better and more capable the scientific benefit was learning about how the moon was formed and how earth might have evolved but the biggest benefit to society was the fact that the apollo program was a huge shot of steroids into stem science technology engineering mathematics education the number of grads in science fields and math in mid60s and early70s essentially doubled that became the foundation of the technological competitive edge we have today right now there’s an entire generation of kids in china enthralled by their space program as they work to send someone to the moon they’re going into stem fields and they are basically shaping up to be leaders in the next generation in stem sponsored financial contentyou may like stories from read moreadd this widget to your
