bring science home salty science is there iodine in your salt a thanksgiving day demonstration from science buddies by science buddies on november 21 2013whats in your salt  when you salt your food you may also be adding another important micronutrient test your salts to see if they contain this special ingredient credit george retseck key concepts nutrients diet food health chemical reactions introduction have you ever noticed if the salt youre using says its iodized iodine is a micronutrient which means we need it in small quantities to be healthy because iodine is relatively rare in many peoples normal diets its added to table salt then when people salt their food such as tasty turkey stuffing and mashed potatoes theyre also getting iodine in this science activity youll use some kitchenfriendly chemistry to investigate which types of salt have iodine and which dont then when you sit down to your thanksgiving dinner you can know whether to also give thanks that youre helping combat iodine deficiency background micronutrients such as iodine are types of nutrients that people need in small amounts iodine is important for a persons thyroid to function normally the thyroid is a gland in the neck that makes key hormones it is found in small amounts in other foods including saltwater fish seaweed shellfish yogurt milk eggs cheese and a handful of other edibles if a person doesnt consume enough iodine they can become iodine deficient the lack of this micronutrient can cause different medical problems usually due to hypothyroidism caused by a thyroid that does not make enough hormones these conditions include goiter a visible swelling of the thyroid as well as serious birth defects in fact iodine deficiency is the most common preventable cause of mental retardation iodine in the form of iodide is added to table salt to help prevent iodine deficiency since the 1980s there have been efforts to have universal salt iodization this has been an affordable and effective way to combat iodine deficiency around the world but not all salt contains iodine however youll investigate whether different salts have iodine by mixing them with laundry starch which forms a bluepurple–colored chemical with iodine vinegar and hydrogen peroxide are added to the salt solution to help this chemical reaction take place materials • disposable plastic cups that are 10 ounces in size or larger alternatively you could use smaller cups and scale down the activity • distilled water • measuring cups • measuring spoons • laundry starch solution also called liquid starch alternatively you could make a suitable starch solution by dissolving one cup of starchbased biodegradable packing peanuts in two cups of water • iodine antiseptic solution optional use either an iodine tincture or povidoneiodine solution found in the first aid section of grocery stores and drugstores if the iodine doesnt come with a dropper youll also need a medicine dropper • disposable plastic spoons • at least three different types of salt to test—for example plain noniodized table salt iodized table salt pickling salt rock salt kosher salt lite salt and sea salt if you arent using the iodine antiseptic solution include iodized table salt • 3 percent hydrogen peroxide • white vinegar preparation • if you are using an iodine antiseptic solution you can prepare a positive control cup so you know what the reaction between iodine and starch should look like to do this pour one half cup of distilled water into a disposable cup add one half teaspoon tsp of laundry starch solution and then add five drops of the iodine antiseptic solution be careful when handling the iodine because it can stain • stir well with a disposable plastic spoon what happens to the liquid when the iodine is added procedure • pick one of the types of salt you want to test and measure out four tablespoons tbsp into a clean plastic disposable cup add one cup of distilled water to the salt and stir well for about a minute with a clean disposable plastic spoon you do not need all of the salt to dissolve • then add one tbsp of white vinegar one tbsp of hydrogen peroxide and one half tsp of starch solution what do you think the purpose of the starch is • stir the salt solution well with the disposable plastic spoon and then let the solution stand for a few minutes what happens to the solution after you stir it does it become a bluepurple color • repeat this process using the other different types of salt you want to test for each type be sure to use a different clean disposable cup and spoon do any of the other salt solutions become a bluepurple color • based on your results which salts do you think contain iodine in the form of iodide and which do not do your results agree with the labeling on the salt packages which often say whether the salt contains iodide or not • extra try this activity with even more different types of salts for some ideas see the materials list above which types of salt contain iodine and which do not do your results agree with their labeling • extra in this activity you added vinegar because it is an acid and helps the chemical reaction take place try testing the iodized salt solution again but this time leave out the vinegar does the reaction still take place turning the solution a bluepurple color if the reaction occurred did it take a longer amount of time to happen • extra temperature often affects chemical reactions you could try this activity again but test an iodized salt solution at different temperatures by heating or cooling the distilled water how does changing the temperature of the solution change how the colorchanging reaction takes place observations and results did the iodized table salt solution change to a bluepurple color when you mixed in the starch did the lite table salt similarly change color whereas most of the other salt types did not in this activity you should have seen that the iodized table salt and the lite table salt solutions both changed to a bluepurple color as did the iodine antiseptic solution if you used it this indicates that iodide is present in these types of salts you likely saw no color change for the solutions made using the noniodized salt rock salt kosher salt or sea salt because these varieties do not typically contain iodide the starch solution was used in this activity because it forms a bluepurple–colored chemical when combined with iodine because the solution’s original p h needs to be changed for this chemical reaction to effectively take place vinegar an acid is also added hydrogen peroxide is used to turn the salts iodide into iodine which the starch reacts with cleanup be sure to thoroughly wash any measuring spoons or other utensils that came into contact with the solutions made in this science activity you can dispose of the solutions by pouring them down the drain more to explore micronutrient information center iodine from the linus
