parallel circuits you should know the characteristics of the current and potential difference in parallel circuits current when two or more components are connected in parallel the total current flowing through the circuit is shared between the components check your understanding of this by answering the questions about the circuit seen here assume that both lamps are identical potential difference when two or more components are connected in parallel the potential difference across them is the same this means that if a voltage across a lamp is 12v the voltage across another lamp connected in parallel is also 12v check your understanding of the voltages across components connected in parallel using this activity now try a test bite
