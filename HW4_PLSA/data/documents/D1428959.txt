cs chris szerenos asked on may 13 2013q incredible battery drain during connected standby on a clovertrail windows 8 tablet im experiencing infuriating battery drain during connected standby on a windows 8 tablet samsung smart pc 500t i bought it 25 months ago the problem has been on for over a month after some big os updates from ms ive tried to diagnose it any way i can but this it it thank you not interested in this all connected standby thing dont want to be a guinea pig anymore i just want to disable it so  how to disable connected standby dont tell me its a part of windows experience bla bla the experience is half baked so far to put it very diplomatically i want to shut connected standby down completely  and use good old normal windows 7style sleep is there a service registry key anything i can do to disable connected standby on connected standby ive got battery drain with airplane mode no user apps open anything that can be shutdown  shutted down most metro apps deleted just 4 left metro ie10 windows store music photos scamera no nfc no bluetooth no usb accesories no keyboard dock all task scheduler stuff not only not allowed to wake the computer but disabled at all no auto syncing anything in widndows 8 not syncing tiles user account stuff no push mail in outlook 2013 no auto updates to os anything except for samsung own supdate service  its fine its been long before and it didnt cause problems no anytvirus windows defender disabled nothing interesting in the event viewer with anything powerrelated filtered from the system logs i mean man what the  how to find this something that drains my battery ive been looking at cpu cycles task manager and process explorer and its not conclusive the most cycles is os stuff some hardware interrupts and dmcs but not nearly enough to cause such drain im suspecting wifi drivers a little bit some weird logs ive seen in the even viewer but im going into connected standby on airplane mode wifi off i even checked i disabled the wifi driver in the device manager and still battery drain on the connected standby yes im all over updated id even say updated too much from ms this been working fine before some powercfg batteryreport s in the links below yup played with powercfg waketimers device manager power and wake settings powercfg devicequery wakearmed all turned off nothing here from a loong time and powercfg requests clean on these pictures from powercfg batteryreport the columns are datetype of activitylasted for how longbattery drain in battery drain in m wh suggesting you have a look at the last one

battery juice went for ive got problem with the windows home button it gets triggered in my bag accidentaly when i carry the tablet around but its a separate problem how to disable this windows home button the connected standby battery drain is a different thing much worse so question 1 how to disable this crappy connected standby thing that drains my battery and drives me nuts question 2 if its not possible to disable directly how to go around that i dont need a button to do this telling what to do with windows registry is good enough question 3 if connected standby cannot be disabled in any way  how to diagnose which appprocess uses cpu cycles battery juice ive been all over process explorer and event viewer but maybe you know something i dont know and please spare me suggestions of clean boot when i revert to normal state ill have a ton of bloatware i dont need running with the os there is a reason why a little bit techsavvy people use such things as servicesmsc debloating nope i didnt touch the system services yes i know it can cause a ton of problems its not this i dont need a clean boot i need a way which device in the device manager uses so much power what driver what app what service what process what thread where its located in the filesystem at which times its been active how much cycles on the cpu it got since then and if ms doesnt already have such app in windows there should be one cause power issues on the clovertrail windows 8 tablets are  plague for instance  this is exactly the problem a review of similar win 8 tablet with the same connected standby issue here  httpwwwumpcportalcom201302connectedstandbybatterylifeproblemwhen even bloggers and tech reviews write about it you know theres something in it but i guess stupid finger painting apps like freshpaint are more important as a selling point reply i have the same question 14be benjamin e372 replied on october 3 2014a in reply to sin tungs post on september 25 2014just to let you all know that i have found the registry key to turn off connected standby so you can all stop raging and take a sigh of relief go to hkeylocalmachinesystemcurrent control setcontrolpower there is a dword called cs enabled which you should find set to 1 and changing it to 0 will turn connected standby off i have a surface pro 3 and can confirm that since making the change my battery life has dramatically improved also on the battery meter previously it just showed the percentage remaining but now it shows the time remaining eg 8hrs 30 mins as well the only disadvantage of doing this is when i close the type cover and reopen it the surface logo normally blue windows logo appears and performs the old style wake up from sleep obviously this should not be a problem for any of you though although as most laptops normally do this previously when i opened the cover the screen would come back on and i would be back at my desktop or metro app whatever was last open just as before  similar to pressing the lock button on and off on an i pad tablet or phone i hope that this helps everyone all out please like and mark as solution if this fixes your problem  dreply did this solve your problem yes no cs chris szerenos replied on november 27 2013a in reply to bemymonkeys post on november 6 2013i would suggest you update the bios theres been two recent releases of bios from samsung for ativ 500t1c the first wrecked my battery meter and didnt fix connected standby battery drain the other fixed the battery metter and the drain after a year from the release of the device finally and it was crappy bios drivers all along reply did this solve your problem yes no
