melanie haikencaringcom  lets be honest a diagnosis of parkinsons disease can be pretty unnerving in fact an april 2011 survey by the national parkinsons foundation revealed that people will avoid visiting the doctor to discuss parkinsons even when experiencing worrisome symptoms such as a tremor the problem however is that waiting prevents you from beginning treatment that  although it cant cure parkinsons  can buy you time we now have medications with the potential to slow progression of the disease and you want to get those on board as soon as possible says illinois neurologist michael rezak m d who directs the american parkinsons disease association national young onset center parkinsons disease pd occurs when nerve cells in the brain that produce the neurotransmitter dopamine begin to die off when early signs go unnoticed people dont discover they have parkinsons until the disease has progressed by the time you experience the main symptoms of parkinsons such as tremor and stiffness youve already lost 40 to 50 percent of your dopamineproducing neurons starting medication early allows you to preserve the greatest possible number of them rezak explains here 10 oftenmissed signs that can help you identify and get early treatment for parkinsons loss of sense of smell this is one of the oddest leastknown and often earliest signs of parkinsons disease but it almost always goes unrecognized until later patients say they were at a party and everyone was remarking on how strong a womans perfume was and they couldnt smell it says rezak along with loss of smell may come loss of taste because the two senses overlap so much patients notice that their favorite foods dont taste right rezak says dopamine is a chemical messenger that carries signals between the brain and muscles and nerves throughout the body as dopamineproducing cells die off the sense of smell becomes impaired and messages such as odor cues dont get through some researchers consider this change so revealing that theyre working to develop a screening test for smell function trouble sleeping neurologists stay on the alert for a sleep condition known as rapid eyemovement behavior disorder rbd in which people essentially act out their dreams during rem sleep the deepest stage of sleep people with rbd may shout kick or grind their teeth they may even attack their bed partners as many as 40 percent of people who have rbd eventually develop parkinsons rezak says often as much as ten years later making this a warning sign worth taking seriously two other sleep problems commonly associated with parkinsons are restless leg syndrome a tingling or prickling sensation in the legs and the feeling that you have to move them and sleep apnea the sudden momentary halt of breathing during sleep not all patients with these conditions have parkinsons of course but a significant number of parkinsons patients  up to 40 percent in the case of sleep apnea  have these conditions so they can provide a tipoff to be alert for other signs and symptoms constipation and other bowel and bladder problems one of the most common early signs of parkinsons  and most overlooked since there are many possible causes  is constipation and gas this results because parkinsons can affect the autonomic nervous system which regulates the activity of smooth muscles such as those that work the bowels and bladder both bowel and bladder can become less sensitive and efficient slowing down the entire digestive process one way to recognize the difference between ordinary constipation and constipation caused by parkinsons is that the latter is often accompanied by a feeling of fullness even after eating very little and it can last over a long period of time when the urinary tract is affected some people have trouble urinating while others begin having episodes of incontinence the medications used to treat parkinsons are effective for this and other symptoms lack of facial expression loss of dopamine can affect the facial muscles making them stiff and slow and resulting in a characteristic lack of expression some people refer to it as stone face or poker face says neurologist pam santamaria a parkinsons expert at the nebraska medical center in omaha but its really more like a flattening  the face isnt expressing the emotions the persons feeling the term parkinsons mask is used to describe the extreme form of this condition but that doesnt come until later as an early symptom the changes are subtle its easiest to recognize by a slowness to smile or frown or staring off into the distance santamaria says another sign is less frequent blinking persistent neck pain this sign is particularly common in women who have reported it as the third mostcommon warning sign they noticed after tremor and stiffness in surveys about how they first became aware of the disease parkinsonsrelated neck pain differs from common neck pain mainly in that it persists unlike a pulled muscle or cramp which should go away after a day or two in some people this symptom shows up less as pain and more as numbness and tingling or it might feel like an achiness or discomfort that reaches down the shoulder and arm and leads to frequent attempts to stretch the neck slow cramped handwriting one of the symptoms of parkinsons known as bradykinesia is the slowing down and loss of spontaneous and routine movement handwriting is one of the most common places bradykinesia shows up writing begins to become slower and more labored and it often looks smaller and tighter than before sometimes a family member will notice that someones handwriting is becoming very spidery and hard to read santamaria says washing and dressing are other areas where bradykinesia appears someone may take a long time to get dressed or be unable to deal with zippers and other fasteners changes in voice and speech as the brain signals and muscles that control speech are affected by parkinsons a persons voice begins to change often becoming much softer and more monotone this is frequently one of the first early signs of parkinsons that family and friends notice often long before the patient becomes aware of it slurring words is also characteristic of parkinsons because as the facial muscles stiffen it becomes harder to enunciate clearly some patients begin to have trouble opening their mouths as wide making speech harder to hear and understand says rezak this subtle sign is so characteristic of parkinsons that researchers are working on a voice analysis technique that might eventually be used as an early screening and diagnostic tool arm doesnt swing freely reduced arm swing is how doctors describe this symptom but that doesnt fully capture what some parkinsons patients first remember noticing instead think of this sign as a subtle stiffness and reduced range of motion reaching for a vase on the highest shelf or stretching out to return a serve in tennis and noticing the arm wont extend as far with the onset of parkinsons people begin to have what we call increased tone which means the muscles are stiffer and more limited says santamaria the arm just wont go where the brain tells it to go some people first notice this when walking as one arm swings less than the other one way to distinguish this symptom from arthritis or injury the joints are unaffected and theres no pain excessive sweating when parkinsons affects the autonomic nervous system it loses its ability to regulate the body which can cause to changes in the skin and sweat glands some people find themselves sweating uncontrollably when theres no apparent reason such as heat or anxiety for a woman these attacks may feel much like the hot flashes of menopause the official term for this symptom is hyperhidrosis this condition can also show up in the form of excessively oily skin or an oily scalp resulting in dandruff many parkinsons sufferers also notice a problem with excessive saliva but this is actually caused by difficulty swallowing rather than producing more saliva changes in mood and personality experts arent certain why but there are a variety of related personality changes that come with parkinsons including pronounced anxiety in new situations social withdrawal and depression several studies show that depression in someone who hadnt previously experienced it was the first sign many parkinsons patients and their families noticed but at the time they werent able to attribute it to parkinsons some people also experience subtle changes in their thinking abilities particularly in concentration and the socalled executive functions that govern planning and executing tasks the first sign of decline is loss of ability to multitask people who used to be able to do three or four things at once perfectly well find that they have to do one thing at a time or they cant keep it all straight rezak says some experts believe that thinking problems and mood issues go hand in hand  that the sense of slipping mentally leads to anxiety feeling overwhelmed and social withdrawal
