business day employees retirement plan is a victim as enron tumbles by richard a oppel jr nov 22 2001the rapid decline of the enron corporation has devastated its employees retirement plan which was heavy with company stock and has infuriated workers who were prohibited from changing their investments as the stock plunged through the 401 k retirement plan employees chose to put much of their savings in enron shares and the company made contributions in company stock as well but around the time enron disclosed serious financial problems last month the company froze the assets in the plan because of an administrative change for several weeks as the stock lost much of its value workers stood by helplessly as their retirement savings evaporated they were not allowed to switch investments at all  even though the plan had far less risky choices the unfortunate timing caps a year of pain for enrons workers at the end of last year the 401 k plan had 21 billion in assets more than half was invested in enron an energy conglomerate since then the stock has lost 94 percent of its value at portland general electric the oregon utility acquired by enron four years ago some workers nearing retirement have lost hundreds of thousands of dollars the utility has lined up grief counselors to help them work through their problems we had some married couples who both worked who lost as much as 800000 or 900000 said steve lacey an emergencyrepair dispatcher for portland general it pretty much wiped out every employees savings plan shortly after it was frozen the articles started coming out about some of the questionable activities of enron mr lacey added the stock took a tremendous drop and we were pretty much helpless the loss serves as a grim reminder of the danger of relying too heavily on one investment stock plunges similar to enrons have also wiped out the retirement savings of many employees of the nortel networks corporation lucent technologies inc and global crossing ltd the loss by enrons workers also stands in stark contrast to the profits made by some senior enron executives who sold stock during the last few years enrons chairman kenneth l lay made 207 million during the first seven months of 2001 by exercising stock options  and more than 180 million by exercising options during the three prior years last week mr lay agreed to forgo a 60 million severance package after enron traders and employees made clear how upset they were that he would profit from the proposed acquisition of the company by dynegy inc while they were suffering enron  which is already the subject of a securities and exchange commission investigation of transactions among enron and partnerships headed by the companys former chief financial officer andrew s fastow and a number of shareholders suits  now has an additional legal problem on tuesday steve w berman a lawyer from seattle who represented states against the tobacco industry filed a lawsuit in federal district court in houston seeking classaction status on behalf of enron employees who lost money on the stock through their retirement plan the lawsuit says that enron schemed to pump up the price of the stock artificially and violated its fiduciary duty to its employees by failing to act in their best interests they were promoting enron as a retirement investment vehicle and matching employees contributions with enron stock when they knew the stock was overvalued and thats a breach of their fiduciary duties mr berman said in an interview yesterday whats more he said the assets were frozen on oct 17 with the stock at 3220 even though enron executives knew there would be imminent disclosures about the companys accounting practices they knew the worst news was about to come out but they froze the stock he said enron closed yesterday at 501 the company declined to comment on much of the allegations because of pending litigation a spokeswoman karen denne said that the change in plan

but employees also chose to put much of their own contributions into the stock lured by its stellar past performance the company says that 89 percent of the enron stock in the plan wound up there because employees chose it and 11 percent was the companys contribution a lot of people believed in the stock so it wasnt just the company match said an employee at enrons headquarters in downtown houston it was their own money too people are just shellshocked the stocks past performance had lured many workers last year as the stock soared total assets in the 401 k plan rose more than 35 percent about 57 percent of enrons 21000 employees participate in the 401 k plan the company generally matches employee contributions at 50 cents on the dollar up to 6 percent of their salary with enron stock which cannot be sold and put into another investment until the employee reaches age 50 but ms denne said workers otherwise have a range of options in which to invest their money gerry oconnor a senior consultant with the spectrem group a consulting firm based in chicago said it was not uncommon for companies to freeze assets when administrators were switched if you dont you can wind up with misallocated money wrong statements and all kinds of complicating factors he said but a heavy dose of assets in one company stock has been a concern to many specialists in retirement planning employees are taking a lot of risk but they dont think of it as such mr oconnor said they say you know i work for this company and were doing great in addition to the swoon in their 401 k plans enron employees have watched the value of their stock options wither enron gave a far larger percentage of employees options than most companies do but now with the fall in enron shares nearly all of those options are worthless enrons tumbling fortunes have come as a particular shock to some of its workers in oregon about 95 percent of the 2700 employees of portland general which enron recently agreed to sell to help it raise badly needed cash are invested in the 401 k plan said scott simms a spokesman the losses he added have hit everyone including officers all the way through to other staff its certainly not something in which certain employees have lost out and others havent he said it was the same plan for everyone in an interview with the oregonian in portland peggy y fowler portland generals chief executive said the asset freeze was an unfortunate coincidence the timing couldnt have been worse she said we refer to our retirement program as a threelegged stool  social security the company pension and the 401 k ms fowler said one of the legs has been cut off
