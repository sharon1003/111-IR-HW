popularly used by ceos and sales vps in charting the course of their organization yet they are also commonly misused and misinterpreted not just in the lexicon of businessspeak but also in daily use for all intents and purposes let’s begin by defining efficiency and effectiveness in general terms borrowing from dictionarycom effective adj – adequate to accomplish a purpose producing the intended or expected result efficient adj – performing or functioning in the best possible manner with the least waste of time and effort the difference between effectiveness and efficiency can be summed up shortly sweetly and succinctly – being effective is about doing the right things while being efficient is about doing things right learn how to measure the effectiveness and efficiency of your sales team »another way to illustrate efficiency vs effectiveness is with the 2×2 grid below by referring to this chart ceos and sales leaders can find an optimal balance between effectiveness and efficiency companies usually seek to increase and improve the efficiency of their operations and sales processes after all when working with limited resources they would prefer to maximize the use of each of these resources from budget and technology to time and sales reps however by pursuing efficiency at all costs irony intended some of these companies are missing a valuable chance to take a step back and look at their overall effectiveness from a big picture perspective the holy grail for every company is to always pursue the top right box – pursuing the right goals and being efficient by making use of technological advances not wasting time and having better alignment and collaboration of between employees many companies have their hearts in the right place – they know what goals they want to achieve but are inefficient in achieving those goals other companies are tightly run ships with all employees working together humming along and all singularly focused on the task at hand…but what if the task at hand is the wrong goal an example for a practical example consider the differences between activity effectiveness and activity efficiency among your sales reps every sales team has daily weekly monthly and quarterly goals that when achieved are representative of the effectiveness of their roles if your reps are tasked with making 70 calls each day and they easily hit their numbers they are effective at their jobs some might even go above and beyond and make 80 or 90 calls each day but what if those dials are producing few connects and even fewer deals that’s where activity efficiency ratios come in for a sales manager having reports that track how many calls lead to connects how many connects lead to demos and how many demos lead to deals can be an incredibly powerful indicator of which of your reps are not only effective at their jobs but efficient in performing them learn how to measure the effectiveness and efficiency of your sales team »and therein lies the rub – is it more important for your organization to pursue effectiveness or efficiency if you’re trying to grow aggressively and have resources to burn optimizing effectiveness might be the way to go however if a smaller company has very limited resources to work with they might be more interested in pursuing efficient operations in order to maximize their capabilities and not stretch themselves too thin finding the sweet spot between effectiveness and efficiency is truly that ultimate goal for all companies subscribe to insight squareds blog get insight squareds latest sales

have both efficiency and effectiveness it’s hard to be effective if you aren’t being efficient it’s hard to be efficient if you aren’t being effective because you waste your time on techniques that

think we are both efficient and effective but we also know there is always room for improvementlee t september 25 2014in my mind efficiency encompasses effectiveness…at least from the perspective of the objective at hand doing the wrong things the right way fails to meet the objective so how can efficiency be claimed lots of things can be effective that are not efficient but nothing can be truly efficient that isn’t also effectiveamardeep titung october 19 2014cannot we define the effectiveness as the act of thinking right as efficiency as implementing thing in right way charles january 31 2015effectiveness vs efficiency efficiency i believe is a sub task to become effective if you are set on effectiveness vs efficiency then i would say if your effective then your company should recognize that over efficiency effective should be priority with efficiency following close behind however you can’t leave efficiency out of anything either charles january 31 2015let me give you an example from this company that is automated it’s affective but yet not as efficient here’s the email i received below as you can see from the response from above my name is spelled correctly charles

if no why i am busy with this question in my assignment ben august 28 2017i believe efficiency is the skill of using the best procedures which have been tried and tested over time to increase one’s chances of getting the job done that means using the least amount of resources and generating the least amount of waste in doing so usually it means making the least amount of mistakes effectiveness though is getting the job done achieving the set goals that may happen but not at optimal cost it is still effectiveness but the primary goal of every person is to get what they want at the best price within the best timelines and the right specifications that is being both effective and efficient that’s why people visit a number of web markets to ascertain the best price for the best specs and the best delivery timelines before they place their ordersminecraft pixel art august 28 2017universe mc is a very diverse minecraft server our community brings a varity of gamemodes to fit each player we

what each people should start with first like how one gets the basics right before going more technical with all the shortcuts efficiency can only be deemed truly efficient when corners are not cut resulting in poor results hence effectiveness is important to derive a better efficiency i would say efficiency is improved as a gradual result from effectiveness and if people think they have to
