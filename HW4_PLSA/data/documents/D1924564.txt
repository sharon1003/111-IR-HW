about time i had a hollow leg i could drink everyone under the table and not get drunk my capacity was terrifying my mother says i didnt open my eyes for eight days after i was born but when i did the first thing i saw was an engagement ring i was hooked i dont pretend to be an ordinary housewife cannes may 2001 if not to make the world better what is money for on her weight fluctuations when youre fat the world is divided into two groups  people who bug you and people who leave you alone the funny thing is supporters and saboteurs exist in either camp success is a great deodorant it takes away all your past smells some of my best leading men have been dogs and horses i dont remember much about cleopatra 1963 there were a lot of other things going on one problem with people who have no vices is that theyre pretty sure to have some annoying virtues about montgomery clift the most gorgeous thing in the world and easily one of the best actors you find out who your real friends are when youre involved in a scandal on eddie fisher im not taking anything away from debbie  debbie reynolds because she never really had it 2005 acting is to me now artificial seeing people suffer is real it couldnt be more real some people dont like to look at it in the face because its painful but if nobody does then nothing gets done 2005 theres still so much more to do i cant sit back and be complacent and none of us should be i get around now in a wheelchair but i get around on michael jackson what is a genius what is a living legend what is a mega star michael jackson  thats all and when you think you know him he gives you more    i think he is one of the finest people to hit this planet and in my estimation he is the true king of pop rock and soul on john wayne his image had as much impact in the world as many of our presidents have had but duke was a great actor a great humanitarian but always himself to be a friend was a lifetime thing food is one of lifes great pleasures  i hate dietingi believe in mind over matter and doing anything you set your mind on i along with the critics have never taken myself very seriously on michael jackson he is part of my heart we would do anything for each other on michael wilding im afraid in those last few years i gave him a rather rough time sort of henpecked him and probably wasnt mature enough for him it wasnt that we had anything to fight over we just werent happy on john wayne he is as tough as an old nut and as soft as a yellow ribbon on clark gable he was the epitome of the movie star  so romantic such bearing such friendliness on montgomery clift monty was the most emotional actor i have ever worked with and it is contagious on marilyn monroe she seemed to have a kind of unconscious glow about her physical self that was innocent like a child when she posed nude it was gee i am kind of you know sort of dishy like she enjoyed it without being egotistical i will love michael jackson forever on michael jackson s death on the death of michael jackson i just dont believe that michael would want me to share my grief with millions of others how i feel is between us not a public event richard came on the set and sort of sidled over to me and said has anybody ever told you that youre a very pretty girl i thought oy gevalt the great lover the great wit the great welsh intellectual and he comes out with a corny line like that but then i noticed his hands were shaking as if he had saturday night palsy he had the worst hangover id ever seen and he was obviously terrified of me i just took pity on him i realized he really was human that was the beginning of our affair on her conversion to judaism it had absolutely nothing to do with my past marriage to mike todd or my upcoming marriage to eddie fisher both of whom were jewish it was something i had wanted to do for a long time i dont entirely approve of some of the things i have done or am or have been but im me god knows im me i have the emotions of a child in the body of a woman i was rushed into womanhood for the movies it caused me long moments of unhappiness and doubt the ups and downs the problems and stress along with all the happiness have given me optimism and hope because i am living proof of survival ive come through things that would have felled an ox that fills me with optimism not just for myself but for our particular species on michael jackson he is one of the most normal people i know i hate being called liz because it can sound like such a hiss on cleopatra 1963 they had cut out the heart the essence the motivations the very core and tacked on all those battle scenes it should have been about three large people but it lacked reality and passion i found it vulgar on butterfield 8 1960 for which she won an oscar a piece of shit straight sex gay sex bisexual sex use a condom whoever you are if someones dumb enough to offer me a million dollars to make a picture im certainly not dumb enough to turn it down to larry fortensky in 1990 when she was in the hospital battling bacterial pneumonia when this is over i will marry you you cant be with somebody for like eight years and have loved them and shared life with them and just have it disappear like turning off a faucet if i love somebody i love them always in 1972 i would give up everything i have i would live in a shackif i could give richard a baby in 1992 larry sees through the world of bullshit i live in hes very protective i have to be stronger and more appreciative of what i do have every breath you take today should be with
