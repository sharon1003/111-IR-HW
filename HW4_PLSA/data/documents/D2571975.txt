leisure25 common words that you’ve got wrong joseph hindy joe hindy is a writer editor you tuber and college student full bio everybody talks a lot it’s one of the most frequent things we as human beings do we need it to communicate people do it for entertainment just because we all do it all the time doesn’t mean we have perfected the craft here are a bunch of common words everyone uses but most use incorrectly1 irony what you think it means something that is funny what it really means contrary to what you are expecting this is a famous one because so many people get this wrong so often it’s also kind of hard to explain so we’ll use an example the titanic was boasted about as being 100 unsinkable and then in 1912 it was sunk anyway that is what is called cosmic irony when a starving vegetarian eats a pepperoni pizza that is what is called situational irony there are other kinds too such as dramatic irony and socratic irony believe it or not sarcasm is actually irony when you say something sarcastically your tone and your words mean two opposite things that is ironic irony can be funny but not everything funny is irony2 travesty what you think it means a tragedy or something unfortunate what it really means a mockery or parody this is another one that people have wrong fairly frequently you’ve heard people call 911 a travesty truth be told 911 was a tragedy a travesty is actually a mockery or a parody one might say that a weird al yankovic album is a travesty with how often this word is associated with tragedy we wouldn’t be shocked if that definition were eventually added as an acceptable meaning until then it doesn’t mean anything bad happened3 ultimate what you think it means the one the only the best what it really means the last item of a list some people do actually use this one properly you may see someone list off a bunch of things and hear them say “okay at the store we need eggs milk juice and ultimately butter” that is actually the proper use of ultimate there is no other context or added context it simply means the last one4 conversate what you think it means to have a conversation what it really means nothing conversate actually doesn’t exist and i’ll prove it to you go into a program that underlines words with red if they’re spelled wrong now type out conversate did you see the red line conversate was meant to be a mixture of conversation and converse and be used as a verb however converse is a verb and there really isn’t a need for a second verb to describe the same action5 peruse what you think it means to skim or browse what it really means to observe in depth when you peruse something you are actually taking a very close look at it when you’re at a record store remember those and you’re just running through a stack of records you are just browsing if you pick up a record and look at the artist track list and additional information on the back then your are perusing6 bemused what you think it means amused what it really means confused this is one of the many words on this list that will make you strongly dislike the english language despite looking all but identical to the word amused bemused doesn’t even come close to meaning the same thing if you are bemused then you are actually confused7 compelled what you think it means to do something voluntarily by choice what it really means to be forced or obligated to doing something this is one that people get wrong and it’s rather understandable the real definition is very close to the definition people generally use the difference is the motivation when people say compelled they think the person wants to perform the action in fact they are forced to do it regardless of their personal feelings here’s an example when you’re in court you are compelled to give honest testimony you may not want to but it doesn’t matter because you have to8 nauseous what you think it means to feel ill what it really means to cause feelings of illness this is another understandable mishap that a lot of people make if you actually feel sick then you are nauseated the object that made you feel ill is nauseous here’s how this works if you’re at an amusement park and you’re sitting next to a full trash can the fumes from the trash may make you feel ill that means the fumes from the trash can are nauseous because they are making you feel nauseated9 redundant what you think it means repetitive what it really means unnecessarily excessive this one is tough because you can use it wrong but unintentionally use it right when you repeat something a bunch of times it can become redundant but redundant expands far beyond just repeating things over and over a popular thing companies are doing now is firing people but instead of calling it “getting fired” they call it “eliminating redundancies” the premise being that the employee they’re firing is unnecessary and excessive and they are thus eliminating them in pretty much any scenario where there is simply too much of something it is redundant10 enormity what you think it means huge enormous what it really means profoundly immoral or evil don’t beat yourself up over this one because no one knows this one off the top of their head enormity sounds like enormous and as with many of our other examples here we expect words that sound alike to have similar meanings enormity simply means really evil an example of how to use it is the following “the enormity of the crimes committed by the nazis in world war ii” it doesn’t mean the enormous crimes it means the heinous crimes11 terrific what you think it means fantastic good what it really means horrific to inspire fear this is another one that we expect will be changed in the dictionary eventually because barely anyone uses the real meaning anymore when people say they feel terrific they mean to say they feel fantastic an example of something terrific is king kong you see a giant monster and it inspires fear we’re going to loop awesome in with this one too awesome simply means to inspire awe and people often use it to describe something really good12 effect what you may think it means to cause something to change what it really means an event that causes a change a lot of people staunchly defend the wrong definition of this and it’s understandable when action a causes a change in object b action a affected object b and object b has been affected effect is an event that causes a change in our prior example action a is in and of itself an effect because it affects things it’s admittedly confusing to explain but easy to remember if it’s a noun it’s an effect if it’s a verb it’s an affect13 disinterested what you think it means bored what it really means neutral a good way to remember this one is that there is a word that means bored and it’s uninterested if you’re uninterested you’re bored being disinterested is the longform equivalent of stating that you don’t care about something14 irregardless what you think it means without regard what it really means nothing like conversate above irregardless isn’t actually a word when people say irregardless they actually mean to say regardless regardless means without regard irregardless has been used so often that it actually is in the dictionary now and that’s kind of sad even though it is technically there there are a large number of people who don’t consider it a word you can save yourself a couple of keystrokes and a tongue lashing by just using regardless15 chronic what you think it means severe what it really means over the course of a long time this is definitely one that people ought to know better when you have severe pain it is just severe pain if you have chronic pain you have been in pain for a long long time chronic conditions and diseases are called chronic because they won’t go away and not because they’re overly severe16 ie what you think it means for example what it really means in other words this is one among a number of shortened words that confuse people here’s a quick guide on how to use them et cetera is etc example is ex or eg and in other words is ie when you use ie you’re essentially putting it there to let people know that you’re going to be stating the same information in different words here’s how it really works it’s june and i moved into my new apartment in april ie two months ago17 decimate what you think it means to destroy or annihilate what it really means to destroy ten percent this one is really goofy and one day this won’t be true for the time being decimate actually means removing only ten percent of something if you know a little bit about words it’s not difficult to figure out the prefix “dec” means ten however the traditional definition of this word is antiquated and it’ll probably be changed eventually until then it’s technically correct to use a word like exterminate or annihilate instead18 panacea what you think it means a cure what it really means a cure for a lot of things this one is easy to confuse because the explanation is virtually the same even if the definitions are vastly different a panacea is something that cures a lot of things all at once for instance penicillin is a panacea it cures a bunch of diseases the flu vaccine is not a panacea because it only protects against the flu19 fortuitous what you think it means lucky what it really means by chance there is a difference between luck and chance unfortunately people use the two interchangeably so much so that it’s difficult to explain the differences anymore lucky is an event that happens by chance that can be described as fortunate winning the lottery is lucky fortuitous means simply by chance for instance if you drop your basketball and it bounces into the road and gets hit by a car that’s a fortuitous instance it’s neutral so it can be good or bad things that happen by chance20 plethora what you think it means a lot of something what it really means more than is needed this is one i use incorrectly all the time in fact i almost used it a couple of times in this very article plethora simply means that there is more of something than is needed for instance you may think that 5000 people is a plethora of people however when you put them into a hockey arena that seats 13000 people it’s actually less than half capacity and therefore not a plethora if you had 13500 people in that same arena that would be a plethora of people21 total total means exactly what you think it means but total is used unnecessarily on a frequent basis when there is a total of 50 people who do something the total is 50 whether or not you use the word “total” or you might hear someone say that they were totally surprised surprise is not a conditional emotion you were either surprised or not the use of total didn’t add anything of value to the sentence in most cases the definition is correct but using the word is repetitive when put in context with the rest of the sentence22 literally what you think it means figuratively what it really means actually this is something that has come about relatively recently and my generation may have helped propagate this one literally means actually when something is literally true it is actually true if i haven’t seen my friend in literally five years then i actually haven’t seen them in five years people use literally along with hyperbole to show an emotion “i haven’t had chinese food in literally a million years” this is meant to denote that the person hasn’t had chinese food in a while the word those people actually want is figuratively they figuratively haven’t had chinese food in a million years they probably literally hadn’t had it in a few days or weeks23 can what you think it means what is permissible what it really means what is possible this is one you have to nip in the bud in childhood because it’s much harder to correct in adulthood when you can do something you have capacity within you to perform that action regardless of whether or not you actually do it i can bang my head into my desk but i absolutely will not do it when people use can incorrectly it is because they mean to use the word “may” when you ask someone if they can open the door you did not ask them to open the door you asked them if they were capable of opening the door if you wish for them to perform the task you should ask if they will open the door when you ask if you can have something you’re not asking someone to give it to you you’re asking if you have the capacity to own it if you need something ask if you may have it24 defective what you think it means that something is broken or missing pieces what it really means simply that it’s broken you’ll see this one a lot in amazon reviews people will say that their unit came defective because it was missing a screw or pieces in the box that’s actually incorrect what they mean to say is that their product is deficient it’s missing pieces it is not actually broken the machine may work perfectly fine once the missing pieces have been readded which means that it actually isn’t defective at all25 obsolete what you think it means old out of date what it really means not produced used or needed you’ll see this one in the tech industry a lot people in tech article comments will comment that a phone is obsolete when they really mean that it’s out of date the literal definition of obsolete is an item that it isn’t produced needed or used anymore an example of this is is the steam engine it’s largely inefficient compared to today’s combustion engine and even more inefficient than the emerging electric engines thus steam engines are not used produced or needed anymore yes they are also old and out of date but obsolete is kind of the next step after old and out of date wrap up the english language is a finicky one but it’s also ever changing words are updated and definitions change new words are added every year and some are retired very few people will ever master the entire language and the rest of us will just have to do the best we canreferences featured photo credit gtm mobile reviews via gtmmobilesreviewscom
