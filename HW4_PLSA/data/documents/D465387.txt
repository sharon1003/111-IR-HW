dr ozs guide to yoga i learned yoga as a young doctor just entering the clinic as we learned to stay up late into the evenings to care for critically ill patients i began to use the practice as a tool for centering myself to cope with the reality of patients doing poorly and the fatigue of an academically rigorous program at 3 am when my patient was bleeding internally and the next transplant was in the holding area of the o r positions like down dog freed my mind to meditate on my body and rejuvenate me for the next case it did not take long to figure out that a practice that benefits the healer might also work for the patient most of us never take a deep breath all day long the most fundamental practice in yoga is the deep belly breath through the nose the diaphragm is a large muscle located just below the lungs that ideally should pull down the lungs during inspiration this is why young children push their stomach out when sleeping or exercising adults need to do the same to properly exhale suck your belly button toward your spine to push the diaphragm up and empty all the air from your lungs this process also brings nitric oxide—not nitrous oxide—from the back of the nose into your lungs which dilates arteries to bring more oxygen into your body yoga helps clean blood of waste material through lymphatic stimulation and trains us to loosen muscles and joints that are ignored in our daytoday lives routines like sun salutation get the blood flowing as we warm up and free our body to experience the new stresses we will face the practice also gets us to handle the weight of our body more effectively which builds bone and muscle strength so we are more resilient to the frailty that afflicts many this is why power yoga practitioners have great bodies finally yoga gets us to focus our minds on remote parts of our body—like tight joints and muscles—as we gently but firmly deepen into our poses for people like me meditation proves difficult because our mind wonders but if we can concentrate on the tension in our hips as we empty our mind then we are well on the way so here is my routine it takes me 7 to 10 minutes every morning start your mornings with rejuvenationsubscribe to the live your best life newsletter get more stories like this delivered to your inbox please accept the oprahcom terms and conditions and privacy policy published 01012006
