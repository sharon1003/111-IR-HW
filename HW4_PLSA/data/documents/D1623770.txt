wifi wifi is a wireless networking technology that allows computers and other devices to communicate over a wireless signal it describes network components that are based on one of the 80211 standards developed by the ieee and adopted by the wifi alliance examples of wifi standards in chronological order include80211a80211b80211g80211n80211ac wifi is the standard way computers connect to wireless networks nearly all modern computers have builtin wifi chips that allows users to find and connect to wireless routers most mobile devices video game systems and other standalone devices also support wifi enabling them to connect to wireless networks as well when a device establishes a wifi connection with a router it can communicate with the router and other devices on the network however the router must be connected to the internet via a dsl or cable modem in order to provide internet access to connected devices therefore it is possible to have a wifi connection but no internet access since wifi is a wireless networking standard any device with a wifi certified wireless card should be recognized by any wifi certified access point and viceversa however wireless routers can be configured to only work with a specific 80211 standard which may prevent older equipment from communicating with the router for example an 80211n router can be configured to only work with 80211n devices if this option is chosen devices with 80211g wifi chips will not be able to connect to the router even though they are wifi certified note the name wifi is similar to hifi which is short for high fidelity however wifi is not short for wireless fidelity but is simply a name chosen by the wifi alliance updated march 11 2014
