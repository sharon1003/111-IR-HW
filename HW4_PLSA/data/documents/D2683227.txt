peoplelarger family please note that in your answer thanks1 following 11 answers answers relevance rating newest oldest best answer everytime i left a job to a new job many had a 30 to 90 day waiting period for the new employers coverage to be effective i have paid an average of 600 to 800 per month for both my husband and myself in one job as a single i believe it was around 400 to 500 but these amounts were from 5 to 12 years ago and most likely today with health insurance premiums skyrocketing would most likely be at least 200 to 500 more most people would be surprised how much their premium really costs my very 1st job back in 1988 the employer paid 100 for the employee and if you added family you had to pay a percentage of the cost to add in 1988 my employer was paying over 6000 per year for each employee and i thought that cant be right but now they state the average cost is around 12000 to 13000 per year and climbing upward most people have no clue what the true cost of insurance is until they leave the job and get the cobra package which shows how much you pay to continue the coverage most when going from 1 job to another will go naked and take the risk they dont get sick since most cant afford the premium and hope nothing happens pending the new employers insurance kicks inlucy · 9 years ago2 0 comment cobra insurance cost source shttpsshrinkima8hq pzawacki · 2 years ago0 0 comment its like any other insurance plan its base on the benefits as well as your age if youre young than cobra can be somewhat affordable if you are in mid or late in your career it can get really expensive if you are healthy you should get what is called a temporary health insurance policy its much cheaper and you can easily cancel once you get on a new employed plan heres another reason to get a temp policy if the cobra runs out and your health status changes you may not be able to get insurance going forward hope this helps source s get a quote at www the irahelp

answers lynn · 2 years ago0 2 comment usually i find it cheaper to go and get individual coverage through blue cross and blue shield it tends to be a lot cheaper my last policy was 125 a month versus a cobra of 600 a month for an individual this was about 2 years ago and blue cross and blue shield put me into one of their special side groups this is also with depression as an on going condition since all of this was under different policies of blue cross and blue shield there was no preexisting conditions i got lucky and my current employer also uses blue cross and blue shield so i have not triggered the preexisting condition clause in a long timeandy · 9 years ago0 2 comment compare quotes for free at  insureratesnow info re how much does cobra insurance coverage cost i know that it can
