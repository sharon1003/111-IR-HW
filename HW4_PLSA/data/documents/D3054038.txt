says coop review that way the days before your coop you can review everything you learned in that class by flipping to your tabs a lifesaver isnt it7 study on your own every day take practice tests practice problems go over them practice practice practice it really does help also time yourself when you do questions go through your tabs one by one8 keep your grades up many schools look at your

on the website of the school you want to attend and email or call the principal not helpful 0 helpful 1ask a question submit tips the reading on the coop there are about 5 passages in one section you have to read them and answer questions when dealing with these use good comprehension have a strong vocabulary and pay attention to wording i cannot stress that enough you should also know basic grammar because there are what is wrong with this sentence kind of questions here are things i recommend taking to the coop tissues a phone 2 pencils a school id your sheet that says what high schools you want to go to and your brain you can still take the coop if you go to a public school when i say tabs i mean postit durable index tabsthe coop is scored on a percentile so it doesnt matter if you got a 100 its a big competitions if there were 10100 people who got a 100 on the coop you would be in the top ten percent being in the top ten percent is also the 90th percentile if you get above a 90th percentile most schools will grant you a scholarship i strongly recommend you put down 3 choices what happens when you put only one and dont get in whats your backup plus you cant take the coop twice the coop has very similar format to the terranova the math on the coop it is does not have any complex algebraic equations heck its not even 8th grade math the coop has sequences patterns but sometimes more complex quantitative reason basically arithmetic and a math section its all easy 5th grade math but the only thing that could trick you is the wording of the problems because there are some weird word problemsthe coop is a large part but not all of what high schools look at if you want to attend a good private high school go to their open house  for a day angel for the day blue eagle for the day etc write a good essay for them put them first choice get good grades go to an interview these will all help your chances dont forget your sheet the one that has your high schools listed and information of your test site if you dont have it you cannot take the test warnings sign up for the coop before you take it dont bring a pen not every school gives breaks remember just do your best do not procrastinate studyingbringing food can be distracting dont freak out if you dont get into the school you wished for do not put one high school first on your application and another high school first on the coop it is confusing and hints your hesitance dont cheat youll get your test taken away also dont look like your cheating as in looking around or out the window dont talk after the test unless it the teacher says you are having a break edit related wiki hows how to prepare for the ssathow to study for exams how to get higher marks in exams how to calculate a test grade
