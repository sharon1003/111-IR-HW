interviewed by jean stein issue 12 spring 1956mr faulkner’s self portrait 1956 william faulkner was born in 1897 in new albany mississippi where his father was then working as a conductor on the railroad built by the novelist’s greatgrandfather colonel william falkner without the “u” author of the white rose of memphis soon the family moved to oxford thirtyfive miles away where young faulkner although he was a voracious reader failed to earn enough credits to be graduated from the local high school in 1918 he enlisted as a student flyer in the royal canadian air force he spent a little more than a year as a special student at the state university ole miss and later worked as postmaster at the university station until he was fired for reading on the job encouraged by sherwood anderson he wrote soldiers pay 1926 his first widely read book was sanctuary 1931 a sensational novel which he says that he wrote for money after his previous books—including mosquitoes 1927 sartoris 1929 the sound and the fury 1929 and as i lay dying 1930—had failed to earn enough royalties to support a family a steady succession of novels followed most of them related to what has come to be called the yoknapatawpha saga light in august 1932 pylon 1935 absalom absalom 1936 the unvanquished 1938 the wild palms 1939 the hamlet 1940 and go down moses and other stories 1941 since world war ii his principal works have been intruder in the dust 1948 a fable 1954 and the town 1957 his collected stories received the national book award in 1951 as did a fable in 1955 in 1949 faulkner was awarded the nobel prize for literature recently though shy and retiring faulkner has traveled widely lecturing for the united states information service this conversation took place in new york city early in 1956 interviewermr faulkner you were saying a while ago that you don’t like interviews william faulknerthe reason i don’t like interviews is that i seem to react violently to personal questions if the questions are about the work i try to answer them when they are about me i may answer or i may not but even if i do if the same question is asked tomorrow the answer may be different interviewerhow about yourself as a writer faulknerif i had not existed someone else would have written me hemingway dostoyevsky all of us proof of that is that there are about three candidates for the authorship of shakespeare’s plays but what is important is hamlet and a midsummer night’s dream not who wrote them but that somebody did the artist is of no importance only what he creates is important since there is nothing new to be said shakespeare balzac homer have all written about the same things and if they had lived one thousand or two thousand years longer the publishers wouldn’t have needed anyone since interviewerbut even if there seems nothing more to be said isn’t perhaps the individuality of the writer important faulknervery important to himself everybody else should be too busy with the work to care about the individuality interviewerand your contemporaries faulknerall of us failed to match our dream of perfection so i rate us on the basis of our splendid failure to do the impossible in my opinion if i could write all my work again i am convinced that i would do it better which is the healthiest condition for an artist that’s why he keeps on working trying again he believes each time that this time he will do it bring it off of course he won’t which is why this condition is healthy once he did it once he matched the work to the image the dream nothing would remain but to cut his throat jump off the other side of that pinnacle of perfection into suicide i’m a failed poet maybe every novelist wants to write poetry first finds he can’t and then tries the short story which is the most demanding form after poetry and failing at that only then does he take up novel writing intervieweris there any possible formula to follow in order to be a good novelist faulknerninetynine percent talent  ninetynine percent discipline  ninetynine percent work he must never be satisfied with what he does it never is as good as it can be done always dream and shoot higher than you know you can do don’t bother just to be better than your contemporaries or predecessors try to be better than yourself an artist is a creature driven by demons he don’t know why they choose him and he’s usually too busy to wonder why he is completely amoral in that he will rob borrow beg or steal from anybody and everybody to get the work done interviewerdo you mean the writer should be completely ruthless faulknerthe writer’s only responsibility is to his art he will be completely ruthless if he is a good one he has a dream it anguishes him so much he must get rid of it he has no peace until then everything goes by the board honor pride decency security happiness all to get the book written if a writer has to rob his mother he will not hesitate the “ode on a grecian urn” is worth any number of old ladies interviewerthen could the lack of security happiness honor be an important factor in the artist’s creativity faulknerno they are important only to his peace and contentment and art has no concern with peace and contentment interviewerthen what would be the best environment for a writer faulknerart is not concerned with environment either it doesn’t care where it is if you mean me the best job that was ever offered to me was to become a landlord in a brothel in my opinion it’s the perfect milieu for an artist to work in it gives him perfect economic freedom he’s free of fear and hunger he has a roof over his head and nothing whatever to do except keep a few simple accounts and to go once every month and pay off the local police the place is quiet during the morning hours which is the best time of the day to work there’s enough social life in the evening if he wishes to participate to keep him from being bored it gives him a certain standing in his society he has nothing to do because the madam keeps the books all the inmates of the house are females and would defer to him and call him “sir” all the bootleggers in the neighborhood would call him “sir” and he could call the police by their first names so the only environment the artist needs is whatever peace whatever solitude and whatever pleasure he can get at not too high a cost all the wrong environment will do is run his blood pressure up he will spend more time being frustrated or outraged my own experience has been that the tools i need for my trade are paper tobacco food and a little whiskey interviewerbourbon you mean faulknerno i ain’t that particular between scotch and nothing i’ll take scotch want to keep reading subscribe and save nearly 40 subscribe now already a
