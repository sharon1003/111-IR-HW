permanent lodging and 11 on household expenditures totals 27 of the average household’s income  thats just under the 30 level that experts and authorities decree burdensome for a typical family to put towards housing it’s worth noting that most mortgage lenders will allow a mortgage payment to be as high as 28 of a family’s income at this level a family’s total housing costs including utilities furnishings and other operational costs could be painful for awhile however it should become more manageable over time if income grows while the mortgage payment stays the same average transportation

the rest on food consumed when we’re out and about while food is of course a necessity for life it’s often considered a fungible category in a household budget after all a family could dine on spaghetti or rice and beans for pennies per meal or we could go out to a steakhouse and drop hundreds of dollars on dinner every night to gauge a basic minimum for food costs we can look at the expenditures of america’s poorest households who are presumably eating as cheaply as possible those earning less than 15000 per year still spend about 3500 annually on food they eat at home a little more often about twothirds of the time but have meals out the remaining third of the time other households those earning more than 70000 per year spend nearly 10000 on food and eat out 45 of the time
