fumeus binomial name sorex fumeus miller 1895smoky shrew range the smoky shrew  sorex fumeus is a mediumsized north american shrew found in eastern canada and the northeastern united states and extends further south along the appalachian mountains subspecies this species has two recognized subspecies 1sorex fumeus fumeus sorex fumeus umbrosus description the smoky shrew is active yearround it is dull grey in colour with lighter underparts and a long tail which is brown on top and yellowish underneath during winter its fur is grey its body is about 11 centimetres 43 in in length including a 4 centimetres 16 in long tail and it weighs about 5 grams 018 oz habitat and ecology this animal is found near streams in cool damp deciduous and mixed woods it makes extensive solitary burrows in the leaf litter on the forest floor or builds globular nests 10–15 centimetres 39–59 in of plant materials under rocks the smoky shrew rarely digs tunnels instead it uses tunnels created by moles or other shrews its diet consists mainly of beetles however other insects earthworms snails small rodents and other soil dwelling invertebrates it also consumes plant material and small vertebrates to supplement its diet predators include owls snakes foxes weasels and mustelids reproduction smoky shrews start mating in late march and females give birth to their first litters in april or may about 20 days after mating they mate again a soon as the first litter is born and they may have 2 more litters each about a month apart if the female lives long enough each litter has 2 to 8 pups usually 6 male smoky shrews dont take care of their offspring only the female does females make nests in leaf litter where they give birth the offspring are blind helpless and have no fur females nurse and protect their offspring for a short time less than 20 dayssocial behavior no information exists about the social organization of the smoky shrew some field biologists noting the abundance of the species in some areas and its absence in others have suggested the smoky shrew is colonial however their data remain inconclusive and may reflect a tendency for smoky shrews to achieve dense populations within pockets of suitable habitat instead on exhibiting a complex social structure smoky shrews are quite vocal although the form and function of the vocal repertoire are not well known individuals twitter while foraging and give highpitched grating noises when alarmed references wikimedia commons has media related to sorex fumeus wikispecies has information related to sorex fumeus1
