you’ve ever left speechless from a doctor’s office after being told you have allergies keep reading if you’ve ever spent hours on the throne not the good kind from something you’ve eaten keep reading if you’ve ever had a skin allergy test and had your back covered in big red itchy welts you know how frustrating it can be to realize your favorite foods are making your sick this post is for you now what food allergies and sensitivities are becoming an epidemic it is now estimated that 1 in 5 americans now have some sort of food allergy a recent study in the journal of allergy and clinical immunology found that er visits at children’s hospital boston for allergic reactions more than doubled from 2001 to 2006 what could be causing all these reactions well there are many theories from the infiltration of genetically modified foods to our obsession with antibacterial everything in an effort to sterilize our environment but everybody is in agreement on one thing up until about 50 years ago allergies were rare and now they are rampant inside our intestines where the digestion of our food primarily takes place are little organisms called good bacteria that helps us digest and absorb our food we want this good bacteria we need it many things can cause our intestinal flora to be thrown off balance stress illness a sterile environment prescription medication antibiotics and even eating a standard american diet sad including genetically modified foods gmos can reduce the number of healthy gut bacteria it’s probably safe to say that living in the time period we’re living in means our digestive system are a bit out of whack the wide variety of symptoms associated with food allergies or food sensitivities stomach issues gluten intolerance ibs or crohn’s disease gas or bloating cramps diarrhea constipation indigestion heartburn neurological issues headaches joint pain and stiffness fibromyalgia autism  click here to read some fascinating research on the gutautism connectionasperger’s syndrome add or adhddelayed speech or development immunological issues frequent colds and flus sinus and ear congestion seasonal allergies autoimmune disorders acne eczema psoriasis as crazy as it may seem that food allergies are causing all of this we must first understand how the body reacts when a food is interpreted as a foreign harmful substance what is happening why does my stomach hate me have you ever wondered how your body became allergic or sensitive to a food in the first place to understand how this happened you must first understand dysbiosis you might know it by its other name “leaky gut syndrome”to put it simply having this syndrome means that at some time your body’s intestinal flora and wall became compromised stress illness an overly sterile environment prescription medication antibiotics and genetically modified foods all reduce the good bacteria and break down the wall in our intestinal tract essentially you’ve developed a “leaky gut”a leaky gut is no bueno why because our food was not meant to be absorbed into our bloodstream until it has been broken down into the correct nutrients if a food particle like from that sandwich you ate gets absorbed into your bloodstream at the wrong time all hell breaks loose your body cannot recognize that food particle it’s viewed like a foreign substance and your immune system tags it as bad next time you eat that food your body raises up the red flag and attacks did you know that nexium and prevacid medications prescribed for stomach problems are the 2nd and 3rd most medications prescribed in 2012 yikes lots o’ people are getting their stomachs in knots it’s time to get off the drugs and heal that gutavoiding the culprit is not the cure there is a mistaken belief in modern medicine that if a person is allergic or sensitive to a food then that person must avoid that food until they are no longer allergic or you know forever the theory is based on the process of elimination the sad thing is simply avoiding that food will not magically make the body heal it may relieve your symptoms but the restriction will be awfully hard to live with but no worries today i’m going to give you 3 surprising ways to heal that gut of yours and get rid of those food allergiessensitivities1 eat homemade fermented foodsbeverages“in the normal scheme of things we’d never have to think twice about replenishing the bacteria that allow us to digest food but since we’re living with antibiotic drugs and chlorinated water and antibacterial soap and all these factors in our contemporary lives that i’d group together as a ‘war on bacteria’ if we fail to replenish good bacteria we won’t effectively get nutrients out of the food we’re eating”– sandor katz our ancestors were smarty pants they knew fermented foods were the key to a healthy gut and therefore a healthy body fermenting beverages and fermented foods have been dated as far back as 4000 bc the fermentation process kept food for longer times allowing cultures to sustain themselves through the winter bread cheese pickles yogurt – these were all fermented properly long before the industrialization of food when we stopped canning in the home and purchasing canned goods from the store we lost the art of lactofermentation our ancestors had jars of sauerkraut and lactofermented cucumber pickles stored in the cellar today the storebought versions do not carry beneficial bacteria to the same extent that they used to today especially in america due to lack of culturespecific foods we’re just not getting enough beneficial bacteria from these foods you’ve probably heard of probiotics before and have chuckled at the jamie lee curtis commercials promoting activia yogurt well miss jaime lee curtis is both right and wrong while yogurt with probiotics helps to improve your digestion store bought versions are not optimal your body needs two things prebiotics and probiotics without these foods your body cannot perform efficient digestion probiotics help colonize your gut with essential bacteria prebiotics help feed that good bacterium together they help you have a superhero system good sources of probiotics choose 2 or 3 to incorporate into your diet natural yeastsourdough bread raw aged cheese milk yogurt and milk kefir kombucha water kefir aka homemade soda pop fermented and cultured vegetables  recipes herefermented condiments probiotic supplements  i recommend the biokult brand  in addition to a homemade probiotic good sources of prebiotics choose 2 or 3 to incorporate into your diet jicama chicory endive and dandelion greens artichoke onions asparagus garlic wheat properly prepared2 eat gelatinous foods along with including homemade probiotic and prebiotic foods in your diet it’s equally important to include grass fed gelatin as well gelatin heals and seals the mucosal lining of the intestinal tract and aids in the assimilation of nutrients it’s also an easily digestible protein that works as an antiinflammatory as well gelatin is vital to heal a damaged gut there are a few ways you can incorporate gelatin into your diet like these you can obtain gelatin from homemade bone broth eating whole fat meats and using the drippings to make gravy grassfed gelatin powder can be perfect for adding to other foods the best powdered brands are made from grassfed animals i use the beef unflavored gelatin for use in puddings and other desserts it gels up nicely just like regular jello grassfed gelatin powder also comes in a hydrolysate formula this formula doesn’t congeal in liquid so it’s an easy way to take gelatin as a daily supplement3 sleepdid you know that our bodies can withstand years of poor nutrition but if we go more than 11 days without sleep we die it’s true people who have tried to set a world record longer than 11 days have actually died sleep deprivation is so damaging to the body that it is used as a form of torture isn’t it amazing how we spend so much time analyzing our diets yet we forget about the quality and quantity of our sleep you can’t torture your body during the night but expect it to perform miracles during the day how much sleep should you be getting experts agree that 89 hours of sleep is optimal the early to bed early to rise rule is especially important i love to stay up late but i can feel a huge difference in how i feel if i go to sleep at 10 pm and wake up by 7 am the benefits of maintaining a super digestive system leaky gut symptoms are resolved the body is able to digest sugars proteins minerals and fats with ease digestive issues like bloating gas diarrhea and constipation resolve themselves strong intestinal lining to help block out pathogens allergens and toxins strong immune system the gut overpowers growth of bad bacteria and certain microorganisms like yeast  candida  should i avoid my food sensitivitiesallergies while healing the answer to this question really depends on your body some people

january 4 2017 at 641 am hi danelle i am allergic to yeast and dairy products from the blood test suffers from chronic psoriasis and athritis too i just want to know if “healthy yeast” eg brewer yeast or natural yeast is also considered as food that i should be avoided too is there any difference between the yeast tested by the doctor on me and the healthy yeast as described in your article reply da nelle wolfordsays january 22 2017 at 638 pm hi annathat would probably best be answered by your doctorreply tiffanysays march 7 2017 at 409 pm i’m allergic to yeast also and have been wondering the

any thingsome time i feel bettter but later on these symptoms apears which made my life complicated……my question is that is it dust allergy or food allergy i think doctors unable to dignose it so please guide me and tell me about the treatments medication or home remedies which made my life comfortable…thanks reply da nelle wolfordsays october 2 2016 at 1017 am hi faisalit could be either unfortunately i would try to eat an allergen free diet to try to pinpoint which food is the culprit so sorry you’re going through thisreply deepasays march 8 2017 at 417 pm try naet energy treatment it can actually cure ige mediated allergies like you describe it is usually done by chiropractors and acupuncturists and can take several visits but it works i have tried a similar method at home by buying an ‘allergy kit’ with laser worked for mild to moderate allergies that were recent and not the longest severest allergy maybe it needed more treatment elimination diet to find out what you are allergic to is very tedious good luckreply sharmasays september 13 2016 at 435 pmyay i have broken a world record not slept for 3 straight weeks and still alive this was all part of stress as my son has huge eczema food allergy issues and he was so unwell i am constantly reading to find a cure that works from inside out and i found this current article has nailed it so i am exploring this horizon next thanks reply alonasays october 13 2016 at 853 pm my daughter has severe eczema as well things that have helped not totally eliminated but she doesn’t seem constantly tortured anymore are epsom salt baths find a plain one with no additives preferably an edible one – walmart sells one in a big bag in the vitamin section i also made magnesium oil recipe by wellness mama but basically it was chamomile tea with epsom salt and optional lavender oil – letting the epsom salt absorb into the tea it’s not actually oily the downside of this is it can sting if the skin is broke – which hers often was from scratching it also sucks if you spray it on while it’s cold you can try it on yourself first it’s good for us in general the other thing that helps is wiping her down with a warm soft wash cloth daily daily baths are too much but this gets possible environmental triggers off and applying shea moisture baby lotion also found at walmart – in the baby section this is the only lotion i’ve found useful and this alone got rid of my other daughter’s eczema my youngest just has it worse so the other steps are necessary right now i need to keep her skin covered to keep her from scratching it she’s 15mo or she’ll end up making it bleed all over her the cream from the doctor hardly touched it it made the swelling go down but she was still miserable about the itching despite being a happy baby in general but she doesn’t mess with it as bad as before i can change her diaper and clothes and even let her without clothes for a little bit without her digging it open and the eczema is almost gone it’s really just down to dry skin now not inflammation or scabs from scratching i’ve been adding some kefir to her milk and am making bone broth now to see if that helps my other two daughters also have food related issues so it’s a whole family thing we’re doing fortunately they’re always up for trying new things reply paulsays january 5 2017 at 234 am my daughter suffered with eczema we tried a gluten free diet for 3 weeks after which no eczema now cured and has a new lifestylemaysays july 31 2017 at 1019 am you can visit diche yawqs healing on facebook they have a juniper berry ointment that has completely cured my son’s eczema in 2 days it’s all natural and works for everything my son was 4months when he was diagnosed and we tried every cream there was prescribed and got over the counter ones we tried the baths and oils this is the only thing that worked completely and it’s safe for babies it’s great hope this helpsdeepasays march 8 2017 at 427 pm my son has severe food allergy and i can say that i have done fermented foods probiotic supplements without a dent what works is naet or similar energy techniques try naet energy treatment it is usually done by

everything as well as dairy do you recommend the same protocol reply da nelle wolfordsays september 10 2016 at 439 pm you might have to adjust a bit with your allergies but it will still helpreply sarahsays september 29 2017 at 135 pm can you have fermented vegetables with a yeast allergies probiotics i helene this would help but with yeast and dairy allergies it limited and confusing to what path to take towards healing bobbisays september 29 2017 at 810 pm hi sarah you are absolutely right about all this being confusing since vegetables become fermented because of bacteria not yeast then i would say yes you can have fermented vegetables these would provide some great probiotics now something like beer yeast breads and even kombucha wouldn’t be a good idea depending on your dairy allergy yogurts may or may not work for you i find most people with dairy intolerances do well with yogurt especially raw milk and goats milk if you have a true anaphylactic reaction to dairy then avoid it all together don’t do anything that causes you harm just remember if you choose to introduce foods do so slowly one at a time and in small quantities be very mindful of how they make you feel if they make you feel bad then stay away from them if you know you have a serious allergy to them avoid them or try them out in the presence of a medical professional that deals with allergies on a regular basis i hope this helps and you find a path to healing best wishes and be well bobbi da nelle’s assistantaliciasays october 15 2016 at 724 pm i had strong sensitivities to bakers and brewers

proteins and lactose now i can eat a little bit of cheese and yogurt without feeling sick but before it was just a matter of contamination it really helped me about fruit and vegetables i am quite

don’t get an upset stomach i get a full on allergic reaction that could be life threatening the mislabeling of food intolerances for allergies has lead me to have many allergic reactions at restaurants because people don’t understand the severity of food allergies please consider renaming your article to address food intolerances thank youreply emilie lucksays july 16 2015 at 441 pm hi christinei hope you don’t mind that i reply to your post food allergies manifest in many ways just like symptoms of intolerance vary i have a handful of food allergies that came on suddenly about 4 years ago some like you will cause hives and anaphylaxis in me soy — others like celiac or a wheat allergy or even dairysugar allergy show up as gi issues diarrhea nausea vomiting constipation gas etc… many people don’t realize they are having a food allergy reaction because they expect allergies to manifest “traditionally” in the form of hives anaphylaxis etc… but that’s not really the case most of the time when it comes to food another thing to keep in mind is that testing for celiac and allergies is not always 100– the reason for this is that in order for you to be celiac or allergic your body has to produce a certain level antibodies that would then give you the diagnosis of allergy however let’s say your just shy of of that line– so your body is having a significant reaction however you don’t technically get the diagnosis of allergy believe me i went the rounds for 2 years with my dr and ended up getting a food allergy panel food is not supposed to make you sick like flue sick that is not an intolerance and ultimately just did the elimination diet to figure the rest out i have the same diet as someone who is celiac even if technically i didn’t test positive for celiac i have the same reaction to the gluten grains as a celiac patient does before i was allergic i was intolerant that showed up as mood issues gas and skin eczema etc i ignored those symptoms and yay for me i eventually became allergic to these awesome foods wheat dairy chocolate coffee soy hope this helps emilie luck hhp rytreply sharon j mc connellsays april 8 2016 at 1036 am your article refers to curing non ig emediated food allergies or delayed onset it is my understanding that ig emediated food allergies or immediate onset can not be cured in this manner in other words if you have a food allergy that causes anaphylaxis then you cannot cure it anonymoussays july 8 2015 at 1029 am i’m really weird and mint helps me with allergies reply thomas nelsonsays june 6 2015 at 926 am homemade sauerkraut is so easy to make one head of cabbage green or red i like using red slice it thinly with a knife or mandolin or even a food processor 1 tablespoon of salt sprinkled over that in a big bowl let it sit a few hours or overnight pack it all into a quart size jar it might take some squishing but that whole head will fit let it sit for a few days covered with cheesecloth or the jar lid slightly open to let the gasses out i keep my jar in a bowl on top of the fridge the bowl catches any over runs which can happen after a week it goes in the fridge and it’s perfect i don’t like processed sauerkraut but when i found this recipe i was in love two ingredients and a little time to me that’s pure food reply dianasays january 31 2015 at 354 pm hi angela could you tell me what you think of the “leaky gut cure” and if it helped you thank you from what i understand reactions are worse when we have avoided the food for a while because the body has “stored up” it’s reaction instead of doling it out in little bits when you have eaten the food alot or something like that – it can gather up it’s forces for a stronger punch some practitioners use that to determine food intolerances they have you not eat some suspected foods for some time then reintroduce them one by one looking for that stronger reaction you will get – to see what foods you are intolerant to reply kaylasays

times worse than they used to be my question is was my reaction worse because i am still healing also how long will it take to completely heal reply da nelle wolfordsays november 9 2014 at 935 am hi angelahave you been trying to seal your gut with gelatinbased foods including bone broth reply kaylasays september 22 2014 at 828 pm so once i heal any leaky gut issues i will also be healed of my slight gluten intolerance reply da nelle wolfordsays october 5 2014 at 427 pm that’s the goalreply crazy dog trickssays july 24 2014 at 902 am have you ever thought about writing an ebook or guest authoring on other sites i have a blog based on the same subjects you discuss and would really like to have you share some storiesinformation i know my audience would value your work if you are even remotely interested feel free to send me an email feel free to visit my homepageat crazy dog tricks reply lorisays july 22 2014 at 1101 pm i enjoyed this and the information that i get from many blogs but there are 2 things that keep frustrating me with the majority of them first is you disclose information but do not make any mention that this is what has helped you and each person needs to seek from a professional you need to disclose that you are not a professional and that the things mentioned here may or may not be beneficial in all cases for healing or lessing allergies that has pretty much been pointed out but you and other bloggers who appear by your disclosure to receive compensation to help with their blogging in other words this is not a true expression just wanting to help people and either way if you put information out i feel that you should respond to peoples comments and questions especially the question even if it i’m not sure i commented on many of these truly out of my own experience people read this and other blogs looking for help and answers i know i have and still do and there is nothing more frustrating than commenting in a questioning way or asking it straight out these people are looking for you to respond and if you put this information out there you should be ready and willing to respond to any and all questions as long as you haven’t previously stated in an earlier comment if you can’t do this than you need to say so i realize we are all busy people that is one reason i don’t start a blog although many people have told me i should based on my personal experience and years of so called “wisdom”  but at this point i chose to just comment because i feel i would owe it to those that read my blog the time to respond to their needs and comments so from now on i will chose to share only blogs where i feel people will be responded to and if i chose it share those that i feel readers are not treated appropriately i will only post on goggle with the comment that although this appears to be good information to share that the blogger does not seem to care enough to respond to your comments or concerns and i’m going to appeal to everyone else i know to do the same i hope you take this to heart as a legitimate concern and not a personal attack as i see many doing to information posted and maybe as a well to stop people from attacking your and others information leaving people to wonder what they should try or not simple disclosures and advice as i saw on a couple of question referring them to other resources but when you refer people to these things i would recommend not telling them to get a book some people may not be financial able to buy them another frustration bloggers tend to offer you tidbits of information and then say basically for more information or whatever people would go broke buying all these so called things that people suggest and some do as they see you as experts not just someone regergerating information that you’ve picked up out on the web or books yourself and i know very well that this comment will most likely be deleted as so many confrontational remarks are freedom of speech is dead and censorship is alive and well on the internet when comment s like this are posted and it’s a shame that people can put information in print and then censor comments that are not to their liking even is they are not profane and really threatening to anyone except for the blogger and i am going to book mark this and check back to see what kind of person you are i would hope that at the very least if you delete this comment that you will reply to me in an email and at least tell me that you have read it and taken it in advisement and will share my concerns with other bloggers i have been silent all my life but i am learning that if you think and want things to change you need to stand up and say something if you really feel it is right please continue blogging good information but please keep my considerations in mind as i know others also have these same concerns as i feel i have been led to write this and if your the kind of person i believe you are you will know what i mean sorry if this comes out to strong but i get so frustrated reading comments where i have the same concerns and they go unanswered and maybe you don’t have the answers or they aren’t out there yet or you forgot to put them in people are just looking for answers to their concerns and questions and if you don’t know ok just say so and tell us a free place where you think we can find them and also offers the books for those who can and want to get them i’d love to have books instead of having to search the internet but this is all many of us have i am the only one in my circle of friends who is making all these changes and they are looking to me to help them as i and others are looking to you so again please excuse my harshness but in my life the only way people seem to respond is when i take a firm and sometimes harsh stance it should not be that way in life but that is the reality of it reply marina pintisays may 12 2014 at 845 am true allergies are an ige mediated response which can be life threatenning in your article as you mention allergies  are you really describing food intolerances or aversions  you should at least mention to people that if allergy is severe and there could be a risk of anaphylaxis then they should not attempt to consume the food they are allergic to but they could try healing their gut  only with the assistance and guidance of their allergist should they attempt to consume known allergic foods if it was that easy to cure why hasn’t the the medical profession researched into it just a message to keep those with anaphylaxis allergies safe reply mercedessays march 13 2014 at 1031 am thank u so much for all this important info i have my niece who suffers of major dairy egg and nut allergies would this cure it she’s had it since a baby and can’t tolerate them at all i appreciate your response reply da nelle wolfordsays march 17 2014 at 750 pm since every body is different i can’t say for sure anything would cure it but it’s definitely a good startreplyfarseekersays march 7 2014 at 1139 am i have a problem with your list of prebiotics why well after having my appendix removed i became violently ill whenever i ingested garlic even garlic salt i still do garlic and onions are in the same plant family and though i don’t react as badly to onions as to garlic they do cause severe gas since this also happened with my mother i would say that this runs in the family any thoughts on working around this as garlic and onions are the easiest and most well known to me reply da nelle wolfordsays march 17 2014 at 829 pm my dad actually has a problem digesting garlic as well i would suggest choosing another food from the prebiotic listreply shawnsays june 5 2014 at 1149 am garlic is a fodmap which you may have issues with replytusitiodevideojuegosblogcomsays february 22 2014 at 1156 am please continue placing such great knowledge i love this kind of issuesreply melody filonzcuksays january 20 2014 at 729 am my two year old son has multiple food allergies and although he seems to be growing out of them somewhat he does break out with exczema now and then i would love to get him past these allergies so i came across this site and noticed that one of the bullet points mentioned was speech delays… he has a 69 month delay i have wondered if there could be a connection between the food allergies and his delayed speech do you have any additional info on this subject thanksreplymubashirsays january 14 2014 at 757 am dear doctor i am having food allergy last 4 mounts how lone it will take to cure it will cure or not my docter told six month it will take  please advice  what food i will eat to maintain my self  reply da nelle wolfordsays january 14 2014 at 1103 pm well i’m not a doctor so all i can say is read up on leaky guy syndrome and try to implement some of the practices to healreply hennysays december 13 2013 at 714 am oh biotin is great for supporting good gut bacteria too apparently… i haven’t tried it though we may at some stage we have histamine intolerance issues so we simply can’t do lots of gelatin at the moment reply hennysays december 13 2013 at 712 am please also consider adding some methyl b12 start very very slowly and build up with this one as it will kick off your natural detoxing organs liver and kidneys and is fantastic for supporting your gut in getting a healthy bacterial balance i suffered constipation for years and have been using magnesium for relief which is great but the b12 seems to actually be a longerterm fix for me very excited to have discovered this my kids are both on very low doses too along with d3k2 and it seems to be helping them get a more healthy gut balance going too…all critical stuff for healing food allergies we started on super low dose of the b12 – it is powerful detoxer my son first had 400mcg and had a massive tantrum and weird behavior passed after an hour so we scaled right back to 40mcg and built up… he is just over 50 pounds…so start slow…it is wonderful stuff some people have the mthfr gene mutation and need to also take methylfolate to help them absorb the methyl b12 reply krissays december 12 2013 at 1113 pm i’ve been trying the primal blueprint trying to heal my digestion without going as far as the gaps diet one week in and still bloated came back to reread your post here and will order the gelatin i make bone broth but perhaps upping the amount will help reply lisa watsonsays december 11 2013 at 956 pm why would you put ibs and crohns together in the same bullet point i’m afraid that point alone made me skip the rest of this article replyhttphealthideasjimdocomsays december 6 2013 at 309 pm i am delighted that folks yet still take their moments to write meaningful articles reply krissays november 20 2013 at 248 pm a second question does that mean fermented jicama is both a pro and pre biotic reply cherisays november 19 2013 at 954 pm wow how i wish i could do what you’re suggesting i wish you’d address in here how to live with the side effects while doing all of this and how long they may last i keep having foods added to my allergen list and when i eat them my back seizes up and i’m miserable for days it affects everything from my mood my balance muscle cramps even eye twitches i just want to reset my gut flora but how long would i have to do this before i’d start feeling better reply lorisays july 22 2014 at 958 pmtake baby steps do one thing at a time that is what i have been doing when you and your body adjusts to that add another step it may take longer but at least it’s a start and the more you add the quicker you can add others at least that is what’s happening to me and i want to use my 10 year old granddaughter when her mom was raising her if she had strawberry anything she’d break out in a slight rash her mom took strawberries away well now that i’m in the unfortunate spot of being grandma “mom” and i’ve been slowly but surely getting her and her brothers off of unhealthy foods and their dad and eating mostly good healthy foods she eats strawberries all the time no problem at all as a matter of fact i’ve had to limit their consumption unfortunately because there is a limited food budget and i tell them we have to stretch out what we have but they seem to crave them and say they feel better when they eat “healthy” like grandma and it’s taken little steps for me and them and some is better than none i can’t buy organic but just because i can’t it better that i eat some even if their not organic as i wish so what i’m saying is something is better than nothing especially when it comes to your helth reply krissays november 14 2013 at 435 am any thoughts on coconut oil for gut healing and getting things “flowing” i did a search on your site but didn’t see anything thanksreply brookesays october 25 2013 at 346 pm is sourdough really considered a good probiotic food to add good bacteria flora to the gut seems like

incorporating fermented food and abracadabra my aches and pains reduced significantly i am a true believer thank you for such a great article reply da nelle wolfordsays october 11 2013 at 521 am that’s greatreply lorettasays october 9 2013 at 1116 pm what a wealth of information i agree wholeheartedly thanks for such a great postreplyaprilsays october 9 2013 at 856 pm does this apply to peanut and tree nut allergies as well reply da nelle wolfordsays october 11 2013 at 526 am i would take precautions if you have a true allergy but yes many people can heal nut allergies through this method reply elisesays december 2 2013 at 457 pm i think it is key to recognizing a “true allergy” as you mentioned however i must be critical of the article and note that this distinction was not clear in the original text statistically overcoming nut allergies specifically peanut is rare allergens are tested on a scale of 16 for our son we wouldn’t dare mess with anything at a level 4 or above for fear of a life threatening reaction his nut and soy allergies are levels 5 and 6 i like the blog but in the future please clause the articles with notes about life threatening reactions

cure you brilliantreply maliasays september 17 2013 at 433 am hi i am wondering if the prebiotic foods need to be eaten raw i eat tons of onions but am wondering if i need to be eating them raw more often thanksreply da nelle wolfordsays september 17 2013 at 442 am either one should be fine replycharlenesays july 27 2013 at 139 am thank you for posting this great tips everyone should probably try to incorporate these into their diets regardless of sensitivities and allergies simply as a preventative matterreplymomgenetsays july 25 2013 at 305 pm should i really consider the gaps diet even though wheat seems to be the one thing i can eat without bothering me  reply lorisays july 22 2014 at 925 pm my biggest thing is i listen to my body not diets they are good guidelines and work for some but only you know your body just my thoughts and how i do things i check out many things and healthy living sites as i have many health issues i’m trying to heal i take from all and do what i can in baby steps mostly because of financial restraints but it lets me see what really helps and what doesn’t and what i can do to make lifelong changes i currently have a nice continuous kombucha brew going i’ve slowly but surely bought essential oils i need to make my own blends i know many swear by certain brands but until someone gives me some and proves to me that they are so much better than the ones i’m currently using i can’t justify that kind of expense many say their cheaper than prescriptions but i have no copay for mine so much for western medicine i also have started drinking coconut milk i make my own to save money and i also get flour out of it since now i also have had to give up gluten and nightshade vegetables since those also bother me and i eat lots of fresh andor frozen fruits and vegetables most of the time they are not organic i wish they were but again financial issues govern many of my decisions unfortunately i also eat yogurt so far these things have helped me quite a bit i also do yoga and am active i’m primary caretaker of 3 of my grandkids i’m basically grandma ”mom” since their mother was removed from the home by cps now that is where my 2 biggest issues come in i need to work on more positive ways to deal with the stress in my life as cps works on possible reunification of mom coming home as she suffers from mental health issues and it’s very complicated and stressful situation that i’m in as i’m supposed to look out for the children’s welfare as well as work to help a person who i strongly believe is not good for them to protect her rights and such it affects my sleep these are 2 things that really need to be resolved for even better health i realize at this time as i know these things are thing that need to be worked on i do not dwell on them my biggest thing i’m trying to say here is only you know your life and the issues you face and only you can judge what your body needs others can offer advice but only you can know try no gluten for awhile if you feel better go glutenfree or restrict it for special occasions if you don’t notice any changes go back and enjoy something that in moderation is probably not bad most things in moderation are usually not bad it’s when thing go to excess is when it’s bad those who become so addicted to certain types of living is not good either as they spend to much time on it at the expense of other things that make them a well rounded individual and unwilling to bend if the need is ever their reply robin jsays july 24 2013 at 201 am rebecca you are doing some really good things but you aren’t going to see a difference until you understand adrenal fatigue and make some changes accordingly because that is what is controlling your life right now the adrenal glands help runs several of the major systems in your body i strongly recommend the book “adrenal fatigue the 21st century stress syndrome”off the top of my head these are the adrenal healing points that have been most important for me– lay down flat for 20 minutes every afternoon seriously not reclined not online or tv or book just lie flat and rest your eyes you don’t have to sleep but you often will drift off amazing difference– don’t eat any carbs or sugars in the morning or at least before 1030 start your day with proteins instead eggs are your best friend not eating carbssugars in the morning will help you avoid that 10 am crash this has to do with the body’s natural insulin swings– avoid foodssubstances you are allergic to might feel easier to ignore allergies but you are stressing your adrenals the body produces histamine in response to allergies then the adrenals have to produce cortisol to control the inflammatory response if you can avoid allergens you help your adrenals– go to bed early if you are typical adrenal you get sleepy between 810 but then get a burst of energy until midnight go to bed by 10 while you are still tired i know how hard it is to sleep between 3am and 5am all the more reason to go to bed early– eat real foods avoid processed foods fast food– light exercise every day gardening walking stretching situps weights swimming but avoid cardio and anything that will wear you out find a happy medium i would seriously focus on these things and also read the book once you start feeling better have energy again and a clear mind you’ll realize how bad you were feeling before now i speak from experience reply krissays november 20 2013 at 113 am thanks for these ideas i too was wondering how long for results i do all the items mentioned in the original post and more swedish bitters detox tea castor oil packs etc and still can’t eliminate and bloat even on a single thin slice of fermented rye sourdough bread i suppose laying vertical for 20 minutes may help i do meditate upon waking in a seated position reply lorisays july 22 2014 at 849 pm i had to stop eating gluten to stop those symptoms you may already be doing this but may be eating hidden glutens i know now i am an a strict ingredient reader what i do when i happen to accidently or in a moment of weakness this mostly happened early on before i was able to buy gluten free alternatives for bread or similar items i have a limited budget and now that i have i eat these instead but when i do i use essential oils i made my own tummy blend but if you have money either your favorite brand andor youngs have a digestion blend but their way out of my financial reach and what i make myself works like a wonder except i start burping alot better than my grandsons much to their horror lol hennysays december 13 2013 at 720 am i agree caring for your adrenals is absolutely critical to healing if your adrenals are depleted your thyroid may well be struggling too – they often go hand in hand healing adrenals with teas and supplements is also very effective licorice ashwagandha and other herbs – i like the gaia adrenal support capsules plus tulsi sacred basil teas myself they get my adrenals back on track so well…sacred basil is amazing stuff…if you grow your own you can use it in salads or make pestos with it…so very healing it is sacred for a good reason replylaurensays february 28 2014 at 510 pm robin j – you have totally nailed what i need thanksreply rebeccasays july 22 2013 at 304 pm my nd suggested that i might have food sensitivities my throat is somewhat tight almost all the time my worry that it might be a dairy allergy although i drink raw milk only and make raw milk kefir i also ferment veggies and drink water kefir i do bone broth as well as add the great lakes gelatin to many things the only thing on your list that i don’t do is sleep well i try but battling adrenal fatigue my cortisol levels spike at night and so it is a constant battle to try to get 6 hours of sleep a night causing me further stress oh around and around we go i am hesitant to do the blood test the doc recommends because it doesn’t test raw milk only the pasteurized crap from the store so if it does show a dairy allergy then i feel like i am “marked” maybe i would rather go on life without knowing but my main question would be how long would you have to drink broth eat fermented veggies and water kefir and milk kefir before you should start to see results if they are working i have been drinking raw milk kefir for over 3 years and drinking bone broth for about 9 months gluten free and sugar free for almost a year… and only the past month started on water kefir i have been doing fermented veggies on and off for about 7 – 8 months…thank youreply chelctestsays july 22 2013 at 108 am i take big doses of probiotics but i avoid the prebiotics you listed because they are fodmaps and fodmaps kill my stomach are there any prebiotics that aren’t fodmaps
