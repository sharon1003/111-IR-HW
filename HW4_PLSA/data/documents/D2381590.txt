what is drip irrigation so what is netafim drip irrigation netafim drip irrigation is simply another method of applying water to your garden in terms of its purpose it is no different to the conventional way of irrigation or overhead sprinklers its main aim is to provide plants with their necessary water requirements in order to blossom what is the difference then to conventional irrigation in the case of conventional irrigation sprayers sprinklers or nozzles are used to distribute the water from above the height of the plants to cover the entire landscaped area netafim dripper lines perform exactly the same purpose in wetting the entire landscaped area except that it applies the water at ground level directly to the root zone and not from above and herein lies the difference when spraying from above the plant material you allow the water being irrigated to be susceptible to wind over spraying and ultimately evaporation see below illustration by throwing the water it makes it susceptible to wind which blows it off its course and wastes it to undesired areas such as paving road sides buildings and windows etc secondly the wind sweeps some of this fine water mist into the atmosphere and evaporates it before it has chance of even wetting the desired target the third aspect is that the water lands on all the plants within its irrigation range and thus prohibits some of the water from wetting its intended target namely the soil it is after all the ground we want to wet in order to get the water down to the root zone these essentially are the major benefits of netafim drip  conventional overhead irrigation and it is this difference that can save you between 20 â€“ 50 on the amount of water required to feed plants their weekly optimum requirements below is an illustration of how netafim drip irrigation overcomes these problems and can feed the plants their necessary water requirements without wasting any the netafim techline pipes are laid in a grid format on the ground of the landscaped area and apply the water directly to the root zone of the plants from here nature does the rest of the work by moving the applied water throughout the soil by means of gravity and capillary action the water is also applied at a much lower flow rate enabling the soil to absorb and move the water in a controlled fashion without flooding any areas and causing any run off waste or evaporation this way netafim drip can assure you that the water applied is used in the right areas applied precisely done so in a controlled fashion and will not waste our precious commodity so what is netafim techline dripper pipe netafim techline pipe is not simply just a pipe with lots of holes in it is ongoing technology being developed by netafim over the past 50 years each hole in the pipe has a pressure compensating dripper specifically and sonically welded into place at accurate intervals netafim techline can be used above ground or subsurface is pressure compensating and has continuously self cleaning technology the inline dripper is specifically designed and manufactured in such a way to allow only a certain amount of water pass through it and on to the soil surface the rest of the water is allowed to pass on down the pipe to be used by the other drippers within that line specific flow paths and a built in diaphragm within the dripper slow the water down and regulate its flow it is a patented design and unique to netafim another unique feature of netafim techline is that the inline dripper is located on only a small section of the pipe wall thus creating minimal water friction loss on the water flowing through the pipe friction is an important consideration within the irrigation industry as it creates loss of water pressure and flow secondly the siphon end water inlet of the dripper is always positioned in the centre of the pipe this means that no matter how the pipe lies on the ground the dripper will always suck water from the stream centre again this is beneficial in that if there is any grit or dirt within the pipe the weight of the particle and gravidity will pull it down to the lowest part of the pipe away from the centre stream and prevent it from being sucked in by the dripper the dripper itself has another two unique features in that it has an antisiphon mechanism which prevents contaminants being drawn into the dripper and is selfcleaning the wall thickness of netafim techline pipe is 12mm this too is not simply by chance is has been thoroughly researched to give the pipe enough durability and maintain its integrity within a landscape environment netafim techline is also uv protected against the harmful rays of the sun and carries a 7year warranty netafim techline is without a doubt the number one dripper pipe within the landscape industry
