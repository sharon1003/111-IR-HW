building a home deep porches and dark interior concernstkfinn97 january 29 2012i had been planning a 8 foot porch that runs the entire south side of our house my husband has decided to make it 10 deep which i agree will add some much needed room as we plan to spend a lot of time out there we are close to the border of canada and now i am beginning to worry that the winter sun will be unable to reach the interior of our house great room is on the south side of the house as well and that the rooms will be very dark and gloomy do any of you have thoughts on this would it make sense to add some skylights to the porch or would the skylights make it too hot during the summer months it is a 2 story house with living space above the great room opinions are welcomedemail save comment 13 like comments 13mydreamhome we also have porches on our house on both the north  south sides the front porch faces south and is 8 deep the back porch faces due north and is 10 deep along the kitchen wall and 16 deep along the family room wall i was also worried about the natural light issue especially in the family room with such a deep porch and the north direction when i solicited feedback from gw most posters said the rooms would be gloomy in the end though my worries and the gloomy predictions were unfounded while i do not have direct sunlight streaming in i have plenty of natural light that i can work and read by without help of ambientoverhead lighting even in winter really the only time we turn on the lights in there is at night the room feels open  airykeeping the wall  floor color on the light side  having lots of windows also helps our furniture is dark but the floor is natural stained oak and the walls are a medium beige color sw simply beige ds1s bedroom is on the front of the house on the south side with his bedroom window under the porch during the winter he complains of the sun waking him up too early as the sun is still low enough in the southern sky to shine in under the porch right through his window another 2 in porch depth might have helped that since you say your family room is also on the south side think about what happens when sun shines directly into a roomthere typically is a glare on the tv or it shines directly in someones eyes and you have to pull the curtains or close the blinds with the porch in place you wont have to worry about any of that you should get plenty of natural light without the glare your dh is right in thinking that an extra 2 would help with usability of the porch my parents front porch is 10 deep and they are easily able to use it for parties and such with my 8 deep porch on the front of the house it would be more difficult as its just not deep enough to accomodate a table chairs etc well i guess it could accomodate them but it would be very tough to get around the table to get to all the chairs to have a seatlol the question then is which is more important to youstreaming sunlight in a room vs a roomier  more versatile porch for relaxingentertaining at our house the answer was the porch hands down hope this helps1 like save january 30 2012 at 941ambevangelih8h0uzz with either an 8 or 10 covered porch your windows wont get much if any direct sunlight in either case if you want to ensure that the great room wont be dark and dismal skylights or solartubes on the porch would be a good idea while skylights can make it a bit warmer on the porch the heat build up shouldnt be as problematic as having skylights in an enclosed room inside the house would be remember that your porch should have plenty of air circulation so heat wont build up the same way it would inside plus you can add vents to the porch roof to allow rising warm air to escape in the summertime the other thing youll want to do with a deep porch is make sure the porch flooring and porch ceiling are light colors with high reflectivity values this will allow light to bounce around on the porch more so you get more reflected light entering your great room like save january 30 2012 at 957amtkfinn97mydreamhome and bevangel  thank you so much for your feedback you have made me feel much better about our planned porch and the sunlight issue i can move forward with the porch without the agony of indecision of the last 24 hours just when you think you are done with the planning stage concerns like this pop up and make you think your dream is ruined  its great that we have this forum so we can think of ways to solve potential problems before the buildlike save january 30 2012 at 1030amnikkidan glad i came across this we have covered porch on the front and back side of our house north and south i thought of the light issue during our planning stage but having the covered area outside was more important also the home we just sold was facing west so we really didnt get any direct sunlight except for a very short time in the morning in the kitchendining and not until about 3pm in the livingroom between that time there was plenty of natural light im hoping the same will be true for the new house tkfinn97 im interested to see how it works out for you we are about 23 hours south of the canadian border mn so maybe our lighting conditions will be similarour build should be done in about 6 weeks like save january 30 2012 at 1136pmtkfinn97i really appreciated the advice from the posters above and hope it works out for you nikkidan i also called my sister yesterday to ask for her thoughts and she mentioned that most of her south facing windows usually have the shades down during the day since the direct light was uncomfortable depending on where you are sitting our current house is facing west too and since you mentioned it i usually close the shades around 2 or 3 pm since the sun is streaming right into my eyes i am feeling better and better about this like save january 31 2012 at 845amsally p123we have a wrap around porch8 ft wide i reside in canada and so i understand about the winter light anyhow our porches were designed with clear lexon material sections built over the windows areas so that the light comes through just a thought1 like save january 31 2012 at 531pmnini804we have two skylights in our covered terrace it faces east though not south it is 13 deep and i was very concerned about light especially since we rented an older ranch home with a deep porch while we were building and it was super dark anyway we have found that the fact that the ceilings are 10 both inside and on the porch our exterior is white painted brick so reflects light and the fact that i had the porch ceiling vgroove boards painted light blue like the sky keeps it very light it never feels dark in our home even on a rainy day the skylights and blue ceiling really make it seem sunny like save january 31 2012 at 547pmgobruno i think it depends on how high the porch ceilings are whether you have trees to reduce the amount you have to work with to begin with how big your windows are under the porch and how much natural light you are hoping to have in your home if you have high porch ceilings and many really big windows and your property is naturally pretty sunny then i dont think its a problem but if your porch height is only 8 ft and your windows are smaller and higher up so closer to the roofline and your property is pretty shady then yes i think a deep porch would cause a problem in getting natural light into your home like save january 31 2012 at 613pmfrozenelvesnikkidan what part of mn are you in we are in duluth and hope to be building soon after we sell our house like save january 31 2012 at 754pmspringtime homes great points gobruno probably the most important variables for others in the design stage thinking of porches facing south consider elimanating

majority of homes are built with roof trusses  that seems to complicate things in this matter like save february 2 2012 at 133pmprairiemom61our sse facing porch is 10wide by 60 long with some wrapping the east and west sides we love it its big enough for parties tables chairs etc we have large windows on the south side living room and kitchen letting in plenty of natural light as previous posters said keep your wall colors light you will never regret a porch and in our area the porch actually reduces cooling costs significantly it blocks that hot summer sun in the evenings in the summer the sun is in the nw so our se porch is always shady and much cooler than if we had a deck on the back of the house good luck enjoy that porchlike save february 2 2012 at 253pmnikkidanfrozenelves8we are
