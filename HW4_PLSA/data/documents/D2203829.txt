should you contribute to an ira when you still have student loans paula pant updated on december 16 2015advertiser disclosure you entered the workforce saddled with student loan debt your net worth is negative you’re not sure how long it will take to repay your debts it’s no wonder you might be feeling conflicted about whether to start contributing to your ira how can you invest money in a retirement account when you still have large amounts of debt shouldn’t you pay off debt before worrying about saving the short answer no sometimes it’s better to invest for retirement than to repay your student loans contributing to an irawhen you start working it’s important to make the minimum payments on your student loans at the very least while making the maximum contribution to your retirement accounts contribute enough money to your 401k to take full advantage of your employer match if applicable after that switch to an ira types of iras individual retirement accounts iras are taxadvantaged investing tools geared towards retirement savings there are several types of iras to choose from traditional iratraditional individual retirement accounts “trad” iras allow people to invest their income pretax up to 5500 for 2015 and 2016 into a taxdeferred savings account capital gains and dividend income grow taxdeferred pretax contributions mean the money is deducted from your taxable income if you earned 50000 and contribute 2000 to a trad ira you’re taxed as if you earned 48000 that’s an overlysimplistic example meant for the sake of illustration you’ll also have other tax deductions such as your standard deduction loan interest deductions etc when investments grow “taxdeferred” it means you don’t pay any taxes on that growth until you withdraw the money in retirement roth iraa roth individual retirement account is similar to a traditional ira however contributions to a roth ira are made with aftertax income rather than pretax income why would anyone want this because the deal is that you pay taxes once … and never again your capital gains and dividends don’t just grow taxdeferred they grow taxexempt that means you’ll never pay a dime in taxes on that investment growth even if it enjoys 40 years of compounding this is known as a “taxexempt” account in addition your current tax rate might be lower than your tax rate in retirement which means you’re taking the tax hit at a time when you’re in a lower bracket that’s why people in their 20s and 30s in particular are often attracted to roth iras simple irasimple stands for “savings incentive match plan for employees” simple ira accounts are retirement plans established by employers and selfemployed individuals the employer makes a taxdeductible matching or nonelective contribution to each eligible employee’s simple ira and the employees themselves can make salary deferral contributions to their own account if you’re employed and your job doesn’t offer a simple ira you can ignore this option simple accounts must be set up by the employer if you job offers a simple ira you’ll want to think about whether you should make contributions to a simple ira or your own traditional or roth ira find out whether or not your employer offers matching contributions if so prioritize maxing out this match if your job doesn’t offer matching contributions prioritize the account that has the taxable structure you prefer taxdeferred or taxexempt note that contributions to your simple ira do not preclude you from contributing to a trad or roth ira eligible participants can max out their simple ira in addition to maxing out their trad or roth ira sep irasep stands for “simplified employee pension”seps are irabased retirement plans in which employers make taxdeductible contributions into the sep accounts of eligible employees most contributions are made by the employer employees can contribute up to 5500 or 6500 if they’re 50 or older but this is counted against eligibility for trad or roth ira contributions in other words eligible participants can contribute a maximum of 5500 per year or 6500 if you’re over 50 to a combination of trad roth and sep iras contributing to an ira while paying off debt once you decide which account to fund you’ll need to decide to tackle both student debt and funding your retirement account the longer you invest in your ira or 401k the more time you can gain interest and dividends increasing your overall balance for retirement the sooner you crush your student loans the less interest you’ll pay over time additionally you’ll have excess cash every month which can go into future investments there are good arguments for both options repaying loans vs saving for retirement you’ll need to find the right balance for you when you’re deciding consider the interest rate on your loans any employer matches your tax bracket and your overall comfort with both investing and debt repayment roth ira withdrawals here’s an interesting twist on the retirement vs student loans issue your roth ira contributions can be withdrawn without penalty you could use your original roth ira contributions the “principal” to make a student loan payment here’s an example let’s say you save 5500 per year in your roth ira at the end of five years you’ve contributed 27500 and these investments have grown by an additional 3000 you hold a total of 30500 in your account you can withdraw the original contribution without penalties or taxes you’ve already paid taxes on this income so the government won’t penalize you for tapping it early the other 3000 in growth needs to stay in your account or else you’ll face penalties and taxes why would you choose this option let’s imagine that right now you’re equally contributing to both goals you save 5500 per year in your roth ira and put another 5500 per year toward your student loan payments but let’s say that five years from now you lose your job it’s the middle of a recession and you’re having a tough time jobhunting you understand that retirement is important but your immediate goal is to become debtfree so you can lower your monthly bills a nice 27500 chunk of change will wipe away your debts in one fell swoop that’s a prime example illustrating how the flexibility of a roth ira can help you invest for retirement while still preserving liquidity and flexibility which should you choose right now you have time on your side the longer you allow your retirement contributions to accrue interest and dividends the more money you’ll enjoy in retirement you could take out a student loan but no one will give you retirement loan when you turn 65 you’ll need to have the funds on hand to support yourself throughout your golden years don’t think of ira contributions vs debt payoff as an “eitheror” question instead embrace that you’re going to handle both then decide what balance you want to achieve if you can dedicate an extra 1000 per month towards these goals do you want a 5050 split 6040 7030 your answer depends on your interest rate goals and other personal factors at the end of the day though the specifics of that split are secondary what matters most is that you’re dedicating a significant portion of your income to improving your financial life regardless of whether that’s in the form of ira contributions or debt payments interested in refinancing student loans
