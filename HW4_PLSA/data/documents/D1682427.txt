maybe later sortfor a species with a haploid number of 23 chromosomes how many different combinations of maternal and paternal chromosomes are possibe for the gametes about 8 milllion a 1  frequency of recombination is observed in genes located very close to one another on the same chromosomeif a chromosome lacks certain genes what has most likely occured a deletionin a cross aa bb cc times aa bbcc what is the probability of producing the genotype of aabbcc 132which of the following genes are closest on a genetic map of drosophila b and rbcrossing over occurs during which phase of meiosis prophase 1the frequency of crossing over between any two linked genes is proportionaly to the distance between themwhich of the following is an example of polygenic inheritance skin pigmentation in humansthe following is a list of chromosmal alterations which of these would automatically cause 2 of the others nonrecprocal translocation deletion duplication inversion reciprocal translocationsyngamy occurs between gametesblack fur in mice b is dominant to brown fur b short tail t is dominant to long tails t what fraction of the progeny of the cross bb tt times bbtt 12a couple who are both carriers of the gene for cystic fibrosis have two children who have cystic fibrosis what is the probability that their next child will be phenotypicially normal 75the phases of meiosis that produce the most genetic variation from crossing over and independent assortment and prophase 1 and anaphase 1the finding that defective genes behave differently in offspring depending on whether they belong to the maternal or paternal chromosome is implicated in which of the following praderwilli syndrome fragile x syndrom angelman syndrome e a b and ctallness t is dominant to dwarfiness t while red r flower color is dominant to white r the heterozygous condition results in a pink rr flower color a dwarf homozygous red snapdragon s crossed with a plant homozygous for tallness and white flowers what are the genotype and phenotype of the f1 individual tt rr tall and pinkwhat is the probability that individual c1 is ww 1eukaryotic sexual life cycles show tremendous variation of the following elements which do all sexual life cycles have in common meiosis fertilization sporesa couple has three children all of whom have brown eyes and blonde hair both parents are homozygous for brown eyes bb but one is blonde rr and the other is a redhead rr what is the probability that their next child will be a brown eyes redhead 12a celll that has 2n1 chromosomes is trisomic and anueploid e a and chow does sexual life cycle increase the genetic variation in a species  by allowing independent assortment of chromosomes  by allowing random fertilization  by allowing crossing over e all of the abovean achondroplastic dwarf man with normal vision marries a colorblind woman of normal heights the mans father was 6 ft tall and both the womans parents were of average heiight achondroplastic dwarfism is autosomal dominant and red green colorblindness is xlinked recessive 1 how many of their female children might be expected to be colorblind dwarfs nonewhich of the following terms belongs least suitable with the otehrs chiasmata fertilization spore gamete zygotein a normal mendelian dihybrid cross the expected proportion of offspring showing both recessive traits is 116a woman who belongs to blood group a and is rh positive has a daughter who is o positive and a son who is b negative rh positive is a simple domingant over rh negative 2 which of the following is a possible genotype for the motehr i a i rrcentromeres uncouple and chromatids are separated from each other true for mitosis and meiosis 2there is good evidence for linkage when genes do not segregrate independently during meiosisvermillion eyes is a sex linked recessive characteristic in fruit flies if a female with vermillion eyes is crossed with a wildtype male what percentage of the f1 males will have vermillion eyes 100 homologous chromosomes synapse and crossing over occurs meiosis 1 onlyin cats black color is caused by an xlinked allele the other allele at this locus causes oragne color the heterozygous is tortoiseshell what kinds of offspring would you expect from the cross of a black female and an oragne male tortoiseshell female black malean achondroplastic dwarf man with normal vision marries a colorblind woman of normal heights the mans father was 6 ft tall and both the womans parents were of average heiight achondroplastic dwarfism is autosomal dominant and red green colorblindness is xlinked recessive 2 how many of thier male children would be colorblind and normal height halfthe process is preceded by a copying of dna true for mitosis and meiosis 1a woman who belongs to blood group a and is rh positive has a daughter who is o positive and a son who is b negative rh positive is a simple domingant over rh negative 1 which of the follwoing is a possibly genotype for the son i b i rra woman who belongs to blood group a and is rh positive has a daughter who is o positive and a son who is b negative rh positive is a simple domingant over rh negative 3 which of the following is a possible phenotype for the father b positiviein a series of mapping experiments the recombination frequencies for four different linked genes in drosophila were determined as shown above what is the order of these genes on a chromosome map brbcnvgwhich number represents the dna content of a sperm 5in crossing a homozygous recessive with a heterozygote what is the chance of getting an offspring with the homozygous recessive phenotype 50in most species of ants and bees the chromosomal system of sex determination is haploiddiploid albinism is caused by a recessive autosomal allele a man and a woman both normally pigmented have an albino child together 1 the couple decides to have a second child what is the probability that this child will be an albino 14what is the chromosomal system for sex determined in grasshoppers and certain other insects xoone possible result of chromosomal breakage is for a fragment to join a nonhomologous chromosome this is called a translocationyou the liver cells of an animal have 24 chromosomes its sperm cells would have how many chromosomes 12what is the genotype for individual b5 ww only huntingtons disease is caused by a
