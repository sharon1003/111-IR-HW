home buying guides books nonfiction internal network adapters vs usb wifi donglese bay 2 likes like march 3 2016a network adapter allows a computer to connect to other computers with which it shares a network the internet is perhaps the most common example of a network and is the network that has the most users on it a computer needs a network adapter in order to connect to the internet or to any other network there are a few different types of network cards some are usb wifi dongles that operate via a computers usb port they wirelessly connect the computer to a network via an airborne signal other network cards are internal and they reside inside the computer itself this guide will explain the differences between internal network adapters and usb wifi dongles as well as highlight a few of the benefits of using a usb wifi dongle instead of an internal network adapter is this an applestoapples comparison internal network adapters and usb wifi dongles are both considered network cards otherwise known as network interface controllers or lan adapters they serve the same function of connecting a computer to a computer network such as the internet other networks to which an internal network adapter and a usb wifi dongle connect a computer include a set of home computers and a group of office computers because these two types of devices serve the same basic function an applestoapples comparison can be made between them there are some major differences between internal network adapters and usb wifi dongles which should be apparent in the descriptions of each type of device below what is an internal network adapter an internal network adapter resides inside a computers housing whether it is a laptop casing or a desktop tower it has a port for a wire or an antenna that transmits data to and from the computer and from and to other computers on the same network although various technologies existed for data transmission ethernet has become the widely prevailing technology for internal network cards so the port on the card is usually an ethernet port meant to fit an ethernet cable some internal network adapters employ wireless technology instead of a port for an ethernet cable they have an antenna that transmits data wirelessly what is a usb wifi dongle a usb wi  fi dongle is a network adapter that plugs into a computers usb port it transmits data wirelessly between the computer and other computers on the network with the usb port being hooked up to the motherboard inside the computers housing it is a plugandplay device meaning that it simply needs to be plugged in order to operate the computer is on the network as soon as the wifi dongle is inserted into the computers usb port a software installation may be required the first time a dongle is used on a computer but the computer should recognize the dongle every time it is subsequently plugged in wireless protocol all usb wifi dongles have a wireless protocol for transmitting data via airwaves meaning wirelessly this protocol is denoted by the digits 80211 which is followed by a letter that indicates a slight variance in the signal eg 80211b 80211g the table below details the various 80211 signals employed by usb wifi dongles along with their approximate indoor and outdoor signal ranges80211 protocol approximate indoor range approximate outdoor range80211 a115 ft39080211 b115 ft46080211 g125 ft46080211 n230 ft82080211n usb wifi dongles have the furthest signal range of these types of wireless network adapters the release of an ac protocol is pending u s government approval of airwave use and this would represent the most recent generation of usb wifi dongles the advantages of using a usb wifi dongle although an internal network card is capable of faster maximum data transfer speeds than a usb wifi dongle the dongle has a few advantages over the internal network card in a few key areas these include ease of installation compatibility and portabilityadaptability ease of installation the main advantage of using a usb wifi dongle over an internal network card for connecting a computer to a network is the ease of installation since an internal network card goes inside of a computers housing the computer must be opened up and the internal network card must be installed into the right slot this can be a daunting task for those with little experience working with a computers hardware on the other hand installing a usb wifi dongle is relatively simple most dongles come with software or the software can be downloaded from an online source once the software is loaded onto the computer just follow the instructions and insert the dongle into a usb port when prompted the computer should recognize the wireless adapter and the user will be able to connect the computer to their desired network such as the internet a usb wifi dongle provides the quickest solution for connecting a computer to a network compatibility an internal network card must be compatible with the computers motherboard since it is interfacing directly with the motherboard most motherboards and internal network cards interface via some type of pci bus but there are various versions of pci including standard pci and pci express not all network cards are compatible with all versions of pci therefore a user must ensure that an internal network card is compatible with the motherboard before going through the intricate installation procedure a usb wifi dongle is compatible with a computer that has a usb slot the presence of which has been a standard feature of computers for some time users with older computers simply need to look around the computer to see if it has a usb port checking for compatibility does not require collecting information on the computers motherboard as is the case with an internal network card portabilityadaptability an internal network card is fixed in one place after it is installed removing it and putting it another computer is possible but it is a laborious process and therefore is one that is impractical to do more than once or twice an internal network card is generally used in only one or two computers over its lifespan because a usb wifi dongle is so easy to install and because it is compatible with so many different types of computers it can be easily moved from one computer to another a user may keep it installed in a desktop computer at home and then insert it into a laptop to pick up a hotels or a cafes wifi signal while traveling usb wifi dongles are generally small making them easy to carry anywhere where to buy usb wifi dongles usb wifi dongles are available from a variety of sources computer specialty shops generally stock them these are good places from which to buy usb wifi dongles because the people that run them are often knowledgeable about the products that they sell and can provide good advice to customers the only drawback is that their stocks may be limited large electronics retailers that operate a chain of outlets across a wide geographical region are also good sources of usb wifi dongles because they offer large selections though their employees may not be as knowledgeable as those at computer specialty shops many large electronics retailers also have online stores that sell usb wifi dongles stocks from these sources are generally vast offering consumers a large selection of devices from which to choose customers should have a good idea of the usb wifi dongles they are looking for if they choose to shop for them online because consumer

network adapters perform the same general function in that they connect a computer to a network of other computers such as the internet however there are major differences in how they accomplish this task internal network adapters work from inside a computers housing while usb wifi dongles reside on the periphery of a computers housing attached via a usb port although internal network adapters are generally capable of higher maximum data transmissions the design difference between the two gives usb wifi dongles an advantage in the areas of ease of installation compatibility and portabilityadaptability they are very userfriendly devices that do not require professional installation and that can easily be used on multiple computers for those with little experience working with computer hardware and who want a wireless adapter that they can use on various computers a usb wifi dongle makes the most sense tagsnetwork adaptersusb wifi donglesprotocolnetwork cardsethernet cable
