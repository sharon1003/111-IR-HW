picture as you have it now but it might not be in scale to your other paper crafts so to fix this were going have to scale the image its usually the easiest to just scale it to full page if you know how to do this feel free to skip ahead but if you dont ive broken it down in both photoshop and in msword photoshop first click file and scroll down to print next look for the option that says scale to fit media click that then click print microsoft word after you open word drag and drop the picture into the document now click format picture then wrap text you should have a drag down option list click behind text you should be able to make the picture any size you want now so grab a corner and drag it to the other end once its full sized print microsoft paint open up the picture in paint open paint by clicking the start button  clicking all programs clicking accessories and then clicking paint its on every windows computer next click on one of the corners and drag it to expand to the desired size then click file and print and you should be setstep 3 cuttingah so youve stuck with it this far have you well i can asure you the payoff is soon to come but before that we need to make some cuts so break out the scissors and prepare for step three this parts pretty simple all you have to do it cut on the black line surrounding each white space make sure not you cut these off as theyre what we will be using to hold the contraption together later on if your confused as to what i mean and i dont blame ya just check out the picturesstep 4 foldingafter youve cut out your papercraft your going to do a few folds before we start to glue if you hadnt noticed already papercrafts are the net of the shape they will soon be to get them to their shape we need to fold down every side for example above in the picture every line highlighted in red should be folded in if you folded it right you should be able to hold the box together like i am in the second picture after you fold a few folds itll be a lot easier to see how the rest fit in and soon youll end up with a box ready to gluestep 5 glueinghere we are almost finished you got dis glueings pretty simple all you have to do is take your choice of glue glue sticks or tacky glues seems to work the best and get just the tinniest amount onto one of the white slips the ones we didnt cut earlier once the glues on there just stick it onto the connecting square its a little tough to explain so heres a video i found that covers it pretty well zipper style glue tabs tutorial your browser does not currently

border and it was too big and still pixeled and looked blurry is there a way to fix this maybe change to 300dpi ive been told an image this small wont make a print difference in 72dpi to 300dpi are we doing something wrong your images look clear and some others ive seen look clear thank youben burge okstout4 reply20140603i think whatever software youre using to print the image is simply stretching it to full page actual size is near a quarter of that id find a way to print the file unchanged ms paint will work for that otherwise see if theres an option to print a 4x6 maybe that should look much
