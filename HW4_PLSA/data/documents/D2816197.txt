anytime fitness franchises what do people really want from a health club that’s the key question anytime fitness cofounders chuck runyon and dave mortensen asked themselves six years ago the answer was relatively simple people want a convenient and affordable place to go – with quality exercise equipment and a friendly atmosphere – where they can get in work out and get on with their lives thus

the 9th fastestgrowing franchise of any type in the united states nor is it a fluke that anytime fitness has been described as “the darling of the fitness industry” there are several very good reasons why anytime fitness has captured the franchising world by storm it’s a story that can be best summed up by the phrase “a great idea very well executed”the concept from a franchising perspective it all began with a desire to create an opportunity for entrepreneurs to run businesses they could be proud of – without running themselves into the ground many franchisors promise to provide their franchisees with a return on their investment that’s so strong that they’ll be rewarded with all sorts of free time and the freedom to enjoy their families not all franchisors however actually deliver on that promise anytime fitness not only meets but frequently exceeds franchisee expectations low labor costs one of the most important components to the anytime fitness business model is the ability to minimize payroll costs for club owners while maximizing security and enjoyment for club members a key to all of this is anytime fitness’ innovative use of integrated billing and security systems a unified system tracks member usage while simultaneously preventing nonmember access the same proprietary system seamlessly commands surveillance and alarm devices while controlling the operation of

for anytime fitness clubs compare that figure to the 45 payroll costs at typical franchising ventures franchisees don’t have to “live at the office” when they own an anytime fitness club a balanced
