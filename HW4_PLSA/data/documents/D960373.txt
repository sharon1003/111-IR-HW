reaction also called acute stress disorder psychological shock mental shock or simply shock is a psychological condition arising in response to a terrifying or traumatic event or witnessing a traumatic event that induces a strong emotional response within the individual it should not be confused with the unrelated circulatory condition of shockhypoperfusion acute stress reaction asr may develop into delayed stress reaction better known as ptsd if stress is not correctly managed asr is characterized by reliving and avoiding reminders of an aversive event as well as generalized hypervigilance after initial exposure to a traumatic event asd is differentiated from ptsd as a disorder that precedes it and if symptoms last for more than one month it will develop into ptsd it can thus be thought of as the acute phase of ptsd 1contents  hide 1 signs and symptoms2 history3 causes4 pathophysiology5 diagnosis6 treatment7 references signs and symptoms  editthe dsmiv specifies that asd must be accompanied by the presence of dissociative symptoms which largely differentiates it from ptsd dissociative symptoms include a sense of numbing or detachment from emotional reactions a sense of physical detachment such as seeing oneself from another perspective decreased awareness of one’s surroundings the perception that one’s environment is unreal or dreamlike and the inability to recall critical aspects of the traumatic event dissociative amnesia 2in addition to the characteristic dissociative symptoms asd shares many of the symptoms with ptsd includingthe experience or witnessing of a threatening event that resulted in intense fear or horrorthe reexperiencing of the event by means of flashbacks recurrent thoughts or dreams and distress when reminded of the eventthe avoidance of stimuli that serve as reminders of the event such as feelings thoughts places individuals and activitiesanxiety including restlessness difficulty sleeping and concentrating and hypervigilancea significant disruption in normal social or work functioning 2history  editthe term asr was first used to describe the symptoms of soldiers during world war i and ii and it was therefore also termed combat stress reaction csr approximately 20 of u s troops displayed symptoms of csr during wwii and it was assumed to be a temporary response of healthy individuals to witnessing or experiencing traumatic events symptoms include depression anxiety withdrawal confusion paranoia and sympathetic hyperactivity 2the apa officially included the term asd in the dsmiv in 1994 and prior to that symptomatic individuals within the first month of trauma were diagnosed with adjustment disorder according to the dsm iv asr refers to the symptoms experienced right after exposure to a traumatic event up until 48 hours after it in contrast asd is defined by symptoms experienced after 48 hours of the event up until one month past the event symptoms experienced for longer than one month are consistent with a diagnosis of ptsd 2causes  editthere are several theoretical perspectives on trauma response including cognitive biological and psychobiological while the theories are ptsdspecific they are still useful in understanding asd as both share many symptoms 2acute stress disorder abbreviated asd and not to be confused with autism spectrum disorder is the result of a traumatic event in which the person experiences or witnesses an event that causes the victimwitness to experience extreme disturbing or unexpected fear stress or pain and that involves or threatens serious injury perceived serious injury or death to themselves or someone else a study of rescue personnel after exposure to a traumatic event showed no gender difference in acute stress reaction 3 acute stress reaction is a variation of posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd a recent study found that a single stressful event may cause longterm consequences in the brain this result calls the traditional distinction between the effects of acute vs chronic stress into question 4pathophysiology  editstress is characterized by specific physiological responses to aversive or noxious stimuli hans selye was the first to coin the term “general adaptation syndrome” to suggest that stress induced physiological responses proceed through the stages of alarm resistance and exhaustion 5the sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system gives rise to a specific set of physiological responses in response to physical or psychological stress the body’s response to stress is also termed “fightorflight response” and it is characterized by an increase in blood flow to skeletal muscles the heart and brain a rise in heart rate and blood pressure as well as dilation of pupils and an increase in the amount of glucose released by the liver 6the onset of an acute stress response is associated with specific physiological actions in the sympathetic nervous system both directly and indirectly through the release of adrenaline and to a lesser extent noradrenaline from the medulla of the adrenal glands these catecholamine hormones facilitate immediate physical reactions by triggering increases in heart rate and breathing constricting blood vessels an abundance of catecholamines at neuroreceptor sites facilitates reliance on spontaneous or intuitive behaviors often related to combat or escape  citation needednormally when a person is in a serene unstimulated state the firing of neurons in the locus ceruleus is minimal a novel stimulus once perceived is relayed from the sensory cortex of the brain through the thalamus to the brain stem that route of signaling increases the rate of noradrenergic activity in the locus ceruleus and the person becomes alert and attentive to the environment  citation neededif a stimulus is perceived as a threat a more intense and prolonged discharge of the locus ceruleus activates the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system thase  howland 1995 the activation of the sympathetic nervous system leads to the release of norepinephrine from nerve endings acting on the heart blood vessels respiratory centers and other sites the ensuing physiological changes constitute a major part of the acute stress response the other major player in the acute stress response is the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal axis  citation neededthe autonomic nervous system controls all automatic functions in the body and contains two subsections within it that aids in response to an acute stress reaction these two subunits are the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system the sympathetic response is colloquially known as the  fight or flight  response indicated by accelerated pulse and respiration rates pupil dilation and a general feeling of anxiety and hyperawareness this is caused by the release of epinephrine and norepinephrine from the adrenal glands the epinephrine and norepinephrine strike the beta receptors of the heart which feeds the heart sympathetic nerve fibers in order to increase the strength of heart muscle contraction as a result more blood gets circulated increasing the heart rate and respiratory rate the sympathetic nervous system also stimulates the skeletal system and muscular system in an effort to pump more blood to those areas to handle the acute stress simultaneously the sympathetic nervous system inhibits the digestive system and the urinary system in order to optimize blood flow to the heart lungs and skeletal muscles this plays a role in the alarm reaction stage the parasympathetic response is colloquially known as the rest and digest response indicated by reduced heart and respiration rates and more obviously by a temporary loss of consciousness if the system is fired at a rapid rate the parasympathetic nervous system stimulates the digestive system and urinary system in order to send more blood to those systems to increase the process of digestion in order to do this it must inhibit the cardiovascular system and respiratory system in an effort to optimize blood flow to the digestive tract causing low heart and respiratory rates parasympathetic plays no role in acute stress response van putte regan russo 2014 7studies have shown that patients with asd have overactive right amygdalae and prefrontal cortices both structures that are involved in the fearprocessing pathway 1diagnosis  editthere must be a clear temporal connection between the impact of an exceptional stressor and the onset of symptoms onset is usually within a few minutes or days but may occur up to one month after the stressor in addition the symptoms show a mixed and usually changing picture in addition to the initial state of daze depression anxiety anger despair overactivity and withdrawal may all be seen but no one type of symptom predominates for long the symptoms usually resolve rapidly in those cases where removal from the stressful environment is possible in cases where the stress continues or cannot by its nature be reversed the symptoms usually begin to diminish after 24–48 hours and are usually minimal after about 3 days 8treatment  editthis disorder may resolve itself with time or may develop into a more severe disorder such as ptsd however results of creamer odonnell and pattisons 2004 study of 363 patients suggests that a diagnosis of acute stress disorder had only limited predictive validity for ptsd creamer et al did find that reexperiences of the traumatic event and arousal were better predictors of ptsd 9 early pharmacotherapy may prevent the development of posttraumtic symptoms 10studies have been conducted to assess the efficacy of counselling and psychotherapy for people with asd cognitive behavioral therapy which included exposure and cognitive restructuring was found to be effective in preventing ptsd in patients diagnosed with asd with clinically significant results at 6 months followup a combination of relaxation cognitive restructuring imaginal exposure and in vivo exposure was superior to supportive counseling 11 mindfulness based stress reduction programs also appear to be effective for stress management 12in a wilderness context where counseling psychotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy is unlikely to be available the treatment for acute stress reaction is very similar for the treatment of cardiogenic shock vascular shock and hypovolemic shock that is allowing the patient to lie down providing reassurance and removing the stimulus for the occurrence of the reaction in traditional shock cases this is generally the relieving of pain from injuries or the stopping of blood loss in an acute stress reaction this may be pulling a rescuer away from the emergency to calm down or blocking the sight of an injured friend from a patient 7references  edit a b reynaud emmanuelle guedj eric trousselard marion el khourymalhame myriam zendjidjian xavier fakra
