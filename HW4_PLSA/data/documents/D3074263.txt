controversial period in american history other factors although less discussed throughout history also contributed to the economic rise of early american economy such as plantationism and urbanization

a double edge sword for the united states it began as the driving force in pushing along economic growth but it came at the price of the african society it was implied and enforced that africans were of a lesser class through the means in which they were used by the slave owners to promote their wealth and stature the larger their plantation the wealthier and more successful people were seen but in order to do this the plantation owners needed workers but if they had to pay workers reasonable wages they could not yield a profit also in the south it was hard rough work in the hot sun and very few whites were willing to do the work therefore most plantation owners purchased slaves to work the land the plantation owner gave the slaves shelter and a small food allowance as a salary thereby the plantation owner saved his money to invest in more land which of course required more slaves to continue to yield a larger profit an economic cycle was created between plantation owner and slave

individualism how strange then for such a society that encouraged and promoted such beliefs would contradict itself by excluding the african slaves who were not considered equal to whites they were considered the lowest of the low on the social ladder the colonial society believed in providing the necessary means for personal growth and development and yet limited and controlled the lives of slaves personal development and growth was not an option for slaves they were unable to attain any personal wealth or economic growth which left them dehumanized and limited in life they could lead they were given no means to better themselves and this was done so that the slaves had to remain dependent upon the slave owners for their survival perhaps the most profound factor and the one most difficult to discuss in slavery is racism the ideas of slavery or indentured servant had all been around before the colonies were established so why was it so different in the americas the belief in white superiority and black inferiority was imposed upon the african slaves with very few exceptions all slaves were african and brought to america for the sole purpose of free labor and thereby all people with dark or black skin were labeled something less than human in comparison to the white population in america africans were put out of bounds of regular society because their place was racially defined and therefore incurable slave owners believed that there were five steps in the character molding of a slave 1 strict discipline 2 a sense of selfinferiority 3 a belief in masters superiority 4 an acceptance masters ideals and 5 a deep sense of their own dependency and hopelessness most of the time the slaves were exploited for the accumulation of the wealth of the whites the africans could escape slavery but not their race and if ever caught they would be punished harshly the urbanization and industrialization of early america became another underlying factor in the economics of slavery initially southern slave owners thought that the slaves were too stupid to understand the machinery so they would not work well in urban areas they were also believed to be too careless to use complex tools in the factories as a result of this thinking it impeded the growth of industrialization in the south and maintained the chains of slavery slaves were an economic positive but a social negative in history they helped the economics of the country thrive and grow but it was also a insult of a race africans also had a history that they should have been proud to have instead they were denied their heritage and were made to be ashamed of the people that they were the development of slavery was the white slave owners way to maintain control of the growing population of africans socially and industrially if the slaves were confined to the fields of the plantations for supervision the whites would remain dominant race and maintain their theory of white supremacy it also freed the slave owners from the worries of labor strikes and unemployment it proved to be a strong economic advantage one could state that the increasing economic growth of early america was due to the slaves labor one could also state that the growth was due to the investments of the land and crops by the white slaveholders either way it is stated it is true slavery had a huge impact on the growth of a new and emerging nation but it was also the abuse of a race
