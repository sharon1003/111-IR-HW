harness of car audio cables pull test qualification of crimped end a cable harness also known as a wire harness 1 cable assembly wiring assembly or wiring loom is an assembly of electrical cables or wires which transmit signals or electrical power the cables are bound together by straps cable ties cable lacing sleeves electrical tape conduit a weave of extruded string or a combination thereof commonly used in automobiles as well as construction machinery cable harnesses provide several advantages over loose wires and cables for example many aircraft automobiles and spacecraft contain many masses of wires which would stretch over several kilometres if fully extended by binding the many wires and cables into a cable harness the wires and cables can be better secured against the adverse effects of vibrations abrasions and moisture by constricting the wires into a nonflexing bundle usage of space is optimized and the risk of a short is decreased since the installer has only one harness to install as opposed to multiple wires installation time is decreased and the process can be easily standardized binding the wires into a flameretardant sleeve also lowers the risk of electrical fires 2contents  hide 1 production2 in sound engineering3 industry quality standard4 references production  editcable harnesses are usually designed according to geometric and electrical requirements a diagram is then provided either on paper or on a monitor for the assembly preparation and assembly the wires are first cut to the desired length usually using a special wirecutting machine the wires may also be printed on by a special machine during the cutting process or on a separate machine after this the ends of the wires are stripped to expose the metal or core of the wires which are fitted with any required terminals or connector housings the cables are assembled and clamped together on a special workbench or onto a pin board  assembly board  according to the design specification to form the cable harness after fitting any protective sleeves conduit or extruded yarn the harness is either fitted directly in the vehicle or shipped in spite of increasing automation in general cable harnesses continue to be manufactured by hand due to the many different processes involved such asrouting wires through sleevestaping with fabric tape in particular on branch outs from wire strandscrimping terminals onto wires particularly for socalled multiple crimps more than one wire into one terminalinserting one sleeve into anotherfastening strands with tape clamps or cable ties it is difficult to automate these processes with suppliers like 1x technologies belden inc and alpha wire leading the cable harness industry in quality manual production automating only portions of the process manual production remains more cost effective than automation especially with small batch sizes preproduction can be automated in part this affects cutting individual wires cutting machinecrimping terminals onto one or both sides of the wirepartial plugging of wires prefitted with terminals into connector housings  module soldering of wire ends solder machinetwisting wires testing the electrical functionality of a cable harness can be done with the aid of a test board the circuit diagram data are preprogrammed into the test board where harnesses can be tested individually or in multiple numbers 3 4in sound engineering  editthe cable harnesses used in sound engineering stage and studio for carrying audio signals are also called multicores industry quality standard  editwiring harness quality standards are standardized by ipc s publication ipcwhmaa620 for conforming and nonconforming requirements customer drawings notes or specifications take a higher priority to the ipcwhmaa620 standard but if no customer specifications are called for the default accept  reject is dictated by the 620 standard ipc standards are reviewed every three years to ensure the requirements are up to date with technology industry practices as well as other issues which may have transpired since the previous revision the ipcwhmaa620 standard covers issues such as electrostatic discharge protection  rework  repair preparation of wire stripping strand damage deformation etc  cleanliness solder crimping pulltest requirements of crimps hardware mounting overmolding among other critical processing operations all issues covered in the 620 standard are intended to provide the end user with a product which will fit their intended needs there are three classes mentioned in the 620 standard class 1 general electronic products that is toys noncritical items class 2 dedicated service electronic products that is uninterrupted service is desired but not critical class 3 high performance  harsh environment electronic products that is must function when required lifesaving devices military needs references  edit how are wire harnesses and wire
