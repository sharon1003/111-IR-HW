health general health care pain  pain management what doctor can prescribe the pill called methadone and that take a saginaw health plan coverage follow answers relevance rating newest oldest best answer both poster are wrong a doctor does need a special license to prescribe methadone for addiction but any doctor can prescribe it for pain if they are approved for prescribing narcotics httpwwwmedicalassistedtreatmentcom if it is for addiction then you can use the medical assisted treatment locator at httpdasis3samhsagov you will want to use the advanced option and check methadone maintenance and the insurance option to find one that takes your sort of insurance but if it is for pain then you will need to look under pain management in the phone book or call your provider also i am not sure why the previous poster doubts you would need pain management unless she assumes because she is a pain management patient she is somehow superior lol but she is not very knowledgeable about methadone because although it does have a long half life it has been researched and proven to not be harder to withdrawal from than heroin btw spelled heroin it just lasts longer which seems worse also patients on long term mmt are dependent not addicted there is a difference to methadone source s i am an rn bsn mmt advocate and patient httpwwwfindingnormalwebscomkphelps2012 · 9 years ago0 1 comment the answer from the previous poster needs to be corrected not all doctors can prescribe methadone they have to have a special license from the dea in order to prescribe it so it is not like you can just go to your family doctor and ask them for it they cant help you you need to see a pain management doctor if it is for pain which i doubt or you need to be seen in a methadone clinic if it is for addiction to opiates be advised that if you are going to use this to come off drugs it is harder to stop than pain pills or heroine it is a very addicting drug and it has a very long half life so it stays in your system for a long time and it also builds up with each dose you take if you are addicted to opiates you need to get checked into a rehab facility they will be able to monitor you while you are in withdrawals and will sometimes provide other medications to help with the symptoms such as anxiety and insomnia edit oh great and powerful rn who knows everything let me revise my answer i was incorrect about doctors being able to prescribe for pain management purposes but you were wrong about addiction treatment and maintenance programs this is directly from the deas website question can a practitioner prescribe methadone for the treatment of pain answer federal law and regulations do not restrict the prescribing dispensing or administering of any schedule ii iii iv or v narcotic medication including methadone for the treatment of pain if such treatment is deemed medically necessary by a practitioner acting in the usual course of professional practice confusion often arises due to regulatory restrictions concerning the use of methadone for the maintenance or detoxification of opioid addicted individuals in which case the practitioner is required to be registered with the dea as a narcotic treatment program ntp you can go to this link httpwwwdeadiversionusdojgovfaqge just so that you know i am right oh so sorry to have offended thee the great and powerful rn and btw its a little nit picky to correct spelling just because you think you are so awesome i missed it when editing my response source s pain management patient peaches the original · 9 years ago0 0 commentdoctor prescribe pill called methadone saginaw health plan coverage anonymous · 2 years ago0 0 comment one thing i am against hillary is the universal health care plan we have people who came from canada to live here because the universal health care in canada is horrible the biggest problem is months of waiting for an xray this is nerve reckoning especially if you already got a good health insurance if this implemented the companies you work for will refuse to contribute health insurance coverage because the company wants to save the money therefore you will be moved to the universal health care teresa · 2 years ago0 0 commentany doctor can prescribe it but they need to know why you need it call your doc and see if he can get you into a pain clinic  if it is for pain or into a rehab facility  if it is for drug abuse treatment they might not be able to tell you whether your insurance will cover it if you are in saginaw mi call covenent and ask them if they know of any pain clinics rehab facilities good luck source s rnangelwings · 9 years ago1 1 comment maybe you would like to learn more about one of these want to build a free website psoriatic arthritis symptoms best home security system look for an accident attorney
