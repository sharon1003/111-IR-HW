ligandgated ion channels kenneth r tovar gary l westbrook in cell physiology source book fourth edition 2012isummary ligandgated ion channelsare membrane proteins that are fundamental signaling molecules in neurons these molecules are localized in the plasmalemma and on intracellular organelles and can be gated by both intracellular and extracellular ligands the neurotransmittergated ion channels discussed in this chapter mediate fast excitation and inhibition in the nervous system and have now been well characterized by physiological and molecular studies studies using the technique of voltage and patchclamp recording have examined the three basic features of an ion channel gating conductance and selective permeability in general ligandgated ion channels can be described by kinetic models involving binding of two or more ligand molecules that induce a conformational change in the protein as a result a central waterfilled pore opens and conducts ions at very high rates of up to 10 7 ions per second channel activity is terminated when the channel closes or when it enters a nonconducting desensitized state in vertebrates acetylcholine ach and glutamate receptors are cation channels whereas γaminobutyric acid gaba and glycine receptors are anion channels the ach gaba and glycine receptors constitute the cysloop receptor superfamily that presumably evolved from a common ancestral gene glutamate receptors comprise a separate protein family the ligandbinding domain of glutamate channels shares homology with bacterial amino acid binding proteins whereas the pore shares homology with the pore of voltagedependent ion channels each of the neurotransmittergated channels appears to be comprised of a heterooligomeric complex of closely related subunits surrounding a central ion pore for each receptor type there are a number of possible subunit combinations that can form functional channels ach r subunits have four transmembrane domains with the second transmembrane domain lining the pore charged amino acid residues near the mouth of the pore are important in determining the selectivity and conductance of the individual channel types the glutamate subunits have three transmembrane domains and a reentrant loop domain that forms a portion of the pore the recent availability of crystal structures of a homomeric cysloop receptor and a glutamate receptor will allow atomic level resolution of the conformational movements involved in binding and gating of these channels read full chapter receptor types and subtypes mary a pacheco in x pharm the

passage of na  k  ca  or cl − once the receptorchannel complex is activated the membrane potential may become depolarized or hyperpolarized depending on the direction of the ion flow and the ion involved typically each subunit contains 4 hydrophobic transmembrane domains linked by hydrophilic groups activation of these channels leads to a rapid msec response allowing ions to flow down their

membranes andreas draguhn kristin hartmann in advances in molecular and cell biology 2006ionotropic gaba receptors are essentially ligand‐gated cl − channels they are clustered at postsynaptic membranes underneath the respective release sites of gabaergic neurons but are also abundant at extrasynaptic locations in this chapter we will first summarize the postsynaptic effects of activation of these channels we will then consider gabaergic signaling in a broader context of synaptic transmission taking into account all major molecular and cellular constituents of a gabaergicglycinergic synapse specific attention will be devoted to receptor modulation heterogeneity and its possible implications for the development of highly specific drugs most of the principles of gabaergic synaptic

201020643ligandgated or receptoroperated ion channels ligandgated or receptoroperated ion channels are a special classification of activityassociated receptors in this case instead of activating an enzyme activity upon ligand binding ligand binding regulates the activity of the ion channel thus the relationship is similar to the enzymelinked receptors and will be discussed in this section several examples of ligandgated ion channels include receptors for several neurotransmitters – nicotinic cholinergic receptor γaminobutyric acid a gaba and receptors for glutamate aspartate and glycine the general organization of these receptors is that they are composed of multisubunits each subunit spans the plasma membrane multiple times association of the subunits forms the pore or channel and changes in conformation of the subunits upon ligand binding regulates opening and closing of the channels depending on the specific receptor ligand binding may occur only on a subunit that appears once in the overall structure eg sulfonylurea receptor or multiple ligand binding subunits may be present eg the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ligandgated channels may also be regulated by protein phosphorylation of the channel subunits subsequent to signaling through other receptors  sheng and pak 2000  read full chapter presynaptic receptor signaling m casado p ascher in encyclopedia of neuroscience 2009cooperation between ionotropic and metabotropic receptors ionotropic and metabotropic receptors may operate in succession in one interesting case studied by kerchner and colleagues presynaptic kainate receptors facilitate gaba and glycine release in a transient manner by an ionotropic mechanism which requires na entry and activation of voltagedependent ca channels gaba then activates presynaptic gaba b metabotropic receptors which inhibit the release of gaba and glycine a biphasic effect is observed if kainate is applied exogenously but in physiological conditions the longlasting process is inhibition due to the homosynaptic metabotropic gaba b receptors ionotropic and metabotropic presynaptic receptors may operate synchronously as has been observed in the study of the longterm depression of the excitatory synapses between pyramidal cells in the l5 layer of the cerebral cortex this depression was found to depend on the simultaneous activation of cannabinoid receptors and glutamate nmda receptors in the model proposed by sjöstrom and colleagues release of glutamate by the presynaptic neuron depolarizes the postsynaptic neuron this triggers postsynaptic ca entry which induces the production of endocannabinoids the cannabinoids diffuse in the retrograde direction and activate presynaptic cb1 receptors at the same time the glutamate released by the presynaptic terminal activates presynaptic nmda receptors autoreceptors this coincident activation triggers a longlasting depression of glutamate release read full chapter ionic fluxes and genesis of the cardiac action potential yanggan wang 1  joseph a hill 3 in muscle 2012ligandgated channels ligandgated channels are a group of ion channels that are opened or closed in response to the binding of a chemical messenger ligand ligands can bind extracellularly eg glutamate ach and gaba or intracellularly eg ca 2 on ca 2 activated potassium channels ligand binding triggers a drastic change in the permeability of the channel to a specific ion or ions however the ligand itself is not the substance that is transported when the channel opens these channels play important roles in signal transduction in both neurons and cardiomyocytes in neural cells there are three superfamilies of extracellularly activated ligandgated ion channel subunits the receptors of the cysloop superfamily nicotinic receptors 5ht3 receptors gabaa and gabac receptors glycine receptors and some glutamate histamine and serotoninactivated anionic channels the atpgated channels atp2x receptors and the glutamateactivated cationic channels nmda receptors ampa receptors kainate receptors etc major ligandgated channels in cardiomyocytes include the adenosine5′triphosphate atpsensitive k  channel i katp  acetylcholineactivated k  channels i kach  ca 2 activated potassium and ca 2 activated chloride channels and ryanodine receptors there is yet another type of ion channel that can be regulated by both

channels control synaptic transmission between two neurons or between a neuron and a muscle one subfamily encompasses the cysloop channels so named because of a large extracellular domain containing cys loops 910 members of this family include the channels that bind acetylcholine the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor gaba the gaba a receptor the 5ht3 receptor and glycine receptors five subunits assemble to form the functional pentameric channel most are composed of two alpha subunits and three other subunits beta gamma or delta but some consist of five alpha subunits each subunit contains a large aminoterminal extracellular domain with a characteristic disulfide bond formed by a pair of cysteine residues the cys loop and a transmembrane region formed by four helical segments m1–m4 the channel pore is formed primarily by one of the helical segments m4 from two of the subunits the orthosteric ligand binding site is formed by the extracellular domain at the interface between subunits another class of ligandgated channel encompasses the tetrameric receptors for glutamate 11 glutamate is the major neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain and is largely responsible for excitatory synaptic transmission the ionotropic glutamate receptor has three major structural domains a large aminoterminal extracellular domain atd an extracellular ligand binding domain lbd and a transmembrane region consisting of two helical segments per subunit binding of glutamate causes the “clamshell” like lbd to close resulting in opening of the pore several subtypes of ionotropic glutamate receptors exist and can be broadly segregated based on their pharmacological sensitivity to glutamatelike molecules such as nmda kainate and ampa as is typical for ion channel pharmacology the distinct profile of these synthetic agonists in neuronal preparations foreshadowed the molecular identification of the three subfamilies of ionotropic glutamate receptor yet another class of ligandgated channel is characterized by a trimeric subunit arrangement each subunit has a large extracellular loop and two transmembrane segments members of this family include the acidsensing ion channels asics that are gated by protons 1213 p2x channels which are gated by extracellular atp are another example 1415read full chapter gabaa receptor structure–function studies a reexamination in light of new

of the subunits that formed the receptors  grenningloh et al  1987 noda et al  1982 schofield et al  1987  this provided the impetus for a wide variety of structure–function studies designed to elucidate the structure of the receptors the conformational changes they undergo and the basis for agonist and drug specificity the field is now in the dawn of a new era where highresolution structures can guide future experiments in the past 2 years the structures of a snail acetylcholine binding protein ach bp by xray crystallography at 27 å resolution and the whole torpedo ach receptor

channelreceptors were mentioned in section 33 as ion channels coupled with ligand binding domains in the extracellular domain of the receptor the structure is usually an oligomeric assembly of subunits surrounded by a central pore 14 these receptors are usually implicated where neurotransmitters such as ach and gamma aminobutyric acid act for example the nicotinic ach receptor has a significant role in cholinergic transmission in the central and peripheral nervous system upon the binding of ach to its binding sites the channel becomes permeable to sodium and potassium ions with a net influx of sodium causing depolarization which leads to an electrical excitatory effect 21 in contrast to the nicotinic ach receptors the gamma aminobutyric acid receptors in the central nervous system elicit inhibitory effects on nerve transmission upon the binding of the neurotransmitter to the receptor the ion channel becomes permeable to chloride ions the net influx of these ions causes hyperpolarization which leads to the inhibitory effects on nerve transmission 22 read full chapter planar lipid bilayers blms and their applications i r peterson j a beddow in membrane science and technology 200343occluding channels ligandgated channels for example neuroreceptors tend to open on ligand binding however it is much easier to arrange for the blockage of the channel when for example the ligand binds to a site located inside the channel itself because of the vastly simpler synthetic task involved there have been many attempts to achieve this eg 46 as explained in section 23 this principle is not expected to lead to high dynamic range because as is illustrated in figure 1 the open state of a channel always has a much higher level of noise than the closed state however there is an alternative mode of operation of an occluding channel demonstrated by both bayley and winterhalter rather than looking at the average membrane current its statistics as a function of time are analyzed there are advantages in observing just a single channel in principle such a stochastic sensor has the exciting potential to provide information about a wide range of analyte molecules present in the test liquid 57 in the form of a ‘spectrum’ in much the same way as chromatography stochastic sensing has been proposed as a powerful technique for dna and rna sequencing 58 bayley and coworkers use mainly genetically engineered variants of αhemolysin the toxin excreted by staphyloccus because of the ßbarrel construction of its channel αhemolysin is even more robust than gramicidin in spite of the inherent reliance of stochastic sensing on the ability to detect and analyze individual molecular events the diffusion resistance imposes a design constraint on the response time at low analyte concentrations a typical diffusion constant for a biomolecule in water is 1e10 m 2 s −1 for albumins of molecular weight 20 k da 59 putting a 1 nm and j 1 s −1 in equation 2 gives c 1e18 m −3  ie a concentration of 16 n m at this concentration a single receptor will be visited by analyte molecules once a second at picomolar concentrations the receptor is visited once an hour hence singlechannel stochastic sensing is unlikely to compete for the ultrahigh sensitivity possible with ligandgated channels of course in a biosensor with a large number n of receptors the first indication of analyte presence will be obtained n times sooner the sensitivity limitations of the use of a single channel could be reduced by the use of large multiplexed arrays of nanofabricated occluding channel cells monitored in real time by a computer and this would be a feasible and attractive way of exploiting the capabilities of modern nanofabrication techniques read full chapter
