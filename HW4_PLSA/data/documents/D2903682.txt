energy activity intensity and exposure different radioactive materials and xray generators produce radiation at different energy levels and at different rates it is important to understand the terms used to describe the energy and intensity of the radiation the four terms used most for this purpose are energy activity intensity and exposure radiation energy as mentioned previously the energy of the radiation is responsible for its ability to penetrate matter higher energy radiation can penetrate more and higher density matter than low energy radiation the energy of ionizing radiation is measured in electronvolts e v one electronvolt is an extremely small amount of energy so it is common to use kiloelectronvolts ke v and megaelectronvolt me v an electronvolt is a measure of energy which is different from a volt which is a measure of the electrical potential between two positions specifically an electronvolt is the kinetic energy gained by an electron passing through a potential difference of one volt xray generators have a control to adjust the ke v or the k v the energy of a radioisotope is a characteristic of the atomic structure of the material consider for example iridium192 and cobalt60 which are two of the more common industrial gamma ray sources these isotopes emit radiation in two or three discreet wavelengths cobalt60 will emit 133 and 117 me v gamma rays and iridium192 will emit 031 047 and 060 me v gamma rays it can be seen from these values that the energy of radiation coming from co60 is about twice the energy of the radiation coming from the ir192 from a radiation safety point of view this difference in energy is important because the co60 has more material penetrating power and therefore is more dangerous and requires more shielding activity the strength of a radioactive source is called its activity which is defined as the rate at which the isotope decays specifically it is the number of atoms that decay and emit radiation in one second radioactivity may be thought of as the volume of radiation produced in a given amount of time it is similar to the current control on a xray generator the international system si unit for activity is the becquerel bq which is that quantity of radioactive material in which one atom transforms per second the becquerel is a small unit in practical situations radioactivity is often quantified in kilobecqerels k bq or megabecquerels mbq the curie ci is also commonly used as the unit for activity of a particular source material the curie is a quantity of radioactive material in which 37 x 10 10 atoms disintegrate per second this is approximately the amount of radioactivity emitted by one gram 1 g of radium 226 one curie equals approximately 37037 mbq new sources of cobalt will have an activity of 20 to over 100 curies and new sources of iridium will have an activity of similar amounts once a radioactive nucleus decays it is no longer possible for it to emit the same radiation again therefore the activity of radioactive sources decrease with time and the activity of a given amount of radioactive material does not depend upon the mass of material present additionally two onecurie sources of cs137 might have very different masses depending upon the relative proportion of nonradioactive atoms present in each source the concentration of radioactivity or the relationship between the mass of radioactive material and the activity is called the specific activity specific activity is expressed as the number of curies or becquerels per unit mass or volume the higher the specific activity of a material the smaller the physical size of the source is likely to be intensity radiation intensity is the amount of energy passing through a given area that is perpendicular to the direction of radiation travel in a given unit of time the intensity of an xray or gammaray source can easily be measured with the right detector since it is difficult to measure the strength of a radioactive source based on its activity which is the number of atoms that decay and emit radiation in one second the strength of a source is often referred to in terms of its intensity measuring the intensity of a source is sampling the number of photons emitted from the source in some particular time period which is directly related to the number of disintegrations in the same time period the activity exposure one way to measure the intensity of xrays or gamma rays is to measure the amount of ionization they cause in air the amount of ionization in air produced by the radiation is called the exposure exposure is expressed in terms of a scientific unit called a roentgen r or r the unit roentgen is equal to the amount of radiation that produces in one cubic centimeter of dry air at 0Â°c and standard atmospheric pressure ionization of either sign equal to one electrostatic unit of charge most portable radiation detection safety devices used by a radiographer measure exposure and present the reading in terms of roentgens or roentgenshour which is known as the dose rate
