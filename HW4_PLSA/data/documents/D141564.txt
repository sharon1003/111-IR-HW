the package is what encapsulates the integrated circuit die and splays it out into a device we can more easily connect to each outer connection on the die is connected via a tiny piece of gold wire to a pad or pin on the package pins are the silver extruding terminals on an ic which go on to connect to other parts of a circuit these are of utmost importance to us because they’re what will go on to connect to the rest of the components and wires in a circuit there are many different types of packages each of which has unique dimensions mountingtypes andor pincounts polarity marking and pin numbering all ics are polarized and every pin is unique in terms of both location and function this means the package has to have some way to convey which pin is which most ics will use either a notch or a dot to indicate which pin is the first pin sometimes both sometimes one or the other once you know where the first pin is the remaining pin numbers increase sequentially as you move counterclockwise around the chip mounting style one of the main distinguishing package type characteristics is the way they mount to a circuit board all packages fall into one of two mounting types throughhole pth or surfacemount smd or smt throughhole packages are generally bigger and much easier to work with they’re designed to be stuck through one side of a board and soldered to the other side surfacemount packages range in size from small to minuscule they are all designed to sit on one side of a circuit board and be soldered to the surface the pins of a smd package either extrude out the side perpendicular to the chip or are sometimes arranged in a matrix on the bottom of the chip ics in this form factor are not very “handassemblyfriendly” they usually require special tools to aid in the process dip dual inline packagesdip short for dual inline package is the most common throughhole ic package you’ll encounter these little chips have two parallel rows of pins extending perpendicularly out of a rectangular black plastic housing the 28pin atmega328 is one of the more popular dippackaged microcontrollers thanks arduino each of the pins on a dip ic are spaced by 01 254mm which is a standard spacing and perfect for fitting into breadboards and other prototyping boards the overall dimensions of a dip package depend on its pin count which may be anywhere from four to 64 the area between each row of pins is perfectly spaced to allow dip ics to straddle the center area of a breadboard this provides each of the pins its own row in the board and it makes sure they don’t short to each other aside from being used in breadboards dip ics can also be soldered into pcbs they’re inserted into one side of the board and soldered into place on the other side sometimes instead of soldering directly to the ic it’s a good idea to socket the chip using sockets allows for a dip ic to be removed and swapped out if it happens to “let its blue smoke out”a regular dip socket top and a zif socket with and without an ic surfacemount smdsmt packages there is a huge variety of surfacemount package types these days in order to work with surfacemount packaged ics you usually need a custom printed circuit board  pcb made for them which has a matching pattern of copper on which they’re soldered here are a few of the more common smd package types out there ranging in handsolderability from “doable” to “doable but only with special tools” to “doable only with very special usually automated tools” smalloutline sopsmalloutline ic soic packages are the surfacemount cousin of the dip it’s what you’d get if you bent all the pins on a dip outward and shrunk it down to size with a steady hand and a close eye these packages are among the easiest smd parts to hand solder on soic packages each pin is usually spaced by about 005 127mm from the next the ssop shrink smalloutline package is an even smaller version of soic packages other similar ic packages include tsop thin smalloutline package and tssop thinshrink smalloutline package a 16channel multiplexer  cd74hc4067 in a 24pin ssop package mounted on a board in the middle quarter added for sizecomparison a lot of the more simple singletaskoriented ics like the max232 or multiplexers come in soic or ssop forms quad flat packages splaying ic pins out in all four directions gets you something that might look like a quad flat package qfp qfp ics might have anywhere from eight pins per side 32 total to upwards of seventy 300 total the pins on a qfp ic are usually spaced by anywhere from 04mm to 1mm smaller variants of the standard qfp package include thin tqfp very thin vqfp and lowprofile lqfp packages the atmega32u4 in a 44pin 11 on each side tqfp package if you sanded the legs off a qfp ic you get something that might look like a quadflat noleads qfn package the connections on qfn packages are tiny exposed pads on the bottom corner edges of the ic sometimes they wrap around and are exposed on both the side and bottom other packages only expose the pad on the bottom of the chip the multitalented mpu6050 imu sensor comes in a relatively tiny qfn package with 24 total pins hiding on the bottom edge of the ic thin tqfn very thin vqfn and microlead mlf packages are smaller variations of the standard qfn package there are even dual nolead dfn and thindual nolead tdfn packages which have pins on just two of the sides many microprocessors sensors and other modern ics come in qfp or qfn packages the popular atmega328 microcontroller is offered in both a tqfp package and a qfntype mlf form while a tiny accelerometer  gyroscope like the mpu6050 comes in a miniscule qfn form ball grid arrays finally for really advanced ics there are ball grid array bga packages these are amazingly intricate little packages where little balls of solder are arranged in a 2d grid on the bottom of the ic sometimes the solder balls are attached directly to the diebga packages are usually reserved for advanced microprocessors like those on the pc duino or raspberry pi if you can hand solder a bgapackaged ic consider yourself a master solderer usually to put these packages onto a pcb
