pets cats how much cold can my cat tolerate i dont like to think of him being out all night in the winter 1 following 9 answers answers relevance rating newest oldest best answer im in mourning right nowmy precious black and white long haired kitty oreo died from exposure to the elements both of my landlords forced my cat out the door i finally entrusted him to someone on yahoo who also threw him out claiming he didnt get along with her 2 cats so poor little oreo died i just found out he was the most beautiful thing that ever happened to me we had been thru thick and thin with fleas and nasty landlords the vet made me choose between the leukemia test or a flea dip and since i lost all of my savings in the stock market i couldnt give him a flea dip in a matter of 3 weeks he was almost consumed by these disgusting creatures i finally nursed him back to health and waged a war against these fleas which also destroyed my living room no one told me that all i needed was some diatomaceous earth and a good vacuum cleaner i couldve saved us all so much grief well at least i fed him the best food i could afford fancy feast it was his favorite please please do not entrust your cat to strangers who wont love them as much as their own also isnt there any legislation against landlords i try to leave dry food out for the stray cats in my backyard during this winter storm hopefully theyll pull thru i havent heard them at all todaysad maybe they died last night from this terrible stormcold please if you see a stray kitten just use a laser to guide it to a can of tuna then bring them home i read that euthanized cats and dogs end up in rendered feed for poultry and cattle etc so please try not to put your kitty to sleep also lots of kittens are crushed to death

cave a hollow somewhere under the porch etc when i was a child we took our cat on vacation to upper michigan and the cat ran away when we stopped to visit a friend of dads up there wouldnt come back so the guy said hed look out for the cat and try to catch it he was never able to catch the cat but would see it from time to time peeking out from the trees and brush and it gets real cold and snowy up there the guy said the cat got real furry every winter and seemed to be doing quite well for itself hed put out a bowl of water and food for the cat every day but he never saw the cat that close to the house ever so he couldnt tell if the cat was eating that stuff the cat lived wild out there for 5 years before the guy no longer saw the cat if you cant bring him inside try to give him a dry sheltered place a little dog house or box thats off the ground with straw or some sort of cushy pillows or something where he can go to get out of the wind and dampif you only have a catsize hole in it then the cat can go inside and his own body heat will help warm up the space leave out food and water probably will need to change the water several times a day as it begins to freeze over so he has enough food inundated in sf · 8 years ago1 0 comment in the part of the country central canada i live in the temperatures hovers around zero farenheit from november to may and then we have the cold spells where the temperature dips into the minus 30s for days on end unless we are in blizzard conditions my cats leave the house every morning and seldom return before dark they are not forced out  we merely open the door and if they wish to stay in they do and there is someone here all day if they wish to come in they rarely do there is a colony of feral cats across the road from my residence i doubt that any of them have ever been in a heated building fact  cats are a lot more robust and hardy than most people give them credit for0ne trl ck p0ny · 8 years ago1 0 commenti would not worry about it too much cats have a naturally higher basal temperature than humans between 3839 compared to our 37 degrees so they can withstand the cold far better plus the coats are made up of three layers the undercoat is a lot thick than the outer coat you see so it helps to keep the cold away from their skin also cats are very clever adaptable creatures if they do feel cold when outside they will find a nice spot to curl up in to keep out of the cold and stay warmer the only worry i would have is if they were still a kitten which i am assuming as you let him out now he is not source

years ago2 0 comment my late cat in the picture used to belong to another member of the family who kicked him out all night he crawled into her car engine to keep warm then when the engine was started his leg was caught in the fan belt and got broken he was lucky they got it treated and his leg was plastered by the time we took him off her hands he was fixed and led a happy life could have been very different though we never chucked him out at night  he either had a cat flap or in finland when that was not practical he was shut in all night and only let out during the day anyway there are many dangers for cats at night  foxes cars even wolves  lynxes in finland you should not let a cat out at night if you care about them anonymous · 8 years ago0 0 comment if the weather is freezing
