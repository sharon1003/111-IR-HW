ghost adventures ghost stories the paranormal ghosts supernatural phenomena how was ghost adventures exposed as a fake show14 answers elizabeth martinez writer 1997presentanswered nov 29 2017 · author has 506 answers and 3863k answer views here are 5 good reasons to suggest that ghost adventures might indeed be like many reality shows just a scripted specter and not the real thing5 “poveglia island” episode”so much was going on here for zak that they make it into a special adding additional footage for dramatic effect zak is said to be possessed which causes him to get angry and lash out at aaron whether zak was really possessed or is just using the excuse to vent no one knows this was one of the first episodes where zak’s really bad over acting put a question mark in viewer’s minds4 hearing voices oftentimes viewers have to stretch their imagination when some noises are picked up on the voice recorders or evp meters it sounds like mushy static but the show scrambles it into a word or phrase and then repeats it three times with a caption so before long the translation starts to make sense the ga team and producers know how to build a dramatic plotline where the suggestion of hearing a voice from the other side seems possible3 polished with time during the first season the ga team bragged that they weren’t followed around by a big camera crew it was just three guys going on a ghost hunt now it’s an obviously bigger production and the action runs like clockwork pieces to fit the plot zak’s personality became less likable and more like the selfimportant blowhard you’d avoid at a party2 provoking the ghosts most paranormal experts will agree that you don’t get spirits to show themselves by picking a fight in several episodes the team did a “triple dog dare you” to the ghostly inhabitants with poor results when not picking a fight some of the questions called out by the team are just inane it turns comical pretty fast this baiting seemed more like showboating than investigating1 aaron spilled all in an empire news article aaron goodwin said that the producers at the travel channel have messed with the ghost adventures team’s authenticity with the crew recording some of the evps heard on the show and coaching reactions the stars were even made to go back and recreate scenes for a better “take” the show runners deny his claims and fired him note every supposed evp captured they swore that the spirit was some how evil and giving them well more or less zak some sort of message zak believed that the spirits always called him to a location spirits dont collectively or singularly talk to one person and direct them to as many locations as zak claims also why is it that zak would always send other people into investigate areas and he refused to go into himself or had to have others go with him also how come if he went in a room and he heard a noise hed automatically scream for someone to “come in here” because he was too afraid as far as helping people zak promises people hes going to get rid of spirits from locations because the spirits are evil yet all he does is antagonize the spirits if there are any at a location tell the spirits to leave and then he leaves telling a spirit heshe is evil because you say so is only going to p o the spirit it doesnt make it go anywhere thats not how that worksthe show just gave real ghost hunters a bad taste in their mouths185k views · view upvoters · answer requested by john ogorzalek related questions more answers below why did ghost adventures get cancelled what is it like to

kimberly mc george i was born with natural abilities and worked in paranormal for years answered mar 13 2016 · author has 11k answers and 21m answer views i think there were non disclosures that were signed when contracts were negotiated or nick was bought out that is why there has been no public proof the people who could prove there are aspects that were a fraud could lose everything if they talked heres an incident with aaron ‘ghost adventures’ star gets fired reveals disappointing truth about paranormal television series i work within and close to the paranormal field definitely there was a disagreement of opinion about featuring real noises and going with it as paranormal as my sources have said the team was asked to do zac had no problem with it and many other cast members and production crew did not as well some of the production crew and stars nick did and that is why nick went on to do his own thing it was originally nicks idea and nicks show he brought zac and aaron in i believe he talks about all of that in his auto biography i know people that know all these guys very well and some people who worked on the set my ex boyfriend grew up with zac and told sooo many interesting stories who knows if they were all true but still interesting as you can imagine just because they expose fakery does not eliminate the possibility that they are also faking much of it i worked as the psychic for a paranormal team that was on zacs reality show he did it was a total joke you cannot have a sterile environment in any paranormal investigation no matter how hard you try often evps are proved to be actual conversations of team members pretty funny i have done countless investigations with many well known paranormal groups they all have corrupted evidence agreed this does not mean that evidence that is genuine cannot be caught on camera but why do you think the paranormal performs on cue understand there is a lot of pressure to get evidence and make it exciting while they are doing it the show will be canceled if they dont due to lack of viewers most investigations take hours and days to really catch something and they are extremely boring or maybe im just add or both also i can see and hear energy as well as sense it and it is still super boring for me even with tech there are hours where there is nothing to be recorded or videoed i love the person who said all reality shows are really fake because the second you turn the camera on something or someonetheir behavior changes its an interesting discussion and great question i read this on a great conversation chain on reddit jack shid said so what youre saying is that every single location ghost adventures goes to provides multiple evp video and photo evidence and zak gets possessed and you believe that this is an accurate representation of what real paranormal research is hmmmm i thought this had some great points just because you are a fan and you believe doesnt mean what you believe is truth while not ghost adventures this is one of many interesting videos you can watch for yourself regarding fake evidence1311k views · view upvoters your response is private is this answer still

so far back in my head i almost hurt myself thats    not how it works ive met with scientists who do actual scientific investigations and not one of them takes shows like ghost adventures seriously theyve been approached because the producers were hoping to give their show some legitimacy but the non disclosure agreements are ridiculous and all of them turned their offers down its entertainment if that kind of activity were real there would be no doubt about ghosts one of the main differences is that a real investigator will never claim to have experienced a ghost they record what they experience and then investigate and record their attempt to see if it can be explained by ordinary means they dont say a ghost made a knocking sound instead they would say a loud knocking sound was heard at 1123pm it sounded like wood on wood it seemed to be coming from the kitchen so i investigated to see what might have made the sound but no one was in that area of the house at that time and nothing was out of place they have two cats but they were in the spare bedroom asleep and thats it the detailed account is necessary in case new facts come to light that could explain the sound boring

· author has 882 answers and 6582k answer views i believe jeanne barkemeijer de wit here has mentioned the specific public rumor which spread about the tv show ghost adventures however there is a deeper truth that is missed regarding these shows which is more far important to understand regarding all reality television productions including ghost adventures looking at it from inside the business theres no such thing as a reality show all television productions are under pressure to produce a show and one that appeals to the audience producers spending millions on production leave nothing to chance especially with questionable topics such as ghost hunting storage unit purchasing pawn shop business and so on where there is no guarantee of good results if left to chance a script is made for each and every episode to ensure results and the bumps flying bricks and ghostly voices are all manufactured to build a story to script every tv show is a business demanding return on investment period looking at it rationally from the outside without debating the question and reality of the paranormal what are the odds of finding numerous ghostly events each and every time for every tv episode when in the real world very little if anything paranormal ever happens ive been on various ghost hunts where nothing special ever happened people photographed dust and their breath in the air claiming orbs and mists using consumer pocket cameras while my professional camera equipment captured nothing in the very same places why do tv shows have so much success when the public has little or none makes you think ghost hunting requires very little skill and theres not a degree one can earn to become professional this is not to say that the paranormal doesnt exist or that it cant be captured on film or video i dont know either way i merely havent seen anything compelling and that which would withstand scientific scrutiny definitely not on any television series – theyre in the business of making a show not in finding scientific proof for the afterlife608k views · view upvoters daniel hertz answered jan 28 2017“ghost adventures” the popular travel channel paranormal reality show involving three ed hardyclad ghost hunters is being haunted by allegations the show plays loose with the facts and emphasizes showmanship over hardcore research 1and yes paranormal experts claim that they employ science and scholarly research in their investigations of unexplained phenomena the accusations come from bonnie vent a selfproclaimed “spirit advocate” in san diego who claims shows like “ghost adventures” “ghost hunters” and “fact or fake” sensationalize the supernatural in order to scare up ratings“due to the format they have to be augmented to make them more interesting” she told huff post weird news adding that “lockdowns” where “ghost adventures” stars zak bagans nick groff and aaron goodwin get locked inside a faciliity at midnight in order to investigate “are good television but not necessary”this doesn’t set well with vent who claims that as a “spirit advocate” it’s her job to help dead celebs like michael jackson george carlin and “crocodile hunter” star steve irwin by delivering messages to their loved ones from beyond the grave she says that the crew behind “ghost adventures” doesn’t research the places being investigated as thoroughly as they claim to recently she says she discovered that firsthand when the crew came to her hometown to investigate the cosmopolitan hotel and restaurant a reportedly haunted san diego hot spot for paranormal activity while in town bagans groff and goodwin did an interview with huff post weird news in which they discussed the pending investigation of the cosmopolitan the investigation will air sometime during the show’s fifth season which premieres sept 23 during the interview bagans and groff said one anecdote they discovered during their research led them to believe the hotel was haunted by native american spirits“there is a certain energy that is trapped in this location and one lady was partially possessed i guess and started doing an indian ritual dance” groff said“yes” bagans adds “this lady went downstairs to one of the other rooms we’re going to be investigating and she started doing this indian dance”vent says she knows that story is inaccurate because she is the woman who did the dance“in no way was i possessed” she insisted on her website “the dance was an old fashioned mexican tarantella not an indian ritual dance i did get into the flow of the energy in the wine room which is located in the original bandini house and i did perform a dance that i had no knowledge of for several minutes”another bit of research that vent says was incorrect was the “ghost adventures” cast’s claim that the room in which the interview took place was where juan lorenzo bandini a san diego pioneer who built the house in 1827 slept for many years that room was on the second floor of the building which it turns out wasn’t built until years after bandini died in addition hotel owner joe melluso — who emphasizes he was thrilled to host the cast and crew — says bagans groff and goodwin got a couple other big facts wrong during the interview with huff post weird news bagans mentioned that a spanishspeaking guitar player named carlos had told him that bandini murdered his wife and buried her where the restaurant is now in the original story hotel coowner catherine miller said she was unaware of this allegation melluso said he spoke with carlos after the story was printed and the guitar player said his words were misinterpreted“but after hearing how he explained it i can see how the confusion happened” melluso said he also says the crew misinterpreted a wood headboard of a little girl and a mirror featuring a woman’s face carved in wood as being bandini family heirlooms“the faces don’t represent anyone related to the cosmopolitan’s original owners” he said footnotes 1

it simply flew out of his hand understand zak and his team are in pitch darkness and can only see whats going on around them via the screen of their camera they also have cameras set up around them and cameramen following them so any fakery would be easily caught on camera which was the case during the episode im speaking of the guest was called out by zak and the fakery exposed483k views · view

for a couple seasons zak has worked hard to build a credible reputation as well as ruined his health this is a show that begs for skepticism but is way better than ghost hunters which fails in every category the only show that i would give the same amount of credit to as ghost adventures was probably paranormal state that used to be on ae we tend to forget that when doing the show its not their first time at many locations and its not always gonna have optimal results but we dont want to watch or the have attention spans to watch nothing happen the truth of the matter is that most reality

their technology is made by bill chapell and its a lot of technological wishwash for instance their ovilus 3 devices  ovilus iii  the evolution of a scam  if you read up on this device you will find out some key things such as the fact that unlike the previous ovilus x you dont have to hook it up to your computer to program in words youre expecting to hear before you head out for your everyday paranormal investigation with ovilus 3 it comes complete with built in set of vauge words which when using its q  a mode  thats where you wait for the red light then ask your question and await a response at the time the device spits out a word you also seem to get an energy reading as to the strength that the spirit is sending you stopping right there for a minute and think about this it would not be too hard to create a fancy toy that allows you to ask it a question and have it spit out an arbritary response its like a a talking magic 8 ball you can interpret the response to suit your own investigation as opposed to being able to tailor suit the responses from the previous version some of their toys are this positive ion emitter thats supposedly not good for humans since it will affect their mental capacity as demonstrated in their second episode of the eleventh season a person who is knowingly going to experience feelings of confusion and euphoria is no doubt going to get rather weird its like having members of a csi investigation take a hallucinogenic before heading off to work while the cast might very well believe in what theyre doing its being completely tainted by the use of their gadgets built to provide some level of confirmation of those beliefs and modern day views of how ghosts should be as in communicate and move around to demonstrate what im
