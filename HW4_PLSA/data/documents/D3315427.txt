private lenders that offer student loan refinancing each with different potential interest rates loan terms and features u s news compared private lenders to come up with recommendations for different kinds of borrowers how student loan consolidation works when you consolidate your student loans you essentially combine multiple loans into one to facilitate the consolidation a lender will pay off your current loans and issue you a new loan for the total amount you owe student loans can come from either the federal government through the u s department of education or a private lender such as a bank credit union state agency or the educational institution your options for consolidation and the pros and cons of consolidation may vary depending on whether you have federal student loans private student loans or a combination of the two federal student loan consolidation the direct loan consolidation program is a free option available for federal student loans when you consolidate your federal loans the u s department of education issues a direct consolidation loan with a fixed interest rate that’s the weighted average rate of the loans you’re consolidating rounded up to the nearest oneeighth of a percent 0125 percent this type of consolidation won’t save you money on interest but it can make it easier to manage your loans with a single payment each month if you extend your loan terms you will have a lower monthly payment federal student loan consolidation doesn’t involve a credit check you may be able to lower your monthly payment and there could be other benefits such as being eligible for more repayment plans or forgiveness programs private student loan consolidation with private student loan consolidation a private lender repays your student loans which may include private and federal loans the lender issues a new loan based on your creditworthiness you may be able to save money and lower your monthly payment by refinancing your student loans with an interest rate reduction however when you refinance federal loans they’ll become private loans and will no longer be eligible for federal programs including incomedriven repayment plans and forgiveness programs while both options involve combining multiple loans into one private loan consolidation is generally referred to as refinancing this is because you’ll finance the new student loan based on a variety of factors including your income debts employment and credit by contrast federal loan consolidation won’t change how much interest accrues and eligibility doesn’t depend on your creditworthiness you don’t have to choose one or the other you can consolidate your federal student loans and refinance your private loans or consolidate some of your federal loans and refinance others or you may research your options and determine you shouldn’t use either advantages of student loan consolidation student loan consolidation both federal and private has many potential benefits federal student loan consolidation benefits single monthly payment combining multiple loans with different payment dates into one payment can make it easier to manage your monthly payments potentially lower monthly payments if you’re having trouble making minimum payments on your federal student loans consolidating your loans could help you qualify for an incomedriven repayment plan or a longer term of 10 to 30 years both of these options can lower your monthly payments however extending the term of your loan will increase the interest paid on the loan incomedriven repayment and forgiveness direct consolidation loans are eligible for several incomedriven repayment plans that you may not be eligible for with your original loans these repayment plans limit your monthly payment to 10 to 20 percent of your discretionary income depending on the repayment plan outstanding loan balances may also be forgiven after 20 to 25 years however you may be taxed on the forgiven amount renewed hardship options putting your loans into deferment or forbearance can provide temporary payment relief by delaying your required payments or reducing your monthly minimum payments however some federal loans can only be in forbearance for 12 months at a time and may have a cumulative limit of three years consolidating resets these limits as you’ll have a new direct consolidation loan loan forgiveness programs direct consolidation loans are eligible for federal loan forgiveness programs including public service loan forgiveness and teacher loan forgiveness if you are a teacher or work in public service you can have your loans forgiven if you meet certain criteria interest rate lock federal student loans may have a variable interest rate that rises or falls based on a benchmark which can change your monthly payment amount if you consolidate your loans you can lock in the current rate and a consistent monthly payment it can make it easier to plan since you’ll know your monthly payment won’t change and it can save you money if rates rise in the future however you could miss out on a lower rate if they fall after you’ve locked in your rate get out of default if you default on a federal student loan defined for most student loans as not making a payment for more than 270 days you have three options loan consolidation loan rehabilitation or repaying the loan in full if you don’t take any action you could start to accrue fees and you’ll no longer be eligible for additional federal student aid repayment programs or forbearance or deferment your wages could be garnished loan rehabilitation requires making nine monthly payments on time as low as 5 then your loan comes out of default and the default is removed from your credit reports however the late payments will remain on your credit report loan consolidation can quickly get your loan out of default and you can consolidate a single defaulted loan as long as it’s not already a direct consolidation loan however loan consolidation won’t remove the default or late payments from your credit reports private student loan consolidation benefits private and federal consolidation if you want to combine your federal and private student loans you’ll need to refinance them with a private lender save money with a lower interest rate or longer term you may be able to qualify for a lower interest rate than you currently have on either federal or private student loans particularly if you have a high credit score and low debttoincome ratio or dti lowering your interest rate could save you money and allow you to pay off your loans quicker alternatively you may be able to extend your repayment period and decrease your monthly payment however extending your repayment period could also result in paying more in interest over the lifetime of the loan if you have a consolidated loan with a 7325 balance and a 63 percent annual percentage rate left to repay over the next seven years this example shows how much you could save by refinancing with a fixedrate loan continue repaying over seven years at 63 percent refinance at 499 percent with a 10year term refinance at 499 percent with a fiveyear term estimated monthly payments 108 78 138change in monthly payments not applicable 30 less per month 30 more per month interest paid 1752 1994 967savings not applicable 242 more in interest 785 less in interest refinancing with a shorter term saves 786 but increases your the monthly payments by 30 refinancing with a longer 10year term lowers monthly payments by 30 but costs you 242 more in interest choose a fixed or variablerate loan many private lenders offer fixed and variablerate options variablerate loans tend to start with a lower interest rate than fixedrate loans which could save you money but the rate can change over time to a higher rate with a fixedrate loan you may start with a higher interest rate but it won’t change in the future release a cosigner undergraduate students often don’t have enough income or credit history to qualify for a private student loan on their own so they may have someone such as a parent cosign when refinancing you may be able to release the cosigner if you qualify for the new loan on your own move debt obligation some parents may take out parent plus loans for their children’s education with an agreement that the child will repay the loan after graduating but legally the debt belongs to the parents parents may be able to federally consolidate plus loans but the child can’t consolidate them with loans that are in the child’s name with private student loan refinancing you may be able to refinance parent plus loans into the child’s name moving the legal responsibility for the debt to the former student mark kantrowitz publisher and vice president of strategy for cappexcom a college application and scholarship search website says “you also dont lose as many benefits when refinancing a federal parent plus loan into a private loan since parent borrowers are not eligible for incomedriven repayment plans and public service loan forgiveness”disadvantages of student loan consolidation though there are benefits to student loan consolidation it’s important to keep drawbacks in mind drawbacks of federal consolidation private student loans aren’t eligible if you have private student loans you won’t be able to consolidate them into a direct consolidation loan could pay more in interest the average weighted interest rate of your loans is rounded up to the nearest 0125 percent so you could consolidate into an interest rate that is slightly higher if you lower your monthly payment by lengthening your loan term or changing repayment plans it will take longer and cost you more in interest to repay your loans loss of subsidized interest benefits federal perkins loans have subsidized interest so the government pays the interest that accrues on the loan while you’re in school at least half time kantrowitz says borrowers who have a perkins loan could lose the subsidized interest benefit if they consolidate it can’t strategize which loans to pay off first “federal loan consolidation prevents you from targeting the highestrate loan for quicker repayment” says kantrowitz if you make extra payments on the highestrate loans first you’ll pay less interest overall federal loan forgiveness progress could be reset if you’ve been making payments that are eligible for pslf or incomedriven repayment plan forgiveness those payments won’t count toward forgiveness after you consolidate the loans could lose forgiveness options if you consolidate a perkins loan you’ll lose the option to use its cancellation and discharge options fewer options if you default if your loans are in default consolidating them is one way to get them out however you can’t reconsolidate a direct consolidation loan unless you have another eligible loan to consolidate drawbacks of private student loan refinancing strict eligibility requirements refinancing student loans can be difficult compared with federal loan consolidation which doesn’t take your income debts or credit into account if you have bad credit are unemployed or have a high dti ratio you may not qualify for refinancing without a cosigner to take legal obligation for the loan if you’re unable to repay it if you do qualify you may not be eligible for a lower interest rate degree requirements you may need a degree from a school that’s accredited for title iv federal student aid programs to qualify for refinancing loss of federal loan benefits private lenders don’t offer the same federal repayment plans such as incomedriven options that can greatly decrease your monthly payment based on how much money you make private student loans aren’t eligible for federal forgiveness programs such as pslf “refinancing a federal loan into a private consolidation loan causes the borrower to lose the superior repayment benefits available on federal student loans” says kantrowitz once you turn your federal student loan into a private student loan you can’t reverse the process loss of discounts or rebates if you have any discounts rebates or other benefits with your federal or private student loans you may not receive the same perks from your new lender for example federal loans may offer an upfront interest rebate but you only keep it if you make your first 12 payments on time refinancing before that point would negate this benefit and the rebate amount will get added back to your loan principal before refinancing potentially shorter repayment periods private lenders generally offer repayment terms between five and 20 years while federal student loans may be eligible for a repayment period of up to 30 years potentially higher payments even if you qualify for a lower interest rate your monthly payments could increase if you decrease your payment term while this could save you money on interest it may also strain your budget fewer options if you have trouble making payments federal student loans have deferment and forbearance options but private lenders aren’t required to offer hardship options to borrowers when they do the options could be shorter than what’s available with federal student loans private loans will continue to accrue interest while they’re in forbearance or deferment faster default when you stop making payments on a federal student loan you generally default after 270 days you may default after missing just one payment on private student loans however you might be able to save the loan by catching up on your payments before the account is charged off generally four to six months after your missed payment before you apply for student loan consolidation before you apply for student loan consolidation you should consider eligibility and whether federal or private student loan consolidation is the right choice for your situation federal student loan eligibility it’s not difficult to qualify for federal student loan consolidation but you do have to meet certain criteria most but not all federal loans are eligible for the program here are some additional requirements you must have graduated left school or are taking a lessthanhalftime course load you have to consolidate at least one direct loan or federal family education loan the loans you consolidate must be in repayment or in a grace period you can reconsolidate a direct consolidation loan with a different eligible loan you may be able to reconsolidate a ffel consolidation loan with a different eligible loan or by agreeing to repay the new loan with an incomedriven repayment plan if you defaulted on a loan and want to consolidate it you must make three consecutive monthly payments on time and in full or agree to pay your direct consolidation loan with an incomedriven repayment plan if you have a judgment against you because of a defaulted loan you can only consolidate the loan if the judgment is vacated or the wage garnishment order is lifted private student loan refinancing eligibility specific eligibility can vary depending on the lender but many private student loan refinancers look at the following factors a good to excellent fico credit score of 670 or higher many lenders require a minimum credit score of between 650 and 680 to qualify for a loan however even if you qualify you may not get a lower interest rate than you already have on your loans regardless of your score your credit history is important lenders typically review your credit history for derogatory marks such as late payments and consider this information when reviewing your application and determining your interest rate employment requirements including minimum income and proof of stable income lenders often set a minimum income of between 24000 and 50000 per year your dti ratio which is your total monthly debt payments divided by your total monthly gross income can help lenders determine if you’ll be able to make your monthly loan payments a lower dti ratio is better as it indicates you have more room in your monthly budget most lenders don’t disclose their maximum dti for applicants but among those who do it’s between 20 and 50 percent lenders may only refinance your loans after you have completed your degree only accept certain degrees or only refinance private loans some lenders have different refinancing options for student loans that were taken out for specific types of degrees such as law school or medical school lenders may have state restrictions such as regional lenders and credit unions that only serve those in the same state if you can’t qualify for refinancing on your own you may be able to apply and get approved with a creditworthy cosigner comparison federal vs private

when considering consolidating or refinancing loans the results in the example demonstrate why this is important in several instances your monthly payment could be lower sometimes significantly lower but you will pay thousands of dollars more in interest however it’s important to compare more than just your monthly payment and interest rate to determine whether consolidation or refinancing might make sense for your situation when you can benefit from federal student loan consolidation borrowers who are in the following circumstances may be best off consolidating their loans with the federal program you’re having trouble making payments consolidating and increasing your loan’s term could lower your monthly payment it’s hard to manage your multiple loans consolidating could make managing your monthly payments easier by combining all your federal student loans into one new loan you don’t have a stable income whether you lost your job are only working part time or are underemployed if you don’t have a stable income you may want continued access to federal loan repayment plans deferment or forbearance you plan to work in a profession eligible for loan forgiveness if you have federal loans that aren’t eligible for a federal loan forgiveness program consolidating those loans could make them eligible however don’t consolidate loans that are already eligible if you’ve been making payments that count toward forgiveness as the counter on those loans will be reset you have a loan in default you may be able to consolidate the defaulted loan and bring it out of default when you can benefit from private student loan refinancing refinancing your student loans with a private lender could be a good idea if you qualify for better loan terms if you have good credit a stable income or other factors that lenders want to see you may qualify for a better interest rate that can decrease your monthly payment or the cost of the loan you want to combine your federal and private student loans you’ll have to refinance and consolidate your loans with a private lender if you want to combine private and federal loans you have a stable income refinancing federal student loans means you’ll no longer be eligible for an incomedriven repayment plan or federal hardship programs so refinancing is best suited for those with a stable income you want to release a cosigner if you want to release a cosigner you’ll need to qualify for refinancing on your own and use a lender that allows you to release the cosigner you don’t plan to use federal forgiveness options or alternative payment plans private loans aren’t eligible for federal loan programs before refinancing make sure you don’t want to use them or think you’ll need to use them in the future how to consolidate your loans some debt relief companies offer to consolidate your loans for a fee but this isn’t necessary “never pay a fee to consolidate your student loans” says kantrowitz “you can do it on your own for free at student

variablerate loans range from about 25 to 909 percent preapproval quote check option some lenders let you apply for preapproval to get rate quotes and estimated terms without hurting your credit loan and refinancing terms maximum loan amount most people won’t need to worry about the maximum loan amounts which can range from 60000 to 500000 in some cases there isn’t a maximum however this could be a concern for some borrowers with an exceptionally large amount of student loan debt minimum loan amount many refinancers require you refinance at least 5000 to 7000 although there could be a state requirement to have a higher minimum loan amount if you have a relatively small amount of student loan debt you may not be able to refinance it minimum loan period refinancers often have a minimum loan period of five to 15 years choosing a short period could increase your monthly payment but it’ll also get you out of debt sooner and you might wind up paying less in interest maximum loan period

some states advice for paying back your student loans repaying student loans can take years sometimes decades and you may want to strategize your approach consolidating your loans can make it easier to manage the payments and refinancing could speed up the process by lowering your interest rate and saving you money pay as much as you can afford if you have federal student loans you may be able to choose between different repayment plans such as one of the incomedriven plans “ when repaying student loans choose the repayment plan with the highest monthly payment you can afford” says kantrowitz “this will reduce the total interest paid over the life of the loan and lead to quicker repayment of the loans”the same principle can apply to private student loans as the repayment term you decide on when refinancing will impact your monthly payment make extra payments when you can if you can afford to make extra loan payments you should request the lender apply your payment toward the principal balance rather than count it as an early payment this way you’ll pay down the principal faster and accrue less interest unlike other types of loans which may have prepayment penalties it’s against the law for lenders to charge a penalty for prepaying student loans pay off the loan with the highest interest rate first if you haven’t consolidated all your loans review each loan’s terms and try to make extra payments on the one with the highest interest rate sign up for autopay many private lenders and federal loan servicers will give you a 025 percent interest rate discount if you use autopay however if you sign up you’ll want to keep an eye on the account you’re using to make your monthly payments if you don’t have enough money in your account the payment will be returned and you may incur a nonsufficient funds fee contact your lender if you have financial difficulty “ignoring the problem will not make it go away and may even make it worse” says kantrowitz if you’re having trouble with your monthly payments contacting your lender or loan servicer is a good first step there may be options such deferment forbearance or an alternative repayment plan that allow you to avoid a late payment which could hurt your credit claim tax deductions “up to 2500 a year in interest on federal and private student loans can be excluded from income on your federal income tax return” points out kantrowitz “you can claim this abovetheline deduction even if you dont itemize” whether you work with an accountant or do your own taxes be sure to claim this deduction if you’re eligible related
