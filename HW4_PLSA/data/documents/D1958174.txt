cities how supermarkets choose where to open … and where to close tesco’s decision on which stores to close says a lot about how supermarkets operate in cities why are supermarkets stacked two or three deep in some areas while other communities in the same city are neglected cities is supported by about this content ian wylie wed 11 feb 2015 0729 est1306 estthis article is over 3 years old243

to go back for another but i can’t the shop has closed their last act was to post a sign on the door that read “sadly we can no longer compete with waitrose and their free coffee”the waitrose in question – where everyone who holds a my waitrose card gets a cup of coffee – is a little waitrose one of the convenience outlets so many supermarkets are opening in cities across the uk five minutes’ walk away sainsbury’s plans to open one of its local convenience stores on an old cinema site between the two there’s a tesco metro head to the neighbouring ward of walker however which is home to 11000 people – more than jesmond – and you’ll find that the nearest big four supermarket is a halfhour walk away the two wards may lie within the same newcastle upon tyne east constituency but they have little else in common walker scores worst on the city council’s indices of multiple deprivation jesmond best and the supermarket distribution appears to reflect this split the pattern repeats throughout newcastle supermarkets stacked two or three deep in affluent or student areas while other areas of the same city are neglected this map of newcastle city centre highlights the lack of

tesco’s recent announcement that it will close 43 stores can tell us a lot about where supermarkets choose to operate in cities brutal competition from discounters aldi and lidl is making life very uncomfortable for the big british grocers – sainsbury’s has scrapped plans for new superstores while morrisons will shutter 10 lossmaking stores this year – but the tesco metro in jesmond which has a reputation among locals for being either the chain’s most expensive or most profitable store per sq ft which tesco will neither confirm nor deny is not one of the three northeast uk outlets being closed in april instead the axe is falling in less affluent bedlington hartlepool and whitley bay from kensington in liverpool to south tottenham in london tesco’s decision about where to close stores isn’t random – it’s a reminder that ultimately it is salespersquare foot not local community need that dictate where supermarket chains choose to locate they do this in a variety of ways all supermarkets have property teams who sift locations according a wide range of factors – population density footfall the proximity of train stations and schools they also use location analysis software like acorn produced by the retail consultant caci acorn segments households postcodes and neighbourhoods into six categories 18 groups and 62 types these range from affluent achievers premiership footballers hedge fund managers and entrepreneurs to the difficult circumstances group of single parent elderly or lowincome households and supermarkets can rely on loyalty card data for insights into who their customers are where they live what they buy and when a tesco superstore in hounslow london the big chains are closing superstores and opening smaller outlets in cities leaving some communities overserviced and others neglected photograph alamy in a recent collaboration with the grocer magazine caci named the uk’s “hottest” 100 postcodes for convenience stores forty of those postcodes were in london just two were in the northeast of england the race for profitable demographics in cities has become more pronounced twenty years ago campaigners worried about “food deserts” as supermarkets abandoned city centres for hypermarkets on the edge of town now cities and towns are experiencing a recolonisation as the supermarkets return to hollowedout high streets to open convenience stores which are typically under 3000 sq ft to circumvent sunday trading laws sainsbury’s plans to open another 100 of its local convenience stores this year supermarkets use loyalty cars like nectar to track who buys what and when photograph alamy this is partly a reflection of changing shopping patterns – increasingly we undertake one big shop a week or fortnight in stores or online then top up at convenience stores – and partly of the availability of town centre sites at lower rents “justintime technology allows this to be possible as storage space is now selling space” explains martin caraher professor of food and health policy at centre for food policy at city university in london but because it can take 10 to 15 convenience stores to generate the same sales as a superstore supermarkets are often found clustering in the most profitable or affluent city districts for example figures compiled by the scottish green party show that edinburgh has the highest number of sainsbury’s and tesco local stores per capita of any city in britain with 28 tesco metros and 25 sainsbury’s locals likewise there is no shortage of groceryshopping choice in wealthy canterbury which caci says is one of the top 10 most cities most heavily overserviced by supermarkets in the canterbury postcode alone there is more than a million sq ft of supermarket space in some cases this can lead to what might seem an absurd clustering of supermarket stores around some street corners partly this can be explained by rent levels says louise etherden principal consultant at caci “supermarkets tend to be very sensitive to high rents so the availability of goodsized units at reasonable rates is why you sometimes find clusters of them”but according to graham soult a northeast retail consultant these convenience store locations are actually chosen using less sophisticated tools and methods than those used to site the big stores“if you’re looking to open a major superstore it’s relatively easy to map the key competitors at a subregional level and work out the catchment based on drive time” he explains “but for a convenience store likely to be visited on foot there is a whole load of microscale factors at play which are harder to quantify or predict”according to soult supermarkets therefore resort to a more qualitative ad hoc approach when picking local urban locations “that means actually going to the place getting a feel for the area and making an assessment based on what’s happening there” he says “is it an upandcoming area are there new offices or student flats being built nearby what other retailers are investing in those locations to increase their appeal and footfall what is the visibility of the site like“that’s why retailers like sainsbury’s regularly solicit referrals from property consultants – people who have their ears to the ground at the local level”the result is often that supermarkets end up clustering in wealthier postcodes but does this matter a tesco express supermarket in a former pub photograph alamy it matters in poorer neighbourhoods partly because of our reliance on supermarkets shoppers have willingly plugged themselves into the supermarkets’ network some 97 of our groceries we buy from supermarkets threequarters of that from the big four the clock cannot be turned back to high streets of old when butchers bakers and greengrocers greeted us by name for better or worse we rely on supermarkets and underserviced neighbourhoods may eat less healthy food as a result and it matters in wealthier neighbourhoods because too many supermarkets – particularly of the convenience store variety – can be as bad as too few smaller city stores pose a greater risk to small local independent grocery shops than their big sheds on the edge of town they charge higher prices and can snap up community assets such as pubs it all comes down to the idea that letting supermarkets control our cities’ food supply is in their own best interests not ours says carolyn steel architect and author of hungry city she argues that the solution is for city leaders to take back control of food supply“for historical and geographical reasons the british have always adopted a free trade attitude to food and planning” she says “it was easier to let markets sort it out when supermarkets first came to europe the uk was the only country not to put rules in place”“we must analyse the footprint of the supermarket chains” says alison johnstone green msp for lothian “surely a city with half a million people like edinburgh only needs so many supermarkets”that might mean setting rules for where supermarkets can open like in san francisco where chain stores must provide evidence they are appropriate for the neighbourhood until then the food supply of uk cities – and the character of our neighbourhoods – will be subject only to the law of which supermarket locations are most profitable per square foot
