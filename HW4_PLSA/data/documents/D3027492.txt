chain the chain is the most important part of the transmission over time road gunk will be attracted to your lubed chain and that silky oil will turn into a chaindestroying grinding paste there are plenty of safe degreasers and chain cleaning devices on the market to bring that chain back to life though we like to use a chain cleaner because its enclosed nature avoids mess and gets the chain sparkling watch our full park tool maintenance monday video guide on how to clean your chain with or without a chain cleaner here how to clean and lube a chain video how to clean and lube a chain the video also explains how to lube a chain – written instructions for this can be found in step 8 below2 clean jockey wheels step 2 clean jockey wheels use a little degreaser and a rag or brush to scrub the jockey wheels not forgetting the insides of the mech arm it’s possible to unscrew the jockey wheels from the mech arm but it’s advisable not to unless you’ve got thread lock to reinstall the pivot bolts we’ve seen too many rides ended by bottom jockey wheels falling out3 clean rear sprockets step 3 clean rear sprockets give the sprockets some flossing with your strip of rag or a special cog brush a little degreaser can be used if its really filthy the cleaner you can keep your sprockets the faster they’ll shift and the longer they’ll last remember  dirt acts like a grinding paste when in contact with any part of your transmission so get rid of it4 clean chainrings step 4 clean chainrings remove the worst grit from the chainrings using a brush  much like the cassette the teeth of the chainrings will hold dirt and increase wear5 rinse step 5 rinse once youve cleaned all the above parts rinse them off with water to ensure the degreaser won’t contaminate the lube be sure to use a gentle flow of water and always point it downwards never directly at the bearings6 wipe chain step 6 wipe chain use a soft rag to wipe the chain completely clean – you’ll be surprised what comes off a cleanlooking chain try to massage the links moving them through as wide a range of movement as possible – this helps expose the sections of link that are normally hidden from view7 lube jockey wheels step 7 lube jockey wheels lube the jockey wheels at the point they spin they only need the very lightest touch of lube  they’ll pick up enough from the chain as its used remember these little wheels attract a lot of dirt and with lube being sticky it doesn’t pay to make matters worse by overdoing it wipe the excess away with a rag they should look dry8 lubricate the chain step 8 lubrication apply lube only when the chain is clean and dry we prefer to lube the chain as little as possible with as light a lube as we can get away with use a dripper bottle because it’s easier to apply accurately with minimum waste coat the whole chain spinning the cranks to force the lube into the links that’s where lube is most useful not on the outside plates as many believe wipe excess lube away with a clean rag9 unclip cables step 9 unclip cables set the rear gears into the largest rear sprocket and then without letting the rear wheel spin shift into the smallest rear sprocket this will free up some inner cable and allow you to pop the outers from the slotted cable stops on the frame with the cables now fully unclipped from the frame you can inspect clean relube and reinstall everything note – for frames with internal cable routing this step may not be possible10 wipe and lube cables step 10 wipe and lube cables slide the outers to expose previously covered sections of inner cable give the entire inner cable a wipe over with a section of rag soaked in degreaser if you come across any sections that are rusty or fraying replace with a new inner cable most dry cables can be reinvigorated with a little light chain lube extra tip lube front mech extra tip lube front mech front mechs often suffer from neglect theyre hard to access and are often jammed full of grit and drier than a cracker we recommend giving them a thorough wipe and applying a little chain or penetrating oil to the pivots to get it swinging right again pro tip chain wear pro tip chain wear chains wear and will stretch when this happens the cogs and chainrings will wear to match the lengthened chain there are basic tools available to measure chain wear replacing the chain before it wears is cheaper than leaving it to wear and needing new chainrings and cassette how fast a chain wears depends on many factors  riding style weight riding conditions and how well you follow the previously outlined steps on average expect to replace your chain every 25003000km on a road bike and closer to every 1000km on a mountain bike related links get into mountain biking with bike radar
