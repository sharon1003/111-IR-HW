10 things that make your uber driver sadby lexus jonesin newson jun 19 2015 1105 am im lexus jones click here to read last weeks intro  i have a regular fulltime job but on the weekends and a few weeknight i drive for uber over the last couple of years i have driven over 2000 trips for uber at first i drove on the uber x platform now i drive a luxury car on the uber plus platform whenever i think that i have seen it all something new happens i will be sharing those stories here i will also answer questions and give advice on how to get the most out of your rides uber drivers love you lets get that on the table we love driving because the money can be decent we are free to roll whenever we want and the positive energy from our passengers is often lifeaffirming you may not think that you are radiating vibes but you are and they are usually lovely however there are several things that can make uber drivers very sad because laist readers are enlightened wonderful and always seeking new ways to be better souls i will share some issues that i have experienced and some i have heard from other drivers that piss us off and make for a notsogreat trip1 making your driver wait one benefit for passengers about uber is you can see how far away your driver is from you as we are heading to pick you up the app even tells you before you order the ride how many minutes it will take for the car to get to you although la prides itself about being fashionably late dont pull that with your uber be cool indeed if you wanna be super cool be outside gasp waiting for your driver when we arrive if the app says there is a driver 5 minutes away why would you be shocked when there is a car in your driveway in 5 minutes perhaps you are unaware but drivers make 0 as they wait to start the trip so if you make us wait more than five minutes we can cancel the ride and you get charged 5 advice if you still havent fully prepared for the night on the town when you are considering reaching for the uber app do everyone a favor and wait until youre photoready before you tap your phone for your ride well be there in just a few minutes promise2 no drinking booze no smoking no doing drugs uber is not a limo uber is not your living room uber is someone elses car and theyre giving you a ride for on average 10 minutes finish your beer before you use the app smoke your cigarette before you get in the car and if you must do drugs why would you think a moving vehicle is a good place to do them your uber driver is usually driving to make a few extra bucks on top of their regular job they are not trying to find new ways to go to jail or pay crazy expensive fines because you just opened your bud light before you ran out of your frat house and didnt feel like chugging your precious swill ironically one thing you probably love about riding in an uber compared to a taxi is it doesnt smell like an ashtray so please dont even think about lighting up a cigarette in the backseat be considerate to the driver and the next passenger who probably doesnt want to smell your smoke and please dont ask us to make an exception because that will create an awkward hell no from us and turn those positive vibes into something sad3 bad reviews for obeying the rules unlike cabs uber drivers get rated after every single ride its actually a great way to weed out the bad drivers and provide instant feedback to the company the only problem is the only acceptable rating in most drivers minds is a perfect score 5 stars we feel that way because if a driver averages 4 stars they get booted from the system technically if we get lower than a 46 we are on thin ice with the company therefore drivers get very nervous when passengers ask if they can smoke or snort or drink in the car the driver knows they will have to say no and we also know that that can result in a 1 or 2 star rating  which will take dozens of 5star rides to overcome at the same time drivers are instructed by uber not to solicit 5star ratings from our passengers so a goodhearted passenger may think they are giving a positive review when they dole out 4 stars on an average typical ride unfortunately a 4star rating is bad and a night of them is a nightmare advice if everything went well on the ride give your driver 5 stars if the car was dirty or the driver was clueless about how to get to your destination etc give them lower than 5 stars but if the ride was fine keep in mind that a 4 or lower is actually a negative review please dont punish us because you wanted to do something that you know in your heart you shouldnt be doing in an uber and for petes sake dont give a negative review because of things like price or traffic the driver has no control over those things4 trying to jam more than four passengers in an uber x you can get around town so much cheaper in an uber than a cab because of the lowcost uber x the 4door cars are clean sometimes theres water phone chargers andor treats its easy to pay you even get a receipt emailed to you uber xl gives you all of those features too but in a minivan if you have four passengers uber x is perfect because there are four seat belts for everyone we want to see you again no one wants tragedy to strike because someone wasnt buckled up advice if you have 5 or 6 people in your party order an uber xl and split the fare with everyone via the app or pay people back through venmo or get two uber xs youll survive but please dont try to pack more people in a car than it was designed to handle its for your safety which you may not consider valuable but we do5 you dont know where youre going youve been drinking and you do the right thing you order an uber while you wait type in the app the destination where you want to go it will take less than a minute you know where you want to go if you dont know the address just try to type in the name of the venue or intersection—its probably in there but dont do this dont say oh ill just tell you how to get there some drivers like me dont care if you backseat drive but usually people who have been drinking are easily distracted a phone rings or texting commences—or worse you pass out suddenly the directions stop being slurred from the back seat and the trip takes much longer than it should just type into the app where you want to go before the ride starts well get you there safe pinkie swear6 asking drivers about tips you tip your cabbie your limo driver your super shuttle dude your lyft driver even the guy who cracks open the bottle of beer at the bar a while back ubers message was the tip is included if youve noticed they havent said that in about a year as you may have noticed there still is no way to tip electronically on the app you may not know but uber drivers are instructed not to solicit tips we are even told to refuse tips once and only accept them if the passenger insists on their generosity as pointed out earlier because our rating is the differencemaker between keeping our job with uber we are put in a very uncomfortable position when a passenger asks us about tips because we dont want you to have a bad feeling when the ride is over when you are prompted to rate us me personally i dont expect tips ive driven over 2000 rides with uber and even though im an amazing driver with a clean car with water mints and chargers for several phones ive received maybe 25 tips advice when you take a 5 uber ride keep in mind the drivers cut is about 260 you tip everyone else if you have a buck or two that you can spare do what youd do with a cabbie or bartender if that driver really went above and beyond its ok to be generous trust me when i tell you you will make that drivers day its like seeing a unicorn7 asking to go through a drivethru after the bars close this is a tricky one youve been partying all night and innout or taco bell sounds soooooo good youre in the uber and you pass by one and even though the line is out to the street you must have some deep fried fare so you ask your driver to get in that line while you party in the back with your friends the dilemma for the driver is we get very little money while the meter is running uber is not like a cab the meter is running but realllly slowly if the wait is 45 minutes the driver gets about 750 before uber takes their cut and the car has been idling for that long sucking gas the driver only really gets paid if the wheels are rolling advice heres what i do as a passenger if i am in that position and i dont want to bum out my driver i give them a 5 bill up front or more depending on how long the line is and i insist that i buy them a snack anything you want just order it i say then i dont eat it until i get home spilling food and drinks in an uber can be horrible for a driver and drunk people are known to spill8 while waiting to get picked up calling the driver to ask where are you the uber app is great technology but its not perfect all of the time especially in the hands of people who have been drinking—or those not paying 100 attention sometimes when a wouldbe passenger uses the app they dont realize that the pin isnt being dropped where they actually are you might be at the palladium but the pin drops a half a block away in front of roscoes since the driver assumes you are where you dropped the pin they may be waiting in front of roscoes holding up traffic after a while the passenger might use the app to call the driver and most of the time the first question the passenger asks is where are you that seems like a reasonable question but its actually irrelevant the most important fact is where is the passenger the ideal question should be i am at the palladium which way should i walk to get to you advice one way to avoid improper pin droppage is to type in the venue that you are at into the app instead of letting the pin automatically fall and if you call say right away i am at this address in front of this barrestaurant9 asking to be picked up at the hollywood bowl the bowl is one of the greatest places to see a concert tragically its also one of the toughest spots in all of la to pick someone up traffic is snarled after the concert lets out and the police close roads to help out on traffic and there are dozens and dozens of wouldbe uber passengers all waiting in the worst place possible right by the marquee of the bowl advice do everyone including yourself a favor and walk a little bit south down highland to either one of the motels on the west side of the street and summon your uber there or better yet walk down to the gas station on franklin and highland and then use your app your driver will get to you quickly and you will speed out of that congested area much faster10 dropping your pin on the corner of a busy street we live in great times within minutes of clicking a button on your phone a clean car will appear and take you on your merry way this gets gunked up when you drop your pin in the middle of an intersection or on a busy corner how will a driver know where to pick you up also do you really want to hear cars honking as you enter the car on the corner of a busy street advice to make things merrier if you are at a corner and you want a ride walk 200 feet or so to the middle of the block and look for a place that a car could logically pull over to pick you up safely intersection corners are the furthest things from safe it also ticks off every other car on the road as you and your friends block traffic getting into the prius next week lexus will answer

connected but completely off  it uses known networks to increase accuracy the driver went where the app claimed the rider was but it wasnt accurate  cant blame the driver for that yada yade • 2 years ago i had used the app once and waited for my driver only to see him pull over on the other side of the street i was angry at first but realized it was my fault i didnt pay attention to my location and the pin gave him the an odd number street number he pulled a u turn and all was good so now i double check my location driver d • 2 years ago we can read numbers when you drop the pin it gives us the address and we go to the address the problem happens when youre at a different building with different numbers and get upset because we didnt know you had made the numbers utterly meaningless b steed • 2 years ago it can be very difficult to read numbers from the street especially at night as you are driving and then there are some buildings with no numbers at all as the author stated there may not be anywhere to pull over at the address you requested the ride consider where the driver can pull up to when you do request you may think its the drivers job to cater to your every need but for 260 the average ride drivers expect you to do your part thats why its called a peer to peer app guest • 2 years ago guest • 2 years ago shane uren • 1 year ago you really are not to smart are youthe above posts with regards to your initial message are correctyou are just an individual that lacks decency and common sense when ordering an uber if you have nothing clever to add to this forumi suggest you go and buy a car so you stop using uber all togetheras drivers we really could do without trying to deal with idiots zuzus petals • 1 year ago how about this passengers dont ever have to tip but i also dont have to stop for you for coffee on the way to work i dont get paid for that wait time  get your coffee on your own time  shane uren • 1 year ago are you serious you are the sterotypical ignorant and rather stupid uber riderthe type that stands on a cornermakes the driver wait because you couldnt be bothered taking notice of the vehicles locationarrival time i make good money as an uber driver and my golden rule is if you are not waiting for me i leave without youif you are not waiting a spot that demonstrates common sensei leave without youscrew your head on and start to demonstrate a little more regard for those of us sent to pick u up for half the price of a shitty cab shane uren • 1 year ago it aint rocket science sweetheart   itmfa • 2 years ago how about just calling this ways to make your uber ride more efficient or something like that dont care that much about driver sadness im sad all day at my job i dont expect anyone to go out of their way to something about it bubbles • 2 years ago empathy is bullshit fuck feelings cjscudworth • 2 years agohttps38mediatumblrcom chuck w • 2 years ago about tipping if you have a buck or two that you can spare do what youd do with a cabbie or bartender if that driver really went above and beyond its ok to be generous but you also mention that uber forbids you to accept tips what other anti uber policy rules do you suggest we breakpeterk • 2 years ago no way i use uber so i dont have to carry cash with me perhaps drivers deserve a bit more of the share but thats an issue for the drivers to take up with the company jack lantern13 • 2 years ago the douches always come out when the topic of tips comes up chuck w • 2 years ago but if its specifically against company policy  lexus jones • 2 years ago as the person below stated the policy for drivers is to refuse the initial tip but if the passenger insists then we are allowed to accept it it is an unnecessary dance that is a waste of time and goes against the customer is always right credo chris boehm • 2 years agolol you are spot on telling independent contractors to turn down gratuity is a ridiculous notion it just results an awkward dialog and sometimes even mildly offends the pax jack lantern13 • 2 years ago its not they can accept tips also as of now they are still independent contractors so they can technically do whatever they want rb • 2 years ago they can technically do what they want as a contractor but it has similar consequences as if you were an hourlysalaried employee if you violate company policy jack lantern13 • 2 years ago true but accepting tips isnt going to get them in trouble chuck w • 2 years ago probably not jack lantern but thats an assumption on your part skirting around company policy can be risky jack lantern13 • 2 years ago havent we established that its not policy chuck w • 2 years ago i thought we had but when you comment they can accept tips like you did above well that goes against what ubers apparent company policy says apparent again in that the company doesnt make this very clear on their website scott douglas • 2 years ago unless the rider was a secret shopper which companies that have independent contractors and employees can do and have used your naive ideology is going to cost people their jobs if it is company policy than it is company policy very few people especially uber riders are going to repeatedly insist they take the tippeterk • 2 years ago then why dont you tip every time you go to mc donalds its a different business model with different tipping protocols pricktoddal • 2 years ago because mc donalds workers are not endangering their vehicles and having to spend time with you for 1020 minutes and then still being underpaid by their company the article was about recognition of what an uber driver is going through and ways that you might be able to help out you knowlike a normal good human being but i guess maybe you dont qualify for thatpeterk • 2 years ago or gee whiz we could just pay the fair amount for the service without worrying about gratuities maybe you screw around by giving less tip if youre less happy with service but i dont i give 20 no matter what because its not worth my time and aggravation worrying about it thats why ive said before that i dont mind paying more but id rather the 20 simply be built into the price for convenience and safety of not having to carry cash im sorry you think thats not normal or good apparently toddal and others you dont know how to readtoddal • 2 years ago rightthe problem is with me and others but no way is it maybe what you wrote or the tone with which you wrote it in other wordsyoure an idiot the point is that its not the fucking drivers fault that uber is screwing us so maybe you could be a more caring human and offer a few bucks here and there if you dont have it fine if you dont carry cash fine no one is saying you have to but maybe you could not post hostile bullshit on websites either have a great daypeterk • 2 years ago anyone with eyes can see that it was you and other people that were hostile first i simply stated that the reason i use the service is to not deal with the danger of carrying cash with me my safety is just as important an issue as you being able to make a living and i am perfectly justified in bringing that up if thats the attitude you take with you to your job youre the reason why uber and lyft have become popular at the expense of traditional cab companies drivers like you are the reason why i switched and uber should be commended for weeding out hostile selfentitled drivers like yourself michael voight • 2 years ago if you dont like uber pay and uber rules dont work for uber it is really that simpleted • 2 years ago except that its not you the passenger knows damn well whos paying for the gas you know who pays for the tires and the brakes youve never asked yourself how the driver makes any money when youre paying less than youd pay to take a bus sometimes have you ever noticed you never get the same driver twice thats because uber by necessity signs up thousands of new drivers every week to replace the ones that quit the reason uber is able to sign up so many drivers is they lie to them they advertise youll make up to 90 thousand a year they let that lie get to the passengers as well so they dont feel bad about not tipping they help you lease a new car then they manipulate the pricing and the pay always to benefit the passengers and themselves always at the expense of the driver its simple i agree uber should do what they promised they should pay drivers 90000year and youll get your free water and candy from the driver with a smile but so long as were working for next to nothing 85mile really it wouldnt kill you to reach into your pocket and give the driver a little appreciation for taking the pay cut theyve taken to honor your smug libertarian cheapness its really that simpletoddal • 2 years ago yeah but its not built in and that isnt something the drivers have anything to do with in fact we have collectively spent thousands of hours trying to convince uber to do it so instead of living in fantasy land how about you just bring 2 for a fucking tip and stop being such a pussy about carrying a few bucks cashpeterk • 2 years ago nice comeback apparently it took you months afterward to think it up youre the one living in a fantasy land if you believe that customers are obligated to cater to you in the real world its the other way around good luck trying to keep a job with your attitude psycho brad the tortoise • 2 years ago not all of us carry cash i dont need cash for any of my normal daily activities that being said i view uber and lyft as different business models if i want a single total price ill use uber if i want a tipbased total price ill take lyft because i like the choice between two different business models id prefer uber to just raise its rates so that drivers are paid what they feel is a fair wage without me having to add in an additional tip as an income supplement ill still patronize the service even if prices are higher because theyll still be well below what taxis charge shadow rising • 2 years ago i just did my first uber run tonight 20 fares and 3 of them tipped fuck ubers refuse the tip at first policy when someone handed me a tip i said thanks really appreciate it and took the money hell no im not going to refuse it especially on a short trip one guy who normally uses lyft was confused as to how to tip me as he didnt know how thats done on uber i told him that uber doesnt require tipping but that its certainly appreciated i wouldnt solicit tips but if the passenger clearly has intent to tip but is confused on how its done with uber thats what i will tell them if uber corporate doesnt like that well then fuck them innajunglestylee • 2 years ago to be fair the current policy appears to be to discourage tips one time then accept them not quite the same as forbidding tips andrew w • 2 years ago yeah but who would do that i like uber and offered to tip the first few times and the drivers always said they werent allowed to accept it i didnt want to get them in trouble or make it weird so i stopped offering it seemed pretty cut and dry this is the first time ive heard they actually can accept it jack lantern13 • 2 years ago how long ago was that things have changed a lot andrew w • 2 years ago couple years ago maybe i mean i dont go checking the fine print to see whats changed jack lantern13 • 2 years ago yeah a couple years ago it seemed like the tip was actually included also drivers are making less than they were a couple years agotoddal • 2 years ago drivers are definitely making less than even one year ago uber has saturated the market with drivers and at the same time slashed prices around 30 i totally get that this is good for riders of which i am one but it really hurts even the casual driver trying to make a few bucks thus just like any other tip a few extra bucks for a nice driver is always appreciated or uberplease put a gd tip option on the fing app how the f does it hurt you b steed • 2 years agoin my market drivers are making 40 less than they did a year ago the reason they stopped saying tips were included is because drivers were looking for these tips and could only find fares that were being hit with a 20 commissionso someone sued now they tell riders they dont have to tip lexus jones • 2 years ago give it another try or what i do is i just toss two bucks in the passenger seat as i exit it really will make their day innajunglestylee • 2 years ago its a pretty stupid policy and hey will likely go towards demonstrating that uber drivers are employees and not contractors next time somebody sues them just build a tipping option into the app brad the tortoise • 2 years ago lyft already has a tipping option i prefer the single simple price offered by uber that said they really should raise their rates its not like uber customers are going to jump ship to some mythical bargainbasementpriced competitor to be honest i think it would be better for lyft to cost a little less but maintain their tipping option and for uber to cost a bit more but to keep its tipfree pricing model which makes them unique adam a diaz • 1 year ago totally agree that would be an excellent strategy instead of having it work around surge oo moose wizard • 2 years ago this is why as a driver i make it a point to say tipping is not necessary rather than not allowed
