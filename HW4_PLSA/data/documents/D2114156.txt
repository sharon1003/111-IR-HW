buying an espresso machine i probably don’t need to tell you that espresso machines aren’t super cheap while you could buy a stovetop unit aka “moka pot” for as little as 20 i’m not going to be covering that on this page those things are inexpensive and uncomplicated and don’t make very good espresso anyway instead i’ll be focusing on those machines that require a cord and a bit more of an investment but before you give up on the painful ordeal that is consumerism consider how much you currently spend getting your fix in cafes wouldn’t you rather support your habit with a reasonable initial investment and be able to slurp down espresso in the comfort of your own home of course you would read on how much will it cost good question if you’re in the market for a new machine you can expect to shell out based on the following amounts in usd as for used machines the prices can vary quite a bit but if you know how much a new machine would cost you’ll know when you’ve spotted a deal50 to 90 electric steam machine 200 and up pump machine 600 and up manual lever pump machine 700 and up super automatic pump machine while it’s generally true that you get what you pay for this isn’t always true for example i could sell you a wad of used chewing gum for 800 but it’d still be rather nasty that’s why you should also be asking…which one should i buy i’m glad you asked unfortunately i don’t have any clear answers on this one because manufacturers are bringing out new machines all the time but i do have some general advice see what’s available shop around just to see what’s being sold either in department and electronics stores or online better yet do both take down model numbers and names of anything that catches your eye even if it’s a bit out of your price range you might be able to find a better deal elsewhere locate reviews google is a good way to find reviews — search for the product name manufacturer and the word “review” it might help to use quotation marks for example you might try searching for “company x model 4″ review next try “company x” “model 4″ review note the difference in quotation marks online review sites can also be helpful amazon and coffee geek both have useful user reviews to take a look at find a good price at an honest store whether you buy online or off there’s no simple way to find the best place to buy ask around be sure to check return policies and if you’re buying online or from a catalog figure out how much shipping will cost before you place your order features and considerations the major features will depend on what type of machine you get but there are a few important points i feel i have to make also i like making lists here you go metals used all espresso machines heat water in a metal unit of some sort and the metal s used here can effect the taste of the espresso brass and steel are a better choice than aluminum which can leave a hint of a metallic taste in your espresso but aluminum is also cheap and lightweight so it’s used in all the lowend models heating system espresso demands a constant temperature very low end machines use a thermoblock to heat the water a thermoblock is what’s used in those “instant hot water” taps thermoblocks just don’t compare to a real boiler in terms of temperature stability some manufacturers have started selling 250 machines without real boilers which seems like kind of a ripoff to me durability they don’t make em like they used to watch out for machines with plastic portafilters these are a definite nono pump pressure sometimes salespeople will make the pressure of a pump which is measured in bars seem like it’s the most important feature this isn’t necessarily the case but it shouldn’t be overlooked the minimum pressure to make espresso is usually considered to be 14 bars a more powerful pump means a finer grind can be used increasing the surface area of the coffee and unlocking more of the beans’ flavor steam wand stovetop and manual lever machines typically don’t include a steam wand but most others do some of the big n’ expensive pump machines have two boilers — one for the espresso in which the water doesn’t really boil and one for creating steam this isn’t necessary at all but it means you can make lattes cappuccinos etc faster because you don’t have to wait for the boiler to change temperature by the way don’t worry about those crazy frothing attachments some companies are including these days — if you buy one that includes some sort of rubber or plastic thing on the end of the steam wand take it off before you use it these usually make steaming more difficult removable water reservoir the cool thing about these is you can take all the water out of the machine so bacteria won’t build up for health reasons it’s best not to leave water in the machine for extended periods of time where to buy over at my espresso shop they sell a great variety of espresso machines particularly in the
