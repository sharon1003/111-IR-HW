the five worst contaminants in chicken products americans eat a staggering 84 pounds of chicken per person a year 1 but nutrition experts with the physicians committee warn that most consumers are unaware that feces toxic chemicals superbugs carcinogens and cholesterol are likely hiding in every bite they eat more than 8 billion chickens are slaughtered in the united states each year 2 but instead of tightening inspection procedures the u s department of agriculture is poised to unveil a new poultryinspection policy this summer that could endanger consumers’ health 3the new guidelines decrease the number of federal inspectors on inspection lines from four to one increase the number of chickens inspected from 140 to 175 per minute and call for toxins such as chlorine to treat chicken for contaminants 3in addition to contaminants related to processing chicken products naturally contain carcinogens triggered through cooking and nearly as much cholesterol as red meat the five worst contaminants in chicken products contaminant shocker1 feces chickens can soak in “fecal soup” for up to an hour before being packaged for consumers2 toxic chemicals peracetic acid and chlorine are both commonly used to treat chicken for contaminants in poultry plants3 superbugs nearly 75 percent of bacterially tainted chicken products harbor germs resistant to one or more types of antibiotics4 carcinogens arsenic in chicken could lead to increased risk of lung and bladder cancer deaths5 cholesterol both 4 ounces of beef and 4 ounces of chicken contain approximately 100 milligrams of cholesterol feces poultry slaughter procedures a usda training video recently obtained by the physicians committee through the freedom of information act reveals that the chicken slaughtering process ends with carcasses soaking in cold water—“fecal soup”—for up to one hour before being packaged for consumers 2large chicken processing plants such as tyson and perdue can slaughter as many as 30000 chickens an hour 2 during processing chicken carcasses are mechanically disemboweled and later soaked in a chill tank before being packaged and sent to distributors a federal inspector said “we often see birds going down the line with intestines still attached which are full of fecal contamination if there is no fecal contamination on the bird’s skin however we can do nothing to stop that bird from going down that line it is more than reasonable to assume that once the bird gets into the chill tank that contamination will enter the water and contaminate all of the other carcasses in the chiller that’s why it is sometimes called ‘fecal soup’”in 2012 the physicians committee tested chicken products sold by 15 grocery store chains in 10 u s cities for the presence of fecal bacteria 48 percent of chicken samples tested positive 4applying high cooking heat to poultry products does not remove the feces it merely cooks it along with the muscle tissue in march 2013 the physicians committee submitted a legal petition requesting that usda declare and regulate feces as an adulterant require that poultry product labels uniformly disclose the presence of feces and remove the word “wholesome” from the official inspection legend for poultry products toxic chemicals chlorine and peracetic acid are used to treat chicken at the processing plant where a federal poultry inspector died after coughing up blood and his lungs and kidneys failed 5 both are toxic chemicals known to cause lung damage among other health hazards usda inspectors and poultry industry employees across the nation have also suffered from asthma burns rashes irritated eyes and sinus problems that they attribute to chemical exposure 5use of these toxins and other antimicrobials to treat chicken contaminants will increase because of the pending poultryinspection guidelines that state “all carcasses would remain on the line to be treated with the online antimicrobial agent” 6 in other words all poultry products would be doused with an agent such as trisodium phosphate chlorinated water or acidified sodium chlorite prior to reaching consumers 6in april 2013 the physicians committee added an addendum to its usda petition to cover these toxins “if usda will not condemn all fecally contaminated products then at a minimum it must inform consumers what they are eating”superbugs the food and drug administration recently found that 74 percent of bacterially tainted chicken products harbored germs that were resistant to one or more types of antibiotics the report also noted that 303 million pounds of antibiotics were sold and used in livestock feed in 2011 a 21 percent increase from 2010 7a 2013 study from the center for science in the public interest cspi declared chicken as the most unsafe meat in terms of bacterial content cspi researchers examined 12 years of cdc data and determined that more reported foodborne illness outbreaks were linked to chicken than any other meat or poultry product 8the centers for disease control and prevention’s most recent food safety progress report shows that foodborne illnesses from bacteria found in chicken are on the rise campylobacter has seen a 14 percent increase and for every reported case there are an estimated 30 additional cases that are undiagnosed 9 for each reported salmonella case there are 29 undiagnosed cases both salmonellosis and campylobacteriosis can cause fever diarrhea abdominal cramping and potentially result in a serious lifethreatening condition carcinogens a new study from johns hopkins university found levels of inorganic arsenic in chicken two to three times higher than the fda suggests might be safe arsenic is used in chicken feed to kill intestinal parasites promote growth and make meat look pinker there is no federal law prohibiting the sale or use of arsenicbased drugs in poultry feed but maryland is the first state to ban most arsenicals in chicken feed consuming inorganic arsenic leads to increased risk of lung and bladder cancer 10carcinogens also occur naturally in chicken in a physicians committee study compiled from independent laboratory tests 100 percent of 100 grilled chicken samples from top restaurant chains in california contained ph ip a federally recognized carcinogen that has been linked to breast prostate and other cancers 11 ph ip forms naturally from substances found in tissue when the tissue is exposed to direct high heat in california proposition 65 requires all food outlets to display warnings related to carcinogens in their products in 2008 the physicians committee filed a lawsuit that would compel fast food chains to post this notice regarding their grilled chicken items burger king settled and agreed to display the appropriate warnings in their california locations cholesterol chicken contains nearly as much cholesterol as red meat four ounces of beef and 4 ounces of chicken both contain approximately 100 milligrams of arteryclogging cholesterol which contributes to heart disease in addition to dietary cholesterol typical chicken servings are about 50 percent fat and 30 percent of that is saturated or “unhealthy” fat which stimulates the body’s production of cholesterol chicken contains no fiber a substance that can naturally lower cholesterol and remove toxins and hormones from the body that can help prevent certain types of cancer what should the government and industry do the usda should require chicken producers and distributors to label packages to inform consumers that they are likely eating feces and other contaminants the physicians committee’s march 2013 legal petition to the usda requests that feces be declared an adulterant and that packaging be labeled appropriately sample warning label the fastfood industry can help customers avoid chicken’s contaminants cholesterol and carcinogens by displaying warnings and offering customers healthful alternatives chipotle is currently testing a new tofubased option in california 12what can consumers do the safest choice is to avoid purchasing ingesting or handling chicken products a plantbased diet of fruits vegetables whole grains and legumes is naturally free of cholesterol and loaded with fiber and protein references1 broiler chicken industry key facts national chicken council
