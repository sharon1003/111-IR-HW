jackie changed face of sports by larry schwartz special to espncom its not often that the essence of a man especially a complicated man can be summed up in one sentence but then again there havent been many people like jackie robinson a life is not important he said except in the impact it has on other lives jackie robinson led the way for generations of black athletes by that standard few people  and no athlete  this century has impacted more lives robinson lit the torch and passed it on to several generations of africanamerican athletes while the brooklyn dodgers infielder didnt make a nation color blind he at least made it more color friendly and he accomplished this feat by going against his natural instincts he was an aggressive man outraged at injustice and quick to stand up for his rights he had the guts to say no when ordered to the back of the bus in the army and was courtmartialed for his courage his instinct wasnt to turn the other cheek but to face problems head on he was more prone to fighting back than holding back thats what robinson had to do when dodgers president branch rickey selected him to become the first africanamerican to play in the majors this century rickey wanted a man who could restrain himself from responding to the ugliness of the racial hatred that was certain to come a shorthand version of their fateful conversation in august 1945 rickey i know youre a good ballplayer what i dont know is whether you have the guts robinson mr rickey are you looking for a negro who is afraid to fight back rickey exploding robinson im looking for a ballplayer with guts enough not to fight back this unwritten pact between two men would change the course of a country baseball might only be a game but in the area of black and white it often is a leader robinsons debut for the dodgers in 1947 came a year before president harry truman desegregated the military and seven years before the supreme court ruled desegregation in public schools was unconstitutional rickey was deadon about the racism as sports illustrated s bill nack wrote robinson was the target of racial epithets and flying cleats of hate letters and death threats of pitchers throwing at his head and legs and catchers spitting on his shoes robinson learned how to exercise selfcontrol  to answer insults violence and injustice with silence a model of unselfish team play he earned the respect of his teammates and eventually the opposition the 6foot 195pound robinson was the rookie of the year and two years later he was mvp his lifetime average was 311 and he was voted into the hall of fame in his first year of eligibility pigeontoed and muscular it was no 42s aggressiveness on the basepaths that thrilled fans it wasnt so much his two stolenbase titles or his 197 thefts it was the way he was a disruptive force dancing off the base drawing every eye in the stadium making the pitcher crazy instilling the dodgers with the spirit that would help them win six pennants in his 10 seasons robinson could hit and bunt and steal and run roger kahn wrote in the boys of summer he had intimidation skills and he burned with a dark fire he wanted passionately to win he bore the burden of a pioneer and the weight made him stronger if one can be certain of anything in baseball it is that we shall not look upon his like again he was born on jan 31 1919 in rural georgia his father jerry was a ladies man who deserted the family six months after his birth when his mother mallie was told by her halfbrother if you want to get closer to heaven visit california she took her five children west in 1920 they moved into a workingclass neighborhood in pasadena where they felt the sting of a towns prejudice jackie found his home on the playground playing marbles soccer dodgeball tennis golf football baseball and basketball he was a demon competitor desperately wanting to win no matter the game after starring athletically at pasadena junior college he became the first to letter in four sports at ucla he was a brilliant brokenfield runner in football a pioneer point guard who introduced the fast break to a deliberate white boys game in basketball a bandit on the bases in baseball and an ncaa champion long jumper he also earned a reputation as a mad brawler ready to smash any white man who insulted him after pearl harbor he was drafted into the army and wound up a second lieutenant at his courtmartial for not moving to the back of the bus his lawyer said robinson was on trial not because he had violated any articles of war but because a few officers were working vengeance against an uppity black man all charges were dismissed and several months later robinson received an honorable discharge from the army in 1945 he played shortstop for the kansas city monarchs in the negro league that year happy chandler became the major leagues new commissioner succeeding the late kenesaw mountain landis a racist at heart chandler a former governor and senator of kentucky said about africanamericans if they can fight and die on okinawa guadalcanal and in the south pacific they can play ball in america that summer rickey selected robinson to integrate baseball in 1946 robinson playing second baseman for the montreal royals the dodgers top farm team batted an international leagueleading 349 and stole 40 bases and led them to the little world series championship april 15 1947 robinsons first majorleague game it was the most eagerly anticipated debut in the annals of the national pastime wrote robert lipsyte and pete levine in idols of the game it represented both the dream and the fear of equal opportunity and it would change forever the complexion of the game and the attitudes of americans robinson went hitless but did score the winning run that season the 28yearold rookie played first base the only position open on the dodgers he would move back to second base the next year the new position was easy compared to all he had to endure  an abortive rebellion by some of his teammates the threat of a strike by the st louis cardinals black cats thrown on the field despite feeling the enormous pressure he kept his considerable temper under control just as he had promised rickey one poignant moment occurred when dodgers shortstop pee wee reese a native of louisville draped an arm over robinsons shoulder a quiet expression of support that spoke volumes zone pollby 1949 robinson was free to become his own man he became animated with his teammates the opposition the umpires when he felt an injustice he spoke his mind for this some thought he was an umpity nigger robinson said if a white player had shown the same fire he would have earned praise much like pete rose did the real robinson came into his own this mvp season leading the league with a 342 average and 37 steals he also had careerhighs in rbi 124 and runs 122 after a decade with brooklyn he was traded to the new york giants in december 1956 a month later the 37yearold robinson announced his retirement in look magazine he became a vice president for chock full o nuts before going into other businesses and politics but his body which had served him so well as an athlete gave out early diabetes and heart disease weakened him and he was almost blind in middle age on october 24 1972 he died of a heart attack at 53 in 1997 baseball dedicated the season to robinson on the 50th anniversary of his debut how should we remember this grandson of a slave and son of a sharecropper maybe by what he told a white new orleans sportswriter we ask for nothing special we ask only to be permitted to live as you live and as our nations constitution provides with such simple and justifiable demands its no wonder the man had such an impact on so many lives
