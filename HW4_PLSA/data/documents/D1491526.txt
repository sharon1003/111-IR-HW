new jersey undated passenger issue circa 1969 the black on buff new jersey plates were introduced in 1959 and issued through 1979 with some minor base changes these plates remain valid today with plate stickers having been introduced with late 1999 expirations plates in the p series tended to have been issued in 1968 or early 1969 new jersey undated passenger issue circa 1970 starting in mid to late1969 new jersey plates carried an experimental reflective backing that was started with the ria series of plates then discontinued after plate number szz999 new jersey didnt return to plate reflectorization until the early 90s plates from this era can be difficult to date but luckily i heard from another collector that he himself was issued a plate in this ryv series a mere 69 plates lower than this one in fact in june 1970 id guess that this one was issued probably within a day or two of his new jersey undated passenger issue circa 1971 standard nonreflective black on buff plates were issued from plate number uaa001 through the end of the series at yzz999 plates in the t series were used for trailer registrations and not used within the passenger series new jersey undated passenger issue circa 1973 when plate number yzz999 was reached in 1973 nj switched to a reverseseries 123abc format the z series was not issued until approximately 1985 on a different baseplate plates of this era had a slightly lighter color of buff background this plate would have been issued in approximately 1973 based on my estimates new jersey undated passenger issue circa 1977 starting with plate number 100hca the full state name was added to these plates this was the first time in new jersey plate history that the entire state name appeared on a plate this variation existed through the end of the kzz series when the baseplate was changed for a new design new jersey undated passenger issue circa 1978 another of the fully embossed state name issues this one uses an alternate state name die which appeared seemingly randomly throughout this stretch the difference between the dies is most apparent when looking at the w in new with this version being substantially wider than the other version this particular plate also seems to have a much darker background color than others ive seen again this tended to vary somewhat depending on the production run new jersey undated passenger issue circa 1979 these buffonblue plates were introduced in 1979 and started with plate number 100laa aside from the obvious color scheme changes one of the uglier combinations in history but in a nice way a small stateshaped divider was also added to the plate this base was issued through 1993 and these plates although being phased out through attrition can still be seen in great numbers on the road new jersey undated passenger issue circa 1985 when plate number 999zzz was reached around 1985 the state went back and issued plates in the previously skipped zaa100 through zzz999 series other previouslyskipped combinations were also issued at this time to try to stretch out the sequence for a little longer eventually all combinations were exhausted and a new format was introduced new jersey undated passenger issue circa 1985 once the zaazzz series and other combinations were used up the series switched to this abc12d format this format has also been used over the years by florida and texas on passenger issues this series was used through 1993 and was discontinued suspended actually  see the last couple plates on the page at the end of the h series at hzz99z new jersey undated passenger issue circa 1993 this new reflective baseplate was introduced in 1993 and was intended to replace all existing 19591993 plates rather than picking up the numbering series where the last plates left off new jersey opted for a new format altogether and the sevendigit abc1234 format was selected these plates were very hard to read at a distance however so they were changed to an ab123c format shortly thereafter the seven digit plates were not recalled and can still be seen on the road new jersey undated passenger issue circa 1994 this is one of the ab123c format plates on the current graphic reflective base this series began at plate number ba100a as the a series was skipped due to similarity with the sevendigit plates the a series was later issued for apportioned truck plates starting in 1996 the stateshaped divider was also returned to the plates with the new format this format lasted until mid1998 when it was exhausted and replaced by a return to the abc12d format at jaa10a see 2000 plate new jersey undated passenger issue circa 1998 same series as above this was one of a limited production run of reflective screened new jersey plates that were stamped onto older blue blanks the result is a regular format current plate with a blue back and blue showing at the very edges of the plate blue paint can also be seen if the plate is scratched as seen on the top left bolthole on this plate new jersey undated passenger issue circa 1999 in 1998 new jersey ran out of combinations in the ab123c numbering series and reverted back to where the 1979 series tan on blue plates had left off at plate number jaa10a plates in this format were initially issued without plate stickers like every other issue from 1959 through 1999 stickers were implemented starting with plates expiring in november 2000 however see next plate new jersey 2000 passenger issue near the middle of the j series in this format the state began using plate validation stickers on passenger plates for the first time the first of these stickers expired in november 2000 this was done as a result of more stringent emissions inspections being introduced to the state so vehicle inspections still noted by a windshield sticker were changed to every two years yearly registrations remain as indicated by the new plate stickers stickers can be used on any new jersey plate from 1959 forward so older plates are still not being completely replaced at this time new jersey 2002 passenger issue in 2001 the contract for producing the reflective background for new jersey plates was awarded to the avery corporation who also supplies material to a few other states north carolina ohio wisconsin for example these plates have sort of a sheen to them for lack of a better description the avery plates in new jersey are also different in that the font for the state name has been increased slightly in size this change is reported to have occurred around the late lgx series of plates although the change was not a clean break and plates in the late lgx and early lhx series can be found on both bases new jersey 2005 passenger issue well after joining the evergrowing number of states to start using avery reflective sheeting in 2001 new jersey also joined the evergrowing number of states to stop using the sheeting due to poor durability in early 2004 avery by all accounts makes pretty good reflective sheeting for things like road signs etc but the stuff just doesnt seem to like being embossed as a result the sheeting cracks at the edges of the numbers and starts looking terrible usually within only one or two years of use new jersey returned to using 3m materials at some point in the pxrpxs series new jersey undated passenger issue circa exp 2005 after a glorious fiveyear stretch of issuing perhaps the worstmade plate validation stickers in the history of adhesive products new jersey ended up discontinuing plate stickers in mid2004 as a result plates from the midr series and above will once again be valid without stickers law enforcement in the state apparently never quite embraced the idea of the plate stickers so now theyll get to deal with vehicles bearing no outward proof of registration at all new jersey undated passenger issue circa exp 2008 having eliminated plate stickers after 2005 new jersey apparently decided in 2007 that having the two prominent sticker boxes at the top corners of the plate was no longer necessary these plates started appearing in mid2007 in the latter part of the vxx series there apparently is not a clean break between the types as the boxless type was first reported as early as vyx but most of the vzx series did have the boxes plates from at least vzu forward seem to be consistantly without boxes new jersey undated passenger issue circa exp 2011 new jersey ran out of available combinations in the abc12d series after zzz99z was reached in 2010 at that point the format was flipped to an a12bcd format with the plate remaining otherwise unchanged the serial progression works the same on these plates as well where on the old format aaa99a would be followed by aaa10b on these a99aaa was followed by b10aaa etc this is a departure from the progression used by some other states which have used this format in the past texas florida where the first letter has remained constant quebec also recently began using this format progressing as the new jersey version does new jersey undated passenger issue circa exp 2015 new jersey began issuing flat plates in april 2014 reportedly at the beginning of the eff series these plates use the same 3m serial font as south dakota minnesota and several other states with a larger more detailed state shape separator than the old embossed version a bar code was also added to the bottom right of the plate the plate design remains otherwise unchanged
