costume colour and semiotics of heathers4 oct ’13 lord christopher laverty clothes from 1980s girls in films premium filmmaker and costume designer sophie black recounts her personal interpretation of heathers a film defined by vivid visual interpretation it is just a coincidence that the first time i saw michael lehmann’s heathers 1988 was within hours of the first time i saw david lynch’s blue velvet 1986 and i immediately made comparisons between the two films which i may have not noticed otherwise more people are quick to compare heathers to the work of tim burton because of the associates he had on the film producer denise di novi and star winona ryder to name but two and the fact that the candycoloured suburban setting mirrors that of edward scissorhands 1990 but the picketfenced world of blue velvet equally does so and preceded both films and only blue velvet matches heathers in its extremity at portraying unusual characters and capricious changes in editing and tone one cannot also help but find comparisons between heathers and david lynch’s twin peaks 1991 – 1991 which came later but which featured a similar high school setting and the characters which the american high school scene demands the jocks the teenage beauties and the outcast darkly dressed angry teenage boy plus in a note of trivia twin peaks star heather graham was offered the role of heather mc namara in heathers before her parents disallowed it but to hone all these lynchian notes into one clear source of inspiration one needs to only look at the scenes including and leading up to heather chandler’s death veronica winona ryder and the aptlynamed jason dean christian slater walk into the aforementioned heather’s kitchen like two darklyclad creatures creeping into heather’s world the kitchen is littered with red objects not mainly because the addition of red items in a kitchen add a retrokitsch look but because production designer jon hutman is playing with the semiotics of the colour red in a way that would make lynch proud he uses this colour in clever flashes throughout his own films because as i said this is heather chandler’s world and the addition of red throughout refers to one little costume accessory her red scrunchy the use of red in art often reflects themes of lust war and blood – all of which this film uses it for throughout – and giving it to heather chandler as her signature colour suits her character perfectly for all these reasons but above all the colour red here is a symbol of power and wearing the red scrunchy shows everyone around her that heather chandler is the leader like a queen wearing a crown the opening shot in fact shows her putting on the scrunchy before leading the other heathers in a somewhat cruel game of croquet by always wearing the colour red in other elements of her clothing heather chandler reinforces this power leaving the other colours for the rest of her group – veronica in blue heather mc namara in yellow and heather duke at first in green green not being one of the primary colours pushes heather duke out of the group slightly making her more of an outcast than veronica who heather chandler favours more highly in spite of the name when playing croquet heather chandler reminds them all that “i’m always red” and she says a lot with this line i’ve always believed that production design and costume design are part of the same discipline and great film design should always be in sync to create the type of overall look that heathers achieves because the colour red leaks into the rest of the film’s ‘world’ not only in heather chandler’s home even in the linings of her drawers and in her locker – even the stationery that she uses – but in the environment of the other characters as well the school’s signature colour is red shown in the jocks’ sport jackets and in the inserts of the cheerleader’s skirts with the principal constantly wearing a red tie even the straws the pupils drink their milk out of is red – and red flowers are featured throughout which unsurprisingly the three heathers walk all over in neatasapin coloured shoes by featuring the colour in all aspects of the film it shows heather chandler’s power over the school and later – after her death and through the media – the larger world around her after heather chandler’s framed ‘suicide’ the oppressed heather duke steps up – with some encouragement by jd – and wears the scrunchy herself signalling her promotion to head of the group at first she wears this red scrunchy with her allocated green ensembles but then adds a red belt at which point she starts a game of croquet with veronica echoing heather chandler’s words with “i’m red” and finally dons a full red suit and similarlycoloured blouse as she basks in the sunlight and in her new power and glory by wearing heather chandler’s colour she adopts her attitude and her bitchiness in a similar way to how the wearer of laura palmer’s sunglasses in twin peaks immediately becomes sultry and confident when alone in her own space there is no red in veronica’s world just as there is little suggestion of yellow or green the set dressing reflects the costumes again with blue objects dotted around her desk and bedside table even the lighting echoes this with an unnatural blue light appearing at windows when veronica is alone and even behind jd as though this light were suggesting that he and veronica are kindred spirits luring her towards him veronica is completely at one in her own space and more herself when away from the heathers – at one point the costume and set design is so in sync that blue stripes on veronica’s collar perfectly echo the blue stripes on the curtains behind her this signature colour is not lost on the other characters – when mocking veronica heather chandler refers to her as a ‘bluebird’ although allocated a colour the reclusive veronica opts more for blacks and greys with hints of blue through her jewellery or hosiery her hair is darker than the heathers’ and her whole appearance suggests that she is not one of them and that she is miserable amongst them without going so far as to give her costumes a gothic look that resembles ryder’s character in beetlejuice released in the same year as heathers in the scene when we are first introduced to the heathers group and shown their place within the student body all four are wearing skirt suits this was typical of 80s ‘power dressing’ and immediately gives them status in the same way it does for similar characters in 1995’s clueless with heathers mc namara and duke playing it safe in allover yellow and green respectively heather chandler teams her scrunchy with a skirt in the exact same shade of red whilst clearly being part of the group in a similarlyshaped jacket veronica opts for a black patchwork print with military style frog fastenings on her blouse immediately showcasing her different nature and own sense of quirky style however by carrying heather chandler’s red clipboard at the same time she shows the power that the heathers still have over her at this point in the story when heather chandler and veronica go to a university boys’ party they dress to impress although veronica reluctantly so heather wears all over figurehugging red with a shaped 1940s neckline and eramatching pearls she is the picture of a femme fatale and wants others to see her that way although this is an image she comes to detest as we see when she’s alone in the bathroom veronica’s pinafore dress is also figurehugging mimicking heather chandler’s style one cannot help but think that heather had a say in what veronica is wearing here and she showcases her attempt at sultry sophisticated style but by staying in her comfort colours of grey and black with blue featured in a brooch on her chest and by wearing layers she’s still very much veronica her shoulders are on show but little else – and this revelation of skin is cut into by blocks of thick black straps nonetheless when she sees jd before the party she seductively sucks on a red twizzler suggesting that she needs a little of heather chandler’s essence in her in order to act sexy the night robe that heather chandler wears when she dies is perhaps the most noteworthy of rudy dillon’s costume designs for this film she sleeps in her scrunchy almost protectively and her robe reflects the powersuits she’s worn before with a similar collar and doublebreasted buttons the brocade silk fabric of the robe is fauxrich and she looks regal as she sits up in bed surrounded by similar silks and colours in the set design dillon may have softened her colour pallete from red to pink here after all she is the victim in this scene but she still has power in her final moments on the back of the robe are two large bows which work to cinch in the robe at the waist these are not just a dated piece of gaudy 80’s fashion but add interest to the scene in an important way as any costume designer knows if a character is about to fall to the ground on their front you had better put the most costume detail on their backcolour plays another important role here in the form of liquid when heather chandler accidentally drinks the bright blue drain unblocker that kills her it stains her tongue and lips blue as she chokes blue represents veronica throughout this film and never more so than here although jd put the blue liquid into the cup it represents veronica taking power over her ‘friend’ and forcing control over her life whereas when heather mc namara goes to kill herself later in the film the tablets she puts into her mouth are yellow – her signature colour – showing that this act is her choice alone as heather mc namara puts it “suicide is a private thing”although she wears hints of blue throughout the film veronica does not embrace this colour fully until after heather chandler’s death when she wears full blue suits these ensembles even going as far as to her hat in heather chandler’s funeral scene she is freer without heather chandler and happier because of her romance with jd and these bursts of colour show a blossoming of spirit for veronica’s final costume she wears a thick grey jacket over a blue top this jacket with its full peplum and large shoulders evokes not only power dressing but also gives veronica a sort of victorian heroine look with this jacket on and the confidence in her face she has the strength to confront jd for his wrongdoings and ultimately to take power – and the red scrunchy – back for herself heathers writer daniel waters when interviewed has said that he wanted stanley kubrick to direct the film looking at films such as a clockwork orange it is easy to see how the director would’ve worked with the material and christian slater who evoked jack nicholson for his role as jd would clearly have loved to be mentored by the shining director but with some suspension of disbelief one can imagine how david lynch would’ve treated it too the editing and performances would’ve been changed and the bizarre elements exaggerated the original ending where they all dance together in heaven’s version of a prom would certainly have been kept but i imagine the set and costume design would remain the same by sophie black sophie black is an independent filmmaker costume and production designer
