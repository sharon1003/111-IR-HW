the safe way to use ozone generators are you concerned about using an ozone machine near your family or coworkers perhaps youve been told ozone is dangerous but yet you hear others are having great success using it you need to know ozone is like many other essentials in life a little is good a lot is not too much food can make you overweight too much water can cause drowning and taking too much of a lifesaving medication can make you very ill at high concentrations ozone can cause chest pain coughing shortness of breath and throat irritation ozone may also worsen chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma and compromise the ability of the body to fight respiratory infections people vary widely in their susceptibility to ozone therefore you should only run ozone machines on very low settings in well ventilated spaces if people and pets are present so to use ozone safely consider what problem or problems you need to treat with ozone are you looking to merely sanitize the air you breath get rid of cooking odors or remove the smell of stale tobacco in a space which you occupy on a regular basis like your home office or vehicle if so ozone generators can be used in these spaces while they are occupied only as long the ozone concentration remains below the safe level specified by osha or the epa typically this can be accomplished with an inexpensive machine like our dc12 but if larger concentrations of ozone are required it can still be a highly effective solution  but that amount of ozone needs to be produced in an area while it is not occupied by people pets or plants if you want the safest way to use ozone generators just run them when the space is unoccupied utilize the timers available on many of our units to switch on our ozone generators while you are out of the building and shut them off an hour or so before you return so the ozone has time to safely dissipate turn back into oxygen prior to reoccupying the space in your vehicle you can run it for 23 hours during the night and start your day with a clean bacteria free ride to work check out these models that have builtin timers pro4pro8you may also safely operate our machines on their higher settings in an adjacent room as long as the door is shut or another barrier plastic sheet is employed between the occupied space and the room being treated generating ozone in the basement while you occupy the upper floors is generally not a problem as ozone is heavier than air so it will remain down it the basement ozone generators are ideal for certain specific applications such as killing mold killing mildew killing bacteria getting rid of odors killing mold mildew and other germs takes high concentrations of ozone so that should only be done when a room is unoccupied mold is also much tougher to treat than common odors so plan on running a properly sized ozone generator for at least 30 hours in each room being treated the ozone concentration needed to kill mold shock treatment is well beyond the level that is safe to breathe it is similar to fumigating a room in your house for bugs you wouldnt want to stay in the room breathing those chemicals luckily ozone doesnt smell as bad and doesnt linger as long as those bug killers the best models for for killing mold are pro8pro44ozone generators do not remove dust particles from the air filter the air or remove cigarette smoke they do remove smoke odor lingering in the carpet or on the walls and furniture — either from tobacco products or from a fire ozone generators work well in removing odors from automobiles boats and recreational vehicles they do not mask odors ozone generators destroy odors never to return there are two proven ways to get rid of mold and mildew in your home or office one is to remove all of the moldcontaminated material in the building a reputable mold remediation company should be employed for this job as it involves handling some very nasty material and should be performed by personnel protected with hazardous material gear if done properly it is the most thorough method but it is costly usually 8000 and up using an ozone generator is the other proven method that is much less expensive 85 to 90 less a sufficiently high concentration of ozone will kill airborne mold the most dangerous type and the most likely to end up in your lungs but it is important to use a high output ozone machine several thousands of milligrams per hour mgph and these output ratings must be based on using normal air as the source gas  not pure oxygen see our learn the truth about ozone generator ratings page for more informationozone generators will also kill the surface mold on any material it contacts ozone is like air if air can reach the mold ozone can reach the mold and kill it permanently neither air nor ozone can penetrate dry wall wood or other nonporous building products it is difficult for ozone to get into the padding under carpets or inside stuffed furniture so remember killing mold is a serious issue and the higher the ozone output the better but if your budget dictates a bare bones approach here is an powerful mold killer and it is on sale right now
