necessarily equal degree of gloading complicated © institute for applied psychometrics kevin mc grew 02101422 cognitively complex design characteristics lohman 2011 • larger number of cognitive component processes parameters of cognitive efficiency in info proc models • accumulation of speed component differences • increased demands of attentional control ac  working memory • more important component processes eg inference • more demands on adaptive functions assembly control and monitoring23 one design objective in the wj iv was to increase the cognitive complexity requirements for selected tests and clusters to provide greater ecological validity and interpretive relevance of the measures approach 1 increasing the cognitive complexity of a test is often accomplished by making the test a mixed measure of more than one narrow chc ability factorially complex mixed chc measures approach 2 a second approach is to increase the complexity of information processing demands of the tests within a specific narrow chc domain lohman  larkin 2011 mc grew in press b this second form of cognitive complexity not to be confused with factorial complexity places greater demands on cognitive information processing cognitive load requires greater allocation of key cognitive resources working memory or attentional control and invokes the involvement of more cognitive control or executive functions arend colom botella contreras rubio  santacreu 2003 jensen 2011 lohman  larkin 2011 marshalek lohman  snow 1983 this second approach to increasing test cognitive complexity was a

psychometrics kevin mc grew 012314 wechsler arithmetic test27 approach 2 is to increase the complexity of information processing demands of the tests within a specific chc cognitive functional domain tasks are still as relatively pure a measure of the chc domain as possible but there is a deliberate increase in the number of “minipulleys” cognitive information component complexity that work together within the chc domain this was the primary approach used for certain wj iv tests ga gv gwm © institute for applied psychometrics kevin mc grew 012314 gc gf glr gv gs28 professor butts and the
