tell me when they were done well it seems that i did something wrong when inserting the thermometer because the thighs were still undercooked how can you use a probe thermometer on a chicken thigh to accurately take its temperaturechicken temperatureshare improve this questionedited dec 20 14 at 1848cascabel ♦51k 13 140 252asked may 13 13 at 1946dforck42261 2 5 145how do you know that they were undercooked the main reason to use a thermometer is that its more accurate than other indicators – aaronut may 14 13 at 028food needs time to cook even its reach the temperature its still needs to stay there for a while for the texture to change and sometimes takes it longer to become safe to eat – user3528438 sep 8 17 at 1751add a comment6 answers active oldest votesup vote9down vote i assume you cooked your chicken thighs to 165–175°f 7480°c depending on preference 165°f 74°c is the recommended temperature for safety at least by us authorities 175°f 80°c is often recommended for texture in legs and thighs not for breast the best bet is to measure in several spots you generally want to guess the thickest spot of meat insert the probe past the center then slowly withdraw it how slowly depends on the response time of your probe you then use the lowest temperature you see especially if you see anything under the foodsafety temperature 165°f or 74°c if there are multiple pieces of chicken you should check several especially if theyre different sizes probe response times are anywhere from 20 seconds on fairly cheap thermometers down to 3 seconds on expensive ones like a thermopen 10 seconds is typical youll know its finished responding when the numbers stop changing quickly you also should rest the chicken loosely tented for at least 5 minutes for just thighs more like 15 minutes for a full chicken after taking it off the heat—this lets the heat even out and also will reduce the amount of juice lost when cuttingshare improve this answeredited may 13 13 at

give you a falsely high reading wait long enough for the temperature reading to stabilize which may be 510 seconds depending on your thermometernote that once you start measuring your temperature you may be cooking your thighs properly but may be so used to overcooked meat that properly cooked thighs are unpalatable to you of course you should find the temperature you like as long as it is above the safety threshold typically thighs would be cooked to about 165170 fshare improve this answeranswered may 13 13 at 1951saj14saj657k 12 123 196when you freshly insert the thermometer the temperature is going to still be going up—so failing to wait for it when youve just stuck it in would result on overcooking – derobert may 13 13 at 1957derobert erm it does say wait long enough for the temperature reading to stabalize what i am i missing – saj14saj may 13 13 at 1959op complained of it being undercooked not overcooked im just saying that failing to wait probably wasnt ops problem – derobert may 13 13 at 20001this is an answer on properly not just one form of the error  – saj14saj may 13 13 at 2002add a commentup vote3down vote according to the fsis site you should check the temperature in the thickest part of the thigh the middle of it is the part that will take the longest to cook so thats where you should put the tip of the probe take care to not touch the bones since they can conduct the heat from the outside and give an incorrect reading finally it will depend on your taste but i would overcook it the first time lets say 165 f and then see if its more or less to your desired point then i would adjust the temperature to the desired tasteshare improve this answeredited may 13 13 at 2104wax eagle960 7 16answered may 13 13 at 2008woliveirajr277 1 4 14add a

digital thermometers check manufacturers directions insert in a way that the sensing area is in the center of the thickest part of the food and not touching bone fat or gristle ideally you would require about 15 to 20 seconds for the temperature to be accurately displayed on a dial thermometer and about 10 seconds on a digital thermometer thinner foodsinsert the thermometer sideways with the

of the thigh and try to also hit the bone as the thickest part will have a bone n the middle also the last places to reach temperature are always closest to the bone i never put the probe near the ends of the bone where its not thickest anyway and ive never had a false high reading just let the point touch the bone but dont push it into the bone i like to hit the bone with the point at the thickest spot if its 165 there then the rest is good i also pick the thickest piece if they dont vary much in size if they vary i check the smallest first i pick them off from smallest to largest as they reach 165share improve this answeredited nov 11 15 at 508answered nov 11 15 at 502sean w1 11interesting another answer says to never touch the bones because they can falsify the reading do you have a source for the bone touching thing – rumtscho ♦ nov 11 15 at 1148add a commentup vote1down vote make sure youre not measuring the temp of the pan as well just put the thermometer into the meat far enough that youre measuring in the middle of the piece of meatshare improve this answeranswered sep 7 17 at 2210user613591please do not repeat answers already given – jan doggen sep 8 17 at 734add
