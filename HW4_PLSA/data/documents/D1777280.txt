vegan  vegetarian nutrition vegan  vegetarian nutrition vegetarians can rest assured plantbased foods are loaded with nutrients including ampleprotein iron calcium vitamin d  iodine  omega3 fatty acids and zinc vegans require a reliable source of vitamin b12 whether you eat a vegetarian or nonvegetarian diet the key to health is simple include a wide variety of different foods in your diet – no one food source is nutritionally complete by itself vegetarians choose foods from grains vegetables legumes nuts seeds and fruits whole unrefined foods are best eggs and dairy are optional on a plantbased diet you will have the distinct advantage of obtaining nutrients from sources high in fibre and low in saturated fat and cholesterol click veg nutritonfeb06 for a print version protein most people can easily meet their protein needs by eating a variety of whole grains legumes and vegetables on a daily basis although there is somewhat less protein in a vegetarian diet this is actually an advantage as excess protein has been linked to heart disease cancer kidney disease and osteoporosis foods high in protein include tofu tempeh tvp beans nuts seeds soy milk some vegetables such as broccoli asparagus spinach snowpeas brussels sprouts eggs and dairy products it was once thought that foods had to be combined within a single meal to provide complete protein the latest research indicates that an assortment of plant foods eaten over the course of a day can provide all of the essential amino acids you need this is the postion of american dietetic association iron the american dietetic association’s position paper on vegetarian diets says “incidence of iron deficiency anemia among vegetarians is similar to that of nonvegetarians although vegetarian adults have lower iron stores than nonvegetarians their serum ferritin levels are usually within the normal range”the richest plant sources of iron are fortified breakfast cereals  soy products and legumes whole grains dark green vegetables dried fruits nuts and seeds potato with skin and blackstrap molasses cooking with castiron pots especially water based acidic foods like tomato sauce also contributes to dietary intake adding fruits and vegetables high in vitamin c ascorbic acid to your meals such as citrus peppers cabbage broccoli tomatoes and greens like kale and collards enhances iron absorption the same is true for other organic acids in fruits and vegetables calcium supplements black or green tea coffee and chocolate inhibit iron absorption if eaten at the same time as iron dairy products contain very little iron only about one fifth of the iron in a standard diet comes from meat but plants contain nonheme iron which is not as easily absorbed as the heme iron that makes up two thirds of the iron in meat because of this the rda for iron has been set higher for vegetarians in canada and the us it is 33 mg per day for vegetarian women verses 18 mg per day for meateating women for meateating men and postmenopausal women it is 8 mg of iron a day but for vegetarians in this group it is 14 mg according to jack norris rd this is controversial because the recommendations were not based on studies of vegetarians but instead on vegetarian diets designed to reduce iron absorption the rdas for vegetarians don’t properly take into account the benefits of adding vitamin c and avoiding tea and coffee at meals also norris has observed that some women have trouble getting enough iron on a vegetarian diet initially but over time their bodies become efficient at absorbing nonheme iron due to blood loss during menstruation iron deficiency anemia is more of a concern for adult women than it is for men there are some advantages to having a lower iron intake lower iron levels are associated with higher glucose tolerance and might help prevent diabetes and high iron levels have been linked to cancer calcium dairy products are high in calcium but needs can also be met on a wellplanned vegan diet rich plant food sources include dark green vegetables such as broccoli bok choy and kale beans tofu made with calcium tahini sesame seeds almonds figs seaweeds unrefined molasses and fortified soy milks since the consumption of animal protein increases calcium requirements a person following a vegan diet may have much lower needs although some plant foods contain oxalates and phytate which can inhibit calcium absorption the calcium in plant foods is generally well absorbed vitamin dthis vitamin is essential for the absorption of calcium and is formed in the presence of direct or indirect sunlight your body stores vitamin d during the summer for winter use on average about 10 to 15 minutes a day of sun on the face and hands for lightskinned people should suffice darkerskinned people the elderly and those at higher latitudes may need more sun exposure sunscreen lotion rated spf 8 or above prevents vitamin d synthesis dairy products and some rice and soy milks are fortified with vitamin d people getting insufficient sun or not eating fortified foods should consider taking a daily multiple vitamin that includes 400 iu of vitamin d zinc zinc is readily available in many plant foods such as whole grains breads pasta rice wheat germ tofu tempeh millet quinoa miso legumes sprouts nuts and seeds as well as eggs and dairy products vitamin b12very low b12 intakes can cause anemia and nervous system damage both vegans and omnivores have a reason to be cautious as changes to food patterns such as an increase in pesticide insecticide and herbicide use and increase washing of foods removes a lot of the b12 previously found in dirt and soil the only reliable vegan sources are foods fortified with b12 including some rice and soy milks some breakfast cereals and red star nutritional yeast vegetarian support formula b12 supplements and some multivitamins in the past some nonanimal items such as spirulina tempeh miso and soil were considered as possible sources but these have proven to be unreliable in the absence of any apparent dietary supply deficiency symptoms usually take five years or more to develop in adults though some people experience problems within a year long term studies of vegans have detected a very low rate of b12 deficiency some people including meateaters have problems absorbing b12 it’s especially important for women to ensure b12 intake when pregnant or breastfeeding iodine regular iodized table salt is fortified with plenty of iodine but if you use sea salt instead be sure your diet includes a reliable source sea salt contains very little iodine the best sources are seaweed  vegetables grown near the ocean and many vitamin and mineral supplements also some breads use dough stabilizers that contain iodine iodine is needed for the normal metabolism of cells omega3 fatty acids omega3 fatty acids include ala epa and dha alphalinolenic acid ala is found mainly in the oil of flaxseeds hemp seeds walnuts rapeseed  canola oil and soybeans ala reduces blood clotting and is good for the heart the body converts some of the ala into two other essential omega3 fats called epa and dha these two are also found to a small degree in seaweeds and there are vegan dha supplements available made from microalgae low levels of dha have been associated with depression however a tablespoon of ground flaxseeds or a teaspoon of flax oil per day will meet the needs of most people all other essential vitamins minerals fats and carbohydrates are widely found in the plant kingdom these nutrients can be easily obtained by maintaining variety in a plant food diet if you have difficulty adapting to a vegetarian diet it may be that your body needs a few months to adjust and detoxify try experimenting with a variety of foods and cooking methods if you have concerns about a nutrient deficiency you can always have your blood tested but rest assured that a varied vegetarian diet lacks no nutrients and is proven to be a powerful health promoting choice bon appetitreviewed by annemarie roy r d except for the iron section which was updated in oct 2009 links updated in 2013notes and links

western diet the average person consumes about double the protein their body needs excess protein is linked to osteoporosis and kidney disease heart disease can be another risk factor since highprotein diets often encourage consumption of meat eggs and dairy products which in turn are all high in cholesterol fat and saturated fat also certain proteins present in meat and fish are linked
