2017 toyota prius prime first drive will the second time be a charm for the prius plugin hybrid by gabe shenhar august 04 2016what a difference four years make toyota succumbed to customer pressure to roll out a prius plugin in 2012 seemingly without enthusiasm indeed it was a halfhearted effort that promised some electriconly range but resorted to turning its gas engine on at every opportunity unsurprisingly in our owner satisfaction survey the prius plugin hybrid ranked well below the regular prius clearly the company could do better it’s no secret that toyota believes in hybrids and stays away from fully electric vehicles and until now even true plugin hybrids it seems that the automaker heard those evleaning buyers loud and clear as evidenced by the new 2017 toyota prius prime with the fourthgeneration prius the plugin takes on a dedicated name several styling detail differences and most important the ability to go all electric—no ifs ands or buts we got a firsthand experience with the prius prime by renting one from toyota the car goes on sale in the fall thanks to an 88k wh lithiumion battery the car has a claimed range of 22 miles unlike its predecessor it remains in electric mode even at full throttle or climbing hills once past those electric miles the prime reverts to regular hybrid operation there is also a recharging mode which runs the engine to supply the battery with juice—handy for recapturing some electric miles for future use but there are no free rides—that recharging cuts into fuel economy by how much we’ll find out when we buy our own prime in the fall and test it thoroughly prices for the toyota prius prime are expected to begin where a wellequipped prius leaves off about the mid30000s three equipment levels are available with the top trim distinguished by a larger touch screen and fauxleather seats with a power driver seat in our hands we actually observed a 28mile pureelectric range without trying toyota says it takes 25 hours to recharge at 240 volts a claim we will soon verify suffice it to say that the car can be charged overnight at the standard 120 volts even if that takes six hours unlike the regular prius the 2017 toyota prius prime is only a fourseater toyota says that the big battery takes up the space and due to the curved rear window theres not a rear wiper don’t be fooled by the mere 121horsepower stat the prime takes off with authority with a full battery the car is committed to deliver an electric car experience complete with nearsilent running and brisk response in hybrid operation it functions much like a regular prius with which we got 52 mpg overall when we tested it ultimately the 2017 toyota prius prime promises a combined range of more than 600 miles a long press on the mode button shifts into battery recharge mode in which the engine works constantly and thus buzzes monotonously it doesn’t take long before you gain five or six miles of electric range which can be used in an urban environment or anywhere else in other respects the prime drives very similarly to the regular prius with a comfortable steady ride and handling that’s responsive and secure though not sporty top trim lines get a large tesla like touch screen that serves as the gateway to the audio system trip information phone and navigation the expression “can’t see the forest for the trees” is most apt here you’ll get toyota’s various apps and other secondary items before you’ll figure out how to get simple goodold fm radio yes it’s that maddening the seat heater controls seem like they were added as an aftethought—the switch is low and far away on the dash practically by your ankles advanced active safety systems are standard including active cruise control automatic emergency braking and automatic high beams for people who think the regular prius is too much of a commodity and relies too much on gas yet aren’t ready to fully embrace a dedicated ev the 2017 toyota prius prime provides a bridge much like the chevrolet volt the prius prime can go electric for short distances and rely on its hybrid powertrain for longer trips with no range worries check back with us for more on the toyota prius prime once we buy our own and fully test it read our complete toyota prius road test 58hybridsevs in our ratings current hybridev ratings gabe shenhar im an engineer test driver auto journalist and consumer advocate rolled into one my 25 years of experience includes taking cars to their limits and sometimes beyond writing thousands of road test reports participating in grassroots motorsports and instructing advanced driving courses if i’m not doing laps on the test track i’m doing laps in the pool follow me on twitter crcars gabe
