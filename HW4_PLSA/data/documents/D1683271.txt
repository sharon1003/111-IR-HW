different religions  i always believe that it is much better to have a variety of religions a variety of philosophies rather than one single religion or philosophy this is necessary because of the

numerous appearances in interfaith services imparting the message of universal responsibility love compassion and kindness  the need for simple humantohuman relationships is becoming increasingly urgent    today the world is smaller and more interdependent one nations problems can no longer be solved by itself completely thus without a sense of universal responsibility our very survival becomes threatened basically universal responsibility is feeling for other peoples suffering just as we feel our own it is the realization that even our enemy is entirely motivated by the quest for happiness we must recognize that all beings want the same thing that we want this is the way to achieve a true understanding unfettered by artificial consideration  from les prix nobel the nobel
