when we asked if canada was okay my teacher replied that we would have to get the person from a francophone province is ontario one of those provinces or is it just quebec2 following 21 answers answers relevance rating newest oldest best answer nope quebec is the only canadian province with a predominantly french speaking population and the only one whose sole official language is french at the provincial level★hig htƹc h★ · 10 years ago5 1 comment quebec is the only province that uses french as its official language and has laws that prevent the use of other languages in its businesses and on public signs for example although i deal almost exclusively with us customers my office is required to install the french version of windows on my pc because our company has over fifty employees new brunswick and winnipeg both also have a high francophone community but i think that new brunswick is the only one that made their province officially bilingual the rest are all english although you are supposed to be entitled to services from the government all across the country in both languages the french dialect spoken in quebec is often referred to as quebecois the french in new brunswick is more of an acadian dialect the main french group in manitoba are decendants of the french metis and so each region may not sound quite the same if you want to listen to french radio from quebec i have supplied a couple of links if you have to dress up as a french quebecer the best costume would be that of the traditional quebec trappeurs which hunted beavers and other animals in 18th century new france canada for the fur to be sent back to france traditionally the look was cotton or wool pants suede jacket with tassles a toque cotton or woolen hat with pompom and you might be carrying a hunting rifle and a fur skin keep in mind that this is not what quebecers look like today lol  what i described is the way the hudsons bay trading company fur trappers were shown in our canadian history books in school if you were looking at three people from quebec ontario and say ohio in todays world you probably would not be able to tell them apart until they started speaking to you source shttpwwwckoicomhttpwwwradioenergiecomaccueilphp steve n · 10 years ago3 0 comment french speaking part of canada source shttpsshorteimba d0h · 1 year ago0 0 comment ontario is not officially a bilingual province but in practice it is the government of ontario offers services in both languages and many official documents issued by the province are in both english and french during election campaigns some signs are bilingual and some politicians even speak french in the legislature the percentage of residents who use french at home is about 5 mostly concentrated in cities such as hawkesbury clarencerockland ottawa sudbury sault ste marie and hearst i think that quebec new brunswick and ontario would be acceptable for your projectjust another guy · 10 years ago0 1 comment quebec is the mainly french speaking province all of canada is officially a frenchenglish bilingual country but honestly about 98 of the french speakers reside in quebec the areas on the border of quebec and ontario consists of french speakers but truly the rest of the country is mainly english fluent in most of quebec other than montreal the people can barely speak a word of english ive experienced it they didnt understand a thing i was saying and if a french speaking canadian went to any of the other provinces that consists of mainly english speakers they wouldnt understand a thing that the other person would be saying source s myself ive lived in british columbia alberta quebec and ontario misskt · 10 years ago5 1 comment outside of france canada has a significant frenchspeaking population particularly in quebec province and also in some areas of new brunswick nova scotia newfoundland and ontario provinces among all provinces only quebec has the french speakers as the majority although montreal and few cities in this province have significant englishspeaking population since you are doing a project on regional cultures of frenchspeaking regions i suggest you to pick quebec province as the prominent representative of french canadian since the province of quebec is already wellknown for having a distinctive french culture and language good luck on your projectchy5398p · 10 years ago4 2 comment i have met hundreds of people of french heritage in ontario i found that thunder bay ottawa and niagara have a particularly high ratio of french people but i also found that most people of french heritage either forgot how or are embarrassed to speak french because quebecers make french people outside of quebec look bad i once knew some arrogant guys from hull quebec who would drive around and visit french areas in ontario just to tease start fights and act like jerks ive heard countless people from quebec talk down at people from ontario new brunsweck and nova scotia who speak french quebecers are full of them self and discourage french in other parts of canada smokers are dumb · 10 years ago0 1 comment quebec is a francophone province the only part of ontario that is truly bilingual is ottawa and virtually everyone there speaks both languages  but outside of ottawa most ontarians speak englishold lady · 10 years ago2 1 comment the majority of french speaking people in canada do reside in quebec so i would choose quebec for your project there are pockets of communities in ontario that are french speaking however the province with the largest french speaking population would be quebec bears mom · 10 years ago5 1 commentpretty much just quebec but all of canada is offically bilingual and so even someone from ontario would fit the project actually ontario does have a lot of french speaking areas in the north east section close to the quebec border ottawa in ontario is also completely bilingual the argument could be made that your contact in ontario would fit the bill wont be much problem dressing up like a canuck as basically the same as americansfreeside49 · 10 years ago3 4 comment french is the official language of both quebec new brunswick and the yukon are bilingual french and english northwest territories and nunavut are multilingual french english and native languages are all official every other province is officially english most people in british columbia speak english but there are many immigrants in the big cities in bc so unless you speak chinese dont expect everyone to speak your tongue · 2 years
