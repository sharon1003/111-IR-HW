of crust moves mainly in a horizontal direction san andreas fault epicenter epicenter epi being greek for above point directly above the hypocenter the locations of earthquakes are frequently identified by the geographic location of their epicenter the point on earths surface that is directly above the focus the point where an earthquake or underground explosion originates focus focus or hypocenter the point at which the slippage occurs fault plane where a fault has formed from a single fracture the fault plane is a surface along which fracture and displacement have taken place fault scarp the fault scarp is the feature on the surface of the earth that looks like a step caused by slip on the fault ground shaking and rupture are effects of an earthquake but these effects are often accompanied by a widespread surface rupture and displacement of earths surface althought most surface cracks produced by earthquakes are the result of liquefaction and landslides a major surface rupture may occur along the fault that was the source for the earthquake this rupture commonly creates a rift called a fault scarp which may extend for kilometers along the scarp p waves p waves also called compressional or primary waves are the faster of the two what waves cause the most damage surface waves what can p waves travel through they can travel through solid liquid and gas tf p waves travel much more quickly through solids than through liquids true how fast do p waves travel through earths crust 6 km per second through water 15 km per second s waves also called shear or secondary waves what can s waves travel through only solid materials do s waves travel faster or slower than p waves slower than p waves how fast do s waves travel through earths crust 3 km per second what type of motion do s waves make up and down an s shapewhy cant s waves move through water when liquids are subjected to sideways shear they are unable to spring back explaining why s waves cant move through liquids surface waves when p and s waves reach the land surface complex surface waves form and move along earths surface these waves travel more slowly than either p or s waves and they cause much of the damage near the epicenter travel of surface waves because surface waves have a complex horizontal and vertical ground movement or rolling motion they may crack walls and foundations of buildings bridges and roads what causes an earthquake a sudden release of stress and rocks sliding past each other what is a fault a fracture where rocks have been displaced tf all faults break the land surface false where are the highest concentration of earthquakes located tectonic plate boundaries what type of stress causes reverse thrust faulting compression which direction does the hanging wall move in a normal fault down which type of material causes the highest amount of shaking water saturated silt and mud what is an aftershock a smaller earthquake near the epicenter of the main event which direction does the hanging wall move in a reverse fault up what is the term for the spot where an earthquake originates focus what type of stress causes strikeslip transform faulting shear what type of stress causes normal faulting extension how is the epicenter of a fault determined triangulation how do p waves move back and forth slinkycan you tell waves apart on a seismogram yes the p s and surface waves can be identified by changes in the amplitude of the waves on the graph because p waves travel faster than s waves they will arrive first on the seismogram what is the moment magnitude scale seismologists to compare the energy released by different earthquakes on the basis of the area of the geological fault that ruptured in the quake moment magnitude is determined from an estimate of the area that ruptured along a fault plane during the quake the amount of of movement or slippage along the fault and the rigidity of the rocks near the focus of the quake what is the modified mercalli scale the moment magnitude scale provides a quantitative way of comparing earthquakes in contrast earthquake intensity is often indicated with the quantitative modified mercalli scale the 12 categories on this scale are assigned roman numerals each category contains a description of how people perceived the shaking from a quake and the extent of damage to buildings and other humanmade structures what is the term for the spot where an earthquake originates focus how is the epicenter of a fault determined triangulation hazards that result from an earthquake tsunami waves large waves cased by displacement of water liquefaction solid ground becoming a liquid during shaking regional changes in land elevation uplift subsidence mass movement landslides fires breaking of oilgas lines or electrical lines disease contaminated water loss of sanitation lisbon portugal 1755 originated in the atlantic ocean 200 km from cape vincent 87 to 90 earthquake geologic setting transform boundary near the atlantic ocean largest city in portugal  building heights should be restricted streets must be a minimum width fires and a tsunami san francisco 1906 occurred on the san andreas fault  fault runs from san francisco to los angeles fire lasted three days on a transform boundary lasted just over a minute fires caused most of the damage 78 magnitude great kanto eq japan 1923 79 september 1

turn natural disasters into political affairs natural disasters can trigger each other sumatra indonesia 2004 occurred 60 miles 100km off the west coast of the indonesian island of sumatra reverse fault hanging wall thrust upward causing the shock in the wave earthquake 92 the tsunami hit 20 minutes after the quake lessons learned importance of having proper technologywarning systems funding the sciences mitigation measures evacuation routs supply depots importance of effective supply inventory and personnel the most land that moved on the surface ever recorded longest duration of shaking from an earthquake ever recorded  length 400 km long and 100 km wide haiti 2010 71 earthquake center of quake is 15 miles away from the capital port au prince lessons learned buildings need better infrastructure more damage was done than the larger chili earthquake strike slip fault chile 2010 magnitude 88 shaking lasted 3 minutes occurred at the nazca and south american plate convergent plate boundary nazca subducts under the south american plate earthquake generated a tsunami displaced the sea floor motivated the chileans to build to a more sophisticated standard in the future so the housing stock the building stock is very very earthquakeresistant tohoku japan 2011 maximum magnitude of 90 maximum tsunami height of 133 feet 405 meters and went up to 6 miles near the e coast of honshu japan near the subduction zone interface plate boundary between the pacific and n american plates it was a thrust faulting near the subduction zone most of the damage was caused by the tsunami not the earthquake most of the damage was caused by the tsunami not the earthquake as a country they shut down all the nuclear power plants after the earthquake caused other countries to stop producing the nuclear power
