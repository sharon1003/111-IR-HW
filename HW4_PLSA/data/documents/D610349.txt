infants transition safely and it is up to the physician to assess risk factors identify the nearly 10 percent of infants who need resuscitation and respond appropriately a team or persons trained in neonatal resuscitation should be promptly available to provide resuscitation the neonatal resuscitation program which was initiated in 1987 to identify infants at risk of needing resuscitation and provide highquality resuscitation underwent major updates in 2006 and 2010 among the most important changes are to not intervene with endotracheal suctioning in vigorous infants born through meconiumstained amniotic fluid although endotracheal suctioning may be appropriate in nonvigorous infants to provide positive pressure ventilation with one of three devices when necessary to begin resuscitation of term infants using room air or blended oxygen and to have a pulse oximeter readily available in the delivery room the updated guidelines also provide indications for chest compressions and for the use of intravenous epinephrine which is the preferred route of administration and recommend not to use sodium bicarbonate or naloxone during resuscitation other recommendations include confirming endotracheal tube placement using an exhaled carbon dioxide detector using less than 100 percent oxygen and adequate thermal support to resuscitate preterm infants and using therapeutic hypothermia for infants born at 36 weeks gestation or later with moderate to severe hypoxicischemic encephalopathy nearly 10 percent of the more than 4 million infants born in the united states annually need some assistance to begin breathing at birth with approximately 1 percent needing extensive resuscitation 1 2 and about 02 to 03 percent developing moderate or severe hypoxicischemic encephalopathy 3 mortality in infants with hypoxicischemic encephalopathy ranges from 6 to 30 percent and significant morbidity such as cerebral palsy and longterm disabilities occurs in 20 to 30 percent of survivors 4 the neonatal resuscitation program nrp which was initiated in 1987 to identify infants at risk of respiratory depression and provide highquality resuscitation

neonatal resuscitation team a 1987 study showed that nearly 78 percent of canadian hospitals did not have a neonatal resuscitation team and physicians were called into a significant number of community hospitals 69 percent for neonatal resuscitation because they were not inhouse 8 national guidelines in the united states and canada recommend that a team or persons trained in neonatal resuscitation be promptly available for every birth 9 10 actual institutional compliance with this guideline is unknown in small hospitals a nonphysician neonatal resuscitation team is one way of providing inhouse coverage at all hours nrpcertified nurses nurse practitioners and respiratory therapists have demonstrated the capacity to lead resuscitations 11 – 13 however it is recommended that an nrpcertified physician be present in the hospital when a highrisk delivery is anticipated 11 – 13 one study provides an outline for physicians interested in developing a neonatal resuscitation team 14breakdowns in teamwork and communication can lead to perinatal death and injury 15 team training in simulated resuscitations improves performance and has the potential to improve outcomes 16 17 ultimately being able to perform bag and mask ventilation and work in coordination with a team are important for effective neonatal resuscitation planning and preparation important aspects of neonatal resuscitation are the hospital policy and planning that ensure necessary equipment and personnel are present before delivery 1 anticipation and preparation are essential elements for successful resuscitation 18 and this requires timely and accurate communication between the obstetric team and the neonatal resuscitation team physicians who provide obstetric care should be aware of maternalfetal risk factors 1 and should assess the risk of respiratory depression with each delivery 19 the obstetric team should inform the neonatal resuscitation team of the risk status for each delivery and continue to focus on obstetric care once the neonatal resuscitation team is summoned to the delivery room it is important to obtain a pertinent history assign roles to each team member check that all equipment is available and functional 1 including a pulse oximeter and an airoxygen blender 6 optimize room temperature for the infant and turn on the warmer light oxygen and suction outline of resuscitation resuscitation of an infant with respiratory depression term and preterm in the delivery room  figure 1 focuses on airway breathing circulation and medications 5 as soon as the infant is delivered a timer or clock is started once the infant is brought to the warmer the head is kept in the “sniffing” position to open the airway the airway is cleared if necessary and the infant is dried breathing is stimulated by gently rubbing the infants back the wet cloth beneath the infant is changed 5 respiratory effort is assessed to see if the infant has apnea or gasping respiration and the heart rate is counted by feeling the umbilical cord pulsations or by auscultating the heart for six seconds eg heart rate of six in six seconds is 60 beats per minute bpm the heart rate should be verbalized for the team figure 1 download pdfalgorithm outlining neonatal resuscitation ppv  positive pressure ventilation sp o 2  oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry

initiated with 21 percent oxygen room air or blended oxygen and the pulse oximeter probe is applied to the right handwrist to monitor heart rate and oxygen saturation 5 6 the heart rate is reassessed after 30 seconds and if it is less than 100 bpm ppv is optimized to ensure adequate ventilation and heart rate is checked again in 30 seconds 5 – 7 if the heart rate is less than 60 bpm after 30 seconds of effective ppv chest compressions are started with continued ppv with 100 percent oxygen 31 ratio of compressions to ventilation 90 compressions and 30 breaths per minute for 45 to 60 seconds 5 – 7 if the heart rate continues to be less than 60 bpm despite adequate ventilation and chest compressions epinephrine is administered via umbilical venous catheter or less optimally via endotracheal tube 5 – 7depending on the skill of the resuscitator the infant can be intubated and ppv delivered via endotracheal tube if chest compressions are needed or if bag and mask ventilation is prolonged or ineffective with no chest rise 5 heart rate respiratory effort and color are reassessed and verbalized every 30 seconds as ppv and chest compressions are performed once the heart rate increases to more than 60 bpm chest compressions are stopped when the heart rate increases to more than 100 bpm ppv may be discontinued if there is effective respiratory effort 5 oxygen is decreased and discontinued once the infants oxygen saturation meets the targeted levels  figure 1 5if there is no heartbeat after 10 minutes of adequate resuscitative efforts the team can cease further

amniotic fluid intrapartum suctioning a multicenter randomized trial showed that intrapartum suctioning of meconium does not reduce the risk of meconium aspiration syndrome 20intrapartum suctioning is not recommended with clear or meconiumstained amniotic fluid 1 2 5 6endotracheal suctioning a randomized trial showed that endotracheal suctioning of vigorous infants born through meconiumstained amniotic fluid is not beneficial 21endotracheal suctioning of vigorous infants is not recommended 1 2 5 6endotracheal suctioning of nonvigorous infants born through meconiumstained amniotic fluid may be useful 1 2 5a nonrandomized trial showed that endotracheal suctioning did not decrease the incidence of meconium aspiration syndrome or mortality 22ventilation strategies for term infants assisted ventilation device ventilation using a flowinflating bag selfinflating bag or tpiece device can be effective 23a selfinflating bag flowinflating bag or tpiece device can be used to deliver positive pressure ventilation 1 6initial breaths the primary objective of neonatal resuscitation is effective ventilation an increase in heart rate indicates effective ventilation 24auscultation should be the primary means of assessing heart rate and in infants needing respiratory support the goal should be to check the heart rate by auscultation and by pulse oximetry 6initial pip of 20 cm h 2 o may be effective but a pip of 30 to 40 cm h 2 o may be necessary in some infants to achieve or maintain a heart rate of more than 100 bpm 5ventilation rates of 40 to 60 breaths per minute are recommended 5 6exhaled carbon dioxide detectors to confirm endotracheal tube placement a prospective study showed that the use of an exhaled carbon dioxide detector is useful to verify endotracheal intubation 25use of an exhaled carbon dioxide detector in term and preterm infants is recommended to confirm endotracheal tube placement 5 6laryngeal mask airway a randomized study showed similar success in providing effective ventilation using either laryngeal mask airway or endotracheal tube 26laryngeal mask airway should be considered if bag and mask ventilation is unsuccessful and if endotracheal intubation is unsuccessful or not feasible 5 6use of cpapuse of cpap for resuscitating term infants has not been studied 5no evidence exists to support or refute the use of mask cpap in term infants 2 5use of peepno studies have examined peep vs no peep when positive pressure ventilation is used after birth 5peep should be used if suitable equipment is available such as a flowinflating bag or tpiece device 5supplemental oxygen 100 vs 21 percent room airthere is a reduction of mortality and no evidence of harm in term infants resuscitated with 21 percent compared with 100 percent oxygen 5 6 27delivery rooms should have a pulse oximeter readily available 5 – 7a pulse oximeter is recommended when supplemental oxygen positive pressure ventilation or cpap is used 5 – 7supplemental oxygen should be administered using an airoxygen blender 5 – 7it is recommended to begin resuscitation with 21 percent oxygen and increase the concentration of oxygen using an airoxygen blender if oxygen saturation is low 5 – 7 see figure 1  it is recommended to increase oxygen concentration to 100 percent if the heart rate continues to be less than 60 bpm despite effective positive pressure ventilation and the infant needs chest compressions 5 – 7ventilation strategies for preterm infants initial breaths premature animals exposed to brief high tidal volume ventilation from high pip develop lung injury impaired gas exchange and decreased lung compliance 28initial pip of 20 to 25 cm h 2 o should be used if the heart rate does not increase or chest wall movement is not seen higher pressures can be used excessive chest wall movement should be avoided 2 6use of cpapin a randomized trial the use of mask cpap compared with endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation in spontaneously breathing preterm infants decreased the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia or death and decreased the use of surfactant but increased the rate of pneumothorax 29in spontaneously breathing preterm infants with respiratory distress either cpap or endotracheal intubation with mechanical ventilation may be used 1 5 6supplemental oxygen preterm infants less than 32 weeks gestation are more likely to develop hyperoxemia with the initial use of 100 percent oxygen and develop hypoxemia with 21 percent oxygen compared with an initial concentration of 30 or 90 percent oxygen 30 31in preterm infants less than 32 weeks gestation an initial oxygen concentration of more than 21 percent 30 to 40 percent but less than 100 percent should be used the goal should be to achieve oxygen saturation targets shown in figure 1 5 6chest compressions during resuscitation a combination of chest compressions and ventilation resulted in better outcomes than ventilation or compressions alone in piglet studies 6 32when chest compressions are indicated it is recommended to use a 31 ratio of compressions to ventilation 5 – 7chest compressions in infants should be delivered by using two thumbs with the fingers encircling the chest and supporting the back and should be centered over the lower onethird of the sternum 5 6a 31 ratio of compressions to ventilation provided more ventilations than higher ratios in manikin studies 6 33the chest compression technique of using two thumbs with the fingers encircling the chest and supporting the back achieved better results in swine models compared with the technique of using two fingers with a second hand supporting the back 5 6 34medications route and dose of epinephrine in a case series endotracheal epinephrine 001 mg per kg was less effective than intravenous epinephrine 35if the infants heart rate is less than 60 bpm after adequate ventilation and chest compressions epinephrine at 001 to 003 mg per kg 110000 solution should be given intravenously if epinephrine is administered via endotracheal tube a dose of 005 to 01 mg per kg 110000 solution is needed 1 2 5  7higher doses 005 to 01 mg per kg of endotracheal epinephrine are needed to achieve an increase in blood epinephrine concentration 36volume expansion in a retrospective study volume infusion was given more often for slow response of bradycardia to resuscitation than for overt hypovolemia 37early volume expansion with crystalloid 10 m l per kg or red blood cells is indicated for blood loss when the heart rate does not increase with resuscitation 5 6naloxone there was no difference in apgar scores or blood gas with naloxone compared with placebo 38use of naloxone is not recommended as part of initial resuscitation of infants with respiratory depression in the delivery room 1 2 5 6sodium bicarbonate in a randomized trial the use of sodium bicarbonate in the delivery room did not improve survival or neurologic outcome 39very rarely sodium bicarbonate may be useful after resuscitation 6postresuscitation management induced therapeutic hypothermia randomized trials have shown that infants born at 36 weeks gestation or later with moderate to severe hypoxicischemic encephalopathy who were cooled to 923°f 335°c within six hours after birth had significantly lower mortality and less disability at 18 months compared with those not cooled 40 41term or near term infants with evolving moderate to severe hypoxicischemic encephalopathy should be offered therapeutic hypothermia 5 – 7glucose in a retrospective review early hypoglycemia was a risk factor for brain injury in infants with acidemia requiring resuscitation 42intravenous glucose infusion should be started soon after resuscitation to avoid hypoglycemia 5 6resuscitation of preterm infants temperature control hypothermia at birth is associated with increased mortality in preterm infants it is recommended to cover preterm infants less than 28 weeks gestation in polyethylene wrap after birth and place them under a radiant warmer hyperthermia should be avoided 1 2 6wrapping in addition to radiant heat improves admission temperature of preterm infants 43delivery room temperature should be set at at least 788°f 26°c for infants less than 28 weeks gestation 6bpm  beats per minute cpap  continuous positive airway pressure peep  positive endexpiratory pressure pip  peak inspiratory pressure —defined as strong respiratory effort good muscle tone and a heart rate greater than 100 bpm information from references 1 2 5 through 7 and 20 through 43 interventions positive pressure ventilationif the infants heart rate is less than 100 bpm ppv via face mask not mask continuous positive airway pressure is initiated at a rate of 40 to 60 breaths per minute to achieve and maintain a heart rate of more than 100 bpm 1 2 5 – 7 ppv can be administered via flowinflating bag selfinflating bag or tpiece device 1 6 there is no major advantage of using one ventilatory device over another 23 thus each institution should standardize its equipment and train the neonatal resuscitation team appropriately if the infant needs ppv the recommended approach is to monitor the inflation pressure and to initiate ppv using a peak inspiratory pressure pip of 20 cm h 2 o for the first few breaths however a pip of 30 to 40 cm h 2 o in some term infants may be required at a rate of 40 to 60 breaths per minute 5 6 the best measure of adequate ventilation is prompt improvement in heart rate 24 auscultation of the precordium is the primary means of assessing heart rate but for infants requiring respiratory support pulse oximetry is recommended 5 6 however if the heart rate does not increase with mask ppv and there is no chest rise ventilation should be optimized by implementing the following six steps 1 adjust the mask to ensure a good seal 2 reposition the airway by adjusting the position of the head 3 suction the secretions in the mouth and nose 4 open the mouth slightly and move the jaw forward 5 increase the pip enough to move the chest and 6 consider an alternate airway endotracheal intubation or laryngeal mask airway 5 pip may be decreased when the heart rate increases to more than 60 bpm and ppv may be discontinued once the heart rate is more than 100 bpm and there is spontaneous breathing the usefulness of positive endexpiratory pressure during ppv for term infant resuscitation has not been studied 6 a recent study showed that use of mask continuous positive airway pressure for resuscitation and treatment of respiratory distress syndrome in spontaneously breathing preterm infants reduced the need for intubation and subsequent mechanical ventilation without increasing the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia or death 29 in a preterm infant needing ppv a pip of 20 to 25 cm h 2 o may be adequate to increase heart rate while avoiding a higher pip to prevent injury to preterm lungs and positive endexpiratory pressure may be beneficial if suitable equipment is available 6endotracheal intubationendotracheal intubation is indicated in very premature infants for suctioning of nonvigorous infants born through meconiumstained amniotic fluid and when bag and mask ventilation is necessary for more than two to three minutes ppv via face mask does not increase heart rate or chest compressions are needed if skilled health care professionals are available infants weighing less than 1 kg 1 to 3 kg and 3 kg or more can be intubated with 25 3 and 35mm endotracheal tubes respectively 1 exhaled carbon dioxide detection is the recommended method of confirming endotracheal intubation the exhaled carbon dioxide detector changes from purple to yellow with endotracheal intubation and a negative result suggests esophageal intubation 5 6 25 clinical indicators of endotracheal intubation such as condensation in the tube chest wall movement or presence of bilateral equal breath sounds have not been well studied laryngeal mask airwaywhen attempts at endotracheal intubation are unsuccessful laryngeal mask airway size 1 is an alternative for providing ppv in infants weighing more than 2 kg or in infants greater than 34 weeks gestation 5 6 26concentration of oxygenneonatal resuscitation aims to restore tissue oxygen delivery before irreversible damage occurs traditionally 100 percent oxygen has been used to achieve a rapid increase in tissue oxygen in infants with respiratory depression however free radicals are generated when successful resuscitation results in reperfusion and restoration of oxygen delivery to organs 44 use of 100 percent oxygen may increase the load of oxygen free radicals which can potentially lead to endorgan damage recent clinical trials have shown that infants resuscitated with 21 percent oxygen compared with 100 percent oxygen had significantly lower mortality at one week and one month and were able to establish regular respiration in a shorter time the rates of encephalopathy and cerebral palsy were similar in the two groups 45 – 49 the 2010 nrp guidelines recommend starting resuscitation of term infants with 21 percent oxygen or blended oxygen and increasing the concentration of oxygen using an airoxygen blender if oxygen saturation measured using a pulse oximeter is lower than recommended targets  figure 1  5 oxygen concentration should be increased to 100 percent if the heart rate is less than 60 bpm despite effective ventilation and when chest compressions are necessary 5 – 7chest compressionsif the infants heart rate is less than 60 bpm the delivery of ppv is optimized and applied for 30 seconds the heart rate is reassessed 6 and if it continues to be less than 60 bpm synchronized chest compressions and ppv are initiated in a 31 ratio three compressions and one ppv 5 6 chest compressions can be done using two thumbs with fingers encircling the chest and supporting the back preferred or using two fingers with a second hand supporting the back 5 6 compressions should be delivered to the lower onethird of the sternum to a depth of approximately onethird of the anteroposterior diameter 5 6 the heart rate is reassessed at 45 to 60second intervals and chest compressions are stopped once the heart rate exceeds 60 bpm 5 6medications epinephrine is indicated if the infants heart rate continues to be less than 60 bpm after 30 seconds of adequate ppv with 100 percent oxygen and chest compressions it is important to continue ppv and chest compressions while preparing to deliver medications the neonatal epinephrine dose is 001 to 003 mg per kg 110000 solution given intravenously via umbilical venous catheter 1 2 5 6 if there is any delay in securing venous access epinephrine can be given via endotracheal tube at a higher dose of 005 to 010 mg per kg 110000 solution followed by intravenous dosing if necessary as soon as access is established 5naloxone is not recommended during neonatal resuscitation in the delivery room infants with respiratory depression should be resuscitated with ppv 1 2 5 6 volume expansion using crystalloid or red blood cells is recommended when blood loss is suspected eg pale skin poor perfusion weak pulse and when the infants heart rate continues to be low despite effective resuscitation 5 6 sodium bicarbonate is not recommended during neonatal resuscitation in the delivery room because it does not improve survival or neurologic outcome 6 39meconiumstained amniotic fluid approximately 7 to 20 percent of deliveries are complicated by meconiumstained amniotic fluid these infants have a 2 to 9 percent risk of developing meconium aspiration syndrome 50 oral and nasopharyngeal suction on the perineum is not recommended because it has not been shown to reduce the risk of meconium aspiration syndrome 20 in the absence of randomized controlled trials there is insufficient evidence to recommend changing the current practice of intubation and endotracheal suction in nonvigorous infants as defined by decreased heart rate respiratory effort or muscle tone born through meconiumstained amniotic fluid 1 2 5 however if attempted intubation is prolonged or unsuccessful and bradycardia is present bag and mask ventilation is advised 5 6 endotracheal suctioning of vigorous infants is not recommended 1 2 5 6withholding and discontinuing resuscitation withholding resuscitation and offering comfort care is appropriate with parental consent in certain infants such as very premature infants born at less than 23 weeks gestation or weighing less than 400 g and infants with anencephaly or trisomy 13 syndrome 5 if there is no detectable heart rate after 10 minutes of resuscitation it is appropriate to consider discontinuing resuscitation 5 6postresuscitation management intravenous glucose infusion should be started soon after resuscitation to avoid hypoglycemia 5 6 in addition infants born at 36 weeks gestation or later with evolving moderate to severe hypoxicischemic encephalopathy should be offered therapeutic hypothermia using studied protocols within six hours at a facility with capabilities of multidisciplinary care and longterm followup 5 – 7
