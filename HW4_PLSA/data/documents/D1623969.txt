information what is hepatitis b readers comments 40 share your story hepatitis b is an infectious hepatitis caused by the hepatitis b virus hbv this infection has two possible phases 1 acute and 2 chronic acute hepatitis b refers to newly acquired infections affected individuals notice symptoms approximately 1 to 4 months after exposure to the virus in most people with acute hepatitis symptoms resolve over weeks to months and they are cured of the infection however a small number of people develop a very severe lifethreatening form of acute hepatitis called fulminant hepatitis chronic hepatitis b is an infection with hbv that lasts longer than 6 months once the infection becomes chronic it may never go away completely most infected adults are able to fight off the virus so their infection is cured a low percentage of adults infected with hbv go on to develop chronic infection children are at much higher risk for chronic infection a majority of infected young children will fail to clear the virus from their bodies and go on to develop chronic infection about twothirds of people with chronic hbv infection are chronic carriers these people do not develop symptoms even though they harbor the virus and can transmit it to other people the remaining one third develop active hepatitis a disease of the liver that can be very serious the liver is an important organ that filters toxins out of the blood stores energy for later use helps with digestion and makes substances that fight infections and control bleeding the liver has an incredible ability to heal itself but longterm inflammation caused by hbv can result in permanent damage scarring of the liver is called cirrhosis a condition traditionally associated with alcoholism but one that is also caused by chronic active hepatitis b infection as well as other conditions when this occurs the liver can no longer carry out its normal functions and may fail completely the only treatment for liver failure is liver transplant chronic hepatitis b also can lead to a type of liver cancer known as hepatocellular carcinoma any of these conditions can be fatal about 15 to 25 percent of people with chronic hepatitis b die of liver disease hepatitis b is the most common serious liver infection in the world in the united states hepatitis b is largely a disease of young adults aged 2050 years the good news is that infection with hbv is usually preventable because there is an effective vaccine use of the vaccine has resulted in a large decrease in the number of new infections reported in the united states each year a visual guide to hepatitis slideshow digestive disease myths slideshow pictures slideshow infectious mononucleosis how is hepatitis b transmitted how do you get hepatitis b the hepatitis b virus is known as a bloodborne virus because it is transmitted from one person to another via blood or fluids contaminated with blood another important route of transmission is from an infected mother to a newborn child which occurs during or shortly after birth direct contract with blood may occur through the use of dirty needles during illicit drug use inadvertent needle sticks experienced by healthcare workers or contact with blood through other means semen which contain small amounts of blood and saliva that is contaminated with blood also carry the virus the virus may be transmitted when these fluids come in contact with broken skin or a mucous membrane in the mouth genital organs or rectum of an uninfected person people who are at an increased risk of being infected with the hepatitis b virus include the following men or women who have multiple sex partners especially if they dont use a condom men who have sex with men men or women who have sex with a person infected with hepatitis b virus people with other sexually transmitted diseases people with hiv or hepatitis cpeople who inject drugs with shared needles people who receive organ transplants or transfusions of blood or blood products exceedingly rare these dayspeople who undergo dialysis for kidney disease institutionalized mentally handicapped people and their attendants caregivers and family members health care workers who are stuck with needles or other sharp instruments contaminated with infected blood infants born to infected mothers people born outside the united states in areas where hepatitis b is common people who travel to areas of the world where hepatitis b is common in some cases the source of transmission is never known you cannot get hepatitis b from the following activities having someone sneeze or cough on you hugging someone shaking a persons hand breastfeeding your child eating food or drinking water casual contact such as an office or social settinghepatitis b treatment what are hepatitis b treatments hepatitis b is an infection of the liver caused by the hepatitis b virus hbv hepatitis b may cause people to become very ill for several weeks these patients may have jaundice yellow skin poor appetite and other symptoms a lifethreatening hepatitis b infection is called fulminant although this occurs in only 1 of symptomatic cases however some people especially children appear to have almost no symptoms when they acquire hepatitis b hepatitis b is spread through exposure to infected blood or secretions the bodys immune system is eventually able to wipe out the virus and cure the infection in 95 of infected adults unfortunately some patients immune systems are unable to eliminate the virus and they become chronically infected children are especially prone to chronic infection which occurs in 95 of newlyinfected infants compared with 5 of newlyinfected adults patients with chronic hepatitis b carry the virus for years and usually for life allowing it to continue to cause inflammation and scarring in the liver advanced scarring of the liver is called cirrhosis if the cirrhosis is severe it can affect the ability of the liver to function and can lead to liver failure or death people who are chronic carriers of hbv are also at risk for liver cancer for these reasons scientists have developed medications to help reduce the risk of complications in people who are chronically infected with hbv it is important to note that there are effective vaccines available haemophilus bhepatitis b vaccineinjection comvax hepatitis b vaccineinjection engerixb recombivaxhb heptavaxb pediarix to prevent the infection in the first place the vaccine is currently recommended for all children in the united states and for adults who are at increased risk for hepatitis b unfortunately the vaccine does not help people who are already infected read more about hepatitis b treatment »you may also likeviewa picture guide

abdomen for severe symptoms including confusion or delirium go to a hospital emergency department you should also contact your health care practitioner if you think you may have been exposed to the hepatitis b virus if you have chronic hepatitis b infection and think you might be pregnant or if you are pregnant and think you have been exposed to hepatitis b inform health care practitioner right away how is hepatitis b diagnosed hepatitis b infection is diagnosed with blood tests these tests can detect pieces of the virus in the blood antigens antibodies against the virus and viral dna viral load blood tests for hbv are often done when routine blood work shows abnormal liver function tests or in patients who are at an increased risk for exposure if a patient has had a large amount of vomiting or has not been able to take in liquids blood electrolytes may also be checked to ensure that the patients blood chemistry is in balance other tests may be ordered to rule out other medical conditions xrays and other diagnostic images are needed only in very unusual circumstances if a patient is diagnosed with chronic hepatitis b they will need regular visits to their health care practitioner blood tests can help determine how active the infection is and whether there has been damage to the liver blood tests alone may not be enough to guide treatment in chronic hbv other tests include ct scan or ultrasound these diagnostic imaging tests are used to detect the extent of liver damage and may also detect cancer of the liver caused by chronic hepatitis b liver biopsy this involves removal of a tiny piece of the liver it is usually done by inserting a long needle into the liver and withdrawing the tissue the tissue is examined under a microscope to detect changes in the liver a biopsy may be done to detect the extent of liver damage or to evaluate how well a treatment is working manage diabetes in 10 minutes erectile dysfunction type 2 diabetes warning signs health

does not require medical treatment if very severe symptoms such as vomiting or diarrhea are present the affected person may require treatment to restore fluids and electrolytes there are no medications that can prevent acute hepatitis b from becoming chronic if a person has chronic hepatitis b they should see their health care provider and determine if medical treatment is appropriate are there home remedies for hepatitis b the goals of selfcare are to relieve symptoms and prevent worsening of the disease drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration broth sports drinks gelatin frozen ice treats such as popsicles and fruit juices are preferred because they also provide calories ask your physician before taking any medications even those that are overthecounter some medications depend on the liver and liver damage may impair the bodys ability to metabolize these drugs if you are on prescription medications check with your physician to see if the doses should be adjusted or if the medication should be temporarily discontinued avoid drinking alcohol until your health care practitioner allows it individuals with chronic hbv should avoid alcohol for the rest of their lives try to eat a diet that provides adequate nutrition take it easy it may take some time for your energy level to return to normal avoid prolonged vigorous exercise until symptoms start to improve call your health care practitioner for advice if your condition worsens or new symptoms appear avoid any activity that may spread the infection to other people sexual intercourse sharing needles etc what is the medical treatment for hepatitis b acute hepatitis b infection acute hepatitis b infection is not treated with antiviral medications if the infected person is dehydrated from vomiting or diarrhea a doctor may prescribe iv fluids to help them feel better medications may also be used to control these symptoms people with mild symptoms can be cared for at home chronic hepatitis b infection the degree of liver damage is related to the amount of active replicating multiplying virus in the blood and liver regularly measuring the amount of hbv dna viral load in the blood gives your physician a good idea of how fast the virus is multiplying the treatments now in use are classified as antiviral drugs because they work by stopping the virus from multiplying antiviral agents while the best therapy known for chronic hepatitis b do not work in all individuals with the disease there are several antiviral agents for chronic hepatitis b approved by the u s food and drug administration fda new drugs are always being tested and treatment recommendations are subject to change antiviral therapy is not appropriate for everyone with chronic hbv infection it is reserved for people whose infection is most likely to progress to active hepatitis or cirrhosis decisions to start medications for treatment of hepatitis b are made by the patient and health care practitioner often in consultation with a specialist in diseases of the digestive system  gastroenterologist  liver hepatologist or an infectious disease specialist the decision to treat is guided by results of liver function tests hbv dna tests and frequently liver biopsies after a complete history and physical examination treatment is usually started when blood tests indicate that liver functions are deteriorating and the amount of replicating hbv is rising many people never reach this point for those who do the interval between diagnosis and starting treatment is quite variable a visual guide to hepatitis slideshow digestive disease myths slideshow pictures slideshow infectious mononucleosis what are the medications for hepatitis b all of the following medications used to treat chronic hepatitis b are antiviral medications they reduce the ability of the virus to reproduce in the body and give the liver a chance to heal itself these drugs are not a cure for hepatitis b but they do reduce the damage caused by the virus although these medications are similar in some ways they differ in other important ways talk to your health care practitioner about the best medication for you pegylated interferon alfa2b pegasys®pegylated interferon is used alone or in combination with other medications pegylated interferon slows the replication of the virus and boosts the bodys immune system to fight the infection it works best in people who have relatively low levels of hbv dna low viral load pegylated interferon usually is not given to people whose liver damage has progressed to cirrhosis because it can make the liver damage worse treatment is often given for 48 weeks which is shorter than for other medications but pegylated interferon requires regular shots injections while other medications are taken orally by mouth pegylated interferon has unpleasant side effects in many people the side effects are similar to having the flu this medication can also cause or worsen depression for many people side effects are so severe that they cannot continue taking the medication liver function tests and hbv dna tests are used to check how well the treatment is working interferon appears to stop the liver damage in up to 40 of people although relapse is possible nucleosidenucleotide analogues nasnucleosidenucleotide analogues nas are compounds that mimic normal building blocks for dna when the virus tries to use the analogues it is unable to make new viral particles examples of these agents include adefovir  hepsera ® entecavir  baraclude ® lamivudine  epivir hbv® heptovir® heptodin® telbivudine  tyzeka ® and tenofovir  viread ® nas reduce the amount of virus in the body between 20 and 90 of patients may have levels reduced so far that they become undetectable obviously this is a broad range the higher success rates are achieved in patients who do not have hepatitis b e antigen hbe ag hbe ag is detected by a blood test and indicates that the virus is actively multiplying side effects are less common than with pegylated interferon nas have been associated with changes in body fat distribution reduced blood cell counts and increased levels of lactic acid in the blood rarely nas are associated with a severe flare of hepatitis that can be serious or fatal hbv may become resistant to nas over time nas do not cure the infection relapse is possible even in patients who have had a good response to treatment is surgery a treatment for hepatitis b there is no surgical therapy for hepatitis b if liver damage is so severe that the liver starts to fail liver transplant may be recommended liver transplant is a major process and surgery with an extended recovery period it also depends on the availability of a matching donor liver if liver transplant becomes a possibility for an individual a health care practitioner will discuss the risks and benefits with them what other therapy is available for hepatitis b no herbs supplements or other alternative therapy is known to work as well as antiviral medication in slowing hbv replication and promoting liver healing in hepatitis b at this time no specific herb or herbal preparation is recommended what is the hepatitis b vaccine there is a vaccine against the hepatitis b virus engerixb recombivax hb it is safe and works well to prevent the disease a total of 3 doses of the vaccine are given over several months hepatitis b vaccine is also produced as a combination product which includes other common childhood vaccinations this can reduce the number of shots that a child needs at a single visit the following groups should be vaccinated for hepatitis b all children younger than 19 years including all newborns  especially those born to mothers who are infected with hbvall health care and public safety workers who may be exposed to blood people who have hemophilia or other blood clotting disorders and receive transfusions of human clotting factors people who have endstage renal disease including those who require hemodialysis for kidney disease travelers to countries where hbv infection is common this includes most areas of africa southeast asia china and central asia eastern europe the middle east the pacific islands and the amazon river basin of south america people who are in prison people who live or work in residential facilities for developmentally disabled persons people who inject illegal drugs people with chronic liver disease such as hepatitis cpeople who have multiple sex partners or have ever had a sexually transmitted disease men who have sex with men persons with hivpeople who have a sexual partner who is an hbv carrier household contacts of persons who are carriers of hbv anyone who wants to be vaccinated regardless of risk factors hepatitis b immune globulin bay hep b nabihb is given along with the hepatitis b vaccine to unvaccinated people who have been exposed to hepatitis b these include close contacts of people with hbv infection health care workers who are exposed to hbvcontaminated blood and infants born to mothers infected with hbv giving the immune globulin and the vaccine together in these situations prevents transmission of the disease in 80 to 90 percent of cases a visual guide to hepatitis slideshow digestive disease myths slideshow pictures slideshow infectious mononucleosis what is the followup for hepatitis b if an individual has acute hepatitis b a health care practitioner will draw blood and examine the person periodically to see if the infection is resolving if the person develops chronic hepatitis b they will need periodic examinations and blood tests on an ongoing basis if these tests indicate that the virus is actively damaging the liver the health care practitioner may suggest a liver biopsy or begin antiviral therapy the individual will also be given a vaccine against hepatitis a which is an unrelated virus that may cause severe liver disease in people who already carry hepatitis b chronic hepatitis b is associated with hepatocellular carcinoma fortunately this is a rare cancer a blood test can be used to detect a marker for this cancer or the cancer can be detected by abdominal ultrasound persons with chronic hepatitis b are usually screened periodically every 6 to 12 months for hepatocellular carcinoma although it is not clear if this screening improves survival how do you prevent hepatitis b in addition to the hepatitis b vaccine other ways to protect yourself from hbv infection include if you are sexually active practice safe sex correct use of latex condoms can help prevent transmission of hbv but even when used correctly condoms are not 100 effective at preventing transmission men who have sex with men should be vaccinated against both hepatitis a and hepatitis b if you inject drugs dont share needles or other equipment dont share anything including grooming products that might have blood on it such as a razor toothbrush fingernail clippers etc think about the health risks if you are planning to get a tattoo or body piercing you can become infected if the artist or person piercing you does not sterilize needles and equipment use disposable gloves or wash hands properly health care workers should follow standard precautions and handle needles and sharps safely if you are pregnant or think you might be pregnant tell your health care practitioner if you have any of the risk factors for hbv infection is hepatitis b curable some people rapidly improve after acute hepatitis b others have a more prolonged disease course with very slow improvement over several months or with periods of improvement followed by worsening of symptoms a small group of people suffer rapid progression of their illness during the acute stage and develop severe liver damage fulminate hepatitis this may occur over days to weeks and may be fatal other complications of hbv include development of a chronic hbv
