july 20 2017i recently moved into a new apartment and the washer and dryer had already been used by the previous tenants i used the washer with a small load on a cold cycle and when the load was finished my clothes were still dry some of the clothes had wet spots but for the most part my clothes looked like someone just splashed water on them i had to redo the cycle on a larger load setting my clothes came out full of someone elses lint the dryer ohhh the dryer i then place my linty clothes in the dryer to see if they will be removed i do a full 60 minute cycle i open up the dryer when it is finished and my load is warm but still damp after 60 minutes on hot i have to run the dryer 4 times to dry a load of laundry needless to say the landlord was called and he is replacing but god please dont let him buy another set of amana washer and dryer please view more helpful 4 people found this review helpful joyce of danville va verified reviewer verified buyer original review july 14 2017i bought an amana stove 2 years ago it has been in service 5 times within the last year the temperature control board keeps messing up called customer service they said to reset it which i had to do 3 times and still couldnt finish making dinner it was last fixed in november and its out again they really dont care told me buy extra warranty for 400 really lets just say my response was not nice i told them since they didnt care i would let people know about my bad experience and terrible product she hung up on me now i have a useless stove because it cost just as much to fix it than what i paid for it i would never recommend this company or product to anyone helpful 12 people found this review helpful ariel of amityville ny verified reviewer original review july 6 2017i just had the absolute most horrendous experience with an over the phone customer service rep my husband and i are having trouble with our ac unit we got transferred to the portable unit section of customer service when the man answered the phone we gave my husband’s name we said only the words we are having trouble with the rep cut us off he did not state his name he said it is a maytag unit and he cannot help us it does not say maytag anywhere on our unit so we tried to explain which unit we have and before we could even offer up the serial or model numbers the man began raising his voice nearly shouting you dont know what youre talking thats a maytag unit we dont do that i wont help you i wont help you and again the man did not give his name he mostly just yelled at us so we hung up the phone i have never encountered someone so rude so impatient and so incredibly unprofessional in all of my life based on this encounter we will never be contacting amana again and its pretty safe to say that we will never purchase with this company again and highly encourage anyone we know to steer clear view more helpful 5 people found this review helpful greg of palmyra ny verified reviewer original review june 21 2017i have had a new top load he washer now for just a few months and i regret i ever bought them list of problems 1 this will be the 3rd service call in just a few months 2 no softener dispenser what rocket scientist would design a washer without a softener dispenser its not like it would cost anymore to the company you have to either stop the machine right when it’s filling up for a rinse cycle orbuy a softener ball which stains clothes and does an ineffective job at best 3 my electric bill has not dropped one penny do not tell me that these machines are more efficient thats just politics so that congress can say they are being more environmentally safe he high efficiency is not true 4 the washer does a terrible job of cleaning clothes it does not agitate properly it just winds back and forth a little and makes a weird little noise my old washer kenmore was a superior product and i wish i had never got rid of it if you own an amana top load just wash your clothes in deep water so they at least wash better 5 this is our 3rd service call as i said in the beginning in just a few months the first 2 service calls were with the dryer and this one is for the washer the motherboard is bad in the head of the unit buyer beware these are not old time washers that you could open up any time or adjust water levels during the operation or just open up anytime you wanted to add clothes or more soap no these are very sensitive electronics that have issues when the washer process is disturbed in any way 6 this is the way you have to treat these washer pay attention open up lid add soap put clothes or whatever your washing on sticky soap add softener ball if you unknowingly bought a washer without a softening dispenser that was us never buy from ad in paper go see it who knew washers are now made without softener dispensers then close lid and set settings from left to right and hit start program button the reason i said program button start is because these junk washers are now like cyborgs part computer with junk electronic boards as electronics to control functions and operations of a washer which are just basic after you do that do not disturb in any way otherwise you will have problems and regret you ever bought this piece of junk resetting only works so many times when it does have problems i bought this from a local vendor through a sale paper ad the vendor is not the problem this is a amana corporate issue shame on you amana i will never buy a amana product again trying to reinvent the wheel view more helpful 13 people found this review helpful ronald of modesto ca verified reviewer original review june 17 2017i just bought a amana top loader washer a few weeks so far it is doing a great job two years ago i spent over 200000 on a maytag bravos washer and dryer after two years the washer started to sound like a jetliner taking off i called maytag and it would cost over 40000 to repair i did a lot of research on this and found that most the washer do this i think maytag should do a recall on them due to a default in the design of the washer until then i will stick with the amana which is made by the same company how funny

that you selected regardless of your reasons would do what you asked and come back knowing it was done with the electronic controls i must fight with the stupid machine to get it to rinse or spin as needed fill as required or whatever wash really dirty gardening clothes well or wash hockey equipment the automatic settings get it wrong regularly very frustrating helpful 15 people found this review helpful richard of tuscaloosa aloriginal review june 1 2017i purchased an amana side by side refrigerator in november 2017 and the freezer quit working after 4 months service technician came out to repair and said that the workmanship involved at the factory was awful and he had to replace coilscondensing unit needless to say the next day the refrigerator and the freezer quit working another service company came out a week later and said that the first company did very poor work and they were to blame for the new problem needless to say they had to take refrigerator to their shop to break it totally down to find out all that is wrong called amana customer service to request a brand new refrigerator only to be told no without a refrigerator for three weeks and counting is this acceptable ask amana and they will say yes never buy an amana unless this is what you want thanks amana i hope your business survives because with this type of service i know my company would not last very long and i do not think yours will either view more helpful 13 people found this review helpful connie of jeannette pa verified buyer original review may 11 2017i bought a washer and dryer in irwin at rosendahls the first time i used it it would not work on rinse the motor would just hum called where i bought said out of his hands to call amana i did they blamed it on water pressure which i thought was bs then i filled up with water with bucket then it still would not work on rinse called them again they said they replaced some parts took 20 min and theyre gone they never checked at any time when they said it was fixed they never ran a cycle ever i said if it works on wash theres something wrong they just bide time till warranty runs out now im on a fixed income it took me 2 and a half years to save for the pair im just disgusted at the way i was treated and they dont care they got their money i tried to add the water for rinse it just drains out but i have always had to add water to wash because the clothes were always dry on the top my clothes come out with detergent on then after its done because it never ever has rinsed do not buy amana especially one with no water
