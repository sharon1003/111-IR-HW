skin of the anal canal anal fissures may be noticed by bright red anal bleeding on toilet paper and undergarments or sometimes in the toilet if acute they may cause pain after defecation 1 but with chronic fissures pain intensity is often less anal fissures usually extend from the anal opening and are usually located posteriorly in the midline probably because of the relatively unsupported nature and poor perfusion of the anal wall in that location fissure depth may be superficial or sometimes down to the underlying sphincter muscle contents  hide 1 causes2 prevention3 treatment31 medication32 surgery4 epidemiology5 see also6 references7 external links causes  editmost anal fissures are caused by stretching of the anal mucosa beyond its capability superficial or shallow anal fissures look much like a paper cut and may be hard to detect upon visual inspection they will generally selfheal within a couple of weeks however some anal fissures become chronic and deep and will not heal the most common cause of nonhealing is spasming of the internal anal sphincter muscle which results in impaired blood supply to the anal mucosa the result is a nonhealing ulcer which may become infected by fecal bacteria in adults fissures may be caused by constipation the passing of large hard stools or by prolonged diarrhea in older adults anal fissures may be caused by decreased blood flow to the area when fissures are found laterally tuberculosis occult abscesses leukemic infiltrates carcinoma acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids or inflammatory bowel disease should be considered as causes 2 some sexually transmitted infections can promote the breakdown of tissue resulting in a fissure examples of sexually transmitted infections that may affect the anorectal area are syphilis herpes chlamydia and human papilloma virus 3other common causes of anal fissures includechildbirth trauma in women 4anal sex 5 6crohns disease 4ulcerative colitis 7poor toileting in young children 8prevention  editfor adults the following may help prevent anal fissures avoiding straining when defecating this includes treating and preventing constipation by eating food rich in dietary fiber drinking enough water occasional use of a stool softener and avoiding constipating agents 9 similarly prompt treatment of diarrhea may reduce anal strain careful anal hygiene after defecation including using soft toilet paper and cleaning with water plus the use of sanitary wipes in cases of preexisting or suspected fissure use of a lubricating ointment it is important to note that hemorrhoid ointment is contraindicated because it constricts small blood vessels thus causes a decrease in blood flow which prevents healing in infants frequent diaper change can prevent anal fissure as constipation can be a cause making sure the infant is drinking enough fluids ie breastmilk proper ratios when mixing formulas is beneficial in infants once an anal fissure has occurred addressing underlying causes is usually enough to ensure healing occurs treatment  editnonsurgical treatments are recommended initially for acute and chronic anal fissures 10 11 these include topical nitroglycerin or calcium channel blockers eg diltiazem  or injection of botulinum toxin into the anal sphincter 12other measures include warm sitz baths topical anesthetics highfiber diet and stool softeners 13 14medication  editlocal application of medication to relax the sphincter muscle thus allowing the healing to proceed was first proposed in 1994 with nitroglycerine ointment 15 16 17 18 and then calcium channel blockers in 1999 with nifedipine ointment 19 20 and the following year with topical diltiazem 21 branded preparations are now available of topical nitroglycerine ointment rectogesic rectiv as 02 in australia and 04 in uk and us 22  topical nifedipine 03 with lidocaine 15 ointment antrolin in italy since april 2004 and diltiazem 2 anoheal in uk although still in phase iii development a common side effect drawback of nitroglycerine ointment is headache caused by systemic absorption of the drug which limits patient acceptability a combined surgical and pharmacological treatment administered by colorectal surgeons is direct injection of botulinum toxin botox into the anal sphincter to relax it this treatment was first investigated in 1993 however in many cases involving botox injections the patients eventually had to choose another cure as the injections proved less and less potent spending thousands of dollars in the meantime for a partial cure lateral sphincterotomy is the gold standard for curing this affliction 23 combination of medical therapies may offer up to 98 cure rates 24surgery  editsurgical procedures are generally reserved for people with anal fissure who have tried medical therapy for at least one to three months and have not healed it is not the first option in treatment the main concern with surgery is the development of anal incontinence anal incontinence can include inability to control gas mild fecal soiling or loss of solid stool some degree of incontinence can occur in up to 45 percent of patients in the immediate surgical recovery period however incontinence is rarely permanent and is usually mild the risk should be discussed with ones surgeon surgical treatment under general anaesthesia was either anal stretch lords operation or lateral sphincterotomy where the internal anal sphincter muscle is incised both operations aim to decrease sphincter spasming and thereby restore normal blood supply to the anal mucosa surgical operations involve a general anaesthetic and can be painful postoperatively anal stretch is also associated with anal incontinence in a small proportion of cases and thus sphincterotomy is the operation of choice lateral internal sphincterotomy  editlateral internal sphincterotomy lis is the surgical procedure of choice for anal fissures due to its simplicity and its high success rate 95  citation needed in this procedure the internal anal sphincter is partially divided in order to reduce spasming and thus improve the blood supply to the perianal area this improvement in the blood supply helps to heal the fissure and the weakening of the sphincter is also believed to reduce the potential for recurrence  citation needed the procedure is generally performed as a day surgery after the patient is given general anesthesia the pain from the sphincterotomy is usually mild and is often less than the pain of the fissure itself patients often return to normal activity within one week lis does however have a number of potential side effects including problems with incision site healing and incontinence to flatus and faeces some surveys of surgical results suggest incontinence rates of up to 36 25though lateral internal sphincterotomy lis is considered safe on shortterm basis there are concerns about its longterm safety pankaj garg et al published a systematic review and metaanalysis in which they analyzed the longterm continence disturbance two years after the lis procedure they found the incidence of longterm continence disturbance to be 14 so caution and careful patient selection are needed before undergoing lis 26anal dilation  editanal dilation or stretching of the anal canal lords operation has fallen out of favour in recent years primarily due to the unacceptably high incidence of fecal incontinence 27 in addition anal stretching can increase the rate of flatus incontinence 28in the early 1990s however a repeatable method of anal dilation proved to be very effective and showed a very low incidence of side effects 29 since then at least one other controlled randomized study has shown there to be little difference in healing rates and complications between controlled anal dilation and lis 30 while another has again shown high success rates with anal dilation coupled with low incidence of side effects 31epidemiology  editthe incidence of anal fissures is around 1 in 350 adults 8 they occur equally commonly in men and women and most often occur in adults aged 15 to 40 8see also  editmedicine portal
