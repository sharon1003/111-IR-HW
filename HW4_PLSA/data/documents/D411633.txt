rights and power of the people in their struggle against a privileged elite 1 critics of populism have described it as a political approach that seeks to disrupt the existing social order by solidifying and mobilizing the animosity of the  commoner  or  the people  against  privileged elites  and the  establishment  2 populists can fall anywhere on the traditional left–right political spectrum of politics and often portray both bourgeois capitalists and socialist organizers as unfairly dominating the political sphere 3political parties and politicians 4 often use the terms populist and populism as pejoratives against their opponents such a view sees populism as demagogy merely appearing to empathize with the public through rhetoric or unrealistic proposals in order to increase

of populism vary and people have often used the term in loose and inconsistent ways to reference appeals to the people demagogy and catchall politics the term has also been used as a label for new parties whose classifications are unclear unlike  vague wordorder draws out vagueness abt who and how ces  ses differ from and what they call themselves conservatives or socialists populists rarely call themselves populists and usually reject the term when it is applied to them which throws some doubt on the usefulness of the term populist 7in recent years academic scholars have produced definitions that facilitate populist identification and comparison daniele albertazzi and duncan mc donnell define populism as an ideology that pits a virtuous and homogeneous people against a set of elites and dangerous others who are together depicted as depriving or attempting to deprive the sovereign people of their rights values prosperity identity and voice 8 rather than viewing populism in terms of specific social bases economic programs issues or electorates as discussions of rightwing populism have tended to do 9 this type of definition is in line with the approaches of scholars such as ernesto laclau 10 pierreandre taguieff 11 yves meny and yves surel 12 who have all sought to focus on populism per se rather than treating it simply as an appendage of other ideologies in the united states and latin america populism has generally been associated with the left whereas in european countries populism is more associated with the right in both the central tenet of populism—that democracy should reflect the pure and undiluted will of the people—means it can sit easily with ideologies of both right and left however while leaders of populist movements in recent decades have claimed to be on either the left or the right of the political spectrum there are also many populists who reject such classifications and claim not to be left wing  centrist  or right wing 13 14 15some scholars argue that populist organizing for empowerment represents the return of older aristotelian politics of horizontal interactions among equals who are different for the sake of public problem solving 16 17 populism has taken leftwing rightwing and even centrist forms 18 as well as forms of politics that bring together groups and individuals of diverse partisan views 19 in 1912

side of the political spectrum include the anticorporategreed views of the occupy wall street movement and the theme of  two americas  in the 2004 presidential democratic party campaign of john edwards populists are seen by some politicians as a largely democratic and positive force in society while a wing of scholarship in political science contends that populist mass movements are irrational and introduce instability into the political process margaret canovan argues that both these polar views are faulty and has defined two main branches of modern populism worldwide—agrarian and political—and mapped out seven disparate subcategories agrarian  editmain article agrarianism commodity farmer movements with radical economic agendas such as the american peoples party of the

julius caesar the word populism is derived from the latin word populus which means the people in english in the sense of a folk or a nation as in the roman people  populus romanus or the voice of the people  vox populi  populism espouses government by the people as a whole—that is by the masses this is in contrast to aristocracy synarchy or plutocracy each of which is an ideology that espouses government by a small privileged group above the masses populism has been a common political phenomenon throughout history the populares were an unofficial faction in the roman senate whose supporters were known for their populist agenda they tried to rule by mobilizing masses of romans some of the best known of these were tiberius gracchus gaius marius julius caesar and caesar augustus all of whom eventually used referenda to bypass the roman senate and appeal to the people directly 39early modern period in europe  editmain articles german peasants war and revolt of the comuneros populism rose during the reformation protestant groups like the anabaptists formed ideas about ideal theocratic societies in which peasants would be able to read the bible themselves attempts to establish these societies were made during the german peasants war 1524–1525 and the münster rebellion 1534–1535 the peasant movement ultimately failed as cities and nobles made their own peace with the princely armies which restored the old order under the nominal overlordship of the holy roman emperor charles v represented in german affairs by his younger brother ferdinand 40the same conditions contributed to the outbreak of the english revolution of 1642–1651 also known as the english civil war conditions led to a proliferation of ideologies and political movements among peasants selfemployed artisans and workingclass people in england many of these groups had a dogmatic protestant religious bent they included puritans and the levellers 41germany  editfurther information völkisch movement friedrich

vision of aristocracy concerned with social orders had a dark side in that the opposite force of modernity was represented by the jews who were said to be eating away at the state 42 populism also played a role in mobilizing middle class support for the nazi party in weimar germany 43 in this case distressed middle–class populists mobilized their anger against the government and big business

revolution 1789–1799 though led by wealthy intellectuals could also be described as a manifestation of populist sentiment against the elitist excesses and privileges of the ancien régime 44in france the populist and nationalist picture was more mystical metaphysical and literarian in nature 45 historian jules michelet sometimes called a populist 46 fused nationalism and populism by positing the people as a mystical unity who are the driving force of history in which the divinity finds its purpose 44 michelet viewed history as a representation of the struggle between spirit and matter he argues france has a special place because the french became a people through equality liberty and fraternity because of this he believed the french people can never be wrong michelets ideas are not socialism or rational politics and his populism always minimizes or even masks social class differences  citation needed  original research in the 1880s there was a resurgence of french populism in

europe italy  editsilvio berlusconi leader of forza italia and prime minister of italy for almost ten years when silvio berlusconi entered politics in 1994 with his new party forza italia he created a new kind of populism focused on media control 50 berlusconi and his allies won three elections in 1994 2001 and with his new rightwing people of freedom party in 2008 he was prime minister of italy for almost ten years 51 throughout its existence berlusconis party was characterised by a strong reliance on the personal image and charisma of its leader—it has therefore been called a personality party 52 53 or berlusconis personal party 54 55 56 —and the skillful use of media campaigns especially via television 57 the partys organisation and ideology depended heavily on its leader its appeal to voters was based on berlusconis personality more than on its ideology or programme 58another italian populist party is lega nord 59 founded in 1991 as a federation of several regional parties of northern and centralnorthern italy most of which had sprung up and expanded their share of the electorate during the 1980s lega nord was the principal ally of berlusconis parties including most recently people of freedom lega nords political program advocates the transformation of italy into a federal state fiscal federalism and greater regional autonomy especially for the northern regions at times it has advocated the secession of the north which it calls padania lega nord also fights for the implementation of stricter rules and laws in order to contest the expansion of islam into

victory for populism encouraging a flurry of calls for referendums among other eu countries by populist political parties 72latin america  editsee also pink tide populism has been an important force in latin american political history where many charismatic leaders have emerged since the beginning of the 20th century as the paramountcy of agrarian oligarchies had been dislocated by the onset of industrial capitalism allowing for the emergence of an industrial bourgeoisie and the activation of an urban working class 73 causing the emergence of reformist and multiclass nationalist politics centered on a charismatic leadership 74 such as aprismo in peru the mnr in bolivia and the political movements gravitating around getúlio vargas in brazil perón in argentina lázaro cárdenas in mexico ecuadors velasco ibarra and others 75 ideologically latin american populism with its emphasis on nationbuilding under an authoritarian leadership as a prerequisite for technological modernization betrayed the earlier influence of comtean positivism socially for many authors—such as brazils octavio ianni —populism should be understood as the political alliance between an emerging industrial bourgeoisie and a newly organizing urban working class in which the former accepts social reforming for the latters sake as long as the working class remains politically subordinated to both a more or less authoritarian state and private enterprise 76 in a process of controlled inclusion of the masses into the political system 77 a coopting process some marxist authors like brazils francisco weffort ascertain was accepted by the newly urbanized working class given their lack of a previously developed class consciousness 78despite efforts to charter an ideological pedigree to populism in latin america as has been attempted by some working eg with concepts taken from peróns third position 79 latin american countries have not always had a clear and consistent political ideology under populism populist practitioners and movements in latin america usually adapt politically to the prevailing mood of the nation moving within the ideological spectrum from left to right many times during their political lives if populist movements in 1930s and 1940s latin america had apparent fascist overtones and based themselves on authoritarian politics as was the case of vargas estado novo dictatorship in brazil 1937–1945 80 or of some of perons openly expressed sympathies 81 in the 1950s populism adapted—not without considerable unease from its political leadership 82 —to heightened levels of workingclass mobilization therefore it is not surprising that 1960s populism was associated mainly with radical leftleaning pettybourgeois nationalism which emptied the state of its function as a coercive class rule apparatus and saw it instead as an organ of representation of the nation as a whole 83 such was the case for instance of the goulart government 1961–1964 in brazil goulart being described as a fiery populist who identified—mainly rhetorically—with the dispossessed and tried to foster a reformist agenda through ties to the organized left 84 the fact that goulart was eventually ousted by the military shows that in the views of some authors other populist leaders of the time faced a jeopardy they were reformists who in the pursuit of their agenda had to encourage popular mobilization and class conflict they ultimately abhorred 85 consequently populism was eventually identified by the 1970s military dictatorships as demagogery and as a risk to the stability of the existing social order 86if left reformist and nationalist populism never died out altogether during the 1970s latin american military dictatorships—as offered proof by the prompt and successful return of a populist like brazils leonel brizola to electoral politics in the early 1980s 87 —a different streak of populism appeared in the postmilitary dictatorship era this 1990s populism in the persons of leaders like argentinas carlos menem or brazils fernando collor adapted itself to prevailing neoliberal policies of economic adjustment setting aside nationalistic reforms and retaining the need for charismatic leadership policies mass support and a concern for the plight of the common people 88 in the 1990s and 2000s with the emergence of hugo chávez in venezuela —albeit chavez refuses himself to be labelled as populist 89 —reformist and nationalism latin american populism has resurfaced with new patterns as what is called by some authors socialist populism 90 91 that appeals to masses of poor by promising redistributive policies 91 and state control of the nations energy resources 92 —a blueprint that had already appeared however—albeit with no openly socialist rhetoric viz in the nationalist policies—including the launch of the stateowned oilcompany petrobrás —that were the hallmark of vargas second term as brazils democratically elected president 1951–1954 and that led to his eventual suicide 93in some countries populism has been fiscally supported in latin america during periods of growth such as the 1950s and 1960s and during commodity price booms such as in oil and precious metals political leaders could gather followers among the popular classes with broad redistributive programs during these boom times conversely in others countries populism has been historically associated with countering the relative decline of export agriculture with deficit spending and importsubstitution policies aimed at developing an internal market for industrial consumer goods 94 populism in latin america has been sometimes criticized for the fiscal policies of many of its leaders but has also been defended for having allowed historically weak states to alleviate disorder and achieve a tolerable degree of stability while initiating largescale industrialization though populist fiscal and monetary policies called macroeconomic populism has been criticized by economists who see in it the ultimately dysfunctional subordination of economic policy to political goals 95 some authors acknowledge populism to have allowed nonradical leaders and parties to coopt the radical ideas of the masses so as to redirect them in a nonrevolutionary direction 96 its generally regarded that populists hope to reform the system not to overthrow it 97often adapting a nationalist vocabulary and rhetorically convincing manner populism was used to appeal to broad masses while remaining ideologically ambivalent notwithstanding there have been notable exceptions 21stcentury latinamerican populist leaders have had a decidedly—even if mostly rhetorical 98 —socialist bent 90 91when populists take strong positions on economic philosophies such as capitalism versus socialism the position sparks strong emotional responses regarding how best to manage the nations current and future social and economic position mexicos 2006 presidential election was hotly debated among supporters and opponents of populist candidate andrés manuel lópez obrador 99inequality  editpopulism in latin american countries has both an economic and an ideological edge populism in latin america has mostly addressed the problem not of capitalist economic development as such but rather the problems caused by its lack of inclusiveness 100 in the backdrop of highly unequal societies in which people are divided between very small groups of wealthy individuals and masses of poor even in the case of societies such as argentina where strong and educated middle classes are a significant segment of the population 101 therefore the key role of the state in latin american populism as an institution is to mediate between traditional elites and the people in general 102 in appealing to the masses of poor people prior to gaining power populists may promise widely demanded food housing employment basic social services and income redistribution once in political power they may not always be financially or politically able to fulfill all these promises however they are very often successful in providing many broad and basic services in the short term 103 104united states policy  editsince one of the ideological hallmarks of latin american populism was the empowerment of the nation and its identification with the state 105 including nationalization of the land natural resources and key industries as common practice 106 it was seen almost from the start by american policy makers to offer a challenge to us hegemony over the americas the us has intervened in latin american governments on many occasions where populism was seen threatening its interests the 1954 guatemalan coup détat when the populist arbenz government was overthrown by a coup backed by the american company united fruit and the american ambassador in 1954 and the support given by the us to the 1964 brazilian coup détat 107 are just two cases of american intervention another example of us intervention has been seen in colombia particularly since the assassination of the populist leader jorge eliécer gaitán in april 1948 gaitán supported land reform and other populist initiatives and his murder is assumed to have foreclosed subsequent development of populism in mainstream colombian politics 108populist socialism  edithugo chavez founder of the psuv and former president of venezuela populism has remained a significant force in latin america populism has recently been reappearing on the left with promises of farreaching socialist changes as seen in venezuela under hugo chávez and in bolivia under evo morales —a process however seen by some as contradictory as it tries to meld the populist traditional celebration of folk wisdom and charismatic leadership with doctrinaire socialism 109 and in fact socialist changes in todays venezuela have mostly included the expenditure of oil revenue to benefit the working poor as a form of social welfare to help enable an eventual and imprecise socialist transformation for some authors as far as ideology is concerned chávezs political blueprint is more of a throwback to traditional populist nationalism and redistributivism 110 the venezuelan government often spars verbally with the united states and accuses it of attempting to overthrow chavez after supporting a failed coup against him chavez had been one of the most outspoken and blunt critics of us foreign policy nevertheless a large commodity trade continues between venezuela and the us because of the economic constraints of oil delivery and the proximity of the two countries 111when hugo chávez took power in venezuela nearly 20 years ago the leftist populism he championed was supposed to save democracy instead it has led to democracys implosion in the country the new york times april 2017 38because populist tradition ascertains the paramountcy of the people instead of class as a political subject 112 it suffices to say that in the 21st century the large numbers of voters living in extreme poverty in latin america has remained a bastion of support for new populist candidates by early 2008 governments with varying forms of populism and with some form of left leaning albeit vague social democratic or democratic socialist platform had come to dominate virtually all latin american nations with the exceptions of colombia el salvador and mexico 113 this political shift includes both more developed nations such as argentinas front for victory and chiles socialist party and smaller income countries like bolívia with its movement towards socialism and paraguay with the patriotic alliance for change even in middleincome mexico a populist candidate like lópez obrador albeit defeated nevertheless appeared as part of a strong neopopulist reaction 114 nevertheless populist candidates have been more successful in poorer latin american countries such as bolivia under morales  ecuador under rafael correa and nicaragua under daniel ortega  by the use of broad grassroots movements populist groups have managed to gain power from better organized funded and entrenched groups such as the bolivian nationalist democratic action and the paraguayan colorado party 113 some people see also parallels with the work party in brazil with president luiz inácio lula da silva and his successor dilma rousseff that used the state controlled oil company petrobras to illegally fund their party big companies and politicians while at the same time used populism strategies to get good results on the polls and elections 115countries in latin america with high rates of poverty whose governments maintain and support unpopular privatizations and more orthodox economic policies that dont deliver general societal gains are under pressure from populist politicians and movements 116 accusing them of benefiting the upper and uppermiddle classes 117 118 and of being allied to foreign and business interests 119 120north america

party of the early 1890s which midwestern and southern farmers and some labor unions denounced a system whereby the fruits of the toil of millions are boldly stolen to build up colossal fortunes for a few 122 the term populist reemerged in the 1950s when historian richard hofstadter and sociologist daniel bell compared the antielitism of the 1890s populists with that of joseph mc carthy 123 although not all academics accepted the comparison between the leftwing anti big business populists and the rightwing anticommunist mc carthyites the term populist nonetheless came to be applied to both leftwing and rightwing groups that blamed elites for the problems facing the country 123andrew jackson can be seen as perhaps the earliest populist in america he broke up the second national bank

candidates for the democratic party and green party respectively 123populism remains a force in modern us politics the media have identified numerous populist candidates in recent years 126 the thirdparty presidential campaigns of billionaire ross perot in 1992 and 1996 have been perceived as populist 127 128 the 1996 2000 2004 and the 2008 presidential campaigns of ralph nader had a strong populist cast the 2004 and 2008 democratic presidential candidate john edwards has been described by many 129 and by himself as a one economic community one commonwealth 129 populist from its

populist rhetoric and use of patriotic symbols notably the dont tread on me gadsden flag which emerged as the movements standard tapped into the historical legacy of the antifederalist movement of the

zealand first party robert muldoon the 31st prime minister of new zealand from 1975 to 1984 had been cited as a populist leader who appealed to the common man and utilised a personalitydriven campaign in the 1975 election 139populism has become a pervasive trend in new zealand politics since the introduction of the mixedmember proportional voting system in 1996 140 141 the new zealand labour party s populist appeals in its 1999 election campaign and advertising helped to propel the party to victory in that election 142 labour also articulated populism in its 2002 election campaign helping return the party to government despise its being entrenched as part of the establishment under attack by other parties employing strongly populist strategies drawing on their outsider status those parties— new zealand first and united future —benefited greatly in 2002 from running almost textbook populist advertising campaigns which helped both parties increase their proportion of the party vote to levels unanticipated at the commencement of the election campaign 142 the new zealand national party made limited attempts at articulating populism in its advertising but suffered from the legacy of being part of the 1990s establishment 142new zealand first has presented a more lasting populist platform longtime party leader winston peters has been characterised by some as a populist who uses antiestablishment rhetoric 143 though in a uniquely new zealand style 144 145 new zealand first takes a centrist approach to economic issues 140 typical of populist parties while advocating conservative positions on social issues 146 political commentators dispute the partys classification on the ideological spectrum but state that its dominant attribute is populism 147 the partys strong opposition to immigration and policies that reflect that position as well as its support for multiple popular referenda all typify its broadly populist approach peters has been criticised for reputedly inciting antiimmigration sentiment 144 and capitalising on immigration fears—he has highlighted the threat of immigration in both economic and cultural terms 148 some academics have even characterised new zealand first as a rightwing populist party 149 in common with parties such as ukip in britain 143see also  editargumentum ad populum black populism elitism kemalism
