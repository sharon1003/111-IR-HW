waldenström macroglobulinemia health guide disease reference more what is it waldenström macroglobulinemia wm is a rare slowgrowing cancer it is a form of nonhodgkin lymphoma wm is also known as lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma wm begins in the immune system it starts in white blood cells called b lymphocytes b cells b cells play a key role in the bodys immune system some b cells develop into plasma cells plasma cells make antibodies also called immunoglobulins antibodies help the body attack bacteria viruses and other foreign substances sometimes b cells become cancerous before turning into mature plasma cells these abnormal b cells multiply out of control they produce large amounts of ig m antibody immunoglobulin m high levels of ig m can cause a persons blood to thicken this makes it harder for blood to flow through the body multiple myeloma another form of cancer of plasma cells causes similar abnormalities the type of immunoglobulin the cells produce helps distinguish one from the other as they grow out of control lymphoma cells can crowd out the cells that normally develop into healthy blood cells this can lead to low numbers of red blood cells white blood cells and platelets low levels of these blood cells trigger many of the symptoms associated with wm the cells involved in wm grow mostly in the bone marrow the bone marrow is the soft spongy tissue inside most bones wm mainly affects older adults it is not curable but it is usually treatable symptoms some patients do not have signs or symptoms of wm in these cases wm may be detected during a routine blood test those who do have symptoms may experienceweakness and severe fatigueloss of appetite or weightfeverbleeding from the nose and gumseasy bruising of the skinnight sweatsswollen lymph nodes in the neck groin or armpitsenlarged spleen and liver felt as a swollen bellynumbness or tingling in the hands feet  legs ears or nosevision problemsheadaches dizziness or confusion several conditions may result from wm but not all patients develop them hyperviscosity syndrome buildup of the ig m antibody can cause the blood to become abnormally thick viscous and have trouble circulating this can result in headache dizziness confusion and blurred vision it can also cause strokelike symptoms such as slurred speech hyperviscosity syndrome can be lifethreatening cryoglobulinemia the ig m antibody makes the blood thick only at cooler temperatures the patients hands and feet may hurt in the cold cold agglutinin disease the ig m antibody causes red blood cells to be destroyed when temperatures are low circulation in a persons fingers nose ears and toes may be affected amyloidosis the ig m antibody collects in one or more organs this can damage the organ and hinder its function a patient may experience weakness trouble breathing and swelling in the feet and legs diagnosis your doctor may suspect wm if a routine blood test shows low blood counts or unusual protein levels the following tests are usually done to confirm the diagnosis additional blood tests measure levels of different antibodies particularly ig m ig m must be present in the blood for a wm diagnosis blood tests may also measure other proteins as well as the bloods thickness bone marrow biopsy detects abnormal lymphocytes in the bone marrow a long needle removes a small sample of bone and liquid bone marrow from the hipbone or breastbone a doctor examines the sample for abnormal cells flow cytometry looks for tumor markers substances released by the cancer a particular tumor marker found on the surface of lymphocytes may signal wm flow cytometry can help determine the exact type of lymphoma cytogenetics examines the genetic material of the lymphoma cells other exams may also be done to confirm the diagnosis these include urine tests and imaging tests such as computed tomography ct scans or xrays expected duration wm is a slowgrowing disease patients with wm often live for many years before requiring treatment regular checkups are strongly recommended to watch for progression prevention scientists do no know what causes wm several risk factors increase a persons chances of developing wm but most are not preventable risk factors for wm includeage the likelihood of developing wm increases as you grow olderbeing whitebeing malechronic hepatitis c you can reduce your chances of being infected with hepatitis c by using a latex condom when you have sex also do not inject drugs or share needles make sure needles used for body piercing or tattoos are properly sterilizedgenetic changes certain genetic changes increase risk these changes appear to develop during a persons lifetime rather than being passed on from a parentdefective bone marrow cells certain cells in the bone marrow of people with wm may release too much of a hormone involved in cell growthhaving abnormalantibodyproducing cells most people with these risk factors do not develop the disease treatment people with wm who have no symptoms of the disease are usually followed until symptoms or complications develop this allows them to avoid the side effects of chemotherapy until they need treatment treatment begins if they havehyperviscosity syndromeanemia low levels of red blood cellskidney problemsheart problemsnerve damage there is no standard treatment for a patient with wm treatment usually involves chemotherapy biological therapy or a combination of the two many people with wm require more than one type of chemotherapy or biological therapy over time chemotherapy chemotherapy drugs stop the growth of cancer cells they are usually taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle several different anticancer drugs are used to treat wm they can cause temporary side effects such asmouth soresnauseahair lossinsomnia biological therapy this approach is also called immunotherapy it stimulates the immune system to fight the cancer biological therapy uses naturally occurring substances such as monoclonal antibodies growth factors and vaccines to fight the cancer like chemotherapy immunotherapy may cause side effects highdose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant in this procedure stem cells immature blood cells are removed from the patients blood or bone marrow once removed they are frozen the patient receives highdose chemotherapy the stored stem cells are then infused into the patients bloodstream these cells grow into new blood cells stem cell transplants have significant short and longterm side effects plasmapheresis plasmapheresis is also called plasma exchange it may be performed to relieve symptoms caused by a thickening of the blood during plasmapheresis blood is removed from the patient it is passed through a machine that separates the plasma the liquid part of the blood that contains the abnormal ig m antibody from other parts red blood cells white blood cells and platelets the red and white blood cells and platelets are returned to the patient in addition the patient is given a plasma substitute or donated plasma plasmapheresis reduces ig m to safe levels and makes the blood less viscous but it does not affect the lymphoma cells that produce the ig m antibody other treatments patients with low levels of red blood cells white blood cells or platelets may be given transfusions antibiotics or medicines wm can develop into an aggressive form of lymphoma patients facing this situation are often treated with combinations of drugs that are similar to those used to treat nonhodgkin lymphoma when you are considering a treatment option ask your doctor about the risks and possible benefits how will this treatment affect my prognosis what will my quality of life be like during and after treatment when to call a professional contact your doctor if you experience any of the symptoms of wm these includeweakness and severe fatigueloss of appetite and weightfeverabnormal bleeding from the nose and gumseasy bruisingnight sweatsswollen glandsenlarged spleen and liver felt as a swollen bellynumbness or tinglingvision problemsheadaches dizziness or confusion prognosis there is no cure for wm but there are treatments to prevent or control its symptoms the prognosis for a person with wm can vary greatly it depends on several factors includingthe persons age younger patients generally live longerthe persons genderblood countsthe
