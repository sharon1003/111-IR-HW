review the sound at navarre beachselect a star to begin your review overall ratings  43 ratings12 reviews for the sound at navarre beach sort by default the smoking policy lease terms are not enforced it is stated on other websites under features smoke free this is a misrepresentation of the truth the smoking policy allows individuals to smoke everywhere but their apartments my neighbor downstairs smokes constantly on his patio and the smoke comes onto my patio it is turning my patio door glass yellow i cannot use my patio at all if the neighbor gets into the elevator and then you get in you get knocked back 10 feet by the smell you cant tell me this smell doesnt get into the apartment too i have complained in writing on 3 difference occasions about the downstairs neighbor in the smoking policy it states that a resident can be asked to not smoke on their patio if their smoking affects the health and safety of other individuals in 2 of my complaints i have referred to this statement and the apartment complex refuses to enforce it there answer is for me to buy a fan for my patio i have had to buy a fan for my living room only the dining room has a fan and my bedroom now they want me to purchase another fan for an area i shouldnt have too they should enforce the lease02052018was this review helpful2report certified resident it is a beautiful apartment complex very
