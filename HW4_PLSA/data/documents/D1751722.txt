when dangerous weather threatens your family there may not be much time to get to safety but right there in your own home you could ride out a severe tornado or hurricane in a room so sturdily built that it would be the only thing standing after the storm amid the trauma and tragedy of destruction you and your loved ones would be uninjured and safe the federal emergency management agency or fema claims that such a “safe room” can give you “nearabsolute protection” from tornadoes and hurricanes officials point to stories such as how an athens ala couple and their two children emerged unharmed from their reinforcedconcreteblock safe room when a deadly tornado destroyed the family’s home and most others in their neighborhood in 2011 after the recent tornado that flattened much of moore okla the mayor of that oklahoma city suburb said a safe room should be required in every new home built in the community oklahoma is eager for more residents to have safe rooms in the tornadoprone state and has a program offering rebates on new safe rooms of up to 75 percent or as much as 2000 residents who’ve lost homes to tornadoes are given priority what exactly is a safe room a safe room is a specially reinforced area in your home that can serve doubleduty for another use such as a closet or bathroom or it could be a standalone room in the garage or a shelter outside the house you can build a safe room as part of a new home or you could retrofit a room in an existing home but don’t expect a discount on your home insurance says loretta worters vice president of the insurance information institute a trade group more on disaster preparedness preparing for hurricanes see where tornadoes touch down make an emergency kit in case disaster hits documents you need when disaster strikes create a news alert for insurance“safe rooms protect people not property” says randall s guttery director of real estate programs at the naveen jindal school of management at the university of texas at dallas building a safe room designs and construction plans available from fema and the international code council can tell a contractor what materials to use and how to build a safe room for you that will handle specific hurricane or tornado wind loads and impacts from flying debris under these guidelines you could expect your safe room to withstand 250 mph winds and the impact of a 15pound plank hitting a wall at 100 mph according to the insurance institute for business and home safety or ibhs just how tough is that it would take five layers of ¾inch plywood boards to stop that impact safe rooms designed to the fema and icc standards are recommended for both tornadoes and hurricanes says leslie chapmanhenderson president of the federal alliance for safe homes or flash and be sure you understand what types of safe rooms and storm shelters can be installed on your property “safe rooms come in all shapes sizes and costs if you live in an area of the country with an outcropping of rocks such as new england and parts of oklahoma underground storm shelters likely are not an option” says guttery “the key is to choose the product best for your family”paying for a safe room including an 8by8foot safe room in a new home under construction can cost up to 8700 according to fema a 14by14foot safe room can cost as much as 14300 fema says there can be big variations in the costs depending on the size of the safe room its location in the home and other factors“the key is to choose the product best for your family” says randall s guttery director of real estate programs at the naveen jindal school of management at the university of texas at dallas retrofitting a room in an existing home will cost about 20 percent more than building a safe room into a new home because modifying the existing walls or foundation can be complicated financial assistance assistance may be available from a variety of sources for example “fema’s hazard mitigation grant program provides grants to states and local governments to implement longterm hazard mitigation to reduce loss of life and property should you receive a grant it will reduce your cost by up to 50 percent generally capped at 3000” says guttery for financial assistance options in your area fema says to begin by checking with your state’s emergency management department safe rooms aren’t always the safest bet if you live in a flood zone or a stormsurge area a safe room is anything but safe during a hurricane cautions tim reinhold ibhs senior vice president of research and chief engineer “you wouldn’t want to be locked up in a safe room with water rising” he says also while some homeowners opt for a safe room or shelter outside the house those require time to reach reinhold says wait too long and you risk going out into high winds with blowing debris that means you have to be alert and heed hurricane or tornado watches and warnings reinhold recalls a tornado that hit an area of 100 homes — all with shelters — near birmingham ala but only two families made it into their shelters“you have to be aware that there is a threat and of the time it takes to prepare” he says related
