atmospherecontrolled ashing furnace with 14 l 05 cubic foot heating area capacity for general laboratory use temperature range of 100 to 975 degrees c for coal and coke ashing procedures c1 programmable digital temperature controller with one stored program and eight ramp and dwell segments for greater control over the heating process four heating elements embedded in refractory cement on furnace top bottom and sides for fast and even heating rated at 208v for use in industrial settings product description the thermo scientific f6028c6080 thermolyne atmosphere controlled ashing furnace has a c1 singleprogram digital controller with eight ramp and dwell segments 14 l 05 cubic foot heating area capacity and a temperature range of 100 to 975 degrees c for general laboratory use four heating elements embedded in refractory cement on the furnace top bottom and sides provide fast and even heating with minimal temperature gradient thermalefficient ceramic fiber insulation reduces heat loss and enhances energy efficiency a 064 cm 025 interior diameter hose barb in the rear of the furnace allows the connection of a pressurized inert gas line the furnace features a flowmetervalve on the front of the unit to adjust the airflow rate from 0 to 80 lmin the stainless steel manifold prewarms incoming gases to decrease the temperature gradient a 095 cm 038 diameter port at the rear of the furnace allows an independent temperature monitoring device to check internal temperature measurements the furnace has a dualled display that continuously displays the chamber temperature and the furnace setpoint temperature the front door drops down when opened which vents heated air up and away from the operator and allows the door to be used as a shelf when loading and unloading the furnace two stainless steel crucible trays that can hold either 24 30 m l or 38 10 m l crucibles can be inserted at a variety of heights in the furnace a removable handle included can be attached to insert and remove the trays this furnace is designed for coal and coke ashing procedures the thermo scientific f6028c6080 requires a single phase 208v and 5060 hz hardwired electrical connection not included the c1 singleprogram digital controller with eight ramp and dwell segments is a microprocessorbased threemode pid proportional integrative derivative controller it allows the user to create and save a heating program with up to eight rampdwell cycles a ramp controls how quickly the furnace heats to a setpoint and a dwell determines how long the furnace holds the temperature the controller stores the program for future use the power output can be adjusted from 1 to 100 the c1 controller also includes overtemperature protection otp which sounds an alarm when the furnace heats beyond a specified limit a mechanical otp relay turns off power to the heating elements when the alarm sounds additional safety features include a door safety switch which turns off the heating elements when the door is opened and sensor break protection which turns power off in the event of thermocouple failure critical electronic components and heating elements are protected by a 35a circuit breaker the furnace controller also includes a selftuning feature selftuning changes the control parameters to ensure temperature accuracy for a particular material type load and setpoint the builtin vent port on the top of the furnace must be attached to a negative pressure exhaust system not included to vent gases and smoke produced during ashing procedures and to remove moisture and contaminants the furnace meets american society for testing and materials astm d3174 specifications that govern ashing of coal and coke including a twohour 750 degree c program with three to four air exchanges per minute it is also canadian standards association csa approved specifications capacity heating area 14 l 05 cubic foottemperature range 100 to 975 degrees celectrical

applications that require a range of high temperatures they heat to high temperatures evenly and maintain consistent temperatures while providing an environment free of undesirable contaminants and moisture factors such as object size controllers temperature range and shape determine the uses of particular furnaces most furnaces have digital controllers that determine how fast they heat up ramp how long the temperature can be held dwell and how fast they cool down safety systems are included in most furnaces to prevent overheating the contents as well as the furnace itself laboratory furnaces are used in applications such as petroleum analysis chemical analysis of certain compounds and heattreating small steel parts thermo fisher scientific manufactures analytical instruments laboratory equipment consumables and software under the thermo scientific and fisher scientific brands among others the company was founded in 2006 and is headquartered in waltham ma what’s in the box
