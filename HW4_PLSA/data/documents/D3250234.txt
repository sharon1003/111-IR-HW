rehabilitation program physical therapy gradually progressive stretching of the achilles tendon may help to relieve impingement on the subtendinous calcaneal bursa stretching of the achilles tendon can be performed by having the patient place the affected foot flat on the floor and lean forward toward the wall until a gentle stretch is felt in the ipsilateral achilles tendon the stretch is maintained for 2060 seconds and then is relaxed this technique is demonstrated in the following images achilles stretch 1 wholeperson view the patient stands with the affected foot flat on the floor and leans forward toward the wall until a gentle stretch is felt in the ipsilateral achilles tendon the stretch is maintained for 2060 seconds and then is relaxed view media gallery achilles stretch 1 cropped view showing a closeup of the region affected by this type of stretch view media gallery another technique a more advanced stretch that isolates the achilles tendon is shown in the following images achilles stretch 2 whole person view this stretch which is somewhat more advanced than that shown in images 12 isolates the achilles tendon it is held for at least 2030 seconds and then is relaxed view media gallery achilles stretch 2 closeup view view media gallery to maximize the benefit of the stretching program the patient should repeat the exercise for multiple stretches per set multiple times per day ballistic ie abrupt jerking stretches should be avoided in order to prevent clinical exacerbation the patient should be instructed to ice the posterior heel and ankle in order to reduce inflammation and pain icing can be performed for 1520 minutes at a time several times a day during the acute period which may last for several days some clinicians also advocate the use of contrast baths ultrasound or phonophoresis iontophoresis or electrical stimulation for treatment of calcaneal bursitis if the patients activity level needs to be decreased as a result of this condition alternative means of maintaining strength and cardiovascular fitness eg swimming water aerobics should be suggested next medical issuescomplications
