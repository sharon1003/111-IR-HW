glucose oxidase is an enzyme used in baking to improve dough machinability glucose oxidase what is glucose oxidase it is an enzyme that catalyses the oxidation of glucose into hydrogen peroxide and gluconic acid origin enzymes are naturally present in all biological systems it can be selectively isolated from plant animals and microorganisms most glucose oxidase are produced from fungi function glucose oxidase works by oxidizing glucose and producing gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide theoretically hydrogen peroxide is a strong oxidizing agent that strengthens the disulfide and nondisulfide crosslinks in gluten thus better developing the dough and improving its machinability providing good working conditions for these enzymes will help it function properly in a bakery system these conditions include p h temperature moisture ions and ionic strength shearing and pressure enzymes function best in the range 30°c to 40°c 86°f to 104°f and are usually destroyed at temperatures above 45°c 113°f
