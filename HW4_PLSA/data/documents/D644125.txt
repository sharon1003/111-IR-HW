which ensure the safety reliability and effectiveness of bolted joints the companys services are used by the worlds power generation and oil  gas industries to reduce the impact that bolting processes assembly or disassembly have on outage durations integras bolted joint reliability services are used by this industry as well as the hydrocarbons processing industry to rectify and eliminate dangerous bolted flange leakage problems in addition the companys considerable expertise and capabilities in this field are often called upon by clients who wish to outsource all of their botingrelated requirements since 1986 the personnel of todays integra have been developing services and products to achieve leakfree critical path asset utilization at the heart of our business is the continuous combination of technology application expertise and skilled experienced personnel we began as the bolting services group of westinghouse nuclear where we introduced ultrasonic technologies and processes we also developed hydraulic tensioning products specifically for westinghouse turbines we continued our business progress and became the bolting services group of the flexitallic gasket company where we added indepth knowledge of gasket design and interaction with a particular specialty in understanding and dealing with ring joint flanges next we became the north american service group of hydratight where we developed the first turbine casing closure systems and turbine coupling machines for use in fossil and nuclear markets we also introduced hydraulic tensioning tooling and processes to the subsea market in the gulf of mexico in 1995 we became integra technologies since that time we have continued to develop our core capabilities and have added additional technologies and services taking us all the way to maximizing asset utilization full profile contacts description products services and licensing technology market sector contact information p gordon britton title
