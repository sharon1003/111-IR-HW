science  mathematics chemistry how many electrons does mg2 have follow 6 answers answers relevance rating newest oldest best answer a mg atom is neutral so its numbers of protons and electrons are the sameit has 12 protonsso it has 12 electrons · 7 years ago0 9 comment look at the periodic table mg is number 12 so it has 12 protons and 12 electrons the 2 charge of a magnesium ion means the number of protons is 2 more than the number of electrons to become a magnesium ion 2 electrons are removed from the outer shell of the magnesium atom the mg 2 ion contains 12 protons and 10 electrons  12  10  2 charge the number of protons cannot change unless the atom is radioactive the nuclei of radioactive elements emit an alpha particle which is composed of 2 protons and 2 neutrons this process is called transmutation you may learn about radioactive decay in chemistry or physics i hope this helpselectron1 · 7 years ago7 0 comment10zandarx · 7 years ago2 0 comment12210patrick · 7 years ago2 0 comment atomic number of magnesium is 12 thus the elemental magnesium that is mg atom has 12 protons and 12 electrons the dipositive mg2 ion is formed by the loss of 2 electrons by the mg atom hence mg2 ion has 10 electrons only  how ever it will have 12 protonsmanepalli hariprasad · 7 years ago2 0 comment for the best answers search on this site httpsshorturlimavx ug magnesium is 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 when magnesium ionizes and loses two electrons they come from the sublevel that is highest in energy the 3s sublevel therefore mg2 is 1s2 2s2 2p6 penny · 2 years ago0 0 comment maybe you would like to learn more about one of these find moving container services need an electronic signature want to build a free website try online nursing courses
