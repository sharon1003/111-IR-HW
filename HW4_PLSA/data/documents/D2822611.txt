used for recreational and competition strength athletics in russia and europe in the late 19th century the birth of competitive kettlebell lifting or girevoy sport гиревой спорт is dated to 1885 with the founding of the circle for amateur athlethics кружок любителей атлетики 1russian kettlebells  ги́ри giri singular ги́ря girya are traditionally measured in weight by pood corresponding to 1638 kilograms 361 lb 2 the english term kettle bell has been in use since the early 20th century 3similar weights used in classical greece were the haltere comparable to the modern kettlebell in terms of movements another comparable instrument was used by shaolin monks in china  citation needed  year neededanatomy  edit12 kg 16 kg and 24 kg kettlebells unlike traditional dumbbells the kettlebells center of mass is extended beyond the hand similar to indian clubs or ishi sashi this facilitates ballistic and swinging movements 4 variants of the kettlebell include bags filled with sand water or steel shot 5 the kettlebell allows for swing movements and release moves with added safety and added grip wrist arm and core strengthening the unique shape of the kettlebell provides the unstable force for handling  key for the effectiveness of the kettlebell exercises 6 the anatomy of the kettlebell can be broken down into handle corner s horn s window bell and base exercise  editby their nature typical kettlebell exercises build strength and endurance particularly in the lower back legs and shoulders and increase grip strength 7 4 the basic movements such as the swing snatch and the clean and jerk engage the entire body at once 7 and in a way that mimics real world activities such as shoveling or farm work 2 4unlike the exercises with dumbbells or barbells kettlebell exercises involve large numbers of repetitions in the sport and can also involve large reps in normal training kettlebell exercises are in their nature holistic therefore they work several muscles simultaneously and may be repeated continuously for several minutes or with short breaks this combination makes the exercise partially aerobic and more similar to highintensity interval training rather than to traditional weight lifting in a 2010 study kettlebell enthusiasts performing a 20minute snatch workout were measured to burn on average 136 caloriesminute aerobically and 66 caloriesminute anaerobically during the entire workout  equivalent to running a 6minute mile pace 8 when training with high repetitions kettlebell progression should start out slowly to build muscle endurance support the joints and prevent injury like movements performed with any exercise tool they can be dangerous to those who have back or shoulder problems or a weak core when performed without proper education and progression however if done properly they are very beneficial to health they can offer improved mobility range of motion agility cardio vascular endurance mental toughness and increased strength exercises  editthis is a list of common kettlebell exercises most of which are uniquely suited to the kettlebell for some reason rather than just acting as a weight that could be replaced with any other kind of weight 9the following movements can be done with one or two kettlebells conventional swing the kettlebell is swung from just below the groin to somewhere between the upper abdomen and shoulders with arms straight or slightly bent the degree of flexion depends on the trajectory of the kettlebell 10high pull a swing variation where the kettlebell is thrusted a little higher than the russian swing and at the apex the bell is pulled in towards the shoulder and then pushed out again and back down into the swing sometimes the high pull instead refers to a deadlift that continues into a pull straight up to shoulder level hang clean the kettlebell is held in the rack position resting on the forearm in the crook of the elbow with the elbow against the chest lowered to below the knees and then thrust back up in to the rack swing clean the kettlebell is held in the rack position dropped into the backswing behind the knees and then back up in to the rack via the upswing the clean is often combined with a press or jerk to make a clean and press or a clean  jerk also called a long jerk  this is the most common clean hence its referred to as clean rather than swing clean dead clean the kettlebell is pulled up dead from the ground straight into rack position snatch the kettlebell is held in one hand lowered to behind the knees via hip hinge swung to an overhead position and held stable before repeating the movement the dead snatch or true snatch begins with the bell on the ground the lunge snatch lowers into a lunge while the bell goes to the overhead position strict press also called the military press or standing press the kettlebell is held in the rack position and pushed overhead with one arm keeping the body rigid the tree press a press standing on one leg performs a similar function other variations include the walking press taking a step forward with each press perhaps alternating hands and the seated press where the trainee sits on the ground with straight legs while pressing overhead floor press a press performed lying on the ground a variation is the bridge press a press in the wrestlers bridge position push press as a strict press but with a single dip of the hips to provide assistance jerk as a push press but with two dips for more leg assistance as in the barbell clean and jerkthruster a rack squat with a press at the top using momentum from the squat squat the basic squat is performed holding one or more kettlebells in the rack position or a single a bell in the goblet position which can help develop hip mobility by using the elbows to push the knees out at the bottom of the squat overhead squat a squat with the kettlebell held overhead requiring good hip and shoulder mobility sots press named after world record olympic weightlifter viktor sots also called the squat press this exercise is a rack squat with a press at the bottom of the squat lunge press sometimes called the tactical lunge this is a press from a lunging position pistol squat a singleleg squat with one leg held straight in front parallel to the ground holding the bell in the goblet or rack position an easier variant for those with less hip mobility is to perform the squat parallel to a step or ledge so that the foot of the free leg can dip beneath the pushing leg at the bottom deadlift can be performed different styles sumo squat or hip hinge with one or more kettlebells between the legs it can also be performed with the kettlebells on the outside suitcase deadlifts can also be performed with onearm oneleg or both carry walking with the kettlebell held in various positions such as suitcase rack goblet or overhead row while bent over anywhere from 45 degrees to parallel with the ground the kettlebell is held hanging from a straight arm pulled up to the hips or laterally and lowered again lunge a lunge performed with the kettlebell held in either the hanging racked overhead or mixed position lateral lunge a lateral lunge with the bell in either the racked or overhead positions the deepest form of this is called the cossack squat lateral lunge clean a clean performed along with a lateral lunge squat getup a variation of the turkish getup where the feet are pulled into the buttocks to get up squat style windmill standing with a bell held overhead the hips are pushed to the side of the bell keeping the bell arm vertical the upper body is bent to one side and rotated until the other hand is touching the floor this improves mobility and stability through the hips and shoulder alternatively the bell may be held in the other hand or with one in each hand an easier version is the bentleg windmill where the offside leg is bent or the supported windmill where the free hand rests against the off leg farmers walk walking holding kettlebells at your sides the single kettlebell version is called the suitcase walk these build grip strength while challenging your core hips back and traps turkish getup the following movements can be done with a single kettlebell american swing also called the overhead swing this swing variation ends with the kettlebell directly overhead instead of at chest level 10turkish getup a kettlebell exercise that combines the lunge bridge and side plank to build strength the getup is a slow and controlled movement unlike the other exercises that have a power or ballistic element keeping the arm holding the bell extended vertical the athlete transitions from lying supine on the floor to standing and back again getups are sometimes combined to make getup presses with a press at each position of the getup floor press leaning seated press high bridge press singleleg kneeling press standing press 11halo the kettlebell is held by the horns in front of the shoulders usually upsidedown and moved in a circle around the head while keeping the head straight in place this movement is done to improve mobility of the shoulders and triceps arm bar along with the other slow exercises the windmill getup and halo this drill also improves shoulder mobility and stabilization it starts lying on the ground with the kettlebell over the shoulder in a straight arm position as in the top of a floor press but with the other arm along the floor straight overhead the trainee then gradually turns their body away from the kettlebell until they are lying partially on their front slingshot the kettlebell is held hanging in one arm and moved around smoothly the body switching hands in front and behind in the slingshot figure8 the trainee moves the bell in a figure8 through the legs while in a partial squat and a wider variation of this is the cossack slingshot slingshot lunge also called a front leg pass this is a backward lunge circling the bell around the front leg returning to the standing position and repeating circular swing like the slingshot but the bell is swung all the way to arms parallel at the front figure8 swing like a 1arm swing but the bell goes down on one side of the body switching hands and up through the legs and then down the other side circular clean starting with the bell in the rack the bell is pushed away to the side slightly the swung down to the other side in front of the body and reversed back up into the rack deck squat the kettlebell is held in two hands by the ball instead of the handle the trainee squats down deeply then rocks back on their back and lowers the bell overhead so that the handle touches the ground before reverse the movement and standing back up helping hand press a variation of the press where the other arm assists by pushing open palm against the ball bent press a press utilizing a bentleg windmill position to lift heavier weight than is otherwise possible arm bar floor press a floor press in the arm bar or partial arm bar position russian twist while seated the trainee leans back to around 45 degrees and balances with the knees held at 90 degrees from the torso the bell is held by the horns and moved from side to side of the torso the following movements can be done with two kettlebells renegade row also called a plank row the trainee starts in the plank position holding the handles of two grounded kettlebells one bell is rowed to the chest while maintaining the plank position then returned to the ground and repeated with the other arm alternatively performed with a single kettlebell one arm at a time alternating clean a clean is performed with one arm while the other kettlebell is kept in the rack position then repeated with the other arm aka gorilla cleans pushup starting in the plank position holding the handles of two grounded kettlebells the trainee performs a pushup this requires more control than an ordinary pushup and results in a greater range of motion this is often combined with the renegade row feet may be elevated to increase the difficulty until the trainee is performing a handstand pushup on the kettlebells carry walking with two kettlebells held in various positions such as waiter one arm overhead one arm rack either hand or both with waiter hold or cross one arm overhead one arm suitcase for some exercises multiple kettlebells can be held in the same hand for trainees lacking sufficiently heavy kettlebells in any movement involving the rack or overhead position the kettlebell can be held with the ball in an open palm sometimes called the waiter hold for a greater stabilisation challenge or for even more precise control and added grip challenge the bottomup hold squeezing the kettlebell by the handle upsidedown this is especially useful for training to stay tight while pressing holding a single kettlebell in the rack position bottomup with two hands by the horns makes for goblet exercise variants kettlebell swing  editthe kettlebell swing aka russian swing doublearm swing or conventional kettlebell swing is a basic ballistic exercise used to train the posterior chain in a manner similar to broad jumping the kettlebell is swung from just below the groin to somewhere between the upper abdomen and shoulders with arms straight or slightly bent the degree of flexion depends on the trajectory of the kettlebell 10 the key to a good kettlebell swing is effectively thrusting the hips not bending too much at the knees and sending the weight forwards as opposed to squatting the weight up or lifting up with the arms this requires an intense contraction of the gluteal abdominal and latissimus muscles the swing can also be performed with a release and catch of the kettlebell which helps train the proper swing pattern where the arms arent pulling up at the top this can be done with two hands switching to a supinated catch the onearm swing presents a significant antitwisting challenge and can be used with an alternating catch switching between arms further variations include the walking swing taking a step forward at the apex of each swing the outside swing where the kettlebell swings outside the leg and the kneeling swing swinging between the legs in a oneleg halfkneeling position controversy  editthere is controversy within the kettlebell world about whether a swing can only be performed with a hip hinge and not with a squat within the kettlebell sport world employing knee flexion during the swing is more common variations  editthere are many
