the metra axxess aswc1 and the maestro sw and i absolutely prefer the maestro sw actual installation is exactly the same for both but where this shines is in the programming of button functions the sw includes an easy to use webbased application for programming i flashed the rom multiple times until i settled on the combination of primary short press and secondary long press functions i like this means im much less likely to take my eyes off the road to change radio settings comment 4 people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no report abuse clairc40 out of 5 stars easy to do works great november 8 2015verified purchase works very well on my kia optima didnt want to lose the steering wheel controls when i replaced my factory radio that stopped working first time i
