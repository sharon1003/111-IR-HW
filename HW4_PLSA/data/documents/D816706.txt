q1 how much does it cost to buy a cessna 150152 a like cars the sales prices of cessna 150152s are determined by the airplanes condition and how it is equipped in 2010 the average sales price for a cessna 150 in good condition was 18000 cessna 152s were slightly more valuable their average price was 22500 airplanes with expensive radios paint jobs andor larger horsepower engines typically sell in the 2500030000 range the market for these upgraded cessna 150152s is quite small because its possible to buy a low budget 4 seat airplane for around 30000 while it is possible to find deals on a cessna 150152 the likelihood of buying an airplane in good condition for under 15000 is very small it is common to find cessna 150152s on e bay or elsewhere for sale in the 12k15k range these airplanes are often neglected or have engines that have been used up the cost of restoring the engines in these airplanes can easily exceed 10000 turning a 15k airplane into a 25k airplane that is worth about 18k occasionally we find a nice cessna 150 or 152 that is advertised well below its real value this is typically the result of an owners need to quickly resolve a financial hardship or perhaps an estate sale where the heirs are anxious to cash out or may be unaware of the airplanes real value these deals are exceedingly rare in most cases if a deal seems to be too good to be true it is an airplane that seems unusually cheap requires very careful inspection and historical research to make sure it doesnt have expensive skeletons hiding in its closet  top q2 do used airplanes have blue book values  a yes they are called vref values aopa members can perform free vref evaluations on the aopa website unfortunately the vref system is optimized for the insurance industry and is notorious for undervaluing less expensive airplanes heres the problem since the airplanes are used and condition varies widely their value is quite subjective and difficult to quantify the insurance industry would prefer to err on the low side so vref evaluations are typically 40007500 below what the airplanes are actually selling for in the case of a 200k mooney or bonanza this is only a 24 reduction in true value but in a 20k cessna its a whopping 2040 undervaluation since insurance companies use vref to calculate replacement value a new owner has to prove that his airplane is worth what he paid for it when purchasing insurance by making an official statement that it is in better than average condition etc  top q3 how do cessna 150152s compare to the ownership cost of cars a it is very tempting to compare the cost of buying and owning a cessna 150152 with a car its possible to purchase a decent cessna 150152 for about the same price as honda or toyota sedan unfortunately this is an apples to oranges comparison as any aircraft owner can tell you though the purchase price is similar that is where the comparison ends when purchasing a car the sales price is the largest consideration modern cars are normally quite reliable and require very minimal maintenance compared to airplanes once a car is purchased all that is required is fuel oil changes and an occasional tune up in some states a smog check is required every couple of years by comparison the sales price of an airplane is an important consideration but only represents a portion of the cost of ownership like most private airplanes cessna 150152s are based on very old technology their engines and airframes were designed in the late 1940s in addition airplanes are operated in a very different way than cars for example an airplane engine is normally operated at 70100 power most of the time by comparison a car engine is loafing at 3040 of its power output at highway speeds imagine how long your car engine would last if you drove everywhere in a low gear at full throttle most cars are driven nearly every day this keeps engine oil circulating which is good for engines the typical private airplane is flown less than 100 hours a year or less than 2 hours a week a modern car will happily go past 100000 miles with just occasional oil changes and tuneups but airplanes require a full inspection every single year this annual inspection is required by law even if the airplane has not been flown at all since the previous year the cost of these inspections on a cessna 150152 in good condition range from a low of about 500 to a high of about 1500 for an airplane with serious problems the cost of an annual inspection can easily exceed the value of the airplane while car parts are quite cheap and plentiful airplane parts are in limited supply and very expensive for example a starter that might cost 75 on a car can cost hundreds of dollars for an airplane even though it appears to be nearly the same part the difference is that aircraft parts must meet a very rigid legal standard for quality and performance and are produced in very small quantities  top q4 what are the typical costs of owning a cessna 150152  a costs can be divided into three categories1 operational costs this includes fuel oil and replacement of things like spark plugs filters tires and light bulbs these costs remain fairly constant and can be estimated quite accurately for example an owner can easily divide the cost of fuel and oil by how much of each is required for each hour flown the average operational cost for a cessna 150152 is between 40 and 50 per hour largely dependant on the cost of fuel both aviation and car gasoline can be used with the appropriate approval in early of 2011 the average price per gallon of aviation fuel was 492 a cessna 150 with the stock engine consumes about 6 gallons per hour so the fuel cost per hour in early 2011 was approximately 29502 fixed costs this includes insurance required annual inspections the cost of parking or hangar rental and loan payments we wont address the loan question here but our downloadable worksheet provides a way to calculate the effect of loan payments on the cost of ownership the fixed cost remain about the same whether the airplane is flown one hour a year or a thousand3 reserves this includes planning ahead for the most expensive of all ownership costs an engine overhaul the engine in cessna 150s is rated for 1800 hours of use before overhaul for cessna 152s the interval is 2400 hours the cost of overhaul varies widely but is at least 5000 for a low budget job and may be as high as 15000 for a factory like new overhaul additional reserves are used for things like keeping the airplanes radios up to date paint jobs and interior refurbishment whats it all boil down to for a typical pilot who flies about 100 hours a year the minimum cost per hour is about 50 for an airplane with no loan payments to a high of about 90 an hour for an airplane with a 25000 loan  top q5 what do taxes and registration fees cost  a government fees vary widely by state county and even by city the good news is that faa aircraft registration is very inexpensive only 5 yes reallyby comparison state and local government fees can be downright oppressive these kinds of fees are often cloaked as use taxes or luxury taxes its nice to know that state and local governments view owners of 20000 cessnas in the same class as owners of yachts and ferraris some states even require an annual license registration in a recent search of cessna 150152 taxes we found an annual range from a low of 50 kenai alaska to a high of 528 the city of norfolk virginia dont budget for aircraft ownership without a full review of the taxes you may be required to pay to state county and even city governments  top
