3 some use the cutoff of 20 weeks of gestation after which fetal death is known as a stillbirth 11 the most common symptom of a miscarriage is vaginal bleeding with or without pain 1 sadness anxiety and guilt often occur afterwards 2 12 tissue and clotlike material may leave the uterus and pass through and out of the vagina 13 when a woman keeps having miscarriages infertility is present 14risk factors for miscarriage include an older parent previous miscarriage exposure to tobacco smoke obesity diabetes thyroid problems and drug or alcohol use 5 6 about 80 of miscarriages occur in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy the first trimester  1 the underlying cause in about half of cases involves chromosomal abnormalities 4 1 diagnosis of a miscarriage may involve checking to see if the cervix is open or closed testing blood levels of human chorionic gonadotropin h cg and an ultrasound 8 other conditions that can produce similar symptoms include an ectopic pregnancy and implantation bleeding 1prevention is occasionally possible with good prenatal care 9 avoiding drugs alcohol infectious diseases and radiation may decrease the risk of miscarriage 9 no specific treatment is usually needed during the first 7 to 14 days 6 10 most miscarriages will complete without additional interventions 6 occasionally the medication misoprostol or a procedure such as vacuum aspiration is used to remove the remaining tissue 10 15 women who have a blood type of rhesus negative rh negative may require rho d immune globulin 6 pain medication may be beneficial 10 emotional support may help with negative emotions 10miscarriage is the most common complication of early pregnancy 16 among women who know they are pregnant the miscarriage rate is roughly 10 to 20 while rates among all fertilisation is around 30 to 50 1 5 in those under the age of 35 the risk is about 10 while it is about 45 in those over the age of 40 1 risk begins to increase around the age of 30 5 about 5 of women have two

or tissue passing from the vagina 19 20 21 bleeding can be a symptom of miscarriage but many women also have bleeding in early pregnancy and dont miscarry 22 bleeding during pregnancy may be referred to as a threatened miscarriage of those who seek clinical treatment for bleeding during pregnancy about half will miscarry 23 miscarriage may be detected during an ultrasound exam or through serial human chorionic gonadotropin hcg testing risk factors  editfurther information list of miscarriage risks miscarriage may occur for many reasons not all of which can be identified risk factors are those things that increase the likelihood of having a miscarriage but dont necessarily cause a miscarriage up to 70 conditions 4 1 24 25 26 27 infections 28 29 30 medical procedures 31 32 33 33 lifestyle factors 5 6 5 34 35 36 occupational exposures 9 37 9 37 38 chemical exposure 38 and shift work are associated with increased risk for miscarriage 39 some of these risks include endocrine genetic uterine or hormonal abnormalities reproductive tract infections and tissue rejection caused by an autoimmune disorder 40first trimester  editchromosomal abnormalities found in first trimester miscarriages description percent of totalfirst trimester miscarriage normal 4555autosomal trisomy 2232monosomy x 45 x 520triploidy 68structural abnormality of the chromosome 2double or triple trisomy 072 41translocation unknown 42most clinically apparent miscarriages twothirds to threequarters in various studies occur during the first trimester 1 28 43 44 about 30 to 40 of all fertilized eggs miscarry often before the pregnancy is known 1 the embryo typically dies before the pregnancy is expelled bleeding into the decidua basalis and tissue necrosis causes uterine contractions to expel the pregnancy 44 early miscarriages can be due to a developmental abnormality of the placenta or other embryonic tissues in some instances an embryo does not form but other tissues do this has been called a blighted ovum 41 45 46successful implantation of the zygote into the uterus is most likely 8 to 10 days after conception if the zygote has not implanted by day 10 implantation becomes increasingly unlikely in subsequent days 47a chemical pregnancy refers to a pregnancy that was detected by testing but ends in miscarriage before or around the time of the next expected period 48chromosomal abnormalities are found in more than half of embryos miscarried in the first 13 weeks half of embryonic miscarriages 25 of all miscarriages have an aneuploidy abnormal number of chromosomes 49 common chromosome abnormalities found in miscarriages include autosomal trisomy 2232 monosomy x 520 triploidy 68 tetraploidy 24 or other structural chromosomal abnormalities 2 44 genetic problems are more likely to occur with older parents this may account for the higher rates observed in older women 50there is no evidence that progesterone given in the first trimester reduces the risk of miscarriage and luteal phase progesterone deficiency may or may not be a contributing factor to miscarriage 51 52second and third trimesters  editsecond trimester losses may be due to maternal factors such as uterine malformation growths in the uterus  fibroids  or cervical problems 28 these conditions also may contribute to premature birth 43 unlike firsttrimester miscarriages secondtrimester miscarriages are less likely to be caused by a genetic abnormality chromosomal aberrations are found in a third of cases 44 infection during the third trimester can cause a miscarriage 28 these include an older parent previous miscarriage exposure to tobacco smoke obesity diabetes and drug or alcohol use among others 5multiple pregnancy and age  editfurther information advanced maternal age the age of the pregnant woman is a significant risk factor miscarriage rates increase steadily with age with more substantial increases after age 35 53 in those under the age of 35 the risk is about 10 while it is about 45 in those over the age of 40 1 risk begins to increase around the age of 30 5 paternal age is associated with increased risk 54obesity eating disorders and caffeine  editnot only is obesity associated with miscarriage it can result in subfertility and other adverse pregnancy outcomes recurrent miscarriage is also related to obesity women with bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa may have a greater risk for miscarriage nutrient deficiencies have not been found to impact miscarriage rates but hyperemesis gravidarum sometimes precedes a miscarriage 37caffeine consumption also has been correlated to miscarriage rates at least at higher levels of intake 28 however such higher rates have been found to be statistically significant only in certain circumstances vitamin supplementation has generally not shown to be effective in preventing miscarriage 55 chinese traditional medicine has not been found to prevent miscarriage 21endocrine disorders  editdisorders of the thyroid may affect pregnancy outcomes related to this iodine deficiency is strongly associated with an increased risk of miscarriage 37 the risk of miscarriage is increased in those with poorly controlled insulindependent diabetes mellitus 37 wellcontrolled diabetes may lower this risk 56  needs updatefood poisoning  editingesting food that has been contaminated with listeriosis toxoplasmosis and salmonella is associated with an increased risk of miscarriage 28 14amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling  editamniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling are procedures conducted to assess the fetus a sample of amniotic fluid is obtained by the insertion of a needle through the abdomen and into the uterus chorionic villus sampling is a similar procedure with a sample of tissue removed rather than fluid these procedures are not associated with pregnancy loss during the second trimester but they are associated with miscarriages and birth defects in the first trimester 33 miscarriage caused by invasive prenatal diagnosis  chorionic villus sampling cvs and amniocentesis is rare about 1 32surgery  editthe effects of surgery on pregnancy are not wellknown including the effects of bariatric surgery abdominal and pelvic surgery are not risk factors in miscarriage ovarian tumors and cysts that are removed have not been found to increase the risk of miscarriage the exception to this is the removal of the corpus luteum from the ovary this can cause fluctuations in the hormones necessary to maintain the pregnancy 57medications  editimmunizations have not been found to cause miscarriage 58 there is no significant association between antidepressant medication exposure and spontaneous abortion 59 the risk of miscarriage is not likely decrease by discontinuing ssri prior to pregnancy 60 some available data suggest that there is a small increased risk of miscarriage for women taking any antidepressant 61 62 though this risk becomes less statistically significant when excluding studies of poor quality 59 63medicines that increase the risk of miscarriage includeretinoidsnonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids  such as ibuprofenmisoprostolmethotrexate 28chemotherapy and radiation treatments for cancer  editionizing radiation levels given to a woman during cancer treatment cause miscarriage exposure can also impact fertility the use of chemotherapeutic drugs used to treat childhood cancer increases the risk of miscarriage 37intercurrent diseases  editseveral intercurrent diseases in pregnancy can potentially increase the risk of miscarriage including diabetes polycystic ovary syndrome pcos hypothyroidism certain infectious diseases and autoimmune diseases pcos may increases the risk of miscarriage 28 two studies suggested treatment with the drug metformin significantly lowers the rate of miscarriage in women with pcos 64 65 but the quality of these studies has been questioned 66 metformin treatment in pregnancy has not been shown to be safe 67 in 2007 the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists also recommended against use of the drug to prevent miscarriage 66 thrombophilias or defects in coagulation and bleeding were once thought to be a risk in miscarriage but have been subsequently questioned 68 severe cases of hypothyroidism increase the risk of miscarriage the effect of milder cases of hypothyroidism on miscarriage rates has not been established a condition called luteal phase defect lpd is a failure of the uterine lining to be fully prepared for pregnancy this can keep a fertilized egg from implanting or result in miscarriage 69mycoplasma genitalium infection is associated with increased risk of preterm birth and miscarriage 30infections can increase the risk of a miscarriage rubella german measles cytomegalovirus bacterial vaginosis hiv chlamydia gonorrhoea syphilis and malaria 28immune status  editautoimmunity is possible cause of recurrent or lateterm miscarriages in the case of an autoimmuneinduced miscarriages the womans body attacks the growing fetus or prevents normal pregnancy progression 7 70 autoimmune disease may cause genetic abnormalities in embryos which in turn may lead to miscarriage 71 as an example celiac disease increases the risk of miscarriage by an odds ratio of approximately 14 26 27 a disruption in normal immune function can lead to the formation of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome this will effect the ability to continue the pregnancy and if a woman has repeated miscarriages she can be tested for it 38 approximately 15 of recurrent miscarriages are related to immunologic factors 72 the presence of antithyroid autoantibodies is associated with an increased risk with an odds ratio of 373 and 95 confidence interval 18–76 73 having lupus also increases the risk for miscarriage 74anatomical defects and trauma  editfifteen percent of women who have experienced three or more recurring miscarriages have some anatomical defect that prevents the pregnancy from being carried for the entire term 75 the structure of the uterus has an effect on the ability to carry a child to term anatomical differences are common and can be congenital type of uterine structure miscarriage rate associated with defect references bicornate uterus 4079 24 25septate or unicornate 3488 24arcuate unknown 24didelphhys 40 24fibroids unknown 28in some women cervical incompetence or cervical insufficiency occurs with the inability of the cervix to stay closed during the entire pregnancy 29 35 it does not cause first trimester miscarriages in the second trimester it is associated with an increased risk of miscarriage it is identified after a premature birth has occurred at about 16–18 weeks into the pregnancy 75 during the second trimester major trauma can result in a miscarriage 27smoking  editsee also smoking and pregnancy tobacco cigarette smokers have an increased risk of miscarriage 34 35 there is an increased risk regardless of which parent smokes though the risk is higher when the gestational mother smokes 36morning sickness  editnausea and vomiting of pregnancy nvp or morning sickness are associated with a decreased risk several possible causes have been suggested for morning sickness but there is still no agreement 76 nvp is generally interpreted as a defense mechanism which discourages the mothers ingestion of foods that are harmful to the fetus according to this model a lower frequency of miscarriage would be an expected consequence of the different food choices made by women experiencing nvp chemicals and occupational exposure  editchemical and occupational exposures may have some effect in pregnancy outcomes a cause and effect relationship almost can never be established those chemicals that are implicated in increasing the risk for miscarriage are ddt lead formaldehyde arsenic benzene and ethylene oxide video display terminals and ultrasound have not been found to have an effect on the rates of miscarriage in dental offices where nitrous oxide is used with the absence of anesthetic gas scavenging equipment there is a greater risk of miscarriage for women who work with cytotoxic antineoplastic chemotherapeutic agents there is a small increased risk of miscarriage no increased risk for cosmetologists has been found 38other  editalcohol increases the risk of miscarriage 28 progesterone has not been found to be effective in preventing miscarriage 77cocaine use increases the rate of miscarriage 34 some infections have been associated with miscarriage these include ureaplasma urealyticum mycoplasma hominis group b streptococci hiv1 and syphilis infections of chamydia trachomatis camphylobacter fetus and toxoplasma gondii have not been found to be linked to miscarriage 44diagnosis  editin the case of blood loss pain or both transvaginal ultrasound is performed if a viable intrauterine pregnancy is not found with ultrasound blood tests serial βhcg tests can be performed to rule out ectopic pregnancy which is a lifethreatening situation 78 79if hypotension tachycardia and anemia are discovered exclusion of an ectopic pregnancy is important 79a miscarriage may be confirmed by an obstetric ultrasound and by the examination of the passed tissue when looking for microscopic pathologic symptoms one looks for the products of conception microscopically these include villi trophoblast fetal parts and background gestational changes in the endometrium when chromosomal abnormalities are found in more than one miscarriage genetic testing of both parents may be done 80ultrasound criteria  edita review article in the new england journal of medicine based on a consensus meeting of the society of radiologists in ultrasound in america sru has suggested that miscarriage should be diagnosed only if any of the following criteria are met upon ultrasonography visualization 81miscarriaged diagnosed miscarriage suspected references crownrump length of at least 7 mm and no heartbeat crown–rump length of less than 7 mm and no heartbeat 81 82mean gestational sac diameter of at least 25 mm and no embryo mean gestational sac diameter of 16–24 mm and no embryo 81 82absence of embryo with heartbeat at least 2 weeks after an ultrasound scan that showed a gestational sac without a yolk sac absence of embryo with heartbeat 7–13 days after an ultrasound scan that showed a gestational sac without a yolk sac 81 82absence of embryo with heartbeat at least 11 days after an ultrasound scan that showed a gestational sac with a yolk sac absence of embryo with heartbeat 7–10 days after a scan that showed a gestational sac with a yolk sac 81 82absence of embryo at least 6 weeks after last menstrual period 81 82amniotic sac seen adjacent to yolk sac and with no visible embryo 81 82yolk sac of more than 7 mm 81 82small gestational sac compared to embryo size less than 5 mm difference between mean sac diameter and crown–rump length 81 82classification  edita threatened miscarriage describes any bleeding during pregnancy prior to viability that has yet to be assessed at investigation it may be found that the fetus remains viable and the pregnancy continues without further problems  medical citation neededan anembryonic pregnancy also called an empty sac or blighted ovum is a condition where the gestational sac develops normally while the embryonic part of the pregnancy is either absent or stops growing very early this accounts for approximately half of miscarriages all other miscarriages are classified as embryonic miscarriages meaning that there is an embryo present in the gestational sac half of embryonic miscarriages have aneuploidy an abnormal number of chromosomes 44an inevitable miscarriage occurs when the cervix has already dilated 83 but the fetus has yet to be expelled this usually will progress to a complete miscarriage the fetus may or may not have cardiac activity transvaginal ultrasonography after an episode of heavy bleeding in an intrauterine pregnancy that had been confirmed by a previous ultrasononography there is some widening between the uterine walls but no sign of any gestational sac thus in this case being diagnostic of a complete miscarriage a complete miscarriage is when all products of conception have been expelled these may include the trophoblast chorionic villi gestational sac yolk sac and fetal pole  embryo  or later in pregnancy the fetus umbilical cord placenta amniotic fluid and amniotic membrane the presence of a pregnancy test that is still positive as well as an empty uterus upon transvaginal ultrasonography does however fulfill the definition of pregnancy of unknown location therefore there may be a need for followup pregnancy tests to ensure that there is no remaining pregnancy including an ectopic pregnancy transvaginal ultrasonography with some products of conception in the cervix to the left in the image and remnants of a gestational sac by the fundus to the right in the image indicating an incomplete miscarriage an incomplete miscarriage occurs when some products of conception have been passed but some remains inside the uterus 84 however an increased distance between the uterine walls on transvaginal ultrasonography may also simply be an increased endometrial thickness andor a polyp the use of a doppler ultrasound may be better in confirming the presence of significant retained products of conception in the uterine cavity 85 in cases of uncertainty ectopic pregnancy must be excluded using techniques like serial betah cg measurements 85a 13week fetus without cardiac activity located in the uterus delayed or missed miscarriagea missed miscarriage is when the embryo or fetus has died but a miscarriage has not yet occurred it is also referred to as delayed miscarriage silent miscarriage or missed abortion 86 87a septic miscarriage occurs when the tissue from a missed or incomplete miscarriage becomes infected which carries the risk of spreading infection  septicaemia and can be fatal 44recurrent miscarriage recurrent pregnancy loss rpl or habitual abortion is the occurrence of multiple consecutive miscarriages the exact number used to diagnose recurrent miscarriage varies 44 if the proportion of pregnancies ending in miscarriage is 15 and assuming that miscarriages are independent events 88 then the probability of two consecutive miscarriages is 225 and the probability of three consecutive miscarriages is 034 the occurrence of recurrent pregnancy loss is 1 88 a large majority 85 of those who have had two miscarriages will conceive and carry normally afterward the physical symptoms of a miscarriage vary according to the length of pregnancy though most miscarriages cause pain or cramping the size of blood clots and pregnancy tissue that are passed become larger with longer gestations after 13 weeks gestation there is a higher risk of placenta retention 89prevention  editprevention of a miscarriage can sometimes be accomplished by decreasing risk factors 9 this may include good prenatal care avoiding drugs and alcohol preventing infectious diseases and avoiding xrays 9 identifying the cause of the miscarriage may help prevent future pregnancy loss especially in cases of recurrent miscarriage often there is little a person can do to prevent a miscarriage 9 vitamin supplementation before or during pregnancy has not been found to affect the risk of miscarriage 90nonmodifiable risk factors  editpreventing a miscarriage in subsequent pregnancies may be enhanced with assessments of immune status 7 70chemical and occupational exposures 38anatomical defects 75 25intercurrent diseases 68 30polycystic ovary disease 91 92 93 94 66previous exposure to chemotherapy and radiation medications 27 59 60 61 62 63surgical history 57endocrine disorders 37 56  needs updategenetic abnormalities 24 25modifiable risk factors  editmaintaining a healthy weight and good prenatal care can reduce the risk of miscarriage 28 some risk factors can be minimized by avoiding the following smoking 34 36 28cocaine use 34alcohol 28poor nutrition occupational exposure to agents that can cause miscarriage 38medications associated with miscarriage 58 60 28drug abuse 28management  editwomen who miscarry early in their pregnancy usually do not require any subsequent medical treatment but they can benefit from support and counseling 22 95 most early miscarriages will complete on their own in other cases medication treatment or aspiration of the products of conception can be used to remove remaining tissue 96 while bed rest has been advocated to prevent miscarriage this has not been found to be of benefit 97 20 those who are or who have experienced an abortion benefit from the use of careful medical language significant distress can often be managed by the ability of the clinician to clearly explain terms without suggesting that the woman or couple are somehow to blame 98evidence to support rho d immune globulin after a spontaneous miscarriage is unclear 99 in the uk rho d immune globulin is recommended in rhnegative women after 12 weeks gestational age and before 12 weeks gestational age in those who need surgery or medication to complete the miscarriage 100methods  editno treatment is necessary for a diagnosis of complete miscarriage so long as ectopic pregnancy is ruled out in cases of an incomplete miscarriage empty sac or missed abortion there are three treatment options watchful waiting medical management and surgical treatment with no treatment  watchful waiting  most miscarriages 65–80 will pass naturally within two to six weeks 101 this treatment avoids the possible side effects and complications of medications and surgery 102 but increases the risk of mild bleeding need for unplanned surgical treatment and incomplete miscarriage medical treatment usually consists of using misoprostol a prostaglandin to contract the uterus expelling remaining tissue out of the cervix this works within a few days in 95 of cases 101 vacuum aspiration or sharp curettage can be used though vacuum aspiration is lowerrisk and more common 101delayed and incomplete miscarriage  editin delayed or incomplete miscarriage treatment depends on the amount of tissue remaining in the uterus treatment can include surgical removal of the tissue with vacuum aspiration or misoprostol 103 studies looking at the methods of anaesthesia for surgical management of incomplete miscarriage have not shown that any adaptation from normal practice is beneficial 104 some organizations recommend delaying sexual relations immediately after a miscarriage to prevent infection 105induced miscarriage  editfurther information selfinduced abortion an induced abortion may be performed by a physician for women who do not want to continue the pregnancy 106selfinduced abortion performed by a woman or nonmedical personnel is extremely dangerous and is still a cause of maternal mortality in some countries in some locales it is illegal or carries heavy social stigma 107support  editorganizations exist that provide information and counseling to help those who have had a miscarriage 108 family and friends often conduct a memorial or burial service hospitals also can provide support and help memorialize the event depending on locale others desire to have a private ceremony 108 providing appropriate support with frequent discussions and sympathetic counseling are part of evaluation and treatment those who experience unexplained miscarriage can be treated with emotional support 95 98outcomes  editpsychological and emotional effects  edita cemetery for miscarried fetuses stillborn babies and babies who have died soon after birth see also miscarriage and grief and miscarriage and mental illness experiencing a miscarriage is a major loss for all pregnant women 95 a miscarriage can result in anxiety depression or stress for those involved 79 109 110 the impact on a womans life can be underestimated 111 it can have an effect on the whole family 112 almost all those experiencing a miscarriage go through a grieving process 2 113 114 prenatal attachment often exists that can be seen as parental sensitivity love and preoccupation directed toward the unborn child 115 serious emotional impact is usually experienced immediately after the miscarriage 2 some may go through the same loss when an ectopic pregnancy is terminated 28 in some the realization of the loss can take weeks providing family support to those experiencing the loss can be challenging because some find comfort in talking about the miscarriage while others may find the event painful to discuss the father can have the same sense of loss expressing feelings of grief and loss can sometimes be harder for men some women are able to begin planning their next pregnancy after a few weeks of having the miscarriage for others planning another pregnancy can be difficult 108 105 some facilities acknowledge the loss parents can name and hold their infant they may be given momentos such as photos and footprints some conduct a funeral or memorial service they may express the loss by planting a tree 116some health organizations recommend that sexual activity be delayed after the miscarriage the menstrual cycle should resume after about three to four months 108 women report that the medical management of their miscarriage can be performed in a manner that can make the experience even worse than the event 111 women report that they were dissatisfied with the care they received from physicians and nurses 117subsequent pregnancies  editsome parents want to try to have a baby very soon after the miscarriage the decision of trying to become pregnant again can be difficult reasons exist that may prompt parents to consider another pregnancy for older mothers there may be some sense of urgency other parents are optimistic that future pregnancies are likely to be successful many are hesitant and want to know about the risk of having another or more miscarriages some clinicians recommend that the women have one menstrual cycle before attempting another pregnancy this is because the date of conception may be hard to determine also the first menstrual cycle after a miscarriage can be much longer or shorter than expected parents may be advised to wait even longer if they have experienced late miscarriage or molar pregnancy or are undergoing tests some parents wait for six months based upon recommendations from their health care provider 105the risks of having another miscarriage vary according to the cause the risk of having another miscarriage after a molar pregnancy is very low the risk of another miscarriage is highest after the third miscarriage preconception care is available in some locales 105later cardiovascular disease  editthere is a significant association between miscarriage and later development of coronary artery disease but not of cerebrovascular disease 118 27epidemiology  editamong women who know they are pregnant the miscarriage rate is roughly 10 to 20 while rates among all fertilized zygotes are around 30 to 50 1 5 44 95 a 2012 review found the risk of miscarriage between 5 and 20 weeks from 11 to 22 119 up to the 13th week of pregnancy the risk of miscarriage each week was around 2 dropping to 1 in week 14 and reducing slowly between 14 and 20 weeks 119the precise rate is not known because a large number of miscarriages occur before pregnancies become established and before the woman is aware they are pregnant 119 additionally those with bleeding in early pregnancy may seek medical care more often than those not experiencing bleeding 119 although some studies attempt to account for this by recruiting women who are planning pregnancies and testing for very early pregnancy they still are not representative of the wider population 119the prevalence of miscarriage increases with the age of both parents 119 120 121 122 in a danish registerbased study where the prevalence of miscarriage was 11 the prevalence rose from 9 at 22 years of age to 84 by 48 years of age 120  needs update another later study in 2013 found that when either parent was over the age of 40 the rate of known miscarriages doubled 44in 2010 50000 inpatient admissions for miscarriage occurred in the uk 12terminology  editmany women fathers and partners refer to miscarriage as the loss of a baby rather than an embryo or fetus clinical terms can suggest blame and even cause anger terms that are known to cause distress in those experiencing miscarriage include habitual aborter products of conception blighted ovum and evacuation of retained products of conception erpc pregnancy loss is a term that describes miscarriage ectopic and molar pregnancies 98 the term  fetal death  applies variably in different countries and contexts sometimes incorporating weight and gestational age from 16 weeks in norway 20 weeks in the us and australia 24 weeks in the uk to 26 weeks in italy and spain 123 124 125 a fetus that died before birth after this gestational age may be referred to as a stillbirth 123 under uk law all stillbirths should be registered 126 although this does not apply to miscarriages history  editthe medical terminology applied to experiences during early pregnancy has changed over time 127 before the 1980s health professionals used the phrase spontaneous abortion for a miscarriage and induced abortion for a termination of the pregnancy 127 128 in the late 1980s and 1990s doctors became more conscious of their language in relation to early pregnancy loss some medical authors advocated change to use of miscarriage instead of spontaneous abortion because they argued this would be more respectful and help ease a distressing experience 129 130  needs update the change was being recommended by some in the profession in britain in the late 1990s 131 in 2005 the european society for human reproduction and embryology eshre published a paper aiming to facilitate a revision of nomenclature used to describe early pregnancy events 86society and culture  editin places where induced abortion is illegal or carries social stigma suspicion may surround miscarriage complicating an already sensitive language issue research suggests that some dislike the term spontaneous abortion for miscarriage some are indifferent and some prefer it these preferences may reflect cultural differences 98 in the 1960s the use of miscarriage in britain instead of spontaneous abortion occurred after changes in legislation developments in ultrasound technology in the early 1980s allowed them to identify miscarriages 127 according to french statutes an infant born before the age of viability determined to be 28 weeks is not registered as a child if birth occurs after this the infant is granted a certificate that allows women who have given birth to a stillborn child to have a symbolic record of that child this certificate can include a registered and given name with the purpose of allowing a funeral and acknowledgement of the event 132 133 134other animals  editmiscarriage occurs in all animals that experience pregnancy though in such contexts it is more commonly referred to as a spontaneous abortion the two terms are synonymous there are a variety of known risk factors in nonhuman animals for example in sheep miscarriage may be caused by crowding through doors or being chased by dogs 135 in cows spontaneous abortion may be caused by contagious disease such as brucellosis or campylobacter but often can be controlled by vaccination 136 in many species of sharks and rays stress induced miscarriage occurs frequently on capture 137other diseases are also known to make animals susceptible to miscarriage spontaneous abortion occurs in pregnant prairie voles when their mate is removed and they are exposed to a new male 138 an example of the bruce effect although this effect is seen less in wild populations than in the laboratory 139 female mice who had spontaneous abortions showed a sharp rise in the amount of time spent with unfamiliar males preceding the abortion than those who did not 140see also  editchildbirth pregnancy and infant loss remembrance day
