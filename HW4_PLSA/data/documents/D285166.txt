fleurdelis meaning – blood line of the the blessed trinityby moe  aug 14 2012  history of the brotherhood meaning of symbols  13 comments share 26 tweet 1 pin 2 share 129i am prepared here is my keen edged sword decked with five flowerdeluces on each side  joan of arc the facts are that when you see an ancient symbol that is used today by a country on their flag or royalty via their coat of arms that can also be traced back to ancient civilizations you can be certain that it is the very same royal brotherhood using the same old royal symbols to honor their ancestors it is really that royally simple the fleurdelis or fleurdelys in french literally means  lily flower  fleur means flower and lis means lily or iris  however let me state that when you see this symbol emblazoned today on various flags or engraved on royal crowns the fleurdelis does not represent the lily flower but the trinity of the brotherhood for it is and emblem of a blood line of divine majesty and the symbol of a particular royal brotherhood that had originated long before the foundation of rome or the founding royal houses of france the fleurdelis is modeled after the lotus in egypt that was associated with the psychotropic nile lily the nile is where this same brotherhood had originated therefor it is only fitting that they would choose an ancient egyptian symbol for plant meaning tree of life that was three sacred lotus lilies as their symbol it is the fleurdelis that has now replaced he lily as a symbol of royalty of this same said brotherhood to honor the three glorious lilies of jesus mary and joseph the blood line of the the blessed trinity who is the father ptolemy xiv who is the biblical allegorical joseph the son augustus caesar jesus christ and the everblessed cleopatra vii who is the allegorical virgin mary and mother of god jesus the son of god incarnate being the first the second to the everblessed virgin mary mother of god and the third to st joseph spouse of the blessed virgin mary and fosterfather to the son of god the white fleurdelis often called the annunciation of the blessed virgin mary  the flower of the queen of heaven the blessed virgin mary and a symbol of purity or whiteness this day is held in like reverence by the latin greek and reformed churches everywhere as the day when the angel brought the happy tidings to the blessed virgin mary of the incarnation of the son of god as told in the gospel of st luke 1 28 and coming in he said to her “greetings favored one the lord is with you”catholiccom says under full of grace  that these blessings included her role as the new eve corresponding to christs role as the new adam  her immaculate conception her spiritual motherhood of all christians and her assumption into heaven hence the everblessed cleopatra vii is the spiritual mother of all christians and the new eve of the new testament augustus caesar is the new christ and the new adam when catholics recite the hail mary which says hail mary full of grace the lord is with thee blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb jesus holy mary mother of god pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death amen hence when the hail mary prayer is said it is done for the mary and her seeds childrenblood line of the blessed trinity represented by the fleurdelis who the virgin mary is the new eve via the new testament in this 6th age this mary and eve is no other than cleopatra vii who you will also find her under other names such as mariamne i and she is also called mariamne the hasmonean monsieur sonnini discovered an egyptian statue holding a sceptre which terminated in a fleurdelis the blessed virgin mary the last pharaoh of egypt cleopatra vii was of the family of ptolemy and had always appeared in public clothed in a robe sacred to isis her head adorned with a crown of golden lily leaves cleopatra was a descendant of the ptolemaic dynasty who are an ancient greek family sometimes also known as the lagids or lagides who descend from ptolemy is father lagus after the reign of alexander the great they would be known as the macedonian greeks or the hasmoneans maccabees or asmonians whose family emblem is also an eagle this royal family ruled during the ptolemaic empire in egypt which was called the hellenistic period in 305 bc he declared himself king ptolemy i later known as soter savior what this means is that this particular family who wrote both the old and new testaments had made their kings into saviors messiahs christs and the king of kings their rule lasted for 275 years from 305 bc to the time of cleopatra vii in 30 bc when rome united with egypt under the savior and messiah augustus caesar this same family you will find ancient times that his family had lived amongst various peoples such as the assyrians greeks persians romans and the egyptians you can even trace this symbol into ancient egypt depicted in artwork and also the headdresses of the egyptian sphinxes you will find this symbol throughout history as an ornament on the crowns scepters thrones seals coins etc of not only french kings but also on greek roman german english spanish egyptian syrian and

some of the different kinds of fleurdelis that exist around the world good article overall but one wonders what you think all that means brian walker • 4 years ago this comment may either confound or spiritually supplement the content of this site but it is meant in good faith mysticallyinitiated and thereby tasked to revitalize and disseminate a longsuppressed lifeafterlife ad infinitum cosmogony without getting persecuted in the process like jesus in trying to propound it before me i conduct a strategic and whimsical mission called the cosmos coconut club i also operate a website wwwvigiltrustcouk and a new facebook page the vigil trust both these sites bear the fleurdelis symbol but not for the reasons above my mysticallyinspired understanding is that this symbol could well represent the balanced dualitywithinsingularity constitution of the ultimate force my more scientificallyorientated god and that this force will eventually evolve us into wellbalanced androgynous beings on earth before going back into the universal meltingpot so to speak and starting its adinfinitum process all over again yes fellow travellers a very big pill to swallow as it was to me in 1980 when i was initiated to dispense it amenbrian cosmos coconut club sri lankated • 4 years ago funny how you can take almost any pagan symbol or idea and just include it into your religion so far from

river in the netherlands fleur means flower in dutch bloem fleur de lis in dutch is bloem van de luts flower of the luts this is the new symbol replacement for the old one brian • 5 years ago i enjoyed your article but i am still not sure i thoroughly understand what brotherhood are you talking about and are you saying that cleopatra vii is actually mary i am new to this topic so i am sorry if my questions sound doubtful it is ignorance of the topic in general and a deep curiosity to learn what this symbol truly means maurice • 5 years ago thanks brian for your comment yes it is a theory i have based on my extensive research and per the new testament which is the product of this union stephen lewis • 5 years ago hello i also have a family crest of 3 large gold fleur de lis with a royal blue background i think it goes back to louis the vii or just after him i am also a masonic kt it feels right what a great phrasestatement  as above so below it sounds so resolute love it moe • 5 years ago thanks for your comment stephen the fleur de lis actually goes back to egypt and in particular the ptolemy and herod dynastys which became the tribe of levi which later merged with the caesars aka tribe of judah egypt was where the magic of as above so below was first practiced and now what you see is solomons temple that is now world wide via as above so below peace love and light
