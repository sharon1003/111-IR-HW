in roman mythology neptune was the god of the sea he is known as poseidon in greek mythology the planet was probably named after the sea gods because of its deep blue color this is the symbol for neptune neptune is the eighth planet from the sun and the fourth largest by size of the nine planets neptune is smaller in size but its heavier than uranus neptunes blue color is the result of a gas called methane in its atmosphere like the other gas planets neptune has rapid winds trapped in bands of latitude and large storms neptunes winds are the fastest in the solar system reaching2000 km hourat the time of voyagers flyby neptunes most outstanding feature was the great dark spot in the southern hemisphere it was about half the size as jupiters great red spot  about 1 earth would fit into it neptunes winds blew the great dark spot westward at 300 meterssecond 700 mphvoyager 2 also saw a smaller dark spot in the southern hemisphere and a small irregular white cloud that zipped around neptune every 16 hours or so now this feature is known as the scooter recently however the hubble space telescope hst showed that the great dark spot has disappeared scientists think that it has either dissipated like our storms do or is currently being hidden by neptunes atmosphere also hst discovered a new dark spot in neptunes northern hemisphere this shows that neptunes atmosphere changes rapidly neptune also has rings the voyager 2 spacecraft showed scientists that neptune indeed has complete rings with bright clumps like uranus and jupiter neptunes rings are very dark and very faint scientists still havent figured out what they are made of yet look for neptune neptune can be seen with binoculars if you know exactly where to look but a large telescope is needed to see anything other than a tiny disk
