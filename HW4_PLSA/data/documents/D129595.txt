what does the bible say about protection subscribe to our question of the week question what does the bible say about protection answer there are many promises and examples of physical protection in the word of god both the old testament and new testament god promised protection to the israelites against the nations who would come against them as they entered the promised land “i will send my terror ahead of you and throw into confusion all the people among whom you come and i will make all your enemies turn their backs to you”  exodus 2327  here we see god protecting those whose actions were in accordance to his foreordained plans and purpose the psalms of david are filled with praise for god as he protected his chosen one against his enemies  psalm 183 547 1387  no matter the amount of power or wrath that david’s enemies brought against him they were no match for the protection of god god’s protection in job’s life was evident as well even though job suffered through many trials as a result of the attacks of satan it was god who drew the line in the sand over which satan could not cross satan was limited to doing exactly what god allowed him to do and nothing more  job 1–3  even through all the misery and afflictions job endured god was protecting him from greater harm god also protected job’s faith allowing job to be tested only so far before he stepped in and spoke to job  job 38–42  even though job could not see god working behind the scenes he came to understand that god’s protection is sure and faithful because he promises to his people “i will never leave you nor forsake you”  deuteronomy 316 joshua 15 1 chronicles 2820 hebrews 135  understand however that although god has the ability to deliver us out of every physical calamity or trouble it may not be his will to do so sometimes he uses these trials to purify us at these times we should “count it pure joy” because by allowing such trials god tests our faith to develop more faith so that we persevere and grow to maturity and christlikeness  james 123  protecting us from such trials would not be beneficial to us we may think that if god really wanted to protect us he would provide wealth and ease in this life but god does not always protect us from the consequences of bad financial decisions or our lack of diligence in working “make it your ambition to lead a quiet life to mind your own business and to work with your hands just as we told you”  1 thessalonians 411  god made solomon extremely wealthy because his attitude toward wealth was much less than his desire for god’s wisdom and knowledge as solomon walked in sin and adultery his wealth was destroyed ultimately god uses wealth to lift up some and bring down others all of which is part of his protection of his own “praise the lord blessed is the man who fears the lord who finds great delight in his commands wealth and riches are in his house and his righteousness endures forever”  psalm 1121 3  “the lord sends poverty and wealth he humbles and he exalts”  1 samuel 27 the true essence of god’s protection is the eternal indwelling of the holy spirit  ephesians 22122  the believer is sealed for the day of final glorification  ephesians 11314  we are protected in all things we have the ability though by allowing our sin nature to rule us to depart from the will of god a shield can only protect if it is picked up and used we cannot sit back and say “god will protect me” if we have not done the things we ought to be doing it is only through prayer and the study of god’s word that we are assured of god’s protection in our lives recommended resource the right to lead learning leadership through character and courage by john maxwell dig into this topic more with logos bible software—get the free version now related topics what does the bible say about fear how should a christian view selfesteem what is a hedge of protection what does the bible say about responsibility what does the bible say about attitude return to topical bible questions return to got questionsorg home what does the bible say about protection
