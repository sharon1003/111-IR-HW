change your appearance in skyrim november 28 2013 by shane scarbrough 3 comments one of the great things about skyrim is the game’s character creation system as far as rpgs go skyrim’s system truly is robust when i played the game for the first time i spent hours fine tuning my character’s appearance right from the start i was given full control over my character’s physical traits via a slew of menu choices looking back it was lots of fun playing around with the character creation controls and adjusting everything from nose type eye shape skin tone and more in the end i really liked how my character turned out he had a chiseled build and a wicked looking scar across his face that made him look fierce after investing hundreds of hours into the game though i have to admit that i was starting to get a little bored with my character’s appearance what had been cosmetically fresh and exciting was now tiresome if only there was some way to change things up…change your appearance in skyrim with the dawnguard expansion you can change your character’s appearance when the game was first released there was no way to change your appearance in skyrim players were stuck with the appearance choices they made at the beginning of the game things changed though with the release of the dawnguard dlc expansion while you can’t change your character’s race or gender you now have the ability to change your looks the dawnguard expansion gives players the option to change their character’s weight eye color skin color hair color and hair style tattoos and war paint scars facial hair dirt feathers and horns argonianshow to change your appearance it costs 1000 gold but you can change your appearance in skyrim to change your appearance in skyrim you need to visit the ragged flagon in riften and see a woman named galathil the ragged flagon is the thieves guild’s tavern and is located in the city’s subterranean sewer system galathil wears a hooded robe and can be found sitting on a bench in the tavern when you speak with her the first time she lets it be known that she “can work with your face”if you want to change your appearance it’ll cost you 1000 gold the price isn’t cheap but if you’re tired of how your character looks it’s money well spent once you pay galathil she’ll conduct “surgery” on you in actuality the character creation menu opens and you can customize your character’s appearance to your heart’s content final thoughts so how about it have you ever wanted to change your appearance in skyrim and would you be willing to spend 1000 gold to do so share you thoughts in the speak your mind section below also be sure to read about the upcoming elder scrolls online character creation system at first blush the system seems very much like skyrim’s but with some enhancements until next timerelated posts three retro video games that helped inspire skyrim the easy way to get married in skyrim best skyrim mage house skyrim virtual reality is here filed under featured skyrim tagged with dawnguard skyrim skyrim world
