low white blood cell count not always a sign of medical problem february 8 2011  by rajiv pruthi dear mayo clinic i was told after my recent physical that my white blood cell count was low is this something to be concerned about am i more susceptible to colds or viruses answer a low white blood cell count can sometimes be a sign of an underlying medical problem but not always first its important to determine what your health care provider means by low not all medical laboratories use the same range to decide whats normal and whats not second you need to consider factors such as your age gender and ethnic group some groups of people just have naturally lower white blood cell levels than others if your white blood cell count is truly lower than it should be then further investigation is warranted to uncover the root cause as part of your immune system white blood cells fight disease and are important for the bodys defense against infections a chronically low white blood cell count leukopenia can make you vulnerable to bacterial infections and could signal a serious health problem before you start investigating the cause of a low white blood cell count though its important to discuss with your doctor what your test results mean different laboratories classify low white blood cell counts differently generally a count lower than 3500 white blood cells per microliter of blood is considered a low white blood cell count but ask your doctor what the normal range is for the laboratory he or she uses it may also be helpful to discuss exactly how far outside that range your number falls a white blood cell count thats just slightly below the cutoff for the established normal range may actually still be normal and not require further evaluation in addition what would be considered a low white blood cell count for some people may be a normal finding for others for example africanamericans tend to have lower white blood cell counts than caucasians its also not uncommon for young caucasian women to have white blood cell counts that fall slightly below the normal reference ranges talk to your doctor about how individual factors may affect your white blood cell levels with all that in mind if you and your doctor determine that your white blood cell count is lower than it should be that is cause for concern because a low white blood cell count cannot in and of itself be used to diagnose a specific disease or disorder youll likely need more testing to further assess your condition underlying causes for a low white blood cell count can range from benign disorders such as vitamin deficiencies to more serious blood diseases such as leukemia or lymphoma a truly low white blood cell count also puts you at higher risk for infections — typically bacterial infections but viral infections also may be a concern to help reduce your infection risk your doctor may suggest you wear a facemask and avoid anyone with a cold or other illness washing your hands regularly and thoroughly can also help reduce risk ask your doctor if there are other precautions you should take to help avoid infections — rajiv pruthi m b b s hematology mayo clinic rochester minn medical edge from mayo clinic is an educational resource and doesnt replace regular medical care email a question to medicaledgemayoedu or write medical edge from mayo clinic co tms 2225 kenmore ave suite 114 buffalo n y 14207 for more information visit httpwwwmayoclinicorg c 2011 mayo foundation for medical education and research distributed by tribune media services inc all rights reserved more so perhaps there is a place for haslem can bosh wade break out of their funk do nicknames on jerseys go against heat sacrifice mantra do heat appreciate magnitude of game 5 cunanans siblings speak out could heat find value in nba free agency
