if your paleo radar is on point any recipe including “ beans ” might provoke an almost instinctive “that’s not paleo” reaction and possibly an understandable frustration born of getting excited about one too many “paleo” recipes only to find they were full of corn or peanuts or some other random nonpaleo food but before you judge consider…green beans are technically in the legume family but they have very few of the antinutrients that make legumes a paleo nogo if you still don’t want the beans eg you’re on the aip and it’s important to be 100 strict just replace them with something else you could do asparagus red onions or just about any other vegetable of your choice in place of the green beans if you wanted or even just use a double batch of carrots and call it a dish the important part is really the balsamic glaze – the bright tanginess of the vinegar really perks up the vegetables if you’re serving these with mashed potatoes and gravy or anything else “heavy” the balsamic cuts through that a little and the contrast makes all the flavors stand out more this would be an easy way to get an extra side in for holiday dinners if you’re stressed out and pressed for time carrots are hardy and undemanding so you could throw them in the oven alongside something else if necessary and the dish would probably turn out fine it gets a little extra vegetable matter into the holiday rotation and you might want to make a double batch because it’s sure to be gobbled up fastbalsamic roasted carrots and green beans recipe serves 4 prep 10 min cook 35 min nutritionchart carbs”56″ fat”10″ protein”14″add to meal plan ingredients toggle units1 lb carrots sliced1 lb green beans trimmed2 garlic cloves minced3 tbsp olive oil3 tbsp balsamic vinegar fresh parsley sea salt and freshly ground black pepper preparation preheat your oven to 400°f toss the carrots and green beans in a bowl with olive oil garlic and salt and pepper to taste transfer to a roasting pan and place in the preheated oven roast for 25 to 30 minutes drizzle vegetables with balsamic vinegar and roast another 3 to 5 minutes serve sprinkled with fresh parsley
