clinical 360° allceramic how to seat posterior allceramic crowns ivoclar vivadent’s multilink automix universal luting cement provides reliability durability march 21 2012 by john schwartz dds director integra institute  center for advanced dental learning information provided by ivoclar vivadent inc this case demonstrates placement of highly esthetic indirect restorations using an efficient and reliable adhesive cementation technique reducing the risk of debonding fracture and restorative failure the allceramic and adhesive materials selected provided a stable durable and longlasting bond by carefully considering material such as ivoclar vivadent’s multilink automix and technique selection the patient benefited from restorations that demonstrated ideal fit function and esthetics about the material demonstrating excellent reliability and durability in the anterior and posterior multilink automix is an innovative and universal selfcure with an optional light cure luting cement indicated for inlays onlays crowns bridges and posts multilink automix allows cementation of a range of restorative materials including metal and metal ceramics oxide ceramics fiberreinforced composites precious alloys and allceramics used with a onestep primer multilink ab ivoclar vivadent that selfetches selfcures and seals dentin in 15 seconds excellent marginal adaption and high immediate bond strengths are achievable the hydrolytically stable acidic monomers ensure durable adhesion and immediate bonding and reaches complete polymerization in 56 minutes without using a curing light using the automix delivery system ivoclar vivadent a consistent mix is achieved without activation capsules or application tools and devices the “easy cleanup” formula allows excess cement to be precured into a gellike consistency for simpler and more efficient removal case presentation the patient presented for functional and esthetic restorations in the posterior and was given a comprehensive esthetic and functional exam all diagnostic information was gathered and a definitive treatment plan developed due to masticatory forces under where the proposed restorations would function an esthetic lithium disilicate material with high monolithic strength ips emax cad that would be fabricated using cadcam technology  the teeth were prepared following the manufacturer’s guide for adhesive cementation of cadcam fabricated posterior lithium disilicate crowns for proper preparation 15 mm to 20 mm of occlusal reduction was completed along with 15 mm of axial reduction and 10 mm reduction at the gingival margins the internal line angles were rounded and a flatended tapered diamond bur established a buttjoint margin step 1 prior to seating the lithium disilicate crowns fig 1 were triedin to ensure proper fit function and esthetics critical to the success of cementation a fluidfree field was established using selfsupporting cheekretractors cotton rolls and dryangles in the anterior a latexfree lip and cheek retractor optra gate ivoclar vivadent also was placed to ensure improved visibility and accessibility for a patient who salivates excessively place the patient on nasal decongestants claritin dchlortrimeton merck  co for one to two days prior to treatment to reduce the risk of salivary contamination step 2 after achieving complete isolation the preparations were cleaned with a slurry of water and pumice if bacterial contamination is a concern a slurry of pumice and 2 chlorhexidine rinse consepsis ultradent products may be used based on its antimicrobial effect the preparations were blotdried or lightly dried so they remained moist step 3 prior to applying the bonding agent the preparations were checked for moisture and debris the gingival tissues were examined using a prophylactic angle and microtip scrubbing for bleeding which would contaminate the adhesive cement after confirming healthy tissue individual preparation margins were cleaned manually with microtip brush scrubbing and the waterpumice slurry to remove contaminants and the remaining slurry solution the preparations were irrigated with water and airdried step 4 after preparing the dentition the lithium disilicate crowns were etched with 5 hydrofluoric acid gel ips ceramic etching gel ivoclar vivadent for 20 seconds to remove any remaining contaminants and achieve the manufacturer’s recommended etch pattern fig 2 the crowns were thoroughly rinsed with water and airdried fig 3 step 5 a silane coupler monobond plus ivoclar vivadent was placed on the internal crown surfaces and allowed to set for 1 minute figs 4  5 air was used to remove excess material then the crowns were ready to be filled with adhesive cement multilink automix and seated fig 6 step 6 to facilitate a high immediate bond strength seal the dentin and achieve ideal marginal adaptation a selfetching and selfcuring primer multilink ab was mixed and applied to prepared dentition three drops 1 per restoration of multilink a were mixed with 3 drops 1 per restoration of multilink b in the provided mixing tray figs 79 using the microtip brush primer solution was scrubbed into each preparation to ensure sufficient coverage 15 seconds on dentition 30 seconds on enamel step 7 after applying primer air was used to remove excess solution and thoroughly dry the surface fig 10 step 8 immediately following the selfcure with optional light cure universal adhesive cement multilink automix was extruded from the automix tip into the first lithium disilicate crown fig 11 the crown was seated on the preparation and firm pressure applied the remaining restorations were filled and seated consecutively in the same manner fig 12 step 9 the wave technique was used to facilitate proper curing and seating holding the curing light 2 mm from the crowns and slightly waving it in a single direction from one interproximal area to the next the cervical andor buccal surfaces of each crown were cured for 34 seconds each excess cement was removed from the buccal and interproximal areas with a scaler fig 13 after removing all excess the cervical aspect of the buccal surfaces of each crown was cured for 510 seconds the lingual were then cured for 34 seconds each and excessive cement removed with the scaler upon completion the interproximal areas of all restorations were cleaned with dental floss the seated crowns were cured for 20 seconds on high power approximately 1200 m wcm2 on both the buccal and lingual surfaces the patient was very pleased with the final lithium disilicate cad fabricated crowns ips emax cad seated intraorally with the universal dualcure adhesive cement multilink automix the restorations ultimately provided the function and strength required along with the esthetics the patient desired fig 14
