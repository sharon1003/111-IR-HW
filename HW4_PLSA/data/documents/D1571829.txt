staples northlands can rise from rubble of a demolished rexall place david staples edmonton journal 04172015the wayne gretzky statue stands outside rexall place home of the oilers it’s almost certain that the 41yearold arena will be demolished when the oilers move to their new downtown arena david staples writes edmonton journalfile rick mac william rick mac william  edmonton journal share adjust comment print edmonton  wayne gretzky’s old home is almost certainly doomed for the wrecking ball edmonton’s famous arena — the ice palace that opened in 1974 as the northlands coliseum and is now known as rexall place — will likely be demolished after the new downtown arena opens in 2016 mayor don iveson and the board of northlands the booster group that built the arena and still runs a lucrative concert business there talk of possibly repurposing the 41yearold building but edmonton lacks the population and northlands lacks the capital to pull off such a plan that’s why a new northlands plan also contemplates the 8 million demolition of the structure case histories of similar arena situations in other cities point toward demolition in the past two decades 17 new national hockey league arenas have opened up across north america thirteen times the old arena was demolished or is slated to be twice in toronto and montreal the facade of the old building was saved and the interior repurposed but both those situations are unlike rexall place maple leaf gardens and the montreal forum are both downtown in much larger cities in only two of the 17 cases has the old arena remained a competitive venue in los angeles with its 13 million population private investors pumped 50 million to spruce up the great western forum as a concert venue in vancouver 204 million in government funds renovated pacific coliseum for the 2010 olympics it’s home to a western hockey league team and it hosts multinight shows like cirque du soleil the vancouver situation is closest to edmonton but that metropolitan area has 23 million people and there is no olympics slated for this city northlands leaders are more realistic than ever about the arena’s fate but are still struggling with what to do even as the board has now dropped its combative attitude during the protracted arena negotiations from 2010 to 2012 former northlands president richard andersen fiercely maintained that if katz and the city opened a new building downtown northlands would keep open its arena and compete for business oilers owner daryl katz demanded that northlands sign a noncompete clause or he’d refuse to invest downtown andersen fired back telling the city that northlands would only agree if it was compensated 250 million for lost concert revenue in the end katz dropped his bid for a noncompete clause but only after the city agreed to place a ticket tax at all northlands events with none of the tax money going to northlands all of it to general city revenues thus northlands was thwarted and it’s now realizing that its concert business is not worth anywhere close to 250 million indeed it’s admitting that it makes no sense for anyone if northlands tries to aggressively compete with a downtown arena so it will be either repurposing and collaboration with katz or demolition and it’s necessary to quickly decide says northlands president tim reid “we could compete and we could compete with strength but we would eventually lose and ultimately that would hurt the business model and sustainability of northlands”northlands moved away from compete mode after a board delegation visited kansas city last fall a new downtown arena opened there in 2007 but that city’s version of northlands decided to try to compete by keeping open business at its old kemper arena but old arenas on the fringe simply can’t take on sparkling new downtown arenas today the neighbourhood around kemper is in tough with plenty of boardedup buildings graffiti broken windows the arena itself is closed up and surrounded by caution tape it’s so unsafe that they don’t hold events in the arena anymore but in the arena parking lot“we had a very insightful moment that if we continued to beat the drum of competition we would find ourselves being a kemper arena and that would not be good for anybody” reid says northlands has three major buildings — the arena northlands park for horse racing and the expo centre for conventions — on its 160acre site the future of horse racing is also in doubt but northlands got into the arena business in 1912 and into horse racing in the 1910s so it’s no easy matter for it to change course yet that is the imperative as its new leadership understands with this sensible new attitude northlands has an opportunity to redefine itself and redevelop its grounds
