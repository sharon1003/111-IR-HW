going to chiropractors which relieve the pain temporarily i have great instability in my cervical spine which is causing this pain the bummer here is that in the past none of my ct scans mris xrays showed anything was wrong with me this in turn had a negative affect on my law suit i am now on my third pain doctor and he is the first person to give me a diagnosis thank god he said that based on my symptoms it sounds like occipital neuralgia he wants me to have an occipital stimulator implanted and im all for itwhatever eases the pain well my insurance company doesnt want to pay for it i now have a healthcare advocacy taking care of this for me just two weeks ago i had atlanto axial joint injections done on the right side of my neck i felt wonderful for a week and then a week to the day my pain returned relentlessly i go back this thursday for another round of this injection they told me it should have a longer lasting effect this time why dont i really believe it ive had so much false hope for over four years already i am now at risk for losing my job because of all the absenses i have from my pain im trying to research this to see if it is legal in my state for a company to fire you because of chronic pain if this injection doesnt helplast im afraid what will happen ifwhen i have to take more time off for another procedure i really want to have surgery to help this pain now that i know what is wrong with me does anyone have any information or share the same pain i would appreciate any information anyone has to offer back to topholmesla regular member date joined jan

have had multple procedures as well cortisone injections nerve blocks rhizotomy burning of the nerve endings chiropractor care physical therapy massage therapy my xray showed whiplash loss of my cervical curve and mild degeneration disease my ct scan was clean and one doctor said my mri showed spondylosis with a tiny bone spur and mild degeneration disease all of which he tells me is not what is causing my pain i beg to differ anywhoo what are your symptoms of occipital neuralgia for a while i thought that is one thing i had i get this pain at the base of my skull that can best be described as someone just beat me over the back of the head with a baseball bat i struggled with getting a diagnosis as well but no one will give me one i also get really bad muscle spasms in my neck and shoulders the pain is a viscous cycle i wore a neck brace for 3 weeks and it helped but now i am stuck with tension headaches and the spasms do you work full time if you do then you qualify for the family medical leave act fmla it allows you 12 weeks off for your own personal medical issues or medical issues of a family member that you must care for and your job is safe it doesnt have to be 12 consecutive weeks it can be intermittent i recently signed up myself hr gave me the paperwork and my doctor had to fill it out i hope this information helps you positive feelings that you can get through thisback to top knightgoddess new member date joined oct 2007 total posts  5posted 1022007 1227 pm gmt 6thanks for your response i have had the rhizotomy nerve blocks facet joint injections and massage therapy as well none of the procedures worked for me i also had botox injections in the back of my neck back and head it worked great for almost 2 months then it wore off i had it done a second time and it did nothing the worst part was insurance doesnt cover it so i had to pay the steep price for the botox myself i also had prolotherapy and that seemed to make my pain worse after the second round he just gave trigger point injections instead and referred to the pain doctor i am now seeing i am also on several types of pain meds that dont do anything for me the only one that seems to help is my migraine meds but they make me feel like crap after several days of taking them i feel so tired and it was almost hard to breathe sometimes they even make my joints hurt my symptoms of occipital neuralgia are exteme pain at the base of my skull where it curves under it feels like im being jabbed with an ice pick the pain radiates into my shoulders ive been thinking it was the other way around until i had my last injection and into my head and behind my eye sometimes i can even feel it in my molars sometimes i get a dull ache from the side of my neck down into my arm and into my finger tips ive also suffered nausea and vomiting when the pain gets to around a 10 my pain also switches from one side to the other without any rhyme or reason i do work full time and i am eligible for the fmla the only thing with that is you dont get paid im a single mother and cannot afford to not have any income i will be at my job for a year come november 27th after that i can go on temporary disability with that i get a portion of my check which is better than nothing back to topholmesla regular member date joined jan 2007 total posts  196posted 1022007 1244 pm gmt 6your symptoms sound similar to mine only i dont feel anything in my arms like you do just the ice pick feel only sometimes i feel it behind the eyes i am going to try the trigger point injections here pretty soon i called the dr to get it scheduled and have yet to hear back i am hoping it helps with my shoulder and neck pain from the constant muscle spasms i hear you about the fmla i cant afford to lose the money as well but it is good to know i am covered if i have to i have used up all my vacation and sick leave so its good to know i have that good luck with everythingback to top knightgoddess

it really helped me even if only was for a week it was just a relief knowing where the pain is coming from i have found a lot of helpful information on the web for occipital neuralgia just by googling it i hope you find a solution to your pain because this is the most awful thing ive ever had to endure and i though child birth was bad back to top wyo girl new member date joined oct 2007 total posts

tmarie regular member date joined aug 2005 total posts  190posted 10152007 1225 am gmt 6wow reading the posts herefinally im not alone ive been living with occipital neuralgia since february of 2005 i woke up one morning with this excruciating pain and since then its been unrelenting ive had numerous mris ct scans xrays which show all of my cervical disks to be either herniated or bulging and causing pressure on the spine even the thoracic disks at t1 through t4 are herniated the kicker is how it happened i have no clue i wasnt in an accident didnt hurt myself either the only significant event prior to this was a shoulder reconstruction perhaps they had my neckshoulder cockeyed on the operating table ive been through countless horse and pony shows you name it ive done it trigger point injections at least 20 nerve blocks facet joint injections more than i can count rhizotomies none of which have given me any continuous relief i was finally referred to a neurosurgeon who told me all of the procedures ive been through wouldnt work for occipital neuralgia he came up behind me placed his hands on my neck and knew exactly where it hurt where the pain radiated i was genuinely impressed for once he told me i need to get a trial of a nerve stimulator i read knightgoddess was told she needed the same thing where they put the electric stimulators under the scalp connected to the appropriate nerves to stimulate them so they dont cause pain he told me the trial is for approximately 7 days to see if patients can handle the constant feeling of it just like the rhizotomy pulsationnot painful prior to getting the trial done you have to get a psychiatric evaluation done because once the trial is complete theyll put the device in permanently meaning theyll feed the electrode wires down along your spine under the skin not in your spinal column and theyll be attached to the main unit which will be located deep in one of your buttocks im not sure if ill pass the psych eval but im so sick of the pain and what its doing to my life my occipital nerve is being pinchedirritated in an area where it triggers migraines constantly so much that ive had a migraine last for 32 days im constantly getting auras which used to precede the painful part of my migraines thankfully im now on topamax so i dont experience the pain for the most part the neck pain is horrendous i also have pain that radiates up and above my ear and other symptoms too im on the fentanyl patch and msir for breakthrough pain keep in touch fellow onerstmarie sorry if i rambled insomnia strikes

10182007 109 am gmt 6hi there ive posted a few times now about occipital neurolgia my also was created by a car accident in 1992 however it was only diagnosed this august 07 just before id get a full blown migraine it always started the same way 1st my neck would tense up then this would radiate down and along both shoulders and into my upper arms then down along to the front of my neck to include my collar bones region eventually working its way up the base of my skull by this point it would feel like someone took a baseball bat and whacked me in the back of my head then pain would be so intense that i would tense up even more to the point that i couldnt even move my head to the left or the right this also created a severe migraine blowout my face would twitch like crazy i can completely empathize with what you and everyone else who goes through it so far and with what i deem as successful is that my neurologist has been giving me botox treatments for my o n my migraines have decreased by at least 70  75 and i now have an idea as what its like to live without the horrific neckshould pain that was 247 with never having any relief with all the past meds and alternative therapies that i had tried in the past so far so good with my treatments i go for my next round of botox injections on nov 19th if you want ill keep you posted as to how this type of treatment goes for me all the best odessa back to top tmarie regular member date joined aug 2005 total posts  190posted 10182007 525 am gmt 6ive just recently developed the facial twitching to be honest its rather embarrassing at first it was just one area but now it seems to be effecting other areas on my face when ive been at my doctors appointments ive failed to mention the twitching to him due to the plethora of other things going onthanks for mentioning this what a monster occipital neuralgia isnow i definately need to make sure he knows this before i lose control of my facial muscles and turn into a facial contortion artist  smileid love to hear how you progress with botox my neurosurgeon told me i had two options the stimulator or manage the pain it causes im going for the trial of the stimulator if they can figure out how to put the referral in the computer system to get me to the doctortmarie back to top floyd j carroll new member date joined oct 2008 total posts  2posted 10252008 1237 am gmt 6this is my first post ever i was kicked by a horse 307 upper thigh left side it knocked me to the ground hitting my head and popping neck may 07 i started waking up with severe pain behind my left ear i was scared to death this was intense pain i went to three differnt dr and got three differnt diagnostas finally i found the right one who told me i had occipital neuralgia he said iwas third case hed seen in twenty years he tried 4 nerve blocks with no help i then searched out a pain clinic in jan08 i had 4 cervical injections lasting through march 08 not any relief did i mention i had all upper mollers pulled to eliminate that possibility aug08 i had stimultor trial then i had to wait one month for perminent implant the pain never goes away i also have rheamatold arth so i really like the stimulator it does work but the occipital pain never leaves i take lyrica witch helps alot but it is expensive it has taken me awhile to realize that for the rest of my life i will have this pain but i know without the stimulator i would be in bed at a pain level of 10 ivd had lots of tears that just appear that s a ten if you have the pain thers no decision but to have the stimulator surgery i dont regret it at all but instead of being a 10 all day and night know im a 5 to 8 the pain never leaves i hope to hear from someone else and hope to learn from others and maybe i can help someone  if you have the pain 247 the stimulator at least gives at least 50 relief and i got none before they keep you awake during surgery so you can tell the dr the wire is in the right place if i got through it  you can too its kinduve funny now my wire moved but im still getting couverage so as of now im not going through it again which is my only opion to put it back the buzz feeling goes from fingertip to fingertip i lke it  thats all for now  if your in the same pain i havr right behind my left ear and you can get a stimulator itll help but it doesnt stop the headache remember for me its 50 back to top ms ch new member date joined jan 2012 total posts  2posted 1222012 837 pm gmt 6i was in a car accident in 1999 in which i was hit very hard from the rear i got a whiplash and right at the scene of the accident i got a severe left sided headache that radiated to my left eye it felt like an ice pick in my eye prior to a diagnosis i was given ice sticks injections you name it nothing worked and i went for almost two years this way eventually i made my way to a neurologist who fixed me right up he gave me the diagnosis occipital neuralgia which nobody had done previously he started me on a small dose of nortriptyline once a day the pain totally disappeared but the medication gave me dry mouth which i didnt like so i experimented and found that if i took just one pill four times a week it would completely control the pain it has now been almost 13 years since the accident and i virtually never have that pain any more and it is all because of the small dose of nortriptyline i take 4xweek by the way i also got a very poor settlement from the other insurance company because this injury cannot be shown on xray but i will be taking medication for this injury for the rest of my life back to topcarolthiessen new member date joined feb 2012 total posts  1posted 2122012 1000 pm gmt 6ive been diagnosed with occipital neuralgiaand im wondering if
