woodworking tools needed to set up shop setting up shop woodworking tools for a home workshop custom searchhand toolspower tools when i first started woodworking i had a corner in a dark basement that i called my own i had to wind my way through boxes and old bicycles to find my workbench in those days i had a router an electric drill and a few hand tools in various states of disrepair not a great selection of woodworking tools but i got things done and had a good time doing it now i have a much better sense of what tools to use and when its hard to advise people on what tools to get when first starting woodworking since it depends on what you are going to make if you are interested in turning you need a lathe if you want to make shaker boxes you need a way to steam wood carvers need a set of carving tools you get the idea however there are woodworking tools almost everyone will need if you are just starting out you dont need to go out and buy the biggest and best if you have the money and the space more power to you excuse the pun but i actually recommend starting small having said that do buy nice tools you may not need top of the line but poorly made tools make accuracy more difficult and they can be dangerous buy woodworking tools as you need them this spreads out the cost and also gives you a chance to see why you need the tool for example do you need a bench chisel for everyday work a beater chisel for everything from scraping glue to prying things open dont tell anyone i said that or a mortising chisel for chopping mortises next learn how to use your tools before you pick them up or plug them in take a class read the manual ask an expert this is just as important for hand tools as for power tools for example did you know that you need to sharpen the blade on a new hand plane knowing that can save you a lot of frustration just as knowing how to use your table saw can save your fingers dont skimp on hand tools thinking that power tools are easier and faster power tools can give a great degree of accuracy and speed they are useful and i couldnt do my work without them however they are loud and hungry and i have a fondness for hand tools to my mind hand tools have several advantages you get a better understanding of wood by using hand tools you can safely use them on small parts they tend to be cheaper than power tools so its less of a risk if you get all set up then decided youd rather be gardening by using hand tools you get a better sense of what to expect from the power tools they are quiet an important factor for relationships when the shop is in a basement turning off the power tools and settling in at your bench is a relaxing way to end the day now for my list the following list of woodworking tools is for someone who wants to set up shop for general woodworking your own needs will probably be different in some areaswoodworking tools hand tools measuring and marking accuracy starts here train yourself to be as exact as possible you will needtape measure i have both metric and imperial id like to switch to metric entirely but since i live in the us most people i deal with think in inchesengineers square its worth spendi ng some money on a good one you will want your squares to be squarescribethis can be a marking knife a sharp awl or some other tool for marking a clean lineother hand tools card scraper again you need to know how to sharpen a scraper but they are great for cleaning up boards especially when the grain is chippy also good for getting rid of glue they are inexpensive and handy to have around japanese andor backsaw hand saws are good for fine tuning a cut making dovetails cutting small pieces etc decide what you will be doing the most and get the appropriate saw for that purpose files and rasps if you are going to be doing any shaping you will need a selection this is another area where your particular needs determine the tool block plane andor bench plane as with other woodworking tools hand planes have a bit of a learning curve including sharpening but its well worth it i reach for mine any time i need to trim end grain clean up an edge flush up a joint and for general smoothing you can find planes for lots of special operations but i recommend starting with a general purpose bench plane bench chisels a set of 6 from 1434 is most useful but they can also be bought individuallywoodworking tools power tools table saw most people will need a table saw at some point it is the workhorse of the shop it excels at ripping wood cutting the length of the board with the grain using a sled or miter gauge you can easily cross cut cutting across the board against the grain and cut miters a dado blade allows you to cut dados and rabbits with a few jigs you can cut raised panels make tenons cut cove molding make box joints cut tapers and any number of other things dont neglect an assortment of push sticks and other safety devises with any of these tools bandsaw if you are going to be cutting curves or need to resaw lumber i recommend a band saw its not a tool to get right away however think about why you need it before getting one if you want to resaw wood you need to consider how big a band saw you need if you are going to be cutting curves do you need a band saw or is a scroll saw a better choice band saws are wonderful flexible woodworking tools emifem properly set up get a saw with guides that are easily adjusted and that allows you to tension the blade properly you will need to adjust the guides and the blade tension each time you change the blade so look at how it is done before buying anything sliding miter saw if you have a table saw you probably dont need a miter saw unless you are going to be making lots of compound miter cuts on the other hand if you dont have a table saw a miter saw and a bandsaw can do most of what you could do with a table saw either way a miter saw repeats much of what the table saw does so you probably dont need both having said that i use mine all the time its quick and easy and leaves my table saw free for other operations a sliding miter saw allows you to cut a larger board than a standard miter saw i think the extra capacity is worth the price all miter saws will allow you to cut single angles a compound miter saw allows you to cut two angles at the same time if you think you will need to cut compound miters then go with the compound miter saw a routeris an extremely flexible woodworking tool use it for cutting dadoes and rabbits for making molding putting profiles on edges a plunge router allows you to make cuts to the exact same depth a router table makes many operations easier drilldriver a battery operated drill is sufficient for most operations the heavier the battery the more powerful it is get one that has enough power for your needs you may find you need a drill press but that can come later sanders belt sanders make quick work of wood removal i often clamp mine in a vise and use it to shape wood pad sanders excel at finish sanding sanding block for the final hand sanding gets rid of the fine swirls left by the pad sander this is a short list of woodworking tools but it gives you an idea where to start if youre anything like me every woodworking tool you see is a temptation but its possible to get by without a huge shop the important thing is to get started
