its a beautiful look if you want to do the white kitchen its a great material to do that the brown antique is very pretty as well it will give you quite a different look though honestly you cant go wrong with either but it really depends on what look you are going for good luckwednesday may 18 2011unknown said hi steph i was so happy to find your layout on bianco romano we are considering using it with white cabinets white appliances and white sink we have a neutralcolor terrazo tile floor we are working with home depot for our kitchen design the designer there has matched up some very pretty glass subway tiles in white neutral and a greyish green to use for the backsplash it looks lovely with the very small sample of bianco romano we have but when we see the larger samples with the brownishburgundy dots im concerned it may not look right with the backsplash and may be too spottylooking i wanted something neutral with a greenish cast what do you think  will this work thanks for your helpmonday july 04 2011stephthe granite gurus said it sounds like that splash would work with your bianco romano is there anyway that you can select your exact slab i think this will really help you decide on the tile id also suggest just a plain white subway tile good luckthursday july 07 2011anonymous said good evening i am doing a french style kitchen with bianco romano white subway tiles white cabinets stainless steel appliances and dark taupe floors my question is what color grout should i use i was thinking taupegrey to tie it all together thoughts thank youthursday november 03 2011stephthe granite gurus said anonymous your kitchen sounds pretty i would definitely go with white grout with your white subway tile let it blend with the tile you dont want the grout lines to be a focal point and it doesnt need to be what ties everything together good luckwednesday november 09 2011anonymous said thank you for your advice on the grout i pick out my slab next week which will put my mind at ease the sample in the studio had very warm tones which seemed to clash with the white subway tile and grout i will take your advice thursday november 10 2011lauri eich said love bianco romano granite and am putting it in my new kitchen soon we are getting dark brown cabinets with bianco romano and was thinking white tile backsplash so the granite would remain the focal point my husband has fallen in love with natural hickoy floors and we are getting a stone fireplace in the living area open concept do you feel the hickory will look ok with all of this thanksthursday july 04
