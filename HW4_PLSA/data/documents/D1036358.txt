exactly like a climb outside what the pros are sayingafter winning the ironman hawaii world championships again i shifted my focus on putting myself back on the australian olympic team for london i was told this was an impossible dream and that finding the power and speed to match guys half my age was simply a midlife crisis i grabbed myself a tdf bike and used set programs to look at developing the strength speed and power that would be necessary to race at the speeds necessary to win olympic medals again at 38 years of age i was told impossible cant be done and no chance thanks to the tdf bike and the specific indoor sets we could control we achieved the impossible and qualified for the olympic shadow squad it is without question the best way to get the specific results you are looking for chris mc cormack2010 ironman world champion the tour de france trainer is incredible because it has a very realistic road feel in over 20 years of riding trainers ive never ridden anything even close my favorite features are the google maps application and that the bike actually rotates up or down based on uphills and downhills the tour de france trainer is by far the closest stationary bicycle to the road ive ever experienced five stars lewis elliot former us national team cyclist product details shipping weight 146 pounds asin b005aeq66sitem model number pfex01312average customer

purchase i ordered the bike in september it showed up in mid october i assembled it without difficulty however the rear wheel was stuck i called customer service and they surmised that it was a bad hub i was told they would send out a replacement part and that someone from service would contact me within a few days no one contacted me the part arrived i called and left messages and no one returned my calls this is for a brand new 2000 bike i decided to return the bike no problem i was told in october i should be contacted within 3 business days to arrange pick up no one called i called after 10 days to arrange a pick upand was told they only come to my area a few times a month so it would be a few weeks fine i took the day off of work to be there to sign the paperwork and no one showed up i called the company truck broke down call back to reschedule i called back to reschedule now its december 5 i took another day off of work midway through the appointed pick up time december

clothes rack and am out 2k read more comment 23 people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no report abuse yanks marching30 out of 5 stars pro form td f 2012 bike good i fit a nightmarejuly 12 2012verified purchase19 january 2013 update the bike itself is still solid but if you are considering this bike primarily for all the great i fit integrations like the rest of us be sure to check out i fit on facebooktwitter before you buy to see all the customer complaints launched since they upgraded their platformhard to believe that theyre even still in business at this point  original 2012 review ordered the new pro form td f 2012 gen2 bike on saturday morning from the beach via i phone app an additional 399 for next day amazon prime shipping and the bike delivered to my home via ups at 10am monday morning signature was required at delivery due to price large box very sturdy packaging weighed in at approximately 160lbs so my ups guy was happy to see i took the morning off of work to help him carry it up to my third floor walkup assembly was fairly straight forward attach standstabilizers handlebars console bottle holder seat post seat pedalsdone all hardware and corresponding hex key was included in box additional tools needed were a phillips head screwdriver and a ratchet for a bolt on the seat two people would greatly ease assembly but i was able to do alone im 62 200lbs and once assembled the bike felt well put together and very sturdy no initial concerns with overall build powered bike on i fit console went through booting process and bike through inclinedecline test all checked out easily connected to my home wifi network checked for firmware update and already had current version next i logged into my new i fit account no problem there was able to download my next scheduled workout and was off and riding im still tweaking seat post seat and handlebar positions trying to find a sweet spot but during the ride again bike felt very sturdy the gear paddle shifters are a very nice feature but can be nonresponsive at times get stuck at times and i do have some worry that they could failbreak easily inclinedecline worked without issue and was a pretty neat feature the console itself with tiny 35 i fit screen stodgy buttons and the loaded software is underwhelming the concept with the maps integration is a great idea but for the overall price and the current state of tablettouch technology it feels like a swing and a miss what will be key here is the i fit live feature to project street view rides onto your i pad or internet enabled tv im currently using satechi sch121 cup holder mount to mount my i pad in the cup holder dont love the fit and miss my water bottle but it will do for now when testing with the i pad 1 safari constantly crashed during the ride i pad 3 works much better with minimal crashing when it works this is a pretty cool feature ive biked stages in the champs central park chicago lakefront monterrey coast and the national mall in dc already another issue experienced is that every now and then my i fit login credentials are dropped from memory thanks to a tip from david in my comments ive lowered the time and frustration to fix this but still a pain when youre ready to ride and have to wait the bike really needs a firmware update in sum like others have saidwhen it works as planned it is a great concept a great bike thus far but for a 2nd generation and the money spent there should not be some of these issuesbugs online support and knowledgebase resources are pretty thin too updated 3

report abuse c d coddperez30 out of 5 stars needs better pedals september 5 2012verified purchase ive had this product for a couple months and though i love how it inclines and declines easily ive had clicking in the left pedal i noticed today that the pedal appeared bent my son tried to remove the pedal in order to re screw it into the pedal arm well when he was finally able to remove the pedal we found the problem the pedal arm is stripped we cant replace the pedal so i cant use the bike now i have to obtain a new pedal arm if that can be done and pedal before i can use the bike again not very good for an expensive stationary bike my son was able to switch the pedal and put it back on the bicycle is working but it makes a lot of noise there is now a problem with the gear shift and incline buttons on the handle bar you have to use the buttons on the console for bicycle to shiftincline its a pain read more comment 10 people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no report
