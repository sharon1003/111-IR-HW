chapter 13worlds entangled 1600–1750chapter summary from 1600 to 1750 trade continued to expand tying all areas of the globe together demands for silver sugar spices silks cotton and porcelain drove trade so that products from each major global region could be found virtually everywhere else silver allowed economies to become commercialized and began to strengthen the hand of european trade europeans began moving and forcibly moving africans into new places while europeans expanded their colonial reach competition led to bitter conflicts challenging the preeminence of afroeurasia’s great centralized empires economic and political effects of global commerce rising economic integration had farreaching impact on rulers and common people alike shortages or surpluses of key goods greatly affected prices across the globe which could affect fortunes tremendous fortunes in turn provided funding for larger armies and ambitious ventures but they could also divide merchant interests from those of their monarchs some states—england france holland japan—became stronger because of trade others—the mughals the ming the ottomans the safavids—became increasingly destabilized by it extracting wealth mercantilismgold and silver production in spanish and portuguese colonies stimulated other european powers to seek colonies of their own few found gold but many found wealth in the new world’s fertile lands by building plantations or harvesting furs sugar production soared transforming european diets and economies viewing the world through mercantilist eyes europeans saw colonies strictly as sources of revenue and competed with one another for control charter companies represented the close ties between merchants and governments as economics and politics became closely intertwined new colonies in the americas england france and holland all began to establish colonies in the americas competing with each other and with spain and portugal holland’s trading coloniesthe dutch began as transporters of cargo for other nations but eventually sought their own route to asia via a “northwest passage” around the north end of the americas exploration by henry hudson found no passage but some settlers established themselves on the river and began engaging in trade with the iroquois others profited by pirating spanish shipping still others formed the dutch west india company and established a presence in the caribbean although they failed as colonists in the americas the dutch did succeed as businessmen and transporters carrying goods and slaves and underwriting ventures their greatest successes however were to be found in asia france’s furtrading empirefrench interest in a northern passage took them up the st lawrence river to the great lakes there french missionaries attempted to convert amerindians to catholicism while settlers interacted with them as fur traders beaver skins harvested by amerindians and bought by the french cemented links between both groups and led to close ties rarely found between europeans and amerindians marital relations between french and amerindians gave rise to mixedblood métis who brokered between the two peoples england’s landed empiredislike of the english cemented close alliances between the french and the amerindians english settlers’ hunger for land displaced amerindians from the land leading to friction and conflict in new england puritan demands for land contributed to vicious wars in the 1630s and 1670s virginia witnessed much of the same especially after tobacco began to produce great profits and the desire for land increased with time europeans and africans began to outnumber amerindians pushing the latter to the west as more and more land was taken over unlike the french who intermingled and intermarried with the amerindians the english maintained their distance pushing indians to the west arriving europeans and africans began to transform the atlantic seaboard the plantation complex in the caribbeanin the caribbean the sugar plantations based on slave labor dominated especially on english and frenchcontrolled islands given sugar’s enormous profits competition between the powers was fierce the industry was lethal however requiring continuous supplies of new slaves to replace those who died plantation managers worked malnourished slaves to death in the diseaseridden tropics under horrifying living conditions slaves worked six days a week from dawn to dusk at backbreaking work which accelerated during harvest time life expectancy on a plantation was three years some slaves resisted occasionally through violence to the point that governments had to negotiate or ban the slave trade slaves who could simply ran away to communities in the mountains or interior where they established alternate societies to slavery even more resisted in quieter ways the english founded extremely lucrative sugar plantations on jamaica while the french seized half of saintdomingue okay presentday haiti with time europeans became increasingly entrenched in the americas and wealthier for the experience the slave trade and africa more africans arrived in the americas than europeans greatly enriching the latter while decimating the african communities of the former capturing and shipping slaveseuropeans got their slaves from ancient african slaving networks some slaves went north or east to muslim or hindu shippers who took them to indian ocean ports as the demand for slaves in the americas rose however more and more slaves were sent to africa’s west coast some 125 million slaves survived to arrive in atlantic ports between 1525 and 1867 many millions more perished on the journey or even before departing africa in the interior most slaves were captured by africans operating secret societies such as ekpe ekpe ensured that slave capturers fulfilled their quotas and built networks extending deep into inner africa once captured slaves were transported to slave ports along the african coast here many died of hunger and disease waiting until a ship’s hold was filled once the ships set sail diseases often spread leading to mortality rates of 20 percent or so slavery’s gender imbalanceabout twothirds of african slaves were men disrupting sex ratios in africa and the americas with reproduction among their slaves limited slave owners in the americas had to consistently depend on new arrivals to replenish the labor pool in africa great plantations of female slaves became the norm in some cases such as dahomey in west africa women asserted power because of their large numbers africa’s new slavesupplying politiesthe slave trade profoundly altered african development regional leaders fought over control of the slave trade since african slavers and merchants who captured and sold slaves to european buyers profited greatly for everyone else in africa the slave trade left terrible destruction the kongo kingdom in kongo local leaders clashed over control of the slaves trade civil war raged for more than one hundred years and losing warriors were sold into the slave trade some leaders in the kongo—such as queen nzinga—tried to limit the number of slaves sold from the region and took up arms to fight against european slave traders oyo asante and other groups slaving peoples enriched by the trade bought more weapons and established their own plantations served by enslaved women the asante used locally acquired gold to purchase weapons and dominate their neighbors before establishing a centralized state comprising almost all of presentday ghana borders emerged roads led out of the capital in all directions to bring slaves back for trading based on the savanna the oyo people and their king employed large cavalry forces to engage the forest peoples and capture whole villages these ethnicities profited and gained goods from the outside while other africans suffered terribly port cities harbored most wealth while the interior became impoverished and stripped of its rural population asia in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in much of asia european influence remained marginal nevertheless parts of asia as in india and southeast asia gradually fell to european colonial control the dutch in southeast asiadetermined to monopolize the spice trade of southeast asia the dutch east india company voc adopted aggressive policies against rivals the voc raised huge sums of capital—ten times that of the english east india company—and quickly began to deepen dutch influence in southeast asia under jan pieterszoon coen the dutch razed jakarta and built a fortress as a base later coen’s forces liquidated the population of the banda nutmeg islands before moving on to other targets by 1670 dutch ruthlessness had given them control of the melakan spice trade the dutch also engaged in less violent enterprises transporting asian goods in legitimate transactions to provide bullion needed in the china trade the new dutch presence greatly diminished the role of the old cosmopolitan trading hubs of the southeast asian trading network now europeancontrolled outposts became dominant transformations in islamthe islamic empires better resisted european trade incursions but did encounter internal disruptions the safavid empire suffering from weak leadership safavid unity began to disintegrate opening cracks in the regime the empire eventually collapsed under the double blow of external invasion occurring when afghan warriors sacked the capital in 1722 and internal rebellion racked the government in 1773 the ottoman empire ottoman successes began to reverse after suleiman when the habsburgs stopped ottoman expansion in the west reversals and population pressures prompted many to note that the empire was in decline poor leadership also hurt global economic integration and increased supplies of money made it easier for europeans to illegally purchase ottoman goods with silver and avoid paying taxes increasingly impoverished sultans borrowing from merchants found it more difficult to restrict their illegal activities abundant silver but fewer goods meant inflation which greatly pressured artisans and peasants who rebelled in protest economics became hopelessly out of balance parts of the empire also began to show greater independence from ottoman rule the mamluks in ottoman egypt when the sultan sent mamluk military and administrative officers to help raise falling egyptian tax revenues the officers simply allied themselves with egyptian merchants and elites and kept most fiscal revenues for themselves the ottomans’ koprulu reforms the “koprulu reforms” did allow the ottomans to briefly raise revenues and regain lost territorial possessions enthusiasm for greatness even inspired renewed attacks on christendom and plans to take vienna the attack however failed and the ottomans were forced to relinquish major european holdings the mughal empire while the ottomans floundered the mughals flourished reaching their peak in the 1600s prior to the mughals india had no single political authority akbar’s successors continued to expand into the reaches of india and by 1689 even controlled most of the south indian ocean trade proved lucrative but was not pursued overseas mughal leaders remained content to tax landowners and let trade come to india—a simple decision given the eagerness of the europeans trade increased wealth led to the use of silver as the medium of exchange and provided new crops for indian peasants in the south marathas resistance consumed military resources and court finances eager to keep the south sultan aurangzeb raised peasant taxes while also favoring muslims over hindus thus creating hostility economically mughal india thrived new lands came into agrarian production while india’s textile industry spread among the peasantry aurangzeb’s death in 1707 was followed by a war of succession and outrageous taxation practices local autonomy in mughal india commercial prosperity however also strengthened the hand of local and regional magnates seeking ways to strengthen their own hands and assert independence thus transforming centralized mughal rule into a loose association of provincial states local leaders encouraged ties with europeans and created indian trading companies to manage trade with the outsiders others ran vast networks that combined trade and tax farming as the empire weakened local leaders began to challenge mughal authority private commercial enterprise mughal leaders did not pay much attention to commerce but local authorities did some began to organize trading companies to sell goods to foreign merchants and established longdistance trade networks successful merchants gained political influence in the mughal government from ming to qing in chinagrowing wealth among china’s local leaders weakened central control of the ming as it did the mughals in india still officially banned overseas trade produced no revenues for the court but greatly enriched local merchants and smugglers continued local autonomy together with economic and social changes brought down the ming empire in 1644 administrative problems weak emperors plagued the ming being an emperor was difficult filled with responsibilities that could be monotonous and tiring for example the wanli emperor realized that he had little control over the bureaucracy and refused to play his role as an administrator he began to ignore his officials and duties and left important work unattended economic problems as leadership declined china’s economy experienced rapid growth and concomitant problems attracted by rising opportunities japanese pirates plagued the coastal regions silver imports stimulated growth and increased revenues but hurt the peasantry who either suffered from inflation when silver was abundant or struggled to pay taxes when silver was scarce in protest peasants rebelled the collapse of ming authority natural disasters led to crop failure and famine in northern china peasant outrage increased government cutbacks alienated scholarly and military elites whose discontent combined with that of the peasants to create explosive rebellions one headed by li zicheng conquered beijing in 1644 to defeat the rebels ming generals invited their northern “barbarian” enemies—the manchus—into china the manchus naturally accepted the invitation but then refused to leave when their task of destroying li zicheng’s army was complete the qing dynasty asserts control noting their minority status the manchus moved cautiously to consolidate power they were flexible and implemented policies that the chinese could accept ever adapting these leaders of the qing dynasty promoted confucian ideals and patriarchal values reformulated traditional social hierarchies and promoted the family outer regions with their own religious majorities received their own administrative systems based on local mores to deepen qing authority marriages between manchu and han were forbidden han officials had to wear manchu dress and han chinese were required to shave their foreheads and grow a long queue in traditional manchu fashion at the risk of losing their heads if they did not comply as arbiters of public morality the qing placed bans on certain activities but then struggled to enforce them expansion and trade under the qing economic activity thrived in the eighteenth century expansion and tributary relations greatly extended chinese influence merchants fostered trade in southeast asia or monopolized european trade by purchasing special government licenses quick to keep europeans in their place the qing established the “canton system” for europeans exclusively which prevented them from freely coming into china and kept them under close scrutiny the most important trade however took place within china largely because of its sheer size and partly because it remained unencumbered by government taxes or oversight in short china remained vastly wealthy and stable despite the dynastic transition of the seventeenth century tokugawa japandespite rising external trading pressures the japanese managed to unify under the tokugawa shogunate they also managed to control the foreigners and largely avoid western incursion unification of japan under the leadership of autonomous warlords or daimyo japanese warrior elites called samurai struggled for influence and land dividing the country’s political authority into smaller domains despite the fragmentation however a centralized system emerged hideyoshi started the process but it fell to the house of tokugawa to complete the task defeating rival daimyo tokugawa ieyasu assumed the title of shogun japan’s top military position before constructing a new centralized system he established clear rules of succession moved the capital to edo presentday tokyo converted samurai from warriors to administrators and secured adequate resources for his regime an end of warfare coupled with prosperity tripled the population between 1550 and 1700 foreign affairs and foreigners by 1600 europeans had established considerable presence in japan as traders and missionaries but their constant bickering and rivalry disrupted stability to stem foreign influence japanese authorities banned christianity leading to violent suppressions and the expulsion of foreign missionaries traders who generally favored tokugawa rivals in the west were also restricted only the dutch could trade with japan and only under strict supervision at one port thus while asian trade continued european traders were tightly controlled russian interest in the north compelled the tokugawa to take over ezo hokkaido as a barrier to russian encroachments thus providing the japanese with more territory and a stronger sense of identity transformations in europe between 1600 and 1750 religion commerce and warfare all helped transform europe and changed the nature of political authority expansion and dynastic change in russiarussia expanded significantly during this era gaining territory from the pacific ocean to the baltic sea muscovy becomes the russian empire expanding rapidly through territorial expansion and commercial ties muscovy eventually became the world’s largest state and began calling itself russia for ivan iii expansion meant security from steppe nomad incursions adding marital ties to the last byzantine emperor also allowed him to claim russian succession to the orthodox church absolutist government and serfdom the romanovs perfected a centralized system in which the tsar maintained absolute power over virtually everything and everyone including the nobles legally bound to the land and their lords as serfs peasants lived in primitive communal arrangements imperial expansion and migration sufficient stability allowed peter the great and successors like catherine the great to continue expansion eastward and westward toward the baltic sea peter built a new capital—st petersburg—and signed a treaty with the chinese migrations of slavs into siberia—serfs migrated there to escape repressive lords and heretics and political prisoners were banished there—soon shifted the balance between russians and indigenous peoples limited transportation made the going difficult thus siberia gained a reputation as both a land of opportunity and a land of imprisonment economic and political fluctuations in western europein europe commercialization led to increasing wealth but also heightened the risk of destabilization political and religious rivalries did not help the thirty years’ war religious conflicts continued to rage in europe in germany protestant and catholic competition climaxed in the thirty years’ war which killed millions by 1648 the thirty years’ war transformed warfare in europe centralizing states meant bigger armies professional soldiers and increased use of firearms all aimed at winning conclusive campaigns against the enemy these and the added burden of supply lines required huge military budgets as war became more expensive only powerful and wealthy monarchs could win western european economies supporting armies required efficient taxation commerce could help but added a new layer of competition to religious rivalries between european states inflation and rising costs of defense hurt spain venice lost trade to new networks and thus declined the dutch prospered through shipping and financing of trade setting an example to others england and france benefited from monarchical policy that protected local business and eliminated foreign competitors in the countryside breakthroughs in agriculture increased food production that could support larger urban populations agriculture became commercialized when landowners began producing for the market thus leading to increased efficiency and productivity dynastic monarchies france and england france employed an absolutist system society was represented by the estatesgeneral an advisory body comprised of delegates speaking for the clergy the nobles and everyone else the king however closed it he ruled by divine right and his grace and blessing were bestowed on those whom he favored patronage networks ultimately led to the king himself giving him great power possessing all influence the king dominated other groups who had no formal voice or representation of their interests in practice however the french kings struggled to maintain their alleged “absolute” power england developed differently because kings and queens needed parliament for money fierce religious struggles led the court to clamp down with a virtual military dictatorship but james ii’s intrigue to make england catholic led to a revolution that deposed the king opinions remained divided over which system was better thomas hobbes supported absolutism while john locke advocated natural rights and liberty as represented by parliament eventually consensus was that the king’s power had to be balanced by parliament thus england’s nobility and merchants continued to enjoy representation in parliament mercantilist wars another form of conflict arising in europe was mercantilist war for control of colonies and sea lanes restrictions against foreign goods opened the door to smuggling which became commonplace disputed borders led to bloody conflicts in the caribbean and north america the seven year’s war provides an example of conflicts between european states fought mostly outside of europe—in north america the caribbean and india—it marked the rise of england as the dominant colonial power
