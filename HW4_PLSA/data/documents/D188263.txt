hobbits first appeared in the novel the hobbit whose titular hobbit is the protagonist bilbo baggins the novel the lord of the rings includes as major characters the hobbits frodo baggins samwise gamgee peregrin took and meriadoc brandybuck as well as several other minor hobbit characters hobbits are also briefly mentioned in the silmarillion and unfinished tales according to the author in the prologue to the lord of the rings hobbits are relatives 2 of the race of men elsewhere tolkien describes hobbits as a variety 3 or separate branch 4 of humans within the story hobbits and other races seem aware of the similarities hence the colloquial terms big people and little people used in bree  however within the story hobbits considered themselves a separate people 5 at the time of the events in the lord of the rings hobbits lived in the shire and in bree in the north west of middleearth though by the end some had moved out to the tower hills and to gondor and rohan contents  hide 1

his death that the word predated tolkiens usage though with a different meaning 6 tolkiens concept of hobbits in turn seems to have been inspired by edward wyke smith s 1927 childrens book the marvellous land of snergs and by sinclair lewis s 1922 novel babbitt the snergs were in tolkiens words a race of people only slightly taller than the average table but broad in the shoulders and have the strength of ten men 7 tolkien wrote to w h auden that the marvellous land of snergs was probably an unconscious sourcebook for the hobbits 6 and he told an interviewer that the word hobbit might have been associated with sinclair lewiss babbitt like hobbits george babbitt enjoys the comforts of his home however tolkien claims that he started the hobbit suddenly without premeditation in the midst of grading a set of student essay exams writing on a blank piece of paper in a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit 8 while the hobbit introduced this comfortable race to the world it is only in writing the lord of the rings that tolkien developed details of their history and wider society he set out a fictional etymology for the name in an appendix to the lord of the rings to the effect that it was ultimately derived from holbytla plural holbytlan  meaning holebuilder and corresponding to old english in the language of the rohirrim the hobbits were called kûddûkan in plural  which had rendered the autonym kuduk 9appearance  editin the prologue to the lord of the rings tolkien writes that hobbits are between two and four feet 061–122 m tall the average height being three feet six inches 107 cm they dress in bright colours favouring yellow and green nowadays according to tolkiens fiction they are usually shy but are nevertheless capable of great courage and amazing feats under the proper circumstances they are adept at throwing stones for the most part they cannot grow beards but a few of the race of stoor can their feet are covered with curly hair usually brown as is the hair on their heads with leathery soles so hobbits hardly ever wear shoes the races average life expectancy is 100 years two hobbits bilbo baggins and the old took are described as living to the age of 130 or beyond though bilbos long lifespan owes much to his possession of the one ring hobbits are considered to come of age on their 33rd birthday so a 50yearold hobbit would be regarded as entering middleage hobbits are not quite as stocky as the similarlysized dwarves but still tend to be stout with slightly pointed ears tolkien does not describe hobbits ears in the hobbit or the lord of the rings but in a 1938 letter to his american publisher he described them as having ears only slightly pointed and elvish 10 tolkien describes hobbits thus i picture a fairly human figure not a kind of fairy rabbit as some of my british reviewers seem to fancy fattish in the stomach shortish in the leg a round jovial face ears only slightly pointed and elvish hair short and curling brown the feet from the ankles down covered with brown hairy fur clothing green velvet breeches red or yellow waistcoat brown or green jacket gold or brass buttons a dark green hood and cloak belonging to a dwarf 11hobbits and derivative halflings are often depicted with unusually large feet for their size perhaps to visually emphasize their unusualness this is especially prominent in the influential illustrations by the brothers hildebrandt and the large prosthetic feet used in the lord of the rings film trilogy tolkien does not specifically mention foot size as a generic hobbit trait but does make it the distinctive trait of the proudfoot hobbit family lifestyle  editin his writings tolkien depicted hobbits as fond of an unadventurous bucolic and simple life of farming eating and socializing although capable of defending their homes courageously if the need arises they would enjoy six meals a day if they could get them 12 they were often described as enjoying simple food though this seems to be of an oxfordshire style such as cake bread meat potatoes ale and tea they claim to have invented the art of smoking pipeweed and according to the hobbit and the return of the king it can be found all over middleearth the hobbits of the shire developed the custom of giving away gifts on their birthdays instead of receiving them although this custom was not universally followed among other hobbit cultures or communities 13 they use the term mathom for old and useless objects which are invariably given as presents many times over or are stored in a museum  mathomhouse  some hobbits live in hobbitholes or smials traditional underground homes found in hillsides downs and banks it has been suggested that the soil or ground of the shire consists of loess and that this facilitates the construction of hobbit holes 14 loess is a yellow soil it causes the colour of the brandywine river and it was used in making the bricks at stock the main shire brickyard 15 like all hobbit architecture the hobbit holes are notable for their round doors and windows the hobbits had a distinct calendar every year started on a saturday and ended on a friday with each of the twelve months consisting of thirty days some special days did not belong to any month— yule 1 and 2 new years eve  new years day and three lithedays in midsummer every fourth year there was an extra litheday most likely as an adaptation similar to a leap year to ensure that the calendar remained in synch with the seasons 16fictional history  editin their earliest folk tales hobbits appear to have inhabited the valley of anduin between mirkwood and the misty mountains according to the lord of the rings they have lost the genealogical details of how they are related to the big people at this time there were three breeds of hobbits with different physical characteristics and temperaments harfoots stoors and fallohides while situated in the valley of the anduin river the hobbits lived close by the éothéod the ancestors of the rohirrim and this led to some contact between the two as a result many old words and names in hobbitish are derivatives of words in rohirric the harfoots the most numerous were almost identical to the hobbits as they are described in the hobbit they lived on the lowest slopes of the misty mountains and lived in holes or smials dug into the hillsides the stoors the second most numerous were shorter and stockier and had an affinity for water boats and swimming they lived on the marshy gladden fields where the gladden river met the anduin there is a similarity here to the hobbits of buckland and the marish in the shire it is possible that those hobbits were the descendants of stoors it was from these hobbits that déagol and sméagolgollum were descended the fallohides the least numerous were an adventurous people that preferred to live in the woods under the misty mountains and were said to be taller and fairer all of these traits were much rarer in later days and it has been implied that wealthy eccentric families that tended to lead other hobbits politically like the tooks and brandybucks were of fallohide descent bilbo and three of the four principal hobbit characters in the lord of the rings frodo pippin and merry had fallohide blood through their common ancestor the old took about the year t a 1050 they undertook the arduous task of crossing the misty mountains reasons for this trek are unknown but they possibly had to do with sauron s growing power in nearby greenwood which later became known as mirkwood as a result of the shadow that fell upon it during saurons search of the forest for the one ring the hobbits took different routes in their journey westward but as they began to settle together in breeland dunland and the angle formed by the rivers mitheithel and bruinen the divisions between the hobbitkinds began to blur in the year 1601 of the third age year 1 in the shire reckoning two fallohide brothers named marcho and blanco gained permission from the king of arnor at fornost to cross the river brandywine and settle on the other side many hobbits followed them and most of the territory they had settled in the third age was abandoned only bree and a few surrounding villages lasted to the end of the third age the new land that they founded on the west bank of the brandywine was called the shire originally the hobbits of the shire swore nominal allegiance to the last kings of arnor being required only to acknowledge their lordship speed their messengers and keep the bridges and roads in repair during the final fight against angmar at the battle of fornost the hobbits maintain that they sent a company of archers to help but this is nowhere else recorded after the battle the kingdom of arnor was destroyed and in the absence of the king the hobbits elected a thain of the shire from among their own chieftains the first thain of the shire was bucca of the marish who founded the oldbuck family however the oldbuck family later crossed the brandywine river to create the separate land of buckland and the family name changed to the familiar brandybuck their patriarch then became master of buckland with the departure of the oldbucksbrandybucks a new family was selected to have its chieftains be thain the took family pippin took was son of the thain and would later become thain himself the thain was in charge of shire moot and muster and the hobbitryinarms but as the hobbits of the shire generally led entirely peaceful uneventful lives the office of thain came to be seen as something of a formality the hobbits numbers dwindled and their stature became progressively smaller after the fourth age however they are sometimes spoken of in the present tense and the prologue concerning hobbits in the lord of the rings implies they had survived into tolkiens day 17divisions  editharfoots the harfoots were the most numerous group of hobbits and also the first to enter eriador they were the smallest in stature of all hobbits and the most typical of the race they had closer relations with dwarves than did other hobbits tolkien coined the term as analogous to hairfoot 18fallohides the fallohides were the least numerous group and the second group to enter eriador they were generally fairhaired and tall for hobbits they were often found leading other clans of hobbits as they were more adventurous than the other subraces they preferred the forests and had links with the elves tolkien created the name from the archaic meanings of english words fallow and hide meaning pale skin 18stoors the stoors were the second most numerous group of hobbits and the last to enter eriador they were broader than other hobbits they dwelt mostly beside rivers and were the only hobbits to use boats and swim males were able to grow beards tolkien says they were less shy of men  sméagol and déagol were stoors 19 tolkien used an archaic english word stor or stoor strong 18moral significance  editkocher notes that tolkiens literary techniques require us to increasingly view hobbits as like us especially when placed under moral pressure to survive a war that threatens to devastate their land 20 frodo becomes in some ways the symbolic representation of the conscience of hobbits a point made explicitly in the story  leaf by niggle  which tolkien wrote at the same time as the first nine chapters of the lord of the rings 21 niggle is a painter struggling against the summons of death to complete his one great canvas a picture of a tree with a background of forest and distant mountains he dies with the work incomplete undone by his imperfectly generous heart it made him uncomfortable more often than it made him do anything after discipline in purgatory however niggle finds himself in the very landscape depicted by his painting which he is now able to finish with the assistance of a neighbour who obstructed him during life the picture complete niggle is free to journey to the distant mountains which represent the highest stage of his spiritual development 22 thus upon recovery from the wound inflicted by the witchking of angmar on weathertop gandalf speculates that the hobbit frodo may become like a glass filled with a clear light for eyes to see that can 23 similarly as frodo nears mount doom he casts aside weapons and refuses to fight others with physical force for him struggles for the right must hereafter be waged only on the moral plane 23in popular culture  editmain articles halfling and halfling dungeons  dragonsoriginally halfling comes from the scots word hauflin meaning an awkward rustic teenager who is neither man nor boy and so half of both another word for halfling is hobbledehoy or hobby this usage of the word predates both the hobbit and dungeons  dragons 24 dungeons  dragons began using the name halfling as an alternative to hobbit 25 for legal reasons 26music  editcomic horror rock band rosemarys billygoat recorded a song and video called hobbit feet about a man who takes a girl home from a bar only to discover she has horrifying hobbit feet according to lead singer mike odd the band received over 100
