anonymous answered dec 24 2016the moment of inertia can also referred as moment of area although the elemental area is positive the product of inertia can be positive negative or zero because the value of the coordinates x and y can be positive negative or zero similarly the first moment of inertia about the the axis of symmetry when one or both of the coordinate x and y are the axis of symmetry of the area a the integral the product of inertia ixy about the coordinate axes is zero for example a symmetrical area although the area a is not symmetrical about axis y however since the area is symmetrical about axis x for any elemental area at a distance y above the axis x there is always an elemental area below the axis x at the same mirror location of distance y below the axis x therefore the product of inertia of a paired elemental area will cancel out each other and becomes zero and the integral will reduces to zero also since the product of inertia of a symmetrical area about one or two axes of symmetry must be zero the product of inertia of an area with respect to axes can be used to test the dissymmetry or imbalance of the area about x and y axes because when the product of inertia about x and y axes is not equal to zero the area is not symmetrical about both x and y axes but when the product of inertia about x and y axes is equal to zero the area may be not symmetrical about x and y axes for more visit  zero moment of inertia23k views · view upvoterspromoted by uc berkeley extension prepare for grad school  health careers organic chemistry courses at uc berkeley extension classroom courses available enroll today learn more at extensionberkeleyedu related questions more answers below whats the difference between moment of inertia first moment of area and second moment of area how is the moment of inertia 12mr2 is the first moment of inertia a rotational strength of a body about an axis is the second moment of inertia the resistance to a rotational m what is the theory of the moment of inertia in what cases does the moment of inertia change as the body rotates ask new question raj goswami studied at visvesvaraya national institute of technology answered mar 8 2017 · author has 67 answers and 301k answer views first moment of inertia is not always zero but only if you take the moment about the centorid the reason why it is zero lies in the defination of centroid first moment of area is area multiplid by the distance  and the defination of the centroid is that point which is at the centre or around which all the area is equally distributed now if the area will be equally distributed then in that case the area in r distance from centroid will be equal to the area in r distance so every positive value and negative value of area and distance multiplication cancel each other out and first moment of area become zerotake first moment around any other point it will not be zero31k views · view upvoters mathew cherian bachelors in electronics engineering answered oct 11 2016 · author has 39k answers and 15m answer views moment over momentum is called moment of inertia that is dadt is m which is the derivative of a constant “a” which reduces to zero a is the acceleration which is dvdt and v is the velocity you can visualize it like this for an inclined plane the moment of inertia is ha where h is the height and a is the effective distance traveled now suppose if a point moves from center to the extremities and back to the starting point the effective distance is 2pi and the height is zero now the moment of inertia is 02pi  0 i think it is also called the coefficient of resistance16k views · view upvoters subhajit konar works at biomedical engineering answered oct 2 2015there is first moment of area  it is defined as the area a times distance x from the axis isum of ax  now if we consider the centroidal axis then for some part of area it become positive and for rest it become negative when we take the sum it become zero so about centroidal axis moment of area  0 moment of inertia become zero for 0 distance from axis21k views · view upvoters · answer requested by asha palanipromoted by boomerang for gmail ever wonder how your emails are coming across boomerang respondable uses ai to give you realtime advice on how to improve your emails learn more at boomeranggmailcom quora user studied at manipal institute of technology answered mar 28 2015please check first this answer by mark barton it does sort out some confusion whats the difference between moment of inertia first moment of area and second moment of area if you are talking about moment of inertia to answer your question now moment of inertia will be zero when either radial distance from the axis r or infinitesimal mass dm is zero hope this helps you out41k views · answer requested by asha palani biswajit parida mechanics electricity and magnetism answered jan 15 2016first momwnt of inertia becomes zero only around the center of mass12k views · view upvoters
