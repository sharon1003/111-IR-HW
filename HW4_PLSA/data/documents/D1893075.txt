lidoderm  lidocaine  patch endo pharmaceuticals incr x only descriptionlidoderm lidocaine patch 5 is comprised of an adhesive material containing 5 lidocaine which is applied to a nonwoven polyester felt backing and covered with a polyethylene terephthalate pet film release liner the release liner is removed prior to application to the skin the size of the patch is 10 cm × 14 cm lidocaine is chemically designated as acetamide 2 diethylaminon 26dimethylphenyl has an octanol water partition ratio of 43 at p h 74 and has the following structure each adhesive patch contains 700 mg of lidocaine 50 mg per gram adhesive in an aqueous base it also contains the following inactive ingredients dihydroxyaluminum aminoacetate disodium edetate gelatin glycerin kaolin methylparaben polyacrylic acid polyvinyl alcohol propylene glycol propylparaben sodium carboxymethylcellulose sodium polyacrylate dsorbitol tartaric acid and urea clinical pharmacologypharmacodynamics lidocaine is an amidetype local anesthetic agent and is suggested to stabilize neuronal membranes by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses the penetration of lidocaine into intact skin after application of lidoderm is sufficient to produce an analgesic effect but less than the amount necessary to produce a complete sensory block pharmacokinetics absorption the amount of lidocaine systemically absorbed from lidoderm is directly related to both the duration of application and the surface area over which it is applied in a pharmacokinetic study three lidoderm patches were applied over an area of 420 cm 2 of intact skin on the back of normal volunteers for 12 hours blood samples were withdrawn for determination of lidocaine concentration during the application and for 12 hours after removal of patches the results are summarized in table 1 table 1 absorption of lidocaine from lidoderm normal volunteers n 15 12hour wearing timelidoderm patch

the dose applied is expected to be absorbed at least 95 665 mg of lidocaine will remain in a used patch mean peak blood concentration of lidocaine is about 013 µgm l about 110 of the therapeutic concentration required to treat cardiac arrhythmias repeated application of three patches simultaneously for 12 hours recommended maximum daily dose once per day for three days indicated that the lidocaine concentration does not increase with daily use the mean plasma pharmacokinetic profile for the 15 healthy volunteers is shown in figure 1 figure 1 mean lidocaine blood concentrations after three consecutive daily applications of three lidoderm patches simultaneously for 12 hours per day in healthy volunteers n  15 distribution when lidocaine is administered intravenously to healthy volunteers the volume of distribution is 07 to 27 lkg mean 15 ± 06 sd n15 at concentrations produced by application of lidoderm lidocaine is approximately 70 bound to plasma proteins primarily alpha1acid glycoprotein at much higher plasma concentrations 1 to 4 µgm l of free base the plasma protein binding of lidocaine is concentration dependent lidocaine crosses the placental and blood brain barriers presumably by passive diffusion metabolism it is not known if lidocaine is metabolized in the skin lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the liver to a number of metabolites including monoethylglycinexylidide megx and glycinexylidide gx both of which have pharmacologic activity similar to but less potent than that of lidocaine a minor metabolite 2 6xylidine has unknown pharmacologic activity but is carcinogenic in rats the blood concentration of this metabolite is negligible following application of lidoderm lidocaine patch 5 following intravenous administration megx and gx concentrations in serum range from 11 to 36 and from 5 to 11 of lidocaine concentrations respectively excretion lidocaine and its metabolites are excreted by the kidneys less than 10 of lidocaine is excreted unchanged the halflife of lidocaine elimination from the plasma following iv administration is 81 to 149 minutes mean 107 ± 22 sd n  15 the systemic clearance is 033 to 090 lmin mean 064 ± 018 sd n  15 clinical studiessingledose treatment with lidoderm was compared to treatment with vehicle patch without lidocaine and to no treatment observation only in a doubleblind crossover clinical trial with 35 postherpetic neuralgia patients pain intensity and pain relief scores were evaluated periodically for 12 hours lidoderm performed statistically better than vehicle patch in terms of pain intensity from 4 to 12 hours multipledose twoweek treatment with lidoderm was compared to vehicle patch without lidocaine in a doubleblind crossover clinical trial of withdrawaltype design conducted in 32 patients who were considered as responders to the openlabel use of lidoderm prior to the study the constant type of pain was evaluated but not the pain induced by sensory stimuli dysesthesia statistically significant differences favoring lidoderm were observed in terms of time to exit from the trial 14 versus 38 days at pvalue 0001 daily average pain relief and patients preference of treatment about half of the patients also took oral medication commonly used in the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia the extent of use of concomitant medication was similar in the two treatment groups indication and usagelidoderm is indicated for relief of pain associated with postherpetic neuralgia it should be applied only to intact skin contraindicationslidoderm is contraindicated in patients with a known history of sensitivity to local anesthetics of the amide type or to any other component of the product warningsaccidental exposure in children even a used lidoderm patch contains a large amount of lidocaine at least 665 mg the potential exists for a small child or a pet to suffer serious adverse effects from chewing or ingesting a new or used lidoderm patch although the risk with this formulation has not been evaluated it is important for patients to store and dispose of lidoderm out of the reach of children pets and others see handling and disposalexcessive dosing excessive dosing by applying lidoderm to larger areas or for longer than the recommended wearing time could result in increased absorption of lidocaine and high blood concentrations leading to serious adverse effects see adverse reactions systemic reactions  lidocaine toxicity could be expected at lidocaine blood concentrations above 5 µgm l the blood concentration of lidocaine is determined by the rate of systemic absorption and elimination longer duration of application application of more than the recommended number of patches smaller patients or impaired elimination may all contribute to increasing the blood concentration of lidocaine with recommended dosing of lidoderm the average peak blood concentration is about 013 µgm l but concentrations higher than 025 µgm l have been observed in some individuals precautionsgeneral hepatic disease patients with severe hepatic disease are at greater risk of developing toxic blood concentrations of lidocaine because of their inability to metabolize lidocaine normally allergic reactions patients allergic to paraaminobenzoic acid derivatives procaine tetracaine benzocaine etc have not shown cross sensitivity to lidocaine however lidoderm should be used with caution in patients with a history of drug sensitivities especially if the etiologic agent is uncertain nonintact skin application to broken or inflamed skin although not tested may result in higher blood concentrations of lidocaine from increased absorption lidoderm is only recommended for use on intact skin eye exposure the contact of lidoderm with eyes although not studied should be avoided based on the findings of severe eye irritation with the use of similar products in animals if eye contact occurs immediately wash out the eye with water or saline and protect the eye until sensation returns drug interactions antiarrhythmic drugs lidoderm should be used with caution in patients receiving class i antiarrhythmic drugs such as tocainide and mexiletine since the toxic effects are additive and potentially synergistic local anesthetics when lidoderm is used concomitantly with other products containing local anesthetic agents the amount absorbed from all formulations must be considered carcinogenesis mutagenesis impairment of fertility carcinogenesis a minor metabolite 2 6xylidine has been found to be carcinogenic in rats the blood concentration of this metabolite is negligible following application of lidoderm mutagenesis lidocaine hcl is not mutagenic in salmonellamammalian microsome test nor clastogenic in chromosome aberration assay with human lymphocytes and mouse micronucleus test impairment of fertility the effect of lidoderm on fertility has not been studied pregnancy teratogenic effects pregnancy category blidoderm lidocaine patch 5 has not been studied in pregnancy reproduction studies with lidocaine have been performed in rats at doses up to 30 mgkg subcutaneously and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to lidocaine there are however no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response lidoderm should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed labor and delivery lidoderm has not been studied in labor and delivery lidocaine is not contraindicated in labor and delivery should lidoderm be used concomitantly with other products containing lidocaine total doses contributed by all formulations must be considered nursing mothers lidoderm has not been studied in nursing mothers lidocaine is excreted in human milk and the milk plasma ratio of lidocaine is 04 caution should be exercised when lidoderm is administered to a nursing woman pediatric use safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established adverse reactionsapplication site reactions during or immediately after treatment with lidoderm lidocaine patch 5 the skin at the site of application may develop blisters bruising burning sensation depigmentation dermatitis discoloration edema erythema exfoliation irritation papules petechia pruritus vesicles or may be the locus of abnormal sensation these reactions are generally mild and transient resolving spontaneously within a few minutes to hours allergic reactions allergic and anaphylactoid reactions associated with lidocaine although rare can occur they are characterized by angioedema bronchospasm dermatitis dyspnea hypersensitivity laryngospasm pruritus shock and urticaria if they occur they should be managed by conventional means the detection of sensitivity by skin testing is of doubtful value other adverse events due to the nature and limitation of spontaneous reports in postmarketing surveillance causality has not been established for additional reported adverse events including asthenia confusion disorientation dizziness headache hyperesthesia hypoesthesia lightheadedness metallic taste nausea nervousness pain exacerbated paresthesia somnolence taste alteration vomiting visual disturbances such as blurred vision flushing tinnitus and tremor systemic doserelated reactions systemic adverse reactions following appropriate use of lidoderm are unlikely due to the small dose absorbed see clinical pharmacology pharmacokinetics  systemic adverse effects of lidocaine are similar in nature to those observed with other amide local anesthetic agents including cns excitation andor depression lightheadedness nervousness apprehension euphoria confusion dizziness drowsiness tinnitus blurred or double vision vomiting sensations of heat cold or numbness twitching tremors convulsions unconsciousness respiratory depression and arrest excitatory cns reactions may be brief or not occur at all in which case the first manifestation may be drowsiness merging into unconsciousness cardiovascular manifestations may include bradycardia hypotension and cardiovascular collapse leading to arrest overdosagelidocaine overdose from cutaneous absorption is rare but could occur if there is any suspicion of lidocaine overdose see adverse reactions systemic reactions  drug blood concentration should be checked the management of overdose includes close monitoring supportive care and symptomatic treatment dialysis is of negligible value in the treatment of acute overdose with lidocaine in the absence of massive topical overdose or oral ingestion evaluation of symptoms of toxicity should include consideration of other etiologies for the clinical effects or overdosage from other sources of lidocaine or other local anesthetics the oral ld 50 of lidocaine hcl is 459 346773 mgkg as the salt in nonfasted female rats and 214 159324 mgkg as the salt in fasted female rats which are equivalent to roughly 4000 mg and 2000 mg respectively in a 60 to 70 kg man based on the equivalent surface area dosage conversion factors between species dosage and administrationapply lidoderm to intact skin to cover the most painful area apply up to three patches only once for up to 12 hours within a 24hour period patches may be cut into smaller sizes with scissors prior to removal of the release liner see handling and disposal clothing may be worn over the area of application smaller areas of treatment are recommended in a debilitated patient or a patient with impaired elimination if irritation or a burning sensation occurs during application remove the patch es and do not reapply until the irritation subsides when lidoderm is used concomitantly with other products containing local anesthetic agents the amount absorbed from all formulations must be considered handling and disposalhands should be washed after the handling of lidoderm and eye contact with lidoderm should be avoided do not store patch outside the sealed envelope apply immediately after removal from the protective envelope fold used patches so that the adhesive side sticks to itself and safely discard used patches or pieces of cut patches where children and pets cannot get to them lidoderm should be kept out of the reach of children how suppliedlidoderm lidocaine patch 5 is available as the following
