why is this drilling process called rotary drilling because the drill bit turns around in a circle what common household item is used in this video to demonstrate rotary drillingan apple corer what have oceanographers determined from analyzing sea floor coresclimate change and past extinctions which is the best definition of glacial snow linethe line dividing zones of accumulation and melting of ice at the surface of a glacier under what conditions will the front of a glacier remain stationary glacial fronts remain stationary when melting and snow accumulation are equal which way does ice flow in a glacier retreating uphilldownslope how would a snow line on a glacier move as a glacial front is advancing how would you expect the front of a glacier to move if it undergoes a period of net accumulation followed by net wastage and finally a period of net accumulation why does water frozen in the cracks of a rock help to break down the rock what is salt weathering what do freezethaw and salt weathering have in common how can pieces of rock in contact with a stream bed move complete this analogy bouncing is to sand as suspension is to complete this analogy sliding is to gravel as dissolution is to which of the following are part of the bed load what are the three types of loads carried by streams what is suspended load sediments derived from the remains of the hard parts of onceliving organisms are called  sediments two common types of chemical compounds found in biogenous sediments are  and  the two major types of microscopic planktonic organisms that produce siliceous oozes are  and how does siliceous ooze accumulate on the seafloor if silicabased residues are dissolved slowly at all depths siliceous ooze is particularly abundant on the seafloor at  and at  calcitesecreting organisms such as  and  live in the oceans sunlit surface waters and form the basis of most marine food webs the depth at which calcite dissolves rapidly in the ocean is called the  the p h scale is a measure of the  ion concentration of a solution as a whole the p h of surface waters of the ocean is slightly  carbon dioxide co2 combines with water h2o to form  what is the approximate depth of the calcite compensation depth ccd in the ocean forams which are composed of calcium carbonate  above the ccd and  below the ccdÂ· diatomaceous earth which is composed of silica  above the ccd and  below the ccd why does calcareous material dissolve below the ccd what is calcareous ooze what is the calcite compensation depth or ccd what three steps are required for calcareous ooze to exist below the ccd what would happen if the depth of the ccd were above the top of the midocean ridge of the following environments where would you expect to find large amounts of lithogenous sediment a sediment sample dominated by microscopic lithogenous sediment grains would be classified as a  which of the following conditions allows for calcareous ooze to be found beneath the ccd select only one answer which of the following organisms are responsible for the creation of siliceous ooze the most abundant mineral in lithogenous sediments is  sediments with all grains of about the same size are classified as ice raftingturbidite texture refers to the size and shape of sediment particles coastal sand dunes are usually well sorted due to winds sediment that begins as rocks on continents or islands is called sediments that are poorly sorted were most likely deposited by a sediments derived from preexisting rocks on land are called of the following sediments which one s isare considered hydrogenous oozes are uncommon on continental margins because  coccolithophoressiliceous ooze the organisms that contribute to biogenous sediment are chiefly algae and protozoans radiolarian tests are dissolved beneath the carbonate compensation depth calcareous ooze is found in cooler waters at depth around the world which of the following contains calcium carbonate ca co3 calcium carbonate is most likely to dissolve in water with which characteristic what do manganese nodules metal sulfides and evaporites all have in common salt beds of the u s gulf coast are  halite organisms that live on the ocean floor may be responsible for keeping manganese nodules from being buried in the sediment all the following are examples of hydrogenous sediment except  the most likely place to find abundant manganese nodules is on the tektites tektites are glassy rock fragments created during impact events sediments with an extraterrestrial origin are called the particles found in some sediment that suggests that an extraterrestrial impact event are based on this data choose the statement that offers the best explanation for the differences in sediment abundance between the atlantic and pacific basins you take a sediment sample from the ocean floor at a depth of 5500 m the area has low biological productivity and the ccd is at 4500 m depth your sample will probably consist of  sediments found on continental margins are called pelagic clays contain lots of material that settles to the seafloor through the water column and are all the following are true concerning neritic sediment deposits except marine sediments provide valuable clues about which of the following earth history events ocean sediments provide all the following mineral resources exceptmetal
