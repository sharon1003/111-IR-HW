w cameron many of his friends discussed the possibility of having a plaque erected in the city of edinburgh as a tribute to the godfather of bizarre magic it was hoped that the plaque would be erected on the building or in the entranceway of what had formerly been the edinburgh wax museum where charles had been its curator during the daytime during the evening he became dracula as he played the lead role in his own bizarre and spooky magic show this show took place in a specially designed auditorium at the wax museum and it soon became famous as castle dracula in 2002 it was decided that the actual site of the plaque should be in the entrance passage to the building formerly the wax museum which lies within a courtyard off the royal mile in edinburgh old town this entranceway at 142 new assembly close is perfect as it can easily be seen by all who pass by on this very busy road permission to erect a plaque had to meet with city council approval and many months were spent in contacting all possible departments and officers within the council finally permissions were received on the understanding that the proposed plaque was to be of an equal size and quality and placed directly below one already on the site that existing plaque only gave the history of the building prior to the wax museum taking over that meant the plaque to charles had to be a hefty piece of cast bronze measuring 15 3⁄ 4  wide × 12 deep × 12 thick equally hefty was the price of this whole project as far more was involved in it than just the making and security fixing the plaque on site many of charles friends and associates in magic throughout the world sent in donations to fund this project also many of his local lay people friends were only to happy to contribute too alex wallace partner of the late charles and to whom donations were sent was taken aback by the sheer kindness and generosity of people sending in money this turned to amazement and emotional times when people who never met or had any contact with charles generously came forward with donations this shows just how much cameron is regarded within the brotherhood of bizarre magic and mentalism before its final fixing a recess was made at the rear of the plaque so that a document containing all the names of the sponsors could be sealed behind it a time capsule with a difference in part of a dedication tony andruzzi
