ppl here complaining about his private jets are the same ones who dont believe in global warming or give a damn about the planet or the environment whatsoever its almost touching to see so many skeptics concerned about other ppls polution you can complain and call him a hypocrite as much as you want whether he flies private or not this guy does by far much more about the planet than any of you ppl here or than anyone i know143104click to rate2 of 3 replies see all replies mike in az gilbert 2 years ago youre correct i dont believe in global warmingclimate changedisruptionchaos or whatever you people are calling it today however i do what i can to protect the environment but when i see these people like dicaprio gore etc with their millions of dollars continuing to do exactly what they want to and continuing to live their lifestyle even though that is exactly what they say is supposedly destroying mother earth it seems very hypocritical to me then they want to put into effect extreme policies that will force me to change my lifestyle or force me to stop doing what i enjoy to ¿supposedly¿ save the planet for these people it¿s the same old ¿do as i say not as i do¿

should do everything by the book and be the 1st to give the example however sometimes there are valid reasons that may justify that imo its not hypocrisy if they have busy schedules and meetings often in short notice when the alternatives are more tiring or and take longer and you have no choice but flying private or for privacy reasons that i think its comprehensible in leos case i think its unfair to assume hes a hypocrite just because hes richfamous or he because hes defending something ppl dont believe in ppl do what they can its not a crime or a sin or hypocrisy if they cant do everything and he does so much he doesnt just preach about it he donates millions every year for conservation about 12 last year alone and he helps raising many millions more he doesnt fly private only he also flies commercial and he takes the train too compared to his efforts and the results that he gets the private jets are irrelevant8547click to rate jen uk sussex united kingdom 2 years agoi
