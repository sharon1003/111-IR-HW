plymouth county massachusetts new england she was born 1590 in england and died aft 10061659 in of duxbury plymouth county massachusetts new england notes for myles standish captain mayflower passenger myles standish was born probably in lancashire england probably in the vicinity of chorley and duxbury there have been several attempts generally unsuccessful to place his origins on the isle of man but the weight of the historical evidence leans towards the more probable lancashire origin myles standish is alleged to have joined queen elizabeths army and attained the rank of lieutenant but the documentation for this claim was lost in the 1920s without having been published or transcribed so may be suspect in any case standish was certainly a part of queen elizabeths army and was stantioned for a time in holland where he eventually met and became well acquainted with john robinson and the pilgrims who were living in leiden standish was hired by the pilgrims to be their military captain to establish and coordinate the colonys defense against both foreign french spanish dutch and domestic native american threats standish led or participated in all the early exploratory missions sent out to explore cape cod and was heavily involved in selecting the site where the pilgrims would settle he was one of the few who did not get sick at all the first winter and is recorded as having greatly helped and cared for those who were sick he organized the deployment of the colonys cannons and the construction of the fort at plymouth he led both trading expeditions and military expeditions to the various indian groups in the region he led the party that went in pursuit of the alleged killers of squanto who was later discovered to be safe he led the revenge attacks on the indians in the massachusetts bay after they were caught in a conspiracy planning to attack and destroy the plymouth and wessagussett colonies several indians are killed or executed for which standish received some criticism even from his friends for being too heavyhanded standish was heavily involved in numerous aspects of plymouth colony from defense to keeping the law he was on the receiving end of john billingtons verbal wrath in 1621 billington refused to follow the captains orders and was called a silly boy in a letter that was sent out during the oldhamlyford scandal of 1624 and was noted for his short stature and for his quick temper he was sent to arrest thomas morton in 1628 for which he received the nickname captain shrimp from morton william hubbard reported standishs temper was like a chimney soon fired despite the heavy criticism by his enemies standish was well respected within the plymouth colony and held a number of positions of authority he made several trips to england to bring trading goods back and to negotiate with the merchant adventurers who had financially sponsored the jointstock company that funded the pilgrims voyage in the mid1630s standish moved his family and helped found the town of duxbury which may have been named after his ancestral home standish is an heir to a fairly sizeable estate in lancashire but his lands are lost during the english civil war and neither he nor his son alexander were ever able to legally regain control of the estate myles standishs first wife rose came with him on the mayflower and died the first winter his second wife barbara arrived on the ship anne in 1623 and they were apparently married before the year was out nothing is known about either of his wives there is absolutely no indication they were his cousins as has sometimes been claimed standish lived out his later years in duxbury dying in 1656 after his suffering of much dolorous pain apparently from kidney stones the

mayflower descendant 32 624 notes for rose unknown mrs mayflower passenger myles standish who is born about 1585 or 1586 one would infer from his will that his greatgrandfather had been unjustly deprived of his share of inheritance that his boyhood had on that account been one of privation or at least of trial which otherwise need not have been he is said to have been an officer in the english army in holland whereby he gained considerable experience in the art of war before he joined the pilgrims at leyden he is their military leader against the indians and led them in their early exploring expeditions a young man of about thirtyfive when they came from england he is soon one of the chief councilors of the infant settlement during the first winter of want sickness and death he

brewster ther reverend elder  myles standish ther captain  military commander unto who my selfe and many others were much beholden in our low  sickly condition here governor bradford dropped the third

war three times is made commander of the plymouth forces in 1653 he is deputy governor he is employed at home in all manner of business for the colonists and is sent to england as their agent we

character with strong will and firm purpose probably with quick temper under control myles standish is just the kind of leader needed to guide the colony through the difficulties which surrounded them

and heir ralph standish de standish son of alexander this is the first time this combined name standish de standish appears in any documents 14851538 in 1520 ralph standish received land in duxbury called alddall the land in wrightington in 1524 from thomas duxbury he received duxbury hall the children of this ralph are alexander roger george and a daughter anna that married 15181519 john

standish of standish son of alexander edward is minor at the death of ralph his children are alexander his eldest son and heir edward third son and thomas fourth son the name of the second son does not appear alexander son and heir of edward married 1575 elisabeth harwarden daughter of adam harwarden of wolston which came into the standish family through this marriage about this time a new mansion house is built called the hall of standish alexander had ralph thomas roger and john ralph standish of standish had a son edward who 1632 married elisabeth howard myles standish believed that a wrong had been done his greatgrandfather several of the documents refer to certain legal transactions which list that land in several villages in standish and duxbury longree and worthington among others are involved the papers are not sufficiently explicit to enable us with our ignorance of the localities to understand exactly what was done nor to judge of the justice of the transactions during his life time lawrence de standish father of alexander de standish had enfeoffed to james de standish of erley and others the right and title to the manor of standish and advowson of the church etc these are released to roger de standish parson of standish and other trustees in 145456 this james standishs connection with the family does not appear from the records in 151213 ralph standish conveys the manor of standish with advowson of the church to matthew standish and james standish of erley and others in trust 4th march 1513 is a recovery roll an old english method of transferring land or confirming title to land fines and recoveries are abolished in 1833 alexander osbaldston james smithley and others against james standish of erley roger braidshaigh of haigh and matthew standish of lands in blackrad chorley and duxbury with the third part of two mills in duxbury and chorley 24th march 1518 is the confirmation deed to the recoverer james standish of erley and constance his wife and the heirs of that marriage remainder over to george standish son of ralph standish esq and his heirs male lawfully begotten remainder to roger another son of ralph and his heir remainder to alexander son and heir apparent of ralph standish and his heirs male remainder to ralph standish and his heirs general forever in 1525 alexander standish son and heir bf rauff is made executor of the last will and testament of james standish of erley the will is not given according to the confirmation deed ralph standish of standish 1485 to 1538 had only three sons george roger and alexander as the remainder over is deeded last to the eldest son it is probably that it is deeded first to the youngest son which would list that george is the youngest then george is the second brother one of the two brothers roger or george must have been the ancestor of myles and it seems from the wording of myles will that the second or younger brother of alexander standish is he to whom myles refers as not receiving the estate which rightfully belonged to him according to the confirmation deed the property should have passed to george standish and his heirs male if james standish of erley had no children here then is a possibility of such a miscarriage of the inheritance as myles standish refers to alexander the eldest brother son and heir of ralph is executor of james standishs will there would seem to have been an opportunity for alexander to take illegal advantage of his younger brother in settling the estate of james standish of erley he may have disregarded the confirmation deed there is no information as to what became of the property it did not descend to myles the line to which myles standish belonged branched from the main line at his greatgrandfather ralph standish of standish mentioned above would belong to the same generation as myles of plymouth one born about 1576 or a little later the other in 1585 the greatgrandfather of myles would belong then to the same generation as alexander who died 1542 he had two brothers roger and george ralph the father of these three is the first standish who received the name standish of standish 14851538 ralph standish of standish 14851538 is greatgreatgrandfather of myles standish alexander roger george 1513 george probably greatgrandfather of myles standish edward about 156080 grandfather of myles

chiefly church records more about rose unknown mrs mayflower passenger burial bet 1620  1621 coles hill remains now placed in a sarcophagus there plymouth plymouth county massachusetts new england immigration 12261620 pilgrim ship the mayflower notes for barbara allen standish myles soldier born in lancashire england about 1584  died in duxbury massachusetts 3 october 1656 it is supposed that he was a scion of the standish family of duxbury hall in lancashire and that his name was erased from the family register to deprive him of a share in the estate the name is ancient and froissart describing the meeting between richard ii and wat tyler relates how the latter was killed by a squyer of the kynges called john standysshe who was knighted for this act later another sir john standish partieipated in the battle of agincourt while still a youth myles entered the english forces on the continent and after serving in the netherlands he joined in leyden the colony that sailed in the  mayflower from plymouth england on 16 september 1620 the vessel anchored in the bay of cape cod on 21 november 1620 and on 25 november sixteen armed men every one his musket sword and corslet under the command of captaine myles standish were sent ashore for a second exploration they marched in single file through what is now provincetown where they saw several indians followed their tracks about ten miles and spent the night in the woods three subsequent expeditions were sent out on the third after landing in the vicinity of eastham they went toward wellfleet found an indian buryingplace and indian houses and encamped before nightfall at nanskeket on the following day they were surprised by the indians upon whom standish fired but the skirmish was slight on 29 september 1621 after the founding of plymouth a party of ten men witch three savages as guides under command of standish who had been appointed military captain in february 1621 explored massachusetts bay they anchored off what is now thomsons island which standish explored and named trevore this party also explored the broad plain known as massachusetts fields the gatheringplace of the tribes which comprised a part of what is now quincy in 1622 thomas weston sent out emigrants to plant a new colony which they did at wessagussett now weymouth they incurred the enmity of the massachusetts indians who formed a plot to destroy them but fearing that such an act would be avenged by the plymouth colony they decided to exterminate the english before this plan was executed massasoit revealed the plot and the plymouth colonists determined to send an expedition to wessagussett fearful of exciting the suspicion of the indians by an armed body myles standish selected eight men to march to the relief of that colony which he found in a wretched condition by massasoits advice standish with a few of his men enticed the chiefs pecksuot and wituwamat with a halfbrother of the latter into a room and closing the door killed the indians after a desperate fight this was the first indian blood that was shed by the pilgrims a general battle ensued in the open field from which the indians fled and in which no lives were lost this victory of standish spread terror among the savages and as a warning to further depredations the head of wituwamat was exposed to view at plymouth when the news of standishs exploit reached the pious john robinson the pastor at leyden he wrote to the governor of plymouth on 19 december 1623 to consider the disposition of their captain who was of a warm temper and concluded with the remark o how happy a thing had it been that you had converted some before you had killed any in the summer of 1625 the colony was in great trouble owing to its unhappy relation with its partners the socalled merchant adventurers in london and captain standish was sent to england to seek relief bearing a letter from governor william bradford to the council of new england urging their intervention in behalf of the colony  but bradford says that on account of the plague in london standish could accomplish nothing in 1628 standish captured thomas morton of merry mount q v in retaliation for an attack of daulnay see charnise aulnay de who drove away in 1635 a party of plymouth men at penobscot plymouth despatched a vessel and a force under standish to compel the surrender of the french at that post but this expedition failed in addition to being the military leader of every exploit of importance in the colony his counsel was often required in civil affairs and for many years he was also treasurer of the colony he was not a member of the plymouth communion but was a dissenter from the dissenters he was resolute stern bold and of incorruptible integrity an ironnerved puritan who could hew down forests and live on crumbs a portrait painted on an old panel was found in 1877 in a pictureshop in school street boston bearing the date 1625 and  aetatis sua 38 on which the name of m standish was discovered after removing the frame it now hangs in pilgrim hall plymouth and is reproduced in the accompanying vignette his first wife rose died on 29 january 1621 and his second courtship has been made the subject of a romance by henry w longfellow in which there are several anachronisms although his envoy john alden won his chosen bride priscilla mullens they remained close friends until death and later generations of the standish and alden families intermarried a tradition says that his second wife barbara was the younger sister of rose standish in his will dated 7 march 1655 he left his property to his wife barbara and to his four sons alexander myles josias and charles his goods and chattels worth £350 were exhibited in the court that was held in plymouth on 4 may 1657 one of his swords is preserved in the cabinet of the massachusetts historical society and another is in pilgrim hall plymouth several other relics are in the possession of the pilgrim society which also owns a piece of ingenious embroidery made by his daughter lora in 1632 several of the mayflower families settled in duxbury massachusetts standish established himself on captains hill so named from his military office and it is probable that he was buried there it is supposed that his house stood unchanged until about 1666 and that it was then enlarged by his son alexander who it is thought was a trader and possibly townclerk of duxbury the present house was built by this son a granite monument is now being erected to his memory on captains hill duxbury as seen in the accompanying illustration the shaft is one hundred feet in height and upon it stands a statue of standish looking eastward his right hand holding the charter of the colony is extended toward plymouth while his left rests upon his sheathed sword children of myles standish and barbara allen are
