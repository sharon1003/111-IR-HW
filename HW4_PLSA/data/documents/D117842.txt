words theretheirthey’re wherewerewe’re youryou’re etc for people to screw up and confuse – not to mention homographs words that are spelled the same but have different meanings homonyms words that sound alike but have different meanings homophones a type of homonym that also sound alike and have different meanings but have different spellings and heteronyms a type of homograph that are also spelled the same and have different meanings but sound different even though i’m fluent in english i still get tripped up in the rules of grammar syntax and punctuation long after high school at age 33 yo i also have no flippin’ idea how to not end all of my sentences with prepositions i even think preposition s is a preposition lol i also received for years conflicting information on whether or not it is acceptable to begin sentences with the word “and” growing up my teachers always said that was a literary sin then the more i started reading books written by professional and established authors the more i saw plenty of sentences beginning with the word and so i have no idea who is right because i’ve heard of what’s called literary license or something like that meaning basically that an established professional author can do whatever they want when writing and can get away with starting sentences with and or ending sentences with prepositions if anyone can answer the “and” question for me i’d appreciate it log in to reply duende brooks says february 16 2015 at 1038 pm i remember being taught this at 16 in school however the english will never be understood and it is
