from wikipedia the free encyclopedianavigation search interactive diagram of protein structure using pcna as an example  pdb 1axc protein secondary structure is the three dimensional form of local segments of proteins the two most common secondary structural elements are alpha helices and beta sheets though beta turns and omega loops occur as well secondary structure elements typically spontaneously form as an intermediate before the protein folds into its three dimensional tertiary structure secondary structure is formally defined by the pattern of hydrogen bonds between the amino hydrogen and carboxyl oxygen atoms in the peptide backbone secondary structure may alternatively be defined based on the regular pattern of backbone dihedral angles in a particular region of the ramachandran plot regardless of whether it has the correct hydrogen bonds the concept of secondary structure was first introduced by kaj ulrik linderstrømlang at stanford in 1952 1 2 other types of

protein secondary structure cartoon above atoms below with nitrogen in blue oxygen in red  pdb 1axc the most common secondary structures are alpha helices and beta sheets other helices such as the 3 10helix and π helix are calculated to have energetically favorable hydrogenbonding patterns but are rarely observed in natural proteins except at the ends of α helices due to unfavorable backbone packing in the center of the helix other extended structures such as the polyproline helix and alpha sheet are rare in native state proteins but are often hypothesized as important protein folding intermediates tight turns and loose flexible loops link the more regular secondary structure elements the random coil is not a true secondary structure but is the class of conformations that indicate an absence of regular secondary structure amino acids vary in their ability to form the various secondary structure elements proline and glycine are sometimes known as helix breakers because they disrupt the regularity of the α helical backbone conformation however both have unusual conformational abilities and are commonly found in turns amino acids that prefer to adopt helical conformations in proteins include methionine alanine leucine glutamate and lysine malek in aminoacid 1letter codes by contrast the large aromatic residues  tryptophan tyrosine and phenylalanine and c β branched amino acids  isoleucine valine and threonine prefer to adopt βstrand conformations however these preferences are not strong enough to produce a reliable method of predicting secondary structure from sequence alone low frequency collective vibrations are thought to be sensitive to local rigidity within proteins revealing beta structures to be generically more rigid than alpha or disordered proteins 4 5 neutron scattering measurements have directly connected the spectral feature at 1 thz to collective motions of the secondary structure of betabarrel protein gfp 6hydrogen bonding patterns in secondary structures may be significantly distorted which makes automatic determination of secondary structure difficult there are several methods for formally defining protein secondary structure eg dssp 7 define 8 stride 9 screw fit 10 sst 11  dssp classification  editmain article dssp proteindistribution obtained from nonredundant pdbselect dataset march 2006 secondary structure assigned by dssp 8 conformational states reduced to 3 states hhgi eeb cstc visible are mixtures of gaussian distributions resulting also from the reduction of dssp states the dictionary of protein secondary structure in short dssp is commonly used to describe the protein secondary structure with single letter codes the secondary structure is assigned based on hydrogen bonding patterns as those initially proposed by pauling et al in 1951 before any protein structure had ever been experimentally determined there are eight types of secondary structure that dssp defines g  3turn helix  3 10helix  min length 3 residues h  4turn helix  α helix  minimum length 4 residues i  5turn helix  π helix  minimum length 5 residues t  hydrogen bonded turn 3 4 or 5 turne  extended strand in parallel andor antiparallel βsheet conformation min length 2 residues b  residue in isolated βbridge single pair βsheet hydrogen bond formations  bend the only nonhydrogenbond based assignment c  coil residues which are not in any of the above conformations coil is often codified as   space c coil or – dash the helices g h and i and sheet conformations are all required to have a reasonable length this means that 2 adjacent residues in the primary structure must form the same hydrogen bonding pattern if the helix or sheet hydrogen bonding pattern is too short they are designated as t or b respectively other protein secondary structure assignment categories exist sharp turns omega loops etc  but they are less frequently used secondary structure is defined by hydrogen bonding so the exact definition of a hydrogen bond is critical the standard hydrogenbond definition for secondary structure is that of dssp which is a purely electrostatic model it assigns charges of ± q 1 ≈ 042 e to the carbonyl carbon and oxygen respectively and charges of ± q 2 ≈ 020 e to the amide hydrogen and nitrogen respectively the electrostatic energy is according to dssp a hydrogenbond exists if and only if e is less than −05 kcalmol −21 k jmol although the dssp formula is a relatively crude approximation of the physical hydrogenbond energy it is generally accepted as a tool for defining secondary structure experimental determination  editthe rough secondarystructure content of a biopolymer eg this protein is 40 αhelix and 20 βsheet  can be estimated spectroscopically 12 for proteins a common method is farultraviolet faruv 170–250 nm circular dichroism a pronounced double minimum at 208 and 222 nm indicate αhelical structure whereas a single minimum at 204 nm or 217 nm reflects randomcoil or βsheet structure respectively a less common method is infrared spectroscopy which detects differences in the bond oscillations of amide groups due to hydrogenbonding finally secondarystructure contents may be estimated accurately using the chemical shifts of an initially unassigned nmr spectrum 13prediction  editsee also protein structure prediction and list of protein secondary structure prediction programs predicting protein tertiary structure from only its amino acid sequence is a very challenging problem see protein structure prediction  but using the simpler secondary structure definitions is more tractable early methods of secondarystructure prediction were restricted to predicting the three predominate states helix sheet or random coil these methods were based on the helix or sheetforming propensities of individual amino acids sometimes coupled with rules for estimating the free energy of forming secondary structure elements such methods were typically 60 accurate in predicting which of the three states helixsheetcoil a residue adopts the first widely used technique to predict protein secondary structure from the amino acid sequence was the chou–fasman method 14 15 16a significant increase in accuracy to nearly 80 was made by exploiting multiple sequence alignment knowing the full distribution of amino acids that occur at a position and in its vicinity typically 7 residues on either side throughout evolution provides a much better picture of the structural tendencies near that position 17 18 for illustration a given protein might have a glycine at a given position which by itself might suggest a random coil there however multiple sequence alignment might reveal that helixfavoring amino acids occur at that position and nearby positions in 95 of homologous proteins spanning nearly a billion years of evolution moreover by examining the average hydrophobicity at that and nearby positions the same alignment might also suggest a pattern of residue solvent accessibility consistent with an αhelix taken together these factors would suggest that the glycine of the original protein adopts αhelical structure rather than random coil several types of methods are used to combine all the available data to form a 3state prediction including neural networks hidden markov models and support vector machines modern prediction methods also provide a confidence score for their predictions at every position secondarystructure prediction methods was continuously benchmarked eg eva benchmark based on these tests the most accurate methods were psipred sam 19 porter 20 prof 21 and sable 22 the chief area for improvement appears to be the prediction of βstrands residues confidently predicted as βstrand are likely to be so but the methods are apt to overlook some βstrand segments false negatives there is likely an upper limit of 90 prediction accuracy overall due to the idiosyncrasies of the standard method  dssp for assigning secondarystructure classes helixstrandcoil to pdb structures against which the predictions are benchmarked 23accurate secondarystructure prediction is a key element in the prediction of tertiary structure in all but the simplest  homology modeling cases for example a confidently predicted pattern of six secondary structure elements βαββαβ is the signature of a ferredoxin fold 24applications  editboth protein and nucleic acid secondary structures can be used to aid in multiple sequence alignment these alignments can be made more accurate by the inclusion of secondary structure information in addition to simple sequence information this is sometimes less useful in rna because base pairing is much more highly conserved than sequence distant relationships between proteins whose primary structures are unalignable can sometimes be found by secondary structure 17it has been shown that αhelices are more stable robust to mutations and designable than βstrands in natural proteins 25 thus designing functional allα proteins is likely to be easier that designing proteins with both helices and strands this has been recently confirmed experimentally 26see also  editmolecular and cellular
