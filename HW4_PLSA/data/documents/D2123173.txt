walking on ancient ruins – balcony house mesa verde tour the highlight of our visit to mesa verde national park was taking a tour of the balcony house since we arrived at the visitor center late morning most of the tours had already filled up that day so we decided to get tickets for the next morning before the tour the ranger gave us a safety briefing he mentioned that if anyone feels they can’t do it due to physical limitations or are afraid of heights stay at the top balcony house is considered a medium size cliff dwelling there are 40 rooms and only 10 sites in the park have more than that the 32foot entrance ladder makes it the most adventurous cliff dwelling tour and even though we’re scared of heights it wasn’t bad at all as we descended down the cliff we stopped at a few points where he talked more about the ancestral puebloans and background of the cliff dwellings did you know that we still don’t have a definitive answer on why they lived this way at a certain point in history they built these beautiful dwellings then one day they just up and left my favorite feature was the exit they built a tunnel into one of their entrances as a natural defense after all it’s easier to kill any intruders onebyone quick rant see this lady with the neck brace yes it sucks that she’s injured but it’s still completely disrespectful to touch and lean on these ancient ruins at one point we saw her with her knee on it too part of me didn’t want to disrupt the ranger giving the talk no one else in the group noticed her except us and lets be honest part of me was too shy to say anything thinking back on it though i’m disappointed at myself that i didn’t tell her to get off when the ranger clearly tells you before the tour if you can’t hike climb and stand for an hour you shouldn’t come all photos were shot with a 5d mark iii  35mm lens it was truly amazing to stand in and see the balcony house we’ll have to make our way back to mesa verde national park again to tour the other dwellings toopro tips for the balcony house  other mesa verde tourstours are offered from late april to midoctober tours fill up so be sure to book yours as early as possible balcony house tours were 4 per person it doesn’t matter if you have an annual pass to the national parks keep in mind it takes 45 minutes to an hour to get from the visitor center to the meeting point you will be hiking down to the balcony and climbing ladders so wear shoes with good traction if you have a severe fear of heights the tour might be difficult for you we’re both afraid of heights but it wasn’t that bad for us there are bathrooms at the parking lot before you head down if you are bringing your camera be sure to have a strap or backpack you can put it in when you’re going up the ladder please please please do not touch the ruins we should work to preserve it for future generations too they offer tours of a few of the other cliff dwellings as well this was the only one available what ruins have you visited would you have confronted the lady you might also love7 things you can’t miss in mesa verde national park 9 things you can’t miss at great sand dunes national park facing our fears by hiking angels landing zion national park behind the scenes of a travel blogger filed under outdoors
