tim filla b a political science  international relations case western reserve university 2014updated mar 3 2017 · author has 109 answers and 6409k answer views originally answered why did saddam hussein invade iran in 1980 the previous answers touch on a few of the reasons but i think there is a little more to it the basic reasons are these territorial disagreements around the shatt alarab waterway and khuzestan culminating in the algiers accord the threat of khomeini’s theocratic shi’a islamic republic toward iraq’s secular sunni ba’ath party saddam’s view of himself as a champion of arab nationalism saddam’s perception of iran’s vulnerability and iraq’s strength shortly after the iranian revolution here’s the long version1 territorial disputes iran and iraq had very tense relations and important territorial disputes for years before the war much of this centered around two important geographic features the shatt alarab waterway and the khuzestan province of iran the shatt alarab is the place where the tigris and euphrates rivers run together in iraq near the city of basra it’s iraq’s only access to the persian gulf and it happens to be very close to iran in 1937 iran and iraq signed a treaty that provided that iran pay iraq a toll when using the shatt alarab in 1969 a year after saddam hussein’s ba’ath party took power in iraq iran stopped paying tolls iraq threatened war but was too weak to make good on that promise iran started using the waterway unimpeded in response to this the iraqi government began to lay claims on khuzestan iran’s province just east of the shatt alarab khuzestan is roughly the green area on the border with iraq in western iran as you can see in the map khuzestan has a large number of arabs like iraq whereas iran is predominately persian more on this in point 3 iraq claimed khuzestan as part of its territory saying it was stolen from them during colonial rule similar to claims they would later make about kuwait it also doesn’t hurt that khuzestan contains a huge amount of oil iraq began broadcasting propaganda to khuzestan encouraging the arabs to revolt against the shah’s government and later supported arab uprisings in khuzestan in response to this iran and israel for separate reasons began supporting kurdish separatist movements in northern iraq this lasted until 1975 when iran and iraq signed the algiers accord under this agreement the border between iran and iraq ran down the center of the shatt alarab iraq renounced its claim of khuzestan and iran stopped supporting kurdish rebels saddam hussein came out as a major opponent of the algiers accords believing they humiliated iraq the unfairness of the agreement was a major justification for the invasion in 19802 threat of the islamic republic much of the territorial disputes happened even before khomeini came to power in iran in 1979 iran’s shah was overthrown and ayatollah khomeini established a theocratic islamic republic in the country much of khomeini’s rhetoric advocated spreading the “islamic revolution” around the muslim world and naturally his first target was iraq iraq is a majority shi’a country but saddam hussein and his entire government were sunni further iraq’s ruling ba’ath party was avowedly secular whereas khomeini’s iran was literally a theocracy khomeini frequently spoke of overthrowing the iraqi government and saddam took those threats seriously iraqi shi’a began rioting in 1979 attempting to spread the revolution to iraq just as saddam feared and khomeini encouraged the islamic republic was the governmental antithesis of ba’athist iraq  theocratic persian and shi’a vs secular arab and sunni they made for natural enemies3 arab nationalism for those who don’t know arab nationalism is a longstanding postcolonial philosophy in the arab world that arabs share a common identity and should be politically united in some fashion in a secular government the most famous advocate of arab nationalism was egyptian president gamal abdel nasser in fact nasser actually unified egypt and syria from 1958 to 1961 as the united arab republic uar however the project failed quickly as it became clear that it was egypt dominating syria and not an equal partnership the uar’s failure combined with nasser’s humiliating defeat in the 1967 war with israel essentially ended nasser’s career and much of arab nationalism with it the other main proponents of arab nationalism were none other than the ba’ath party the ba’ath party advocated for a single secular socialist arab state the party was responsible for the syria’s end of the merger with egypt to form the uar it became associated with the military and authoritarianism the ba’ath party managed to take control of syria in 1966 after losing control in 1961 with the end of the uar and iraq in 1968 by this point it had split into two separate factions the syrian faction under hafez alassad father of bashar alassad and the iraqi faction under ahmed hassan albakr and later saddam hussein after taking power in the 1970s saddam hussein saw himself as the sole remaining champion of arab nationalism he believed he could be the next nasser and start a second arab nationalist movement across the arab world to demonstrate his commitment to unifying all arabs under a single state he saw it as iraq’s duty to liberate the arabs of khuzestan from persian rule thus invading iran to liberate khuzestan played into saddam’s ideology and his vision for the future4 iran’s vulnerability and iraq’s strength a major justification for the invasion especially when it happened was practical iran was emerging from a tumultuous revolution in which it had alienated itself from much of the international community especially the united states saddam thought that khomeini did not have full control of iran and iran’s response to an invasion would be weak he also correctly assumed he would have the support of the united states and other key international allies further iraq was in a very strong place in the late 1970s oil revenues had never been higher and iraq was developing quickly saddam had a formidable army and it was unclear how effective the islamic republic’s new military would be able to stop them saddam predicted a quick shocking victory taking khuzestan and forcing iran to surrender of course that’s not how it went saddam’s invasion was stalled taking the city of khorramshahr on the iraqiran border and ground to a stalemate in 1981 iran invaded iraq in 1982 and the fighting continued until 1988 it

several reasons nationalism saddam hussein believes in arab nationalism iranian are persian economical benefit saddam hussein wanted more oil to enhance iraqi economy iranian revolution he was frightened of the iranian revolution he was a dictator most of the people of iraq are shia so he was frightened if they revolted against him there is the longstanding historic animosity between sunnis and shiites support soviet union was the main weapons supplier of iraq but under the philosophy that the enemy of my enemy is my friend the united states and other western powers assisted iraq militarily hegemony saddam was a megalomaniac obsessed with power he wanted to lead the arab world chance hussein thought the iranian army was weak  command less at that time but iraqi army was strong  disciplined he thought his military could walk in and take over so he took the chance84k views · view upvoters your response is private is this answer still relevant and up to date sahib tulsi updated jul 1 2014 it all boils down to three main reasons1 it would demonstrate to shias and kurds in iraq that it is useless to look to iran for any kind of help the whole dynamics of the gulf had changed with the iranian revolution ayatollah ruhulla khomeini made calls to shias of iraq to rid themselves of saddam with support from kurds in iraq as a result of these calls from khomeini religious rebellions had already started taking place in saudi arabia bahrain and kuwait so it was important to rein in the enemies of saddam2 to enhance his authority in the arab world saddam had been very successful in combining the social efficacy of networks of patronage with the administrative organization of power that is inherent in the formal structure of state he was in a very strong position now iran had declared itself nonaligned to any of the super powers after the iranian revolution soviet was busy in afghanistan us was not too pleased with iran but the carter administration had built up really strong relations with saudi saddam did not bother them too much for the time being so the time was ripe for saddam to revive the panarab ship with him as the head remember this ship had sunk following 1967 war and development of peaceful relations between egypt and israel in 1979 something needed to be done to enforce the arab nationalist ideology3 he hoped to get territorial concessions from iran once iraq would defeat iran saddam had hoped that iran was not ready for any kind of confrontation following the revolution it had already used up all its resources so in such a state it would be a body blow to iran if he could invade and defeat them that would reduce their bargaining power significantly visavis the territorial issues the most important of these wasthe shattalarab waterway one of the many gifts that british had given to the gulf at the time of their departure in 1975 saddam had settled this issue and us and shah had agreed to stop their support to kurds in iraq but obviously saddam had other ideas once he was power in 1979 so after gaining the confidence of saudi arabia jordan and us iraqi army invaded iran on september 22 1980 little did they know that this battle was going to last for eight long years which would leave them in tatters31k views · view upvoters your response is private is this answer still relevant and up to

views for the sake of being precise and honesty i’d presume that saddam opted to invade iran as your query states  which is not the vision i find as true being an insider and an eye witness of it all but i have to clear a few things firstly  two neighboring countries one of them had long been in total control of the other for centuries until that was made to be over when islam prevailed  who would you believe to be on the course of restoring that power once again  another the first country is mainly shiite the second is also of a majority of shiites who would you imagine to be having concrete ambitions of taking over and invading the other  the third saddam  his party had a panarab ambition his heart and eyes were focused both southwards and westwards towards other arab states for him iran was just a nonarab country with shiite theme for both people and government why would he ever dream of winning a country with a nonarab people of whole persiankurdish blush ethnicity and a minority of shiite arabs in ahwaz  you should have modified your question to kuwait not iran saddam did not progress more than those few border towns beyond which would lay a vast arid and deserted terrain how much army and resources of logistics would saddam had needed to make it an “invasion” rather than a “catch” to abort a shiite revolution that iran was plotting to spark inside iraq besides look at iran now and see it for your own self now that saddam is long gone and almost forgottenis iran a better neighbor than before isn’t iraqi oil still siphoned through slant drilling both by kuwaities and

throwing american imperialism from their country the usa wanted to revenge on iran and couple months later the 1979 revolution saddam attacked to iran there is no other meaning to it’s a western imperialism plot the worlds most developed countries and other arab countries except syria supported saddam even soviet union although iran was against us supported saddam to fulfill us’s need iran used us’s planes which they get in the time of shah after throwing shah away the us also sent planes and weapons to saddam i am not an iran fan but the truth is this264 views · answer requested by
