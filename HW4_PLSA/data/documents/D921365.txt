what not to pack in your carryon bag please note that some posts contain links that earn me a small commission at no extra cost to you i’m a big advocate of traveling with only carryon luggage it means you have less stuff to lug around you avoid having to pay baggage fees and the airline can’t lose your luggage if it’s not checked but you should know what not to pack in your carryon bag if you were thinking of bringing any of these you’ll either need to leave it at home find an alternative or deal with checking luggage liquids over 34 ounces or 100ml the liquids restriction is pretty universal nowadays though enforcement may vary to be on the safe side stick to the rule all liquids must be in containers of no more than 34 ounces or 100ml and all containers must fit in a clear one quart sized zip top plastic bag you can still travel carryon only with liquids a 100ml bottle of shampoo just lasted me approximately 40 showers buy travel sized containers and fill them with shampoo shower gel and any other products you want to bring on your trip buy things like toothpaste in travel sizes there are special rules for medications but these vary by country check with the country you will be flying out of for their rules but in most cases you will need to let the screening agents know that you have liquid medication in addition to one quart bag you are allowed items passengers often forget about which are considered liquids peanut butter mascara snow globes aerosols what toiletries can you take on a plane you can take toiletries or other liquids that are in containers no larger than 34 ounces 100ml and they must all fit in a one quart one liter clear zip top bag this includes liquids gels and aerosols if you must pack more toiletries than these allowances you will have to pack them in checked luggage check out nonliquid options like solid perfume sticks and solid sunscreen to minimize your liquids sharp objects this one should be selfexplanatory but sharp objects are prohibited in carryon luggage because they could be used as a weapon if you simply must bring a knife box cutter or sword on your trip it must be packed in your checked luggage scissors that are less than 4 inches long like nail scissors are generally allowed by tsa but since the final decision rests with the agent just be aware that they could confiscate it rules in other countries can be different from those in the us so check it out before you fly from somewhere else sporting equipment baseball bats ski poles pool cues bows and arrows hockey sticks golf clubs and pretty much any other sporting equipment containing the words stick pole bat or club cannot be brought on the plane as carryon if playing sports will be part of your travels consider renting equipment at your destination if you’re quite attached to using your own sports equipment you’ll probably need to check it oddly enough the tsa website states that it’s ok to bring ice skates in your carryon i’m not sure i want to test this one though guns obviously a gun is a weapon and they don’t want you bringing it on an airplane in your carryon bag most guns are permitted in checked luggage as long as they are empty and they must be in a locked hardsided container check with your airline about other restrictions andor fees they might have some items such as flares and gun powder are not even permitted in checked luggage before you travel research the gun laws in the state or country you’re going to different states throughout the us have different laws and many other countries heavily restrict or prohibit personal gun use and ownership tools most but not all tools are prohibited in carryon luggage if you’re planning on bringing your tools with you you will most likely need to put them in checked luggage you might not think of a hammer or drill bits as weapons but tsa’s opinion differs lighters matches and other flammable items i think we can all agree that starting a fire on the airplane is not a good idea please leave all flammable chemicals and items at home if you feel you must have fireworks bleach or paint thinner on your vacation buy them when you arrive these and other flammable and explosive items are prohibited in both carryon and checked luggage lots of camping gear like camping stoves is considered flammable as well check with tsa and the airline for rules and restrictions if possible get the equipment you need once you arrive to avoid the hassle tsa does allow one book of safety matches in your carryon but matches are not allowed in your checked luggage normal lighters are allowed in your carryon and can only be checked if they have no fuel in them meat fruit vegetables and other agricultural products when traveling internationally most countries prohibit you from bringing in meats fruit vegetables plants and other agricultural products if you want to bring an apple as a snack just make sure you eat it on the plane otherwise it will be confiscated on arrival and you could find yourself facing an angry border agent certain countries like australia and new zealand are even more strict and won’t allow things like wooden souvenirs you may have picked up somewhere else still not sure if an item is allowed in your carryon for us travel check the tsa website to find out what you can bring and now for some items that are allowed but not recommended for packing in your carryon stinky food i know airline food is notoriously bad or often not even offered so it makes sense to bring your own occasionally but please be respectful of your neighbors and leave the fish and other stinky food at home nail polish ok bring the nail polish in your liquids bag if you want but please don’t paint your nails in flight this falls under the disrespectful smell category adult viewing and reading materials your neighbor does not want to look over and see you reading an adult magazine or watching adult movies on your laptop save it for the privacy of your own home perfume we’re all glad you care about how you smell but perfume can be unpleasant and bothersome to many people some are even allergic wait until you reach your destination to spray on the perfume that way your seatmates can breathe easy during the flight guidebooks guidebooks can be really helpful but chances are you don’t need to bring that heavy book with you on the trip either rip out the pages you think you’ll need photocopy them or take pictures with your phone of the pages you need better yet buy digital copies for your kindle or other ereader note recently the us and uk have put into place restrictions on electronics in carryon luggage for flights from certain countries and on certain airlines check with your airline ahead of time about whether you can pack tablets cameras or laptops in your carryon luggage looking for more packing tips check out this book about how to travel carryon only it’s written by another travel blogger and i highly recommend the
