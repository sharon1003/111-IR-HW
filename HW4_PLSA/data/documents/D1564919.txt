interior woodwork for optimum adhesion of the new primer and paint we don’t show you how to strip layers of old paint down to bare wood using heat or chemical strippers cautionif your home was built before 1979 check the paint for lead call your public health department for instructions on how to do it don’t use the scraping or sanding techniques we show here on lead paint because doing so will release lead dust the primary cause of lead poisoning for more information on lead wash the woodwork what you need to start you’ll need buckets sponges and detergent to wash the trim have two buckets and two scrub sponges at hand such as scotchbrite scrub sponges one each for washing solution and clear water rinsing don’t wash with a cloth rag as it may shine a flat surface or dull a lustrous one the goal is to remove the grime so you don’t push it farther into the wood during sanding use a nonsoapy detergent such as dirtex spic  span or tsp norinse substitute according to label directions regular tsp trisodium phosphate also works but it leaves a white film that requires a lot of rinsing and it can irritate your skin it’s not available in some states dip a scrub sponge into the cleaning solution and wring it out enough to keep it from dripping wash wood from the bottom upward with slow easy upanddown strokes so the solution has time to soften the grime  if you start at the top the cleaner can run down the wood and create hardtoremove streaks only clean one section at a time so the wood won’t dry before you rinse off the cleaner if directions call for rinsing to rinse dip the rinse sponge in clear water and wring it drip free then wipe the surface clean in one pass when you begin to wash a new area start well within the clean area to avoid streaking change both the cleaning solution and the rinse water often—whenever the water becomes cloudy spend twice as much time cleaning the wood in areas of high hand contact such as windows door frames and around light switches and handlesknobs and places that attract high airborne particles all wood in kitchens bathrooms and laundry rooms remove stains with special cleaners clean stains use a heavyduty cleaner on stains or cover them with a stainblocking primer if stains from markers ink or the like resist initial cleaning remove them with a specialty cleaner such as goof off otherwise they’ll bleed through the new paint if all else fails apply a stainhiding primer such as zinsser’s bin to cover it handsand all woodwork to remove all surface shine clogresistant sandpaper use clogresistant sandpaper to sand gummy surfaces handsand all woodwork smooth with a fine 180grit paper until all shine disappears right a coarsergrit paper will remove more than necessary use 80 to 120grit to smooth imperfections such as heavy globs of old paint if the outside paint layer is gummy use a “clogresistant” or “selflubricating” sandpaper such as 3m’s sand blaster paper it has an antiload coating that keeps the paper from clogging buy a sanding block and sanding sponges sanding sponges a sanding sponge can reach crevices that are hard to sand with paper the right tool improves the sanding job a folded sheet and finger pressure work great for most areas a rubber sanding block is comfortable to grip works well with feathering and lets you apply more even pressure in stubborn areas like windowsills a sanding sponge or pad conforms readily to curves and crevices test the paint adhesion see if paint sticks to duct tape pull duct tape off the paint to see if the paint sticks perhaps you’ve moved into a house where the previous owners threw on a quick coat of paint—and now you’re stuck redoing it haven’t we all been there to determine if the new paint will hold scribe an “x” lightly into the surface paint layer with a razor blade firmly stick duct tape over the mark and yank it away quickly if any paint adheres to the tape it’s unsound and should be removed scrape loose paint scrape loose paint remove buildup and loose paint with a 2in carbide scraper use a 2in carbideblade scraper the maxx grip tungsten talon by hyde tools is one to eliminate areas of hardened grime flaking or chipped paint and thick paint globs buy one that fits your hand and features a replaceable carbide blade pull the scraper in the direction of the wood grain and use finesse and elbow grease to “rake” the paint away but not gouge the wood scrape until the remaining paint won’t budge and you have nice crisp but not sharp edges in the details of the wood dust and vacuum thoroughly vacuum the woodwork dust off the woodwork then vacuum it with a brush attachment when the first sanding and scraping step is complete dust off all areas with an old paintbrush and vacuum woodwork with a brush attachment clean out crevices with a putty knife scrap crevices with a putty knife use a 112in flexible putty knife to clean out detailed areas for small tight areas scrape with a 112in flexible putty knife use a pushing motion to go under the paint—working from an area of loose paint to an area where paint is firmly adhered this bevels the remaining paint layers to make a smooth transition between damaged and undamaged areas and it renews the details in the wood consider liquid sandpaper especially on lead paint after final sanding and vacuuming some pros go the extra step of wiping woodwork down with a liquid sandpaperdeglosser such as wilbond by wilsonimperial or esp by flood this step will ensure a good bond and if you have to deal with lead paint this step can replace sanding check for flaws with a trouble light rake a light across the wall shine a light across the woodwork and circle any flaws position a handheld bulb at least 60 watts so it shines across rakes the wood surface to detect loose paint rough edges and other blemishes in the surface to determine what needs to be filled take a pencil and lightly circle spots that need work fills holes with lightweight spackling compound fill holes with compound use a putty knife to fill all chips holes and cracks with spackling compound cracks depressions and other surface defects before painting holes filled with a heavy coat or several layers of paint may look good initially but the result won’t last when the paint dries these filled areas will often reopen fill all chips holes and cracks with spackling compound use a lightweight compound that dries fast and doesn’t shrink if you use a type that shrinks fill anything 116 in or deeper twice apply more filler than is needed to each hole with a flexible putty knife then smooth it by pressing down and pulling toward you then use the widest putty knife you have to feather out the filler—and keep sanding to a minimum rebuild damaged corners with a twopart filler twopart wood filler use a twopart wood filler to fix damaged wood trim for damaged corners use a twopart wood filler like minwax’s high performance wood filler or an automotive body filler like bondo both are tough won’t shrink and stick like glue caulk between woodwork and walls caulk along the trim run a crisp bead of caulk between the trim and the wall apply a thin bead of paintable acrylic latex caulk only inside the crack where wood meets a wall for a smooth professional appearance remove extra caulk with a putty knife and buy a dripless caulk gun to save time and frustration cut the tip smaller than you think you need feather out filled areas with finegrit sandpaper dull spot that wasn’t primed prime areas that are filled with compound or the dull spot will show through the finish coat of paint use 320grit sandpaper over all filled areas to flatten and feather them out dust off the sanded areas with an old paint brush and vacuum with a brush attachment
