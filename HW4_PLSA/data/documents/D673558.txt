research technologybased training is usually used to build and sharpen interviewer skills particularly skills required for successfully interacting with survey respondents traditionally interactionskills training relied on peertopeer role playing or passive learning through videos technologybased training in contrast facilitates selfdirected learning with rich media sources and abundant learnerassessment and remediation options the benefits of technologybased training for survey research include a reduced learning time b reduced or eliminated travel time and expense c improved consistency by capturing and replicating best practices and expert knowledge d increased availability of training with justintime access on personal computers in any location e enhanced
