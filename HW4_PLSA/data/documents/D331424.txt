imrt confers survival benefit for head and neck cancer by brian casey aunt minniecom staff writer january 20 2014  patients with head and neck cancer who received intensitymodulated radiation therapy imrt had better survival rates than those who received conventional radiation treatment  the first indication of a survival benefit for the more complex technique according to a new study in cancer researchers from the university of texas md anderson cancer center examined the outcomes of more than 3100 patients treated from 1999 to 2007 some of this group received imrt while others were treated with nonimrt techniques those who received imrt demonstrated better survival rates than those who didnt the researchers found  cancer january 13 2014 this was the first populationbased study to show that imrt conferred a survival benefit for patients in addition to already demonstrated advantages in terms of reducing side effects according to the authors shaping dose imrt has been adopted by many radiation oncology centers due to its ability to shape radiation dose to tumors and spare surrounding healthy tissue its been assumed that imrts more accurate dose pattern primarily benefits patients by reducing side effects such as xerostomia dry mouth and clinical studies have generally supported this contention however imrt costs more than conventional radiation therapy leading some health policy analysts to question whether the greater expense is worth it complicating the issue is a lack of studies specifically addressing imrts impact on patient survival to help answer that question a research team led by dr beth beadle ph d decided to focus specifically on imrts effect on outcomes for head and neck cancer as measured by causespecific survival in theory there could be a benefit imrts greater precision allows the delivery of radiation doses higher than the 2 gy per fraction amount typically used with conventional therapies historically conventional 2d and 3d rt uses large fields and a series of field reductions to provide sequentially higher doses to the primary tumor the authors wrote imrt has the advantage of being able to target the tumor itself with greater conformality and simultaneously reducing dose to normal tissues this could produce either better or worse patient outcomes beadle and colleagues posited on the positive side the higher dose to targeted tissue and lower dose to surrounding healthy tissue could improve outcomes if the technique is performed well but on the negative side the tighter margins and higher conformality of imrt could create the risk of marginal misses and decrease causespecific survival if performed poorly the researchers began their analysis by examining the surveillance epidemiology and end results seer database for patients with head and neck cancers who were treated between 1999 and 2007 they identified 3172 patients who met the studys inclusion criteria the mean age of the patients at diagnosis was 722 years and 668 were male in all 1056 patients 333 received imrt while 2116 individuals 667 were treated with conventional radiation therapy some 583 of the patients had cancer of the oral cavity and oropharnyx 18 had cancer of the larynx 107 had cancer of the hypopharynx 68 had cancer of the nose nasal cavity or middle ear and 62 had cancer of the nasopharynx of the total 3172 patients 1783 562 died with 888 patients 28 reportedly dying of causes related to head and neck cancer however those treated with imrt had a statistically significant improvement in causespecific survival 389 compared with those who received conventional treatment 189 p  00001 because of the different sizes of the two patient groups the researchers then created two equalsized study cohorts and again imrttreated patients had significantly better causespecific survival hazard ratio  072 95 confidence interval 05909 than the nonimrt group the authors characterized their findings as unique and controversial highlighting the fact that imrts superior outcomes for both side effects and survival could give it a costeffectiveness edge over conventional radiation therapy as the population of patients with head and neck cancer grows younger and more prone to both toxicity and recurrence a technology that could improve both may not only be comparatively more effective but may also be more costeffective by reducing needs for costly salvage therapy for recurrences and for side effect management expenses even if the upfront rt costs are higher due to use of a more resourceintensive rt
