mystery of zebra stripes solved black and white pattern confuses flies to stop them landing on their skin stripes are particularly thin on the lower leg and close to the head these are areas were biting flies are most likely to strike a zebra zebra’s short hair and lack of a winter coat may make it especially susceptible to bites necessitating the need for extra protection by fiona macrae for the daily mail published 1213 edt 1 april 2014  updated 1353 edt 1 april 201440view comments scientists think they know how zebras got their stripes – and the answer is far from black and white they say that despite usually being thought of as camouflage the stripes more likely evolved to keep diseasecarrying flies at bay bizarre as this sounds studies show that flies find it harder to land on stripes – and that zebrasized bands are particularly effective at keeping them away2studies show that flies find it harder to land on stripes  and that zebrasized bands are particularly effective at keeping them away stripes are particularly thin on the lower legs – an area extra to flies when they suck blood from other animals such as cows related articlesprevious 1 next the fossilised footprints made by a spider tarantulasized could ocd in dogs bring us closer to developing a cure share this article they are also very narrow on the head – which is close to the ground when grazing the theory comes from u s researchers who looked for evidence to back up the various explanations for how the zebra got its stripes2scientists noticed that zebra stripes very narrow on the head of a zebra  which is close to the ground when grazing and susceptible to bites can zebra stripes dazzle predators last year a team of uk researchers said it had uncovered evidence that the stripes are used by the african equines to dazzle predators the markings they claim work as an optical illusion that conceal a zebra’s movements and protect it from being attacked scientists from royal holloway university of london and the university of queensland used computer models in an attempt to test their theory‘the stripes dont just confuse big predators like lions  pests and flies are affected too’ said professor johannes zanker from the department of psychology at royal holloway‘the highly visible oriented stripes on a zebra’s flank and the narrower vertical stripes on its back and neck give unexpected motion signals that confuse viewers particularly in a herd of zebras the idea that they act as camouflage by making the animals harder to spot in constantly changing woodland light was quickly discounted because zebras spend much of their time out in the open another popular theory is that the stripes dazzle predators and so make it more difficult for them to judge their prey’s size and speed however the university of california review found that lions are particularly good at catching zebras the theories that stripes evolved to cool the animals under the harsh african sun and as a means of recognising each other and grouping together were also dismissed writing in the journal nature communications the researchers said there is however consistent evidence that range of zebras and closely related animals overlaps with that of biting flies they said that zebra’s short hair and lack of a winter coat may make it especially susceptible to bites necessitating the need for extra protection zebras may also be particularly vulnerable to the diseases carried by flies they concluded ‘a solution to the riddle of zebra stripes is at hand’advertisement share or comment on this
