trumps campaign staff took control of his twitter account theyre concerned that his personal tweets sometimes backfire jon fingas jonfingas110616 in politics comments2692shares ap photojohn locher have you noticed that many more of donald trumps recent tweets are obviously from his staff rather than from the presidential candidate himself its not because hes busy on the campaign trail according to the new york times trumps team wrested away control of his twitter account while theres no official reason given its said to be out of concern that trumps offthecuff online remarks are doing his campaign more harm than good  a latenight insult or inaccurate statement would come back to haunt him in the next debate or clinton ad the trick according to the newspaper was convincing trump that losing control would actually make him stronger his campaign chief steve bannon claimed that clinton was trying to get inside trumps head and prod him into saying things on twitter that hed regret later now trump suggests tweets and lets staff edit them before they reach the internet this hasnt completely stopped trump from tweeting himself there are a handful of recent examples as of this writing and not everyone will be happy with the move its easier to connect with candidates if you know its really them rather than press managers serving as conduits however trump himself is happy with the change as it has led to the media reporting more on his campaign message than his outbursts the big question is whether or not the shift in policy is coming in time after all trump had unfettered twitter access for nearly his entire election run if those tweets did any tangible damage to trumps chances of winning theres no guarantee that hell repair his image in the last few days

locations some existing stores have them in the very back which is good for walmart  youre more likely to buy stuff while making a pick up  but kind of terrible for everyone else its also more secure a potential thief has to go through a lot more cameras to get to the back of the store additionally and likely more importantly theyre closer to the backroom so it makes it easier to stock them

particularly if youre on the road allot how much would an unlimited plan be in comparison for a mobile phone in ‘ready player one’ the real world doesnt matterarex913d i read various reviews of the movie many of them critical ahead of seeing it in the theater yesterday so i had sufficiently lowered expectations going in as a result i was not disappointed and found it to be a rather enjoyable ride of course there were a lot of stupid things in the movie 1 at the beginning of the movie they got the omnidirectional treadmill thing right so why are so many people walking down the street while playing in a vr world 2 if it hurts to fight in the oasis when wearing a haptic body suit why bother wearing one at least turn it off when engaging in virtual fist fighting with realworld consequences 3 whats with the musical chairs at ioi when players are killed in the game when regular users die do they similarly need to run to another computer to respawn im pretty sure they dont 4 shutting down the oasis two days a week is a recipe for trouble for people whose realworld lives might be so miserable that they actually need that escape sure such peoples lives would have to be pretty crappy to want to live full time in vr but do you want to take that away from someone who might otherwise feel they have nothing to live for i imagine suicide spikes every tuesday and thursday still overall it was a fun movie if you go in with the right expectations comments sign in
