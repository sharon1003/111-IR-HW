to different locations do not skip this stepdata integrity  perform a data integrity verify data only check prior to running year end to ensure your data is free from errors further details below periods  do not change the dates of your current year periods to next year the yearend procedure does this for you period 13  you can use period 13 to post next year transactions and thereby delay the yearend procedure for up to a month at most please note that period 13 is not available in sage pastel xpress supervisor access  you have sole access to your company data and are logged into partner as a supervisor retained income account  this account exists in your general ledger no open batches exist  documents on hold for users who have multiple period access are not considered to be open you must update all open batches before running the yearend procedure however sales purchase orders and quotations processed before the yearend procedure are carried over to the next year last period processing  you have processed transaction into last period of the current financial year if there are no transactions in the last period of the current financial year pastel warns you of this fact since in all probability you should not want to run the yearend however you can continue if you wish to please also view our document on what to check first before running the year end process for more detailed information in regards to this  click hereimportant note it is very difficult to predict how long the year process may take to completed as a number of variables such as size of the data pc hardware specifications as well as available system resources will impact on the duration of the process a common occurrence that tends to happen during the year end process is that the system appears to hang when processing the acctrndat transactions acchisthdat history header acchistldat history lines files please understand that these files are often very large and although the system seems to be not responding it is actually processing away as intended it is absolutely vital that you are patient during this process as shutting partner down forcefully ie by using ctrlaltdel will almost certainly corrupt your company data files preparing for year end checklist it is absolutely imperative that you prepare thoroughly before you process the yearend the following checklist will help to ensure that you have done all the necessary preparatory work task details update open batches you cannot process the yearend if you have open batches in your company data to determine whether you have any open batches simply click on view… open batches from within partner note however that invoices on hold outstanding sales orders purchase orders and quotations will not prevent the yearend from running backup your company we cannot overstate the importance of this step you should keep this backup and never overwrite it as a precautionary measure make at least two sets of backups and store them in different physical locations if the yearend procedure does not complete for any reason you will have to restore from backup and reinitiate the yearend procedure it is also recommended that you run a data integrity before making this backup copy the company to a new company this step is optional but highly recommended if you have enough disk space you can create a new company as a copy of your company prior to the yearend this is useful because you can continue to do queries on transactions and balances which are more than two years old if you decide to do this we suggest that you change the password s on the copied company to prevent you from inadvertently posting entries into that company note that this procedure is not sufficient as a backup – if your hard disk fails you will loose the data of both companies you can do this within the yearend assistant make printouts we recommend that you make at least the following printouts before running the year end  trial balance for the year  balance sheet for the year  detailed ledger for all accounts and all periods  customer and supplier age analysis reports  any other reports you deem necessary create a retained income account if this is the first time you are running a year end ensure that you have created a retained income gl account the system posts the profit or loss for the year to this account steps to ensure that the retained income account is createdsetup correctly  search for the retained income account  if it exists ensure iis allocated to b15  retained income balance sheet financial category  if not create the account and ensure its allocated to the retained income financial category  once you have finished creating the account click save foreign currency revaluation if you use the multicurrency addon module you must run a foreign currency revaluation prior to running the yearend disk space and memory it is important to check that the available disk space is sufficient to run the yearend there should be at least disk space available equal to the size of your data directory furthermore please ensure that the available conventional memory ie the “largest executable program size” is 585k how do i check on my computer what my free memory is  go into your ms dos prompt and simply type in mem and press enter  locate the area largest executable program size 3rd line from bottom  ensure this setting states at least 585k  if it is less then you may experience problems such as memory errors or hanging problem processing inventory count one of the routines you usually perform before the yearend procedure is a stock count it is not necessary to complete all the options in the inventory count assistant before running the yearend if you perform a snapshot before the yearend you can always complete it after running the yearend you can adjust stock quantities in the last period of last year via inventory journals preserving budgets at year end budgets are transferred to the correct year automatically during the yearend procedure please refer to the section “what the yearend procedure does” for further details on exactly how the processing is done if you want the current budget values before the yearend to remain as the current budgets after the yearend copy the values for this years budget to next years before running the yearend procedure this is done through the edit… budgets menu unmatched payments when you process to open item accounts you allocate payments and receipts to original invoices after you have run the yearend you will be able to allocate paymentsreceipts to the previous years outstanding invoices what running the year end procedure does the yearend procedure automatically sets up the company for processing in the next year during this procedure the following processing is done process explanation updates general ledger balances for income statement accounts current year balances move to last year for balance sheet accounts last year balances consolidate as one total and the current balances move to last year current year balances are set to zero current budgets move to last year budgets future budgets move to current budgets and next year budgets become zero the system posts the profit or loss for the year into the retained income account updates customer and supplier balances last year balances are consolidated into one total this year balances move to last year and last years closing balances are transferred to this year as opening balances this year balances and sales  purchases values become zero general ledger customer and supplier transactions the system deletes last year transactions this year transactions become last year transactions and the system creates a new empty transaction file for the current year invoices on hold have their period set to period one updates inventory costs sales and quantity values closing stock quantities become opening stock quantities in the new year the respective costs of these items are also carried forward periods the years are incremented by one year in the period table and period end dates are adjusted if necessary for example for leap years the current period for single period users is set to one moves period 13 if you set period 13 as the first period of the new year the system transfers period 13 transactions and balances to period one of the new year invoice history and open item history invoice history and open item history are not deleted by the yearend procedure to delete these you must run the delete history  clear files function
