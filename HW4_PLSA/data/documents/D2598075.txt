star and delta connections star and delta connections a threephase electric motor can be connected in two ways star y or delta a the winding phases in a threephase motor are marked u v and w u1u2 v1v2 w1w2 with the star y connection the ends of motor windings phases are joined together to form a zero point which looks like a star y on the motor plate it can for example state 690400 v this means the star connection is intended for the higher voltage and the delta connection for the lower the current which can also be stated on the plate shows the lower value for the star connected motor and the higher for the delta connected motor the main supply is connected to a threephase motors terminals marked uv and w the phase sequence is l1 l2 and l3 this means the motor will rotate clockwise seen from d the drive end to make the motor rotate anticlockwise two of the three conductors connected to the starter or to the motor are switched check the opperation of the cooling fan when rotating anticlockwise
