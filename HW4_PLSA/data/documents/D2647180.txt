the secret to crisp arancini rice balls with molten centers sushi rice daniel gritzer profile twitter contact26 printerfriendly version two unusual ingredients—sushi rice and bechamel—lead to arancini with a thin supercrisp crust and a molten interior photographs daniel gritzerget the recipe rich and creamy saffron arancini with mozzarella food writers spend a lot of time waxing poetic about magical childhood food memories and attempts at recreating—but never quite capturing—that original ideal experience but sometimes the opposite happens sometimes we eat bad versions of dishes in our childhood and we somehow end up accepting it as if the bad version is all that dish can ever hope to be i had that problem with arancini the deepfried sicilian rice balls i grew up in an italianamerican neighborhood in brooklyn in the 1980s and i remember eating arancini there as a kid they were huge the size of softballs and dry and bland to the core ragù mushy peas and bits of cheese studded throughout couldnt save them i remember eating them hoping that the next bite would break through and reveal the good part like an oil prospector drilling into a parched landscape just waiting for liquid black to come surging up from below it was an exercise in perpetual disappointment but its also all i ever knew when i started testing this recipe i had moments of selfdoubt a rice ball would come out starchy and dry and for a moment id think maybe this is right maybe this is exactly what its supposed to be i finally snapped myself out of the haze by reaching out on twitter seeking outside voices to set me straight it worked the chorus of responses made clear the obvious arancini should have a thin cracklingcrisp coating like a potato chip just barely containing the flow of rice suspended in a rich creamy sauce and in the very middle a pocket of juicy melted cheese that stretches from our hands to our mouths in thin gauzy strands the hive mind spoke and i responded this is the result first run the rice and the riches which rice to use for arancini at first seems obvious its an italian rice ball so the rice should be some kind of risotto rice like arborio carnaroli or vialone nano but i did some poking around on italian recipe sites and stumbled across mentions of another type of rice for arancini riso originario i didnt know what it was but after some research it started to look like orginario was an even shorter grain rice than the traditional risotto rice varieties with some sources describing it as being similar to shortgrain japanese sushi rice intrigued i picked up a bag of sushi rice to try alongside risotto rice during my initial run of tests i also wanted to settle on a basic approach for the recipe most that i saw online have you make something like a dry risotto then cool it down roll it into balls bread them and then deep fry them this is more or less how the ones of my childhood were likely made and the results arent good if any of you have ever had leftover risotto and tried to reheat it later youll immediately understand why risotto thickens as it cools and it doesnt flow again if you just warm it up you have to add more liquid to loosen it during reheating the problem with arancini is that once cooled and formed into balls theres no opportunity to rehydrate the rice inside before cooking so the question becomes how can we guarantee a flowing saucy center when we deep fry the rice balls i did some more digging and found some recipes that call for mixing eggs into the cooled risotto i figured id try it but i wasnt convinced that would solve the problem so i came up with another idea inspired by croquettes a related deepfried snack that uses bechamel sauce the beauty of bechamel is that it thickens when cold but then when subjected to the heat of deep frying it becomes molten again the above photo shows four sidebyside tests comparing risotto rice and sushi rice and also egg versus bechamel sauce i found that sushi rice produced the best results the grains retained their shape and a pleasantly chewy texture whereas the risotto rice blew out and became slightly mushy the differences werent drastic enough to say that you should never use risotto rice but if you have the choice reach for that japanese shortgrain rice if you can the samples with the egg meanwhile had a good rich flavor but the high heat of deep frying overcooked it resulting in dry sections of firm egg—not what i was looking for the bechamel on the other hand produced exactly the results i wanted grains of rice suspended in a rich creamy sauce in another test run i tried going for gold by combining the bechamel with egg and that was the best of all creating a sauce that was incredibly rich but without the hardcooked bits of egg like before improving the flavor once id settled on the sushi rice and bechamelandegg sauce i started working on a more precise recipe for the filling itself i settled on a milanesestyle risotto which is made with saffron its a pretty common flavor for arancini plus it gives them a golden hue an appropriate quality given that the name means little oranges in italian i also decided to tweak the bechamel portion of the recipe since i wanted more than just the mild flavor of milk instead i pushed the bechamel in the direction of a velouté by cutting back on the milk and adding some rich chicken stock in its place plus by using a gelatinrich chicken stock or by adding unflavored gelatin to storebought stock the bechamel would thicken even more once chilled which would aid in the formation of the balls to make the rice i start with a classic risotto method sweating onion in oil then adding the rice and toasting it then i add white wine followed by chicken stock and saffron i used the pressurecooker during my testing which cuts the risotto cooking time drastically and produces great results but you can also use the more traditional method of adding the broth in ladlefuls and stirring frequently you want the rice to get tighter and drier than if you were going to serve it as a risotto since too much water will make it very hard to form into balls while the risotto is cooking i prepare the bechamel sauce then stir them together i pour the whole thing onto parchmentlined baking sheets and transfer it to the refrigerator to chill completely which sets it enough to form into balls a question of construction i walked a fine line with my recipe here too wet and you wont be able to make rice balls but any drier than it needs to be and the arancini wont be as moist as they could be—and we want moist i pushed me rice filling about as far as i could while still making it possible to form into balls you may be tempted to dip your hands in water to keep the filling from sticking to them as you work but i dont recommend it since the extra water will thin the filling and make it less able to hold its shape to form the balls i scoop up a small handful of the rice filling and pat it into a flat disk in my palm then set some diced mozzarella in the center and fold the rice filling around it to form a sphere with the cheese in the center—mine were just a little smaller than the size of a handball at first you may not get perfect spheres but thats okay because youll be able to fix them later one other question i had was whether i could simplify the ballforming process by just folding diced mozzarella into the rice filling instead of planting it perfectly in the center of each one this didnt work with the cheese too close to the surface it ruptured and burnt so you really do need to put the cheese in the center of each one in the end i found that while the balls are at first hard to form into perfect spheres once you get the breading on them and let them sit as you form the remaining balls they become much easier to handle right before dropping them in the hot oil all you need to do is pat each one in your hands just a little more and it will turn into a perfect ball crumb luck with my rice balls formed the next step was to figure out the breading i did a few tests homemade breadcrumbs made from a rustic loaf regular panko breadcrumbs and panko thats been more finely ground in a food processor the homemade crumbs produced the best result creating a thin incredibly crisp crust the ground panko came in a close second and definitely scores some convenience points the larger panko crumbs on the other hand create a thicker exterior with a craggy texture that i found less appealing here the goal is little oranges not little fuzzy tennis balls a breaded crust though is about more than just the bread crumbs themselves its also about the dredging layers underneath the crumbs that help the breading adhere i tried it out a couple ways first i did a very traditional flour and eggwash dredging in which i first dusted the rice balls in flour then dipped them in egg and finally rolled them in the bread crumbs i also tried dipping the balls in a flourandwater slurry followed immediately by the bread crumbs which is a method i saw in some italian recipes online both methods worked well but i ever so slightly preferred the extracrisp crust on the flour slurry ones and since its simpler to do than the 3step floureggbreading method its the one im recommending here because the rice balls are pretty damp and sticky i also wanted to see what would happen if i skipped the slurry altogether and just rolled them directly in the breadcrumbs but as you can see in the photo above it resulted in rice balls with a less crisp crust that didnt brown as deeply even after lengthy frying some gratuitous photos lets take one last look fried crisp but not greasyso juicyyou dont even need marinara sauce with these strands of cheese just the way it should be and in case youre wondering this photo is blurry because those cheese strands are running straight into my mouth which made taking a photo really hard these arancini hit all the marks a shattering crisp crust outside and a creamy gooey rice filling inside once i arrived at these all those childhood memories of massive throatclogging balls of dry rice were
