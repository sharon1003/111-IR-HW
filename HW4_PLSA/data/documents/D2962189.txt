such as national parks and at federal facilities like military bases the interstate highway system is partly funded by the federal government but owned and maintained by individual state governments there are a few private highways in the united states which use tolls to pay for construction and maintenance there are many local private roads generally serving remote or insular residences passenger and freight rail systems bus systems water ferries and dams may be under either public or private ownership and operation civilian airlines are all privately owned and financed most airports are owned and operated by local government authorities but there are also some private airports the transportation security administration has provided security at most major airports since 2001 the united states department of transportation and its divisions provide regulation supervision and funding for all aspects of transportation except for customs immigration and security which are the responsibility of the united states department of homeland security each state has its own department of transportation which builds and maintains state highways and depending upon the state may either directly operate or supervise other modes of transportation aviation law is almost entirely a federal matter while automobile traffic laws are enacted and enforced by state and local

in the late 18th century overland transportation was by horse while water and river transportation was primarily by sailing vessel the united states population was centered on its atlantic coast with all major population centers located on a natural harbor or navigable waterway low population density between these centers resulted in a heavy reliance on coastwise and riverboat shipping the first government expenditures on highway transportation were funded to speed the delivery of overland mail such as the boston post road between new york city and boston due to the distances between these population centers and the cost to maintain the roads many highways in the late 18th century and early 19th century were private turnpikes other highways were mainly unimproved and impassable by wagon at least some of the year economic expansion in the late 18th century to early 19th century spurred the building of canals to speed goods to market of which the most prominently successful example was the erie canal access to water transportation shaped the geography of early settlements and boundaries for example the erie canal escalated the toledo war between ohio and michigan in the 1830s the disputed erie triangle was awarded to pennsylvania to give it access to lake erie most of west florida was given to mississippi and alabama to guarantee their access to the gulf of mexico development of the midwestern and southern states drained by the mississippi river system  mississippi ohio and missouri rivers was accelerated by the introduction of steamboats on these rivers in the early 19th century these three rivers  among others also form the borders of several states prior to the introduction of steamboats transit upstream was impractical because of strong currents on parts of these waterways steamboats provided both passenger and freight transportation until the development of railroads later in the 19th century gradually reduced their presence the rapid expansion of railroads brought the canal boom to a sudden end providing a quick scheduled and year round mode of transportation that quickly spread to interconnect the states by the mid19th century during the industrialization of the united states after the civil war railroads led by the transcontinental rail system in the 1860s expanded quickly across the united states to serve industries and the growing cities during the late 19th century railroads often had built redundant routes to a competitors road or built through sparsely populated regions that generated little traffic these marginal rail routes survived the pricing pressures of competition or the lack of revenue generated by low traffic as long as railroads provided the only efficient economical way to move goods and people across the united states in addition to the intercity passenger network running on class i and ii railroads a large network of interurban  trolley or street running rail lines extended out from the cities and interchanged passenger and freight traffic with the railroads and also provided competition the advent of the automobile signaled the end of railroads as the predominant transportation for people and began an era of mobility in the united states that added greatly to its economic output the early 20th century lincoln highway and other auto trails gave way in the 1920s to an early national highway system making the automobile the preferred mode of travel for most americans interurban rail service declined followed by trolley cars due in part to the advent of motorized buses and the lack of dedicated rightsofway but also by deliberate efforts to dismantle urban rail infrastructure see great american streetcar scandal  the scarcity of industrial materials during world war ii slowed the growth of the automobile briefly reemphasizing much of the nations declining rail network in the 1950s the united states renewed building a network of highcapacity highspeed highways to link its vast territory the most important element is the interstate highway system first commissioned in the 1950s by president dwight d eisenhower and modeled after the italian autostrada and the german autobahn system by 1945 nearly every city in america had at least one electric tram company providing intracity transportation there were an estimated 36377 light rail vehicles in operation improved automobile ownership cut this number by 13 by 1965 14the airline industry began to successfully compete with intercity rail which suffered a loss of ridership as the civil air transportation network of airports and other infrastructure expanded air travel became more accessible to the general population technological advances ushered in the jet age which increased airline capacity while decreasing travel times and the cost of flights the costs of flying rapidly decreased intercity rail ridership by the late 1960s to a point where railroads could no longer profitably operate networks of passenger trains  clarification needed by the early 1970s almost all passenger rail operation and ownership had been transferred to various federal municipal and state agencies passenger rail came to be heavily subsidized as it is today freight railroads continued to decline as motor freight captured a significant portion of the lessthancarload business this loss of business when combined the highly regulated operating environment and constrained pricing power forced many railroads into receivership and the nationalization of several critical eastern carriers into the consolidated rail corporation conrail deregulation of the railroads by the staggers act in 1980 created a regulatory environment more favorable to the economics of the railroad industry in the 1990s the increase in foreign trade and intermodal container shipping led to a revival of the freight railroads which have effectively consolidated into two eastern and two western private transportation networks union pacific and bnsf in the west and csx and norfolk southern in the east canadian national railway took over the illinois central route down the mississippi river valley wartime expediency encouraged long distance pipeline transport of petroleum and natural gas which was greatly expanded in the middle 20th century to take over most of the domestic longhaul market road transportation  editfurther

standards in order to receive federal funding the system as of 2010 has a total length of 47182 miles 75932 km 21 making it the worlds second longest after china s and the largest public works project in us history 22the interstate system joined an existing national highway system a designation created for the legacy highway network in 1995 comprising 160000 miles 256000 kilometers of roadway a fraction of the total mileage of roads the interstate system serves nearly all major u s cities often through the downtown areas a point which triggered freeway and expressway revolts in the 1960s and 1970s the distribution of virtually all goods and services involves interstate highways at some point 23 residents of american cities commonly use urban interstates to travel to their places of work the vast majority of longdistance travel whether for vacation or business is by the national road network 24 of these trips about onethird by the total number of miles driven in the country in 2003

networks are further supplemented by state highways and the local roads of counties municipal streets and federal agencies such as the bureau of indian affairs there are approximately 4071000 miles 6552000 km of roads in the united states 2678000 miles 4310000 km paved and 1394000 miles 2243000 km unpaved 26 state highways are constructed by each state but frequently maintained by county governments aided by funding from the state where such counties exist as governing entities mostly every state except the northeastern counties construct and maintain all remaining roads outside cities except in private communities local unnumbered roads are often constructed by private contractors to local standards then maintenance is assumed by the local government 27all federal highways are maintained by state governments although they receive federal aid to build and maintain freeways signed as part of the 46000 mile 75000 km nationwide interstate highway network changes by state initiative may be made with federal approval a large number of expressways are actually government or privately operated toll roads in many east coast and midwestern states west coast freeways are generally free to users freeways no toll charged per use although since the 1990s there have been some small experiments with toll roads operated by private companies after the collapse of the i35w mississippi river bridge in minnesota in august 2007 the backlog of road and bridge maintenance across the country became an issue in transportation funding 28 the collapse prompted a tax increase in minnesota to speed up bridge repairs and action in other states such as the accelerated bridge program in massachusetts but after some debate no increase in federal funding 28 the 2013 i5 skagit river bridge collapse caused by a collision with an overheight truck highlighted fracture critical bridges in which the failure of only one structural member will lead to complete collapse according to the
