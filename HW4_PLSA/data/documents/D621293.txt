67yearold male presented with a gradually progressive low back pain of 2 years duration the patient was leading a retired life and there was no history of chronic fever or significant trauma there was no radiation of pain or any features suggestive of claudication there was no history of any comorbidity the pain was aggravated with extension of the spine and relieved with flexion there was no swelling or neurological deficit but muscle spasm was present radiographs of the spine revealed degenerative changes in the lumbosacral spine along with articulation of spinous processes at in lumbar spine at all levels level suggestive of baastrups disease commonly known as kissing spine routine blood investigations were within normal limits the patient was managed conservatively he was given a weeks course of analgesics and muscle relaxants and then started on spinal flexion exercises with significant improvement being noted at 6 months follow up affiliation journal details this article was

directionality bias in headturning during kissing humans have a bias for turning to the right in a number of settings here we document a bias in headturning to the right in adult humans as tested in the act of kissing we investigated headturning hardware failure in patients with metastatic cancer to the spine the spine is the most common site of skeletal metastases affecting approximately 30 of individuals with cancer the aim of surgical treatment for metastatic spine disease is generally palliative to  do obese and extremely obese patients lose weight after lumbar spine fusions analysis of

chiropractic an occupational discipline founded by d d palmer in the 1890s based on the relationship of the spine to health and disease the spine is analyzed by xrays and palpation and vertebrae are adjusted manually to relieve pressures on the spinal cord osteopathic medicine was originally similar but has become more like family practice osteoarthritis spine a degenerative joint disease involving the spine it is characterized by progressive deterioration of the spinal articular cartilage cartilage articular usually with hardening of the subchondral bone and outgrowth of bone spurs osteophyte scheuermann disease a type of juvenile osteochondrosis affecting the fibrocartilaginous disc intervertebral disk in the thoracic or thoracolumbar region of the spine it is characterized by a forward concave spinal curvature or kyphosis spine the spinal or vertebral column manipulation orthopedic the planned and carefully managed manual movement of the musculoskeletal system extremities and spine to produce increased motion the term is sometimes used to denote a precise sequence of movements of a joint to determine the presence of disease or to reduce a dislocation in the case of fractures orthopedic manipulation can produce better position and alignment of the fracture from blauvelt  nelson a manual of orthopaedic terminology 5th ed p264
