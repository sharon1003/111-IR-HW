deep 102915conspiracy theory thursday—the princess diana death conspiracy like pop dust on facebook helen thomasprincess diana death conspiracy the princess diana death conspiracy theory first popped up within hours of the tragic unexpected death of diana princess of wales in 1997—and the theory just isnt going away it is over a decade and a half since the world woke up to the shocking news that 36yearold princess diana had been involved in a fatal car accident conspiracy theory thursday—tupac shakur faked his death the crash happened just after midnight on august 31 when the mercedes carrying a divorced diana and her boyfriend dodi al fayed 42 careered out of control in a paris tunnel they had just left the ritz hotel which is owned by dodis father mohamed al fayed and were en route to dodis apartment they were accompanied by two members of the al fayed staff both the driver of the vehicle henri paul and dodi were killed instantly when the vehicle spun out of control diana survived for just over three hours before succumbing to her injuries and trevor reesjones al fayeds bodyguard was injured but survived conspiracy theory thursday— paul mc cartney died in 1966the initial blame lay firmly with the pack of paparazzi who were chasing the vehicle however official investigators subsequently concluded that the driver henri paul was drunk and speeding at the time of the crash resulting in his loss of control the theory the overriding theory is that princess diana was killed deliberately by the british secret service mi6 to prevent her from marrying dodi fayed bearing his child—a step sibling to a future king—and becoming a muslim this would have embarrassed and destabilised the monarchy could not be allowed to happen conspiracy theory thursday—jamie lee curtis is a hermaphrodite it is alleged that just after the black mercedes entered the winding pont de lalma tunnel a black motorbike and two cars one dark one white followed into the tunnel in a tight formation the white car approached and clipped the mercedes pushing it off line and allowing the motorbike to surge ahead there was then a flash of light—a strobe—followed by a thunderous bang as the mercedes slammed into the tunnels 13th pillar conspiracy theory thursday—beyonce and the illuminati the motorbike stopped and the passenger got off and peered inside the vehicle he then turned to his partner and raised his arms into an x the military signal for mission accomplished before speeding off the prooflack of cctv images there were more than 14 cctv cameras in the underpass yet astonishingly none recorded footage of the fatal collision neither diana nor dodi were wearing seat belts at the time of the crash prompting speculation that the vehicle may have been sabotaged diana always wore her seat belt when travelling in the back of a vehicle tragically it has been confirmed that had the couple been wearing their seat belts both would have survived the crash the white fiat uno —the unidentified white car was seen to collide with the mercedes at the entrance of the tunnel there was white paint found on the mercedes proving that the cars had come into contact the fiat uno was never officially found eyewitnesses georges and sabine dauzonne saw the vehicle emerging from the tunnel and said that the driver of the car seemed perturbed by something in his rearview mirror they identified former security guard le van thanh as that man forensic tests confirmed that paint and rubber on thanhs car matched traces found on the mercedes but french police ruled him out of the investigation for some reason former mi6 officer richard tomlinson s sworn testimony tomlinson testified thatin the years leading up to the fatal crash mi6 used a paid informant in the security department of the ritz hotel he concludes that this informant was henri paul in 1992 he was shown documents of an outline plan to assassinate the serbian leader president slobodan milosevic while he was being driven the plan involved an almost identical scenario to the crash that killed diana—using a strobe light to disorientate the driver of the vehicle ensuring the crash took place in a tunnel were the close proximity to concrete wallspillars ensured the maximum damage plus it was noted that a tunnel would yield fewer casual witnesses one member of the paparazzi who routinely followed diana was a member of  ukn  a small group of parttime mi6 agents who provide adhoc services to mi6 such as surveillance and photography it is not known whether the undercover pap was present at the time of the fatal incident tomlinson has been subjected to intimidation tactics ever since he raised his theories including being arrested and deported on his arrival at jfk for an appearance on nbc —on the instruction of the cia a former soldier identified only as soldier n claimed that mi6 had help from the military service in engineering the crash the former british special forces sniper told both his former wife and inlaws that the sas british special air service commando unit was behind the deaths and also the cover up author alan power wrote a book the princess diana conspiracy with the aid of another former sas soldier in the book he confirms that diana was killed by mi6 with military aid he claims the existence of the secret assassination squad called the increment team and corroborates tomlinsons assertions eyewitness francois levistre said that a flash of white light was directed at the couples vehicle causing the crash he then said he had stopped near the tunnels exit and saw the motorcycle passenger get off look inside the crumpled vehicle and make a hand gesture to the bikes driver before they sped off the letter diana wrote to her butler paul burrell in 1993 burrell hid the letter from investigators fearful that it would never see the light of day in the letter diana warned this particular phase in my life is the most dangerous my husband is planning an accident in my car brake failure and serious head injury in order to make the path clear for him to marry clearly prophetic conspiracy theory thursday—joan rivers is alive and in fbi witness protection princess diana with her butler paul burrell dodis father mohamed al fayed alleges that diana was pregnant at the time of the accident he claims that diana broke this news to him in a phone call on august 31 dianas body was embalmed with inordinate and illegal haste after her death making it impossible to carry out a pregnancy test to prove whether or not she was carrying dodis child whilst the british establishment tried to downplay the assertion by mohamed al fayed that the couple were engaged in order to undermine his conspiracy theory allegations there is cctv footage of a ritz hotel staff member collecting an item from a jewellers and taking it to the couples suite in the hotel a ring with the inscription dismoi oui tell me yes was discovered after the couples death a receipt dated the day before the crash was also recovered listing a bague de fiancaille engagement ring the paparazzi photographers had crowded at the ritz hotel having heard rumors that there was to be an announcement of the princesss engagement or pregnancy henri paul who was deputy head of security at the hotel wasnt due to be on duty that night but returned just to drive the couple there have been claims that the blood used to test his alcohol level at the time of the crash thereby concluding that his drunkeness contributed to the accident was actually not his but that of a suicide victim this is further evidenced by the fact that there were high levels of carbon monoxide in his blood consistent with that of exhaust fumes as would be evident in a suicide by hose to tailpipe it is widely accepted that paul didnt draw a breath after the crash and the level of carbon monoxide found would have rendered him unable to drive so it wasnt there before the crash conspiracy theory thursday—britney spears was on george bush’s payroll the deputy head of security and stand in driver henri paul there is cctv footage of paul hovering outside the rear entrance of the hotel on the night of the crash waving to a photographer you can then see one of the paps raise his camera in response which if you take into account the evidence of richard tomlinson that paul was being paid by mi6 and that there was an mi6 plant in the pap pack is incredibly suspicious perhaps paul was involved in the plan up to a certain point—not knowing that he was actually driving to his death lord stevens who conducted the official inquiry into the accident in the uk met with pauls parents in 2006 and assured them that their son had not been drunk—that hed only had two drinks that night yet just over a month later the official report was published saying that paul was three times over the drinkdrive limit and that his drunkeness had caused the crash why the sudden change of heart you know theres an old saying just because
