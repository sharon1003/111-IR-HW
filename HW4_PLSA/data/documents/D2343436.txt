maybe later sort noncomparative scale employ whatever rating standard seems appropriate to them do not compare the object being rated either to another object or to some specified standard such as your ideal brand they evaluate only one object at a time and for this reason noncomparative scales are often reffered to as monadic scales consists of continuous and itemized rating scales one of the two types of scaling techniques in which each stimulus object is scaled independently of the other objects in the stimulus set basic noncomparative scales include continuous rating scale likert scale semantic differential and stapel scale itemized rating scales include likert semantic differential and stapel scale continuous scale also referred to as a graphic rating scale this measurement scale has the respondents scale the objects by placing a mark at the appropriate position on a line that runs from one extreme of the criterion variable to the other respondents are not restricted to selecting from markets previously set by the researcher the form of the continuous scale may vary considerably for example the line may be vertical or horizontal scale points in the form of numbers or brief descriptions may be provided and if provided the scale points may be few or many place a mark on a continuous line ex are reaction to tv commercials advantages is that it is easy to construct disadvantage is that scoring can be cumbersome unless computerizeditemized rating scale a measurement scale having numbers andor brief descriptions associated with each other the categories are ordered in terms of scale position categories are ordered in terms of scale position and the respondents are required to select the specified category that best describes the object being rated itemized rating scales are widely used in marketing research and form the basic components of more complex scales such as multiitem rating scales we first describe the commonly used itemized rating scales like likert semantic differenctial and stapel scales and then examine the major issues surrounding the use of these scales likert scale measurement scale with five response categories ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree which requires the respondents to indicate a degree of agreement or disagreement with each of a series of statements related to the stimulus objects example measurement of attitudes advantage is that it is easy to construct administer and understand disadvantage is that it is more time consumingsemantic differential a 7point rating scale with endpoints associated with bipolar labels that have semantic meaning respondents rate objects on a number of itemized 7point rating scales bounded at each end by one or two bipolar adjectives such as cold or warm stapel scale scale for measuring attitudes that consists of a single adjective in the middle of an evennumbered range of values from 5 to 5 without a neutral point zero ex measurement of attitudes and images advantages include easy to construct because its administered over the telephone disadvantages include that its confusing and difficult to applybalanced scale scale with an equal number of favorable and unfavorable categories multiitem scale consists of multiple items where an item is a single question or statement to be evaluated examples include likert semantic differential and staple scales construct specific type of concept that exists at a higher level of abstraction than do everyday concepts such as brand loyalty product involvement attitude satisfaction and so forth measurement error variation in the information sought by the researcher and the information generated by the measurement process employed results in the measurement or observed score being different from the true score of the characteristic being measured true score model mathematical model that provides a framework for understanding the accuracy of measurement x0xtxsxr where xo the observed score or measurement xtthe true score of the characteristic xssystematic error xrrandom error systematic error systematic error that affects the measurement in a constant way and represents stable factors that affect the observed score in the same way each time the measurement is made random error measurement error that arises from random changes or differences in respondents or measurement situations reliability extent to which a scale produces consistent results if repeated measurements are made on the characteristic internal consistency reliability approach for assessing the internal consistency of the set of items when several items are summated in order to form a total score for the scale coefficient alpha measure of internal consistency reliability that is the average of all possible splithalf coefficients resulting from different splittings of the scale items validity the extent to which differences in observed scale scores reflect true differences among objects on the characteristic being measured rather than systematic or random errors content validity a type of validity sometimes called face validity that consists of a subjective but systematic evaluation of the representativeness of the content of a scale for the measuring task at hand construct validity type of validity that addresses the question of what construct or characteristic the scale is measuring an attempt is made to answer theoretical questions of why a scale works and what deductions can be made concerning the theory underlying the scale convergent validity measure of construct validity that measures the extent to which the scale correlates positively with other measures of the same construct discriminant validity type of construct validity that assesses the extent to which a measure does not correlate with other constructs from which it is supposed to differ nomological validity type of validity that assesses the relationship between theoretical constructs it seeks to confirm significant correlations between the constructs by theory generalizability process in testing and statistics theory that takes a score from a sample of behaviors and pplies them to the entire possible set of observations for example generalizability is the process of testing 15 high school senior students on a standardized exam calculating the average of those scores and generalizing that the calculated average applies to all high school senior students with similar demographics questionnaire structured technique for data collection that consists of a series of questions written or verbal that a respondent answers doublebarreled question single question that attempts to cover two issues such questions can be confusing to respondents and result in ambiguous responses filter or screening questions an initial question in a questionnaire that screens potential respondents to ensure they meet the requirements of the sample order or position bias a respondents tendency to check an alternative merely because it occupies a certain position or is listed in a certain order dichotomous question structured question with only two response alternatives such as yes and no leading question a question that gives the respondent a clue as to what answer is desired or leads the respondent to answer in a certain way acquiescence bias yeasaying this bias is the result of some respondents tendency to agree with the direction of a leading question yeasaying implicit alternative an alternative that is not explicitly expressed classification information socioeconomic and demographic characteristics used to classify respondents identification information type of information obtained in a questionnaire that includes name postal address email address and phone number funnel approach strategy for ordering questions in a questionnaire in which the sequence starts with the general questions that are followed by progressively specific questions in order to prevent specific questions from biasing general questions branching or branching questions question used to guide an interviewer through a survey by directing the interviewer to different spots on the questionnaire depending on the answers given precoding in questionnaire design assigning a code to every conceivable response before data collection pretesting the testing of the questionnaire on a small sample of respondents for the purpose of improving the questionnaire by identifying and eliminating potential problems coding assignment of a code to represent a specific response to a specific question along with the data record and column position that code will occupy data cleaning thorough and extensive checks for consistency and treatment of missing responses consistency checks a part of the datacleaning process that identifies data that are out of range logically inconsistent or have extreme values data with values not defined by the coding scheme are inadmissible missing responses values of a variable that are unknown because these respondents did not provide unambiguous answers to the question weighting statistical adjustment to the data in which each case or respondents in the database is assigned a weight to reflect its importance relative to other cases or respondents dummy variables respecification procedure using variables that take on only two values ususally 0 or 1 scale transformation manipulation of scale values to ensure comparability with other scales or otherwise makes the data suitable for analysis univariate techniques statistical techniques appropriate for analyzing data when there is a single measurement of each element in the sample or if there are several measurements on each element but each variable is analyzed in isolation multivariate techniques statistical techniques suitable for analyzing data when there are two or more measurements on each element and the variables are analyzed simultaneously multivariate techniques are concerned with the simultaneous relationships among two ore more phenomena independent the samples are independent if they are drawn randomly from different populations paired the samples are paired when the data for the two samples relate to the same group of respondents population the aggregate of all the elements sharing some common set of characteristics that comprises the universe for the purpose of the marketing research problem census complete enumeration of the elements of a population or study objects sample subgroup of the elements of the population selected for participation in the study element an object that possesses the information sought by the researcher sampling unit the basic unit containing the elements of the population to be sampled sampling frame representation of the elements of the target population it consists of a list or set of directions for identifying the target population sample size the number of elements to be included in a study nonprobability sample sampling techniques that do not use chance selection procedures rather they rely on the personal judgment of the researcher probability sample sampling procedure in which each element of the population has a fixed probabilistic chance of being selected for the sample convenience sample nonprobability sampling technique that attempts to obtain a sample of convenient elements the selection of sampling units is left primarily to the interviewer judgmental sample form of convenience sampling in which the population elements are purposely selected based on the judgment of the researcher quota sample nonprobability sampling technique that is a twostage system restricted judgmental sampling the first stage consists of developing control categories or quotas of population elements in the second stage sample elements are selected based on convenience or judgment snowball sample nonprobability sampling technique in which an initial group of respondents is selected randomly subsequent respondents are selected based on the referrals or information provided by the initial respondents this process may be carried out in waves by obtaining referrals from referrals simple random sample probability sampling technique in which each element in the population has a known and equal probability of selection every element is selected independently of every other element and the sample is drawn by a random procedure from a sampling frame systematic sample probability sampling technique in which the sample is chosen by selecting a random starting point and then picking every ith element in succession from the sampling frame stratified sample probability sampling technique that uses a twostep process to partition the population into sub cluster sample first the target population is divided into mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive subpopulations called clusters then a random sample of clusters is selected based on a probability sampling technique such as simple random sampling for each selected cluster either all the elements are included in the sample or a sample of elements is drawn probabilistically area sample a common form of cluster sampling in which the clusters consist of geographic areas such as counties housing tracts blocks or other area descriptions parameter summary description of a fixed characteristic or measure of the target population a parameter denotes the true value that would be obtained if a census rather than a sample were undertaken statistic summary description of a characteristic or measure of the sample sample statistic is used as an estimate of the population parameter precision level the desired size of the estimating interval the maximum permissible difference between the sample statistic and the population parameter confidence interval the range into which the true population parameter will fall assuming a given level of confidence confidence level the probability that a confidence interval will include the population parameter sampling distribution the distribution of the values of a sample statistic computed for each possible sample that could be drawn from the target population under a specified sampling plan statistical inference process of generalizing the sample results to the population results normal distribution basis for classical statistical inference that is bellshaped and symmetrical in appearance its measures of central tendency are all identical standard error the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean or proportion mean formula and proportion formula z value the number of standard errors a point is away from the mean the z value for a point is the number of standard errors a point is away from the mean or proportion incidence rate the rate of occurrence of persons eligible to participate in the study expressed as a percentage incidence rate determines how many contacts need to be screened for a given sample size requirement completion rate the percentage of qualified respondents who complete the interview it enables researchers to take into account anticipated refusals by people who qualify if researcher expects an interview completion rate of 80 of eligible respondents the number of contacts should be increased by a factor of 125 substitution procedure that substitutes for nonrespondents other elements from the sampling frame that are expected to respond weighting statistical procedure that attempts to account for nonresponse by assigning differential weights to the data depending on the response rates ex in a survey on personal computers the sample was stratified according to income
