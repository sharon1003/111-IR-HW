best on photographs and paintings of realistic scenes with smooth variations of tone and color for web usage where reducing the amount of data used for an image is important for responsive presentation jpegs compression benefits make jpeg popular jpeg exif is also the most common format saved by digital cameras however jpeg is not well suited for line drawings and other textual or iconic graphics where the sharp contrasts between adjacent pixels can cause noticeable artifacts such images are better saved in a lossless graphics format such as tiff gif png or a raw image format the jpeg standard includes a lossless coding mode but that mode is not supported in most products as the typical use of jpeg is a lossy compression method which reduces the image fidelity it is inappropriate for exact reproduction of imaging data such as some scientific and medical imaging applications and certain technical image processing work jpeg is also not well suited to files that will undergo multiple edits as some image quality is lost each time the image is recompressed particularly if the image is cropped or shifted or if encoding parameters are changed – see digital generation loss for details to prevent image information loss during sequential and repetitive editing the first edit can be saved in a lossless format subsequently edited in that format then finally published as jpeg for distribution jpeg compression  editjpeg uses a lossy form of compression based on the discrete cosine transform dct this mathematical operation converts each framefield of the video source from the spatial 2d domain into the frequency domain aka transform domain a perceptual model based loosely on the human psychovisual system discards highfrequency information ie sharp transitions in intensity and color hue in the transform domain the process of reducing information is called quantization in simpler terms quantization is a method for optimally reducing a large number scale with different occurrences of each number into a smaller one and the transformdomain is a convenient representation of the image because the highfrequency coefficients which contribute less to the overall picture than other coefficients are characteristically smallvalues with high compressibility the quantized coefficients are then sequenced and losslessly packed into the output bitstream nearly all software implementations of jpeg permit user control over the compressionratio as well as other optional parameters allowing the user to trade off picturequality for smaller file size in embedded applications such as mini dv which uses a similar dctcompression scheme the parameters are preselected and fixed for the application the compression method is usually lossy meaning that some original image information is lost and cannot be restored possibly affecting image quality there is an optional lossless mode defined in the jpeg standard however this mode is not widely supported in products there is also an interlaced progressive jpeg format in which data is compressed in multiple passes of progressively higher detail this is ideal for large images that will be displayed while downloading over a slow connection allowing a reasonable preview after receiving only a portion of the data however support for progressive jpegs is not universal when progressive jpegs are received by programs that do not support them such as versions of internet explorer before windows 7 15 the software displays the image only after it has been completely downloaded there are also many medical imaging traffic and camera applications that create and process 12bit jpeg images both grayscale and color 12bit jpeg format is included in extended part of the jpeg specification libjpeg codec supports 12bit jpeg and exists high performance version 16lossless editing  editsee also jpegtran a number of alterations to a jpeg image can be performed losslessly that is without recompression and the associated quality loss as long as the image size is a multiple of 1 mcu block minimum coded unit usually 16 pixels in both directions for 420 chroma subsampling  utilities that implement this includejpegtran and its gui jpegcrop irfan view using jpg lossless crop plug in and jpg lossless rotation plug in which require installing the jpgtransform plugin fast stone image viewer using lossless crop to file and jpeg lossless rotate xn view mp using jpeg lossless transformations acdsee supports lossless rotation but not lossless cropping with its force lossless jpeg operations option blocks can be rotated in 90degree increments flipped in the horizontal vertical and diagonal axes and moved about in the image not all blocks from the original image need to be used in the modified one the top and left edge of a jpeg image must lie on an 8 × 8 pixel block boundary but the bottom and right edge need not do so this limits the possible lossless crop operations and also prevents flips and rotations of an image whose bottom or right edge does not lie on a block boundary for all channels because the edge would end up on top or left where – as aforementioned – a block boundary is obligatory rotations where the image is not a multiple of 8 or 16 which value depends upon the chroma subsampling are not lossless rotating such an image causes the blocks to be recomputed which results in loss of quality 17when using lossless cropping if the bottom or right side of the crop region is not on a block boundary then the rest of the data from the partially used blocks will still be present in the cropped file and can be recovered it is also possible to transform between baseline and progressive formats without any loss of quality since the only difference is the order in which the coefficients are placed in the file furthermore several jpeg images can be losslessly joined together as long as they were saved with the same quality and the edges coincide with block boundaries jpeg files  editthe file format known as jpeg interchange format jif is specified in annex b of the standard however this pure file format is rarely used primarily because of the difficulty of programming encoders and decoders that fully implement all aspects of the standard and because of certain shortcomings of the standard color space definition component subsampling registration pixel aspect ratio definition several additional standards have evolved to address these issues the first of these released in 1992 was jpeg file interchange format or jfif followed in recent years by exchangeable image file format exif and icc color profiles both of these formats use the actual jif byte layout consisting of different markers but in addition employ one of the jif standards extension points namely the application markers jfif uses app0 while exif uses app1 within these segments of the file that were left for future use in the jif standard and arent read by it these standards add specific metadata thus in some ways jfif is a cutdown version of the jif standard in that it specifies certain constraints such as not allowing all the different encoding modes while in other ways it is an extension of jif due to the added metadata the documentation for the original jfif standard states 18jpeg file interchange format is a minimal file format which enables jpeg bitstreams to be exchanged between a wide variety of platforms and applications this minimal format does not include any of the advanced features found in the tiff jpeg specification or any application specific file format nor should it for the only purpose of this simplified format is to allow the exchange of jpeg compressed images image files that employ jpeg compression are commonly called jpeg files and are stored in variants of the jif image format most image capture devices such as digital cameras that output jpeg are actually creating files in the exif format the format that the camera industry has standardized on for metadata interchange on the other hand since the exif standard does not allow color profiles most image editing software stores jpeg in jfif format and also include the app1 segment from the exif file to include the metadata in an almostcompliant way the jfif standard is interpreted somewhat flexibly 19strictly speaking the jfif and exif standards are incompatible because each specifies that its marker segment app0 or app1 respectively appear first in practice most jpeg files contain a jfif marker segment that precedes the exif header this allows older readers to correctly handle the older format jfif segment while newer readers also decode the following exif segment being less strict about requiring it to appear first jpeg filename extensions  editthe most common filename extensions for files employing jpeg compression are jpg and jpeg though jpe jfif and jif are also used it is also possible for jpeg data to be embedded in other file types – tiff encoded files often embed a jpeg image as a thumbnail of the main image and mp3 files can contain a jpeg of cover art in the id3v2 tag color profile  editmany jpeg files embed an icc color profile  color space  commonly used color profiles include s rgb and adobe rgb because these color spaces use a nonlinear transformation the dynamic range of an 8bit jpeg file is about 11 stops see gamma curve syntax and structure  edita jpeg image consists of a sequence of segments each beginning with a marker each of which begins with a 0x ff byte followed by a byte indicating what kind of marker it is some markers consist of just those two bytes others are followed by two bytes high then low indicating the length of markerspecific payload data that follows the length includes the two bytes for the length but not the two bytes for the marker some markers are followed by entropycoded data the length of such a marker does not include the entropycoded data note that consecutive 0x ff bytes are used as fill bytes for padding purposes although this fill byte padding should only ever take place for markers immediately following entropycoded scan data see jpeg specification section b112 and e12 for details specifically in all cases where markers are appended after the compressed data optional 0x ff fill bytes may precede the marker within the entropycoded data after any 0x ff byte a 0x00 byte is inserted by the encoder before the next byte so that there does not appear to be a marker where none is intended preventing framing errors decoders must skip this 0x00 byte this technique called byte stuffing see jpeg specification section f123 is only applied to the entropycoded data not to marker payload data note however that entropycoded data has a few markers of its own specifically the reset markers 0x d0 through 0x d7 which are used to isolate independent chunks of entropycoded data to allow parallel decoding and encoders are free to insert these reset markers at regular intervals although not all encoders do this common jpeg markers 20short name bytes payload name comments soi 0x ff 0x d8none start of image sof0 0x ff 0x c0variable size start of frame

recovery after bitstream error such as transmission over an unreliable network or file corruption since the runs of macroblocks between restart markers may be independently decoded these runs may be decoded in parallel jpeg codec example  editalthough a jpeg file can be encoded in various ways most commonly it is done with jfif encoding the encoding process consists of several steps the representation of the colors in the image is converted from rgb to y′c bc r consisting of one luma component y representing brightness and two chroma components c b and c r  representing color this step is sometimes skipped the resolution of the chroma data is reduced usually by a factor of 2 or 3 this reflects the fact that the eye is less sensitive to fine color details than to fine brightness details the image is split into blocks of 8×8 pixels and for each block each of the y c b and c r data undergoes the discrete cosine transform dct a dct is similar to a fourier transform in the sense that it produces a kind of spatial frequency spectrum the amplitudes of the frequency components are quantized human vision is much more sensitive to small variations in color or brightness over large areas than to the strength of highfrequency brightness variations therefore the magnitudes of the highfrequency components are stored with a lower accuracy than the lowfrequency components the quality setting of the encoder for example 50 or 95 on a scale of 0–100 in the independent jpeg groups library 21 affects to what extent the resolution of each frequency component is reduced if an excessively low quality setting is used the highfrequency components are discarded altogether the resulting data for all 8×8 blocks is further compressed with a lossless algorithm a variant of huffman encoding the decoding process reverses these steps except the quantization because it is irreversible in the remainder of this section the encoding and decoding processes are described in more detail encoding  editmany of the options in the jpeg standard are not commonly used and as mentioned above most image software uses the simpler jfif format when creating a jpeg file which among other things specifies the encoding method here is a brief description of one of the more common methods of encoding when applied to an input that has 24 bits per pixel eight each of red green and blue  this particular option is a lossy data compression method color space transformation  editfirst the image should be converted from rgb into a different color space called y′c bc r or informally ycb cr it has three components y c b and c r the y component represents the brightness of a pixel and the c b and c r components represent the chrominance split into blue and red components this is basically the same color space as used by digital color television as well as digital video including video dvds and is similar to the way color is represented in analog pal video and mac but not by analog ntsc which uses the yiq color space the y′c b c r color space conversion allows greater compression without a significant effect on perceptual image quality or greater perceptual image quality for the same compression the compression is more efficient because the brightness information which is more important to the eventual perceptual quality of the image is confined to a single channel this more closely corresponds to the perception of color in the human visual system the color transformation also improves compression by statistical decorrelation a particular conversion to y′c b c r is specified in the jfif standard and should be performed for the resulting jpeg file to have maximum compatibility however some jpeg implementations in highest quality mode do not apply this step and instead keep the color information in the rgb color model  citation needed where the image is stored in separate channels for red green and blue brightness components this results in less efficient compression and would not likely be used when file size is especially important downsampling  editdue to the densities of color and brightnesssensitive receptors in the human eye humans can see considerably more fine detail in the brightness of an image the y component than in the hue and color saturation of an image the cb and cr components using this knowledge encoders can be designed to compress images more efficiently the transformation into the y′c bc rcolor model enables the next usual step which is to reduce the spatial resolution of the cb and cr components called  downsampling  or  chroma subsampling  the ratios at which the downsampling is ordinarily done for jpeg images are 444 no downsampling 422 reduction by a factor of 2 in the horizontal direction or most commonly 420 reduction by a factor of 2 in both the horizontal and vertical directions for the rest of the compression process y cb and cr are processed separately and in a very similar manner block splitting  editafter subsampling each channel must be split into 8×8 blocks depending on chroma subsampling this yields minimum coded unit mcu blocks of size 8×8 444 – no subsampling 16×8 422 or most commonly 16×16 420 in video compression mcus are called macroblocks if the data for a channel does not represent an integer number of blocks then the encoder must fill the remaining area of the incomplete blocks with some form of dummy data filling the edges with a fixed color for example black can create ringing artifacts along the visible part of the border repeating the edge pixels is a common technique that reduces but does not necessarily completely eliminate such artifacts and more sophisticated border filling techniques can also be applied discrete cosine transform  editthe 8×8 subimage shown in 8bit grayscale next each 8×8 block of each component y cb cr is converted to a frequencydomain representation using a normalized twodimensional typeii discrete cosine transform dct see citation 1 in discrete cosine transform the dct is sometimes referred to as typeii dct in the context of a family of transforms as in discrete cosine transform and the corresponding inverse idct is denoted as typeiii dct as an example one such 8×8 8bit subimage might be  52 55 61 66 70 61 64 7363 59 55 90 109 85 69 7262 59 68 113 144 104 66 7363 58 71 122 154 106 70 6967 61 68 104 126 88 68 7079

entry in the original block falls in the range the midpoint of the range in this case the value 128 is subtracted from each entry to produce a data range that is centered on zero so that the modified range is this step reduces the dynamic range requirements in the dct processing stage that follows aside from the difference in dynamic range within the dct stage this step is mathematically equivalent to subtracting 2048 from the dc coefficient after performing the transform – which may be a better way to perform the operation on some architectures since it involves performing only one subtraction rather than 64 of them  citation neededthis step results in the following valuesx  76 73 67 62 58 67 64 5565 69 73 38 19 43 59 5666 69 60 15 16 24 62 5565 70 57 6 26 22 58 5961 67 60 24 2

constant component which defines the basic hue for the entire block the remaining 63 coefficients are the ac coefficients also called the alternating components 22 the advantage of the dct is its tendency to aggregate most of the signal in one corner of the result as may be seen above the quantization step to follow accentuates this effect while simultaneously reducing the overall size of the dct coefficients resulting in a signal that is easy to compress efficiently in the entropy stage the dct temporarily increases the bitdepth of the data since the dct coefficients of an 8bitcomponent image take up to 11 or more bits depending on fidelity of the dct calculation to store this may force the codec to temporarily use 16bit numbers to hold these coefficients doubling the size of the image representation at this point these values are typically reduced back to 8bit values by the quantization step the temporary increase in size at this stage is not a performance concern for most jpeg implementations since typically only a very small part of the image is stored in full dct form at any given time during the image encoding or decoding process quantization  editthe human eye is good at seeing small differences in brightness over a relatively large area but not so good at distinguishing the exact strength of a high frequency brightness variation this allows one to greatly reduce the amount of information in the high frequency components this is done by simply dividing each component in the frequency domain by a constant for that component and then rounding to the nearest integer this rounding operation is the only lossy operation in the whole process other than chroma subsampling if the dct computation is performed with sufficiently high precision as a result of this it is typically the case that many of the higher frequency components are rounded to zero and many of the rest become small positive or negative numbers which take many fewer bits to represent the elements in the quantization matrix control the compression ratio with larger values producing greater compression a typical quantization matrix for a quality of 50 as specified in the original jpeg standard is as follows  16 11 10 16 24 40 51 6112 12 14 19 26 58 60 5514 13 16 24 40 57 69 5614 17 22 29 51 87 80 6218 22 37 56 68 109 103 7724 35 55 64 81 104 113 9249 64 78 87 103 121 120 10172

coefficient and rounding to the nearest integer notice that most of the higherfrequency elements of the subblock ie those with an x or y spatial frequency greater than 4 are compressed into zero values entropy coding  editmain article entropy encoding zigzag ordering of jpeg image components entropy coding is a special form of lossless data compression it involves arranging the image components in a  zigzag  order employing runlength encoding rle algorithm that groups similar frequencies together inserting length coding zeros and then using huffman coding on what is left the jpeg standard also allows but does not require decoders to support the use of arithmetic coding which is mathematically superior to huffman coding however this feature has rarely been used as it was historically covered by patents requiring royaltybearing licenses and because it is slower to encode and decode compared to huffman coding arithmetic coding typically makes files about 5–7 smaller the previous quantized dc coefficient is used to predict the current quantized dc coefficient the difference between the two is encoded rather than the actual value the encoding of the 63 quantized ac coefficients does not use such prediction differencing the zigzag sequence for the above quantized coefficients are shown below the format shown is just for ease of understandingviewing −26−3 0−3 −2

where and then any coefficient in the dct image can be represented as thus in the above scheme the order of encoding pixels for the i th block is and so on baseline sequential jpeg encoding and decoding processes this encoding mode is called baseline sequential encoding baseline jpeg also supports progressive encoding while sequential encoding encodes coefficients of a single block at a time in a zigzag manner progressive encoding encodes similarpositioned batch of coefficients of all blocks in one go called a scan  followed by the next batch of coefficients of all blocks and so on for example if the image is divided into n 8×8 blocks then a 3scan progressive encoding encodes dc component for all blocks ie for all in first scan this is followed by the second scan which encoding a few more components assuming four more components they are to still in a zigzag manner coefficients of all blocks so the sequence is  followed by all the remained coefficients of all blocks in the last scan once all similarpositioned coefficients have been encoded the next position to be encoded is the one occurring next in the zigzag traversal as indicated in the figure above it has been found that baseline progressive jpeg encoding usually gives better compression as compared to baseline sequential jpeg due to the ability to use different huffman tables see below tailored for different frequencies on each scan or pass which includes similarpositioned coefficients though the difference is not too large in the rest of the article it is assumed that the coefficient pattern generated is due to sequential mode in order to encode the above generated coefficient pattern jpeg uses huffman encoding the jpeg standard provides generalpurpose huffman tables encoders may also choose to generate huffman tables optimized for the actual frequency distributions in images being encoded the process of encoding the zigzag quantized data begins with a runlength encoding explained below wherex is the nonzero quantized ac coefficient runlength is the number of zeroes that came before this nonzero ac coefficient size is the number of bits required to represent x amplitude is the bitrepresentation of x the runlength encoding works by examining each nonzero ac coefficient x and determining how many zeroes came before the previous ac coefficient with this information two symbols are created symbol 1 symbol 2 runlength size amplitudeboth runlength and size rest on the same byte meaning that each only contains four bits of information the higher bits deal with the number of zeroes while the lower bits denote the number of bits necessary to encode the value of x this has the immediate implication of symbol 1 being only able store information regarding the first 15 zeroes preceding the nonzero ac coefficient however jpeg defines two special huffman code words one is for ending the sequence prematurely when the remaining coefficients are zero called endofblock or eob and another when the run of zeroes goes beyond 15 before reaching a nonzero ac coefficient in such a case where 16 zeroes are encountered before a given nonzero ac coefficient symbol 1 is encoded specially as 15 0 0 the overall process continues until eob – denoted by 0 0 – is reached with this in mind the sequence from earlier becomes 0 2 3 1 2 3 0 1 2 0 2 6 0 1 2 0 1 4 0 1 1 0 2 3 0 1 1 0 1

based on occurrences of the coefficients in our example block most of the quantized coefficients are small numbers that are not preceded immediately by a zero coefficient these morefrequent cases will be represented by shorter code words compression ratio and artifacts  editthis image shows the pixels that are different between a noncompressed image and the same image jpeg compressed with a quality setting of 50 darker means a larger difference note especially the changes occurring near sharp edges and having a blocklike shape the original image the compressed 8×8 squares are visible in the scaledup picture together with other visual artifacts of the lossy compression the resulting compression ratio can be varied according to need by being more or less aggressive in the divisors used in the quantization phase ten to one compression usually results in an image that cannot be distinguished by eye from the original a compression ratio of 1001 is usually possible but will look distinctly artifacted compared to the original the appropriate level of compression depends on the use to which the image will be put external image illustration of edge busyness 23those who use the world wide web may be familiar with the irregularities known as compression artifacts that appear in jpeg images which may take the form of noise around contrasting edges especially curves and corners or blocky images these are due to the quantization step of the jpeg algorithm they are especially noticeable around sharp corners between contrasting colors text is a good example as it contains many such corners the analogous artifacts in mpeg video are referred to as mosquito noise as the resulting edge busyness and spurious dots which change over time resemble mosquitoes swarming around the object 23 24these artifacts can be reduced by choosing a lower level of compression they may be completely avoided by saving an image using a lossless file format though this will result in a larger file size the images created with raytracing programs have noticeable blocky shapes on the terrain certain lowintensity compression artifacts might be acceptable when simply viewing the images but can be emphasized if the image is subsequently processed usually resulting in unacceptable quality consider the example below demonstrating the effect of lossy compression on an edge detection processing step image lossless compression lossy compression original processed by canny edge detector some programs allow the user to vary the amount by which individual blocks are compressed stronger compression is applied to areas of the image that show fewer artifacts this way it is possible to manually reduce jpeg file size with less loss of quality since the quantization stage always results in a loss of information jpeg standard is always a lossy compression codec information is lost both in quantizing and rounding of the floatingpoint numbers even if the quantization matrix is a matrix of ones information will still be lost in the rounding step decoding  editdecoding to display the image consists of doing all the above in reverse taking the dct coefficient matrix after adding the difference of the dc coefficient back in  26 3 6 2 2 1 0 00 2 4 1 1 0 0 03 1 5 1 1 0 0 03 1 2 1 0 0 0 01 0 0 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 0 0 0and taking the entryforentry product with the quantization matrix from above results in  416 33 60 32 48 40 0 00 24 56 19 26 0 0 042 13 80 24 40 0 0 042 17 44 29 0 0 0 018 0 0 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 0 0 0which closely resembles the original dct coefficient matrix for the topleft portion the next step is to take the twodimensional inverse dct a 2d typeiii dct which is given bywhereis the pixel row for the integersis the pixel column for the integersis defined as above for the integersis the reconstructed approximate coefficient at coordinatesis the reconstructed pixel value at coordinates rounding the output to integer values since the original had integer values results in an image with values still shifted down by 128slight differences are noticeable between the original top and decompressed image bottom which is most readily seen in the bottomleft corner  66 63 71 68 56 65 68 4671 73 72 46 20 41 66 5770 78 68 17 20 14 61 6363 73 62 8 27 14 60 5858 65 61 27 6 40 68 5057 57 64 58 48 66 72

this occurs the decoder needs to clip the output values keep them within that range to prevent overflow when storing the decompressed image with the original bit depth the decompressed subimage can be compared to the original subimage also see images to the right by taking the difference original − uncompressed results in the following error values  10 10 4 6 2 2 4 96 4 1 8 1 2 7 14 9 8 2 4 10 1 82

the bottomleft pixel becomes darker than the pixel to its immediate right required precision  editthe encoding description in the jpeg standard does not fix the precision needed for the output compressed image however the jpeg standard and the similar mpeg standards includes some precision requirements for the de coding including all parts of the decoding process variable length decoding inverse dct dequantization renormalization of outputs the output from the reference algorithm must not exceeda maximum of one bit of difference for each pixel componentlow mean square error over each 8×8pixel blockvery low mean error over each 8×8pixel blockvery low mean square error over the whole imageextremely low mean error over the whole image these assertions are tested on a large set of randomized input images to handle the worst cases the former ieee 1180–1990 standard contained some similar precision requirements the precision has a consequence on the implementation of decoders and it is critical because some encoding processes notably used for encoding sequences of images like mpeg need to be able to construct on the encoder side a reference decoded image in order to support 8bit precision per pixel component output dequantization and inverse dct transforms are typically implemented with at least 14bit precision in optimized decoders effects of jpeg compression  editjpeg compression artifacts blend well into photographs with detailed nonuniform textures allowing higher compression ratios notice how a higher compression ratio first affects the highfrequency textures in the upperleft corner of the image and how the contrasting lines become more fuzzy the very high compression ratio severely affects the quality of the image although the overall colors and image form are still recognizable however the precision of colors suffer less for a human eye than the precision of contours based on luminance this justifies the fact that images should be first transformed in a color model separating the luminance from the chromatic information before subsampling the chromatic planes which may also use lower quality quantization in order to preserve the precision of the luminance plane with more information bits sample photographs  editfor information the uncompressed 24bit rgb bitmap image below 73242 pixels would require 219726 bytes excluding all other information headers the filesizes indicated below include the internal jpeg information headers and some metadata for highest quality images q100 about 825 bits per color pixel is required on grayscale images a minimum of 65 bits per pixel is enough a comparable q100 quality color information requires about 25 more encoded bits the highest quality image below q100 is encoded at nine bits per color pixel the medium quality image q25 uses one bit per color pixel for most applications the quality factor should not go below 075 bit per pixel q125 as demonstrated by the low quality image the image at lowest quality uses only 013 bit per pixel and displays very poor color this is useful when the image will be displayed in a significantly scaleddown size a method for creating better quantization matrices for a given image quality using psnr instead of the q factor is described in minguillón  pujol 2001 25note the above images are not ieee  ccir  ebu test images and the encoder settings are not

uncompressed image but has little noticeable loss of detail or visible artifacts however once a certain threshold of compression is passed compressed images show increasingly visible defects see the article on rate–distortion theory for a mathematical explanation of this threshold effect a particular limitation of jpeg in this regard is its nonoverlapped 8×8 block transform structure more modern designs such as jpeg 2000 and jpeg xr exhibit a more graceful degradation of quality as the bit usage decreases – by using transforms with a larger spatial extent for the lower frequency coefficients and by using overlapping transform basis functions lossless further compression  editfrom 2004 to 2008 new research emerged on ways to further compress the data contained in jpeg images without modifying the represented image 26 27 28 29 this has applications in scenarios where the original image is only available in jpeg format and its size needs to be reduced for archiving or transmission standard generalpurpose compression tools cannot significantly compress jpeg files typically such schemes take advantage of improvements to the naive scheme for coding dct coefficients which fails to take into account correlations between magnitudes of adjacent coefficients in the same blockcorrelations between magnitudes of the same coefficient in adjacent blockscorrelations between magnitudes of the same coefficientblock in different channelsthe dc coefficients when taken together resemble a downscale version of the original image multiplied by a scaling factor wellknown schemes for lossless coding of continuoustone images can be applied achieving somewhat better compression than the huffman coded dpcm used in jpeg some standard but rarely used options already exist in jpeg to improve the efficiency of coding dct coefficients the arithmetic coding option and the progressive coding option which produces lower bitrates because values for each coefficient are coded independently and each coefficient has a significantly different distribution modern methods have improved on these techniques by reordering coefficients to group coefficients of larger magnitude together 26 using adjacent coefficients and blocks to predict new coefficient values 28 dividing blocks or coefficients up among a small number of independently coded models based on their statistics and adjacent values 27 28 and most recently by decoding blocks predicting subsequent blocks in the spatial domain and then encoding these to generate predictions for dct coefficients 29typically such methods can compress existing jpeg files between 15 and 25 percent and for jpegs compressed at lowquality settings can produce improvements of up to 65 28 29a freely available tool called pack jpg 30 is based on the 2007 paper improved redundancy reduction for jpeg files derived formats for stereoscopic 3d  editjpeg stereoscopic  editan example of a stereoscopic  jps file jps is a stereoscopic jpeg image used for creating 3d effects from 2d images it contains two static images one for the left eye and one for the right eye encoded as two sidebyside images in a single jpg file jpeg stereoscopic jps extension jps is a jpegbased format for stereoscopic images 31 32 it has a range of configurations stored in the jpeg app3 marker field but usually contains one image of double width representing two images of identical size in crosseyed ie left frame on the right half of the image and vice versa sidebyside arrangement this file format can be viewed as a jpeg without any special software or can be processed for rendering in other modes jpeg multipicture format  editjpeg multipicture format mpo extension mpo is a jpegbased format for storing multiple images in a single file it contains two or more jpeg

avchdmvc extension camcorder nintendo 3ds panasonic lumix dmctz20 dmctz30 dmctz60 dmcts4 ft4 and sony dschx7v other devices use it to store preview images that can be displayed on a tv in the last few years due to the growing use of stereoscopic images much effort has been spent by the scientific community to develop algorithms for stereoscopic image compression 35 36patent issues  editin 2002 forgent networks asserted that it owned and would enforce patent rights on the jpeg technology arising from a patent that had been filed on october 27 1986 and granted on october 6 1987  u s patent 4698672  the announcement created a furor reminiscent of unisys  attempts to assert its rights over the gif image compression standard the jpeg committee investigated the patent claims in 2002 and were of the opinion that they were invalidated by prior art 37 others also concluded that forgent did not have a patent that covered jpeg 38 nevertheless between 2002 and 2004 forgent was able to obtain about us105 million by licensing their patent to some 30 companies in april 2004 forgent sued 31 other companies to enforce further license payments in july of the same year a consortium of 21 large computer companies filed a countersuit with the goal of invalidating the patent in addition microsoft launched a separate lawsuit against forgent in april 2005 39 in february 2006 the united states patent and trademark office agreed to reexamine forgents jpeg patent at the request of the public patent foundation 40 on may 26 2006 the uspto found the patent invalid based on prior art the uspto also found that forgent knew about the prior art yet it intentionally avoided telling the patent office this makes any appeal to reinstate the patent highly unlikely to succeed 41forgent also possesses a similar patent granted by the european patent office in 1994 though it is unclear how enforceable it is 42as of october 27 2006 the u s patents 20year term appears to have expired and in november 2006 forgent agreed to abandon enforcement of patent claims against use of the jpeg standard 43the jpeg committee has as one of its explicit goals that their standards in particular their baseline methods be implementable without payment of license fees and they have secured appropriate license rights for their jpeg 2000 standard from over 20 large organizations beginning in august 2007 another company global patent holdings llc claimed that its patent  u s patent 5253341 issued in 1993 is infringed by the downloading of jpeg images on either a website or through email if not invalidated this patent could apply to any website that displays jpeg images the patent emerged  clarification needed in july 2007 following a sevenyear reexamination by the u s patent and trademark office in which all of the original claims of the patent were revoked but an additional claim claim 17 was confirmed 44in its first two lawsuits following the reexamination both filed in chicago illinois global patent holdings sued the green bay packers cdw motorola apple orbitz officemax caterpillar kraft and peapod as defendants a third lawsuit was filed on december 5 2007 in south florida against adt security services auto nation florida crystals corp hear usa movie ticketscom ocwen financial corp and tire kingdom and a fourth lawsuit on january 8 2008 in south florida against the boca raton resort  club a fifth lawsuit was filed against global patent holdings in nevada that lawsuit was filed by zapposcom inc which was allegedly threatened by global patent holdings and seeks a judicial declaration that the 341 patent is invalid and not infringed global patent holdings had also used the 341 patent to sue or threaten outspoken critics of broad software patents including gregory aharonian 45 and the anonymous operator of a website blog known as the patent troll tracker 46 on december 21 2007 patent lawyer vernon francissen of chicago asked the u s patent and trademark office to reexamine the sole remaining claim of the 341 patent on the basis of new prior art 47on march 5 2008 the u s patent and trademark office agreed to reexamine the 341 patent finding that the new prior art raised substantial new questions regarding the patents validity 48 in light of the reexamination the accused infringers in four of the five pending lawsuits have filed motions to suspend stay their cases until completion of the u s patent and trademark offices review of the 341 patent on april 23 2008 a judge presiding over the two lawsuits in chicago illinois granted the motions in those cases 49 on july 22 2008 the patent office issued the first office action of the second reexamination finding the claim invalid based on nineteen separate grounds 50 on nov 24 2009 a reexamination certificate was issued cancelling all claims beginning in 2011 and continuing as of early 2013 an entity known as princeton digital image corporation 51 based in eastern texas began suing large numbers of companies for alleged infringement of u s patent 4813056 princeton claims that the jpeg image compression standard infringes the 056 patent and has sued large numbers of websites retailers camera and device manufacturers and resellers the patent was originally owned and assigned to general electric the patent expired in december 2007 but princeton has sued large numbers of companies for past infringement of this patent under u s patent laws a patent owner can sue for past infringement up to six years before the filing of a lawsuit so princeton could theoretically have continued suing companies until december 2013 as of march 2013 princeton had suits pending in new york and delaware against more than 55 companies general electrics involvement in the suit is unknown although court records indicate that it assigned the patent to princeton in 2009 and retains certain rights in the patent 52implementations  edita very important implementation of
