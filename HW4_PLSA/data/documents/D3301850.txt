9k38 missile launcher called djigit 2contents  showhistory edit the development of the igla shortrange manportable air defense system  manpads began in the kolomna okb in 1972 contrary to what is commonly reported the igla is not an improved version of the earlier strela family  strela2sa7 and strela3sa14  but an all new project the main goals were to create a missile with better resistance to countermeasures and wider engagement envelope than the earlier strela series manpads systems technical difficulties in the development quickly made it obvious that the development would take far longer than anticipated however and in 1978 the program split in two while the development of the fullcapability igla would continue a simplified version igla1 with a simpler ir seeker based on that of the earlier strela3sa14 would be developed to enter service earlier than the fullcapability version could be finished igla1 edit the 9k310 igla1 system and its 9m313 missile were accepted into service in the soviet army on 11 march 1981 the main differences from the strela3 included an optional identification friend or foe system to prevent firing on friendly aircraft an automatic lead and super elevation to simplify shooting and reduce minimum firing range a slightly larger rocket reduced drag and better guidance system extend maximum range and improve performance against fast and maneuverable targets an improved lethality on target achieved by a combination of delayed impact fuzing terminal maneuver to hit the fuselage rather than jet nozzle an additional charge to set off the remaining rocket fuel if any on impact an improved resistance to infrared countermeasures both decoy flares and alq144 series jamming emitters and slightly improved seeker sensitivity according to the manufacturer south african tests have shown  citation needed the iglas superiority over the contemporary 1982 service entry but smaller and lighter american fim92a stinger missile however other tests in croatia did not support  citation needed any clear superiority but effectively equal seeker performance and only marginally shorter time of flight and longer range for the igla according to kolomna okb  citation needed the igla1 has a p k  probability of kill of 030 to 048 against unprotected targets which is reduced to 024 in the presence of decoy flares and jamming in another report the manufacturer claimed  citation needed a p k of 059 against an approaching and 044 against receding f4 phantom ii fighter not employing infrared countermeasures or evasive maneuvers igla edit the fullcapability 9k38 igla with its 9m39 missile was finally accepted into service in the soviet army in 1983 the main improvements over the igla1 included much improved resistance against flares and jamming a more sensitive seeker expanding forwardhemisphere engagement capability to include straightapproaching fighters  allaspect capability under favourable circumstances a slightly longer range a higherimpulse shorterburning rocket with higher peak velocity but approximately same time of flight to maximum range and a propellant that performs as high explosive when detonated by the warheads

intelligence company stratfor asserts that sa16 missiles were used in the 1994 shoot down of a rwandan government flight killing the presidents of rwanda and burundi and sparking the rwandan genocide which resulted in approximately 800000 deaths in 100 days 6 one source claims france may have supplied the missiles from captured iraqi stocks of the 1991 war 7cenepa war edit during the cenepa war between ecuador and peru both the ecuadorian army and the peruvian army which had 90 functioning firing units utilized sa16 missiles against aircraft and helicopters a peruvian air force mi25 attack

attack on air force one the american presidential plane or on a commercial us airliner and is understood to have planned to buy 50 more of these weapons after the federalnaya sluzhba bezopasnosti fsb detected the dealer in russia he was approached by us undercover agents posing as terrorists wanting to shoot down a commercial plane he was then provided with an inert igla by undercover russian agents and arrested in newark new jersey when making the delivery to the undercover us agent an indian citizen residing in malaysia moinuddeen ahmed hameed and an american yehuda abraham who allegedly provided money to buy the missile were also arrested 14 yehuda abraham is president and ceo of ambuy gem corp 15 16 17 lakhani was convicted by jury in april 2005 and was sentenced to 47 years in
