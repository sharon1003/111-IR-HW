the formation of precipitation shortanswer questions what causes clouds a cloud is defined as ‘a visible aggregate of minute droplets of water or particles of ice or a mixture of both floating in the free air’ each droplet has a diameter of about a hundredth of a millimetre and each cubic metre of air will contain 100 million droplets because the droplets are so small they can remain in liquid form in temperatures of 30 °c if so they are called supercooled droplets clouds at higher and extremely cold levels in the atmosphere are composed of ice crystals – these can be about a tenth of a millimetre long clouds form when the invisible water vapour in the air condenses into visible water droplets or ice crystals for this to happen the parcel of air must be saturated ie unable to hold all the water it contains in vapour form so it starts to condense into a liquid or solid form there are two ways by which saturation is reached a by increasing the water content in the air eg through evaporation to a point where the air can hold no more b by cooling the air so that it reaches its dew point – this is the temperature at which condensation occurs and is unable to ‘hold’ any more water figure 1 shows how there is a maximum amount of water vapour the air at a given temperature can hold in general the warmer the air the more water vapour it can hold therefore reducing its temperature decreases its ability to hold water vapour so that condensation occurs fig 1 there is a maximum amount of water vapour the air at a given temperature can hold method b is the usual way that clouds are produced and it is associated with air rising in the lower part of the atmosphere as the air rises it expands due to lower atmospheric pressure and the energy used in expansion causes the air to cool generally speaking for each 100 metres which the air rises it will cool by 1 °c as shown in figure 2 the rate of cooling will vary depending on the water content or humidity of the air moist parcels of air may cool more slowly at a rate of 05 °c per 100 metres fig 2 for each 100 metres which the air rises it will cool by 1 °ctherefore the vertical ascent of air will reduce its ability to hold water vapour so that condensation occurs the height at which dew point is reached and clouds form is called the condensation level there are five factors which can lead to air rising and cooling1 surface heating the ground is heated by the sun which heats the air in contact with it causing it to rise the rising columns are often called thermals2 topography air forced to rise over a barrier of mountains or hills this is known as orographic uplift3 frontal a mass of warm air rising up over a mass of cold dense air the boundary is called a ‘front’4 convergence streams of air flowing from different directions are forced to rise where they meet5 turbulence a sudden change in wind speed with height creating turbulent eddies in the air another important factor to consider is that water vapour needs something to condense onto floating in the air are millions of minute salt dust and smoke particles known as condensation nuclei which enable condensation to take place when the air is just saturated types of clouds in 1803 a retail chemist and amateur meteorologist called luke howard proposed a system which has subsequently become the basis of the present international classification howard also become known by some people as ‘the father of british meteorology’ and his pioneering work stemmed from his curiosity into the vivid sunsets in the late 18th century following a series of violent volcanic eruptions they had ejected dust high up into the atmosphere thereby increasing the amount of condensation nuclei and producing spectacular cloud formations and sunsets howard recognised four types of cloud and gave them the following latin names cumulus heaped or in a pile stratus in a sheet or layer cirrus threadlike hairy or curled nimbus a rain bearer if we include another latin word altum meaning height the names of the 10 main cloud types are all derived from these five words and based upon their appearance from ground level and visual characteristics the cloud types are split into three groups according to the height of their base above mean sea level note that ‘medium’ level clouds are prefixed by the word alto and ‘high’ clouds by the word cirro see table 1 all heights given are approximate above sea level in midlatitudes if observing from a hill top or mountain site the range of bases will accordingly be lower table 1 the

cumulus may appear quite ragged especially in strong winds but well formed clouds have flattened bases and sharp outlines large cumulus clouds have a distinctive ‘cauliflower’ shape other features well developed cumulus may produce showers fig 3 cumulus photo © r k pilsbury cumulonimbus cbheight of base 10005000 ft colour white upper parts with dark threatening undersides shape a cumulustype cloud of considerable vertical extent when the top of a cumulus reaches great heights the water droplets are transformed into ice crystals and it loses its clear sharp outline at this stage the cloud has become a cumulonimbus often the fibrous cloud top spreads out into a distinctive wedge or anvil shape other features accompanied by heavy showers perhaps with hail and thunder by convention cb is usually reported if hail or thunder occur even if the observer does not immediately recognise the cloud as cb it may be embedded within layers of other cloud types fig 4 cumulonimbus photo © r k pilsbury stratus stheight of base surface1500 ft colour usually grey shape may appear as a layer with a fairly uniform base or in ragged patches especially during precipitation falling from a cloud layer above fog will often lift into a layer of stratus due to an increase in wind or rise in temperature as the sun heats the ground the base of stratus cloud may rise and break becoming shallow cumulus cloud as its edges take on a more distinctive form other features if thin the disc of the sun or moon will be visible providing there are no other cloud layers above if thick it may produce drizzle or snow grains fig 5 stratus photo © c s broomfield stratocumulus scheight of base 12007000 ft colour grey or white generally with shading shape either patches or a sheet of rounded elements but may also appear as an undulating layer when viewed from the ground the size of individual elements will have an apparent width of more than 5° when at an elevation greater than 30° the width of three fingers at arm’s length other features may produce light rain or snow sometimes the cloud may result from the spreading out of cumulus giving a light shower fig 6 stratocumulus photo © j f p galvin medium clouds altocumulus acheight of base 700017000 ft colour grey or white generally with some shading shape several different types the most common being either patches or a sheet of rounded

width of one to three fingers at arm’s length even if the elements appear smaller than this the cloud is still classified altocumulus if it shows shading other features occasionally some slight rain or snow perhaps in the form of a shower may reach the ground on rare occasions a thunderstorm may occur from one type of ac known as altocumulus castellanus – so called because in outline the cloud tops look like a series of turrets and towers along a castle wall fig 7 altocumulus photo © c s broomfield altostratus asheight of base 800017000 ft colour greyish or bluish shape a sheet of uniform

other features sometimes its appearance in a regular pattern of ‘waves’ and small gaps may resemble the scales of a fish thus giving rise to the popular name ‘mackerel sky’ this name may also be attributed to high altocumulus clouds fig 11 cirrocumulus photo © r k pilsbury cirrostratus csheight of base 1700035000 ft colour composed of ice crystals therefore white shape a transparent veil of

frequent being the small 22° halo around the sun or moon ≬ a little more than the distance between the top of the thumb and the little finger spread wide apart at arm’s length fig 12 cirrostratus photo © r k pilsbury condensation trails contrailsthese are thin trails of condensation formed by the water vapour rushing out from the engines of jet aircraft flying at high altitudes they are not true clouds but can remain in the sky for a long time and grow into cirrus clouds fig 13 cirrus with contrails photo © s d burt what influences the colour of clouds light from both the sky and from clouds is sunlight which has been scattered in the case of the sky the molecules of air nitrogen and oxygen undertake the scattering but the molecules are so small that the blue part of the spectrum is scattered more strongly than other colours the water droplets in the cloud are much larger and these larger particles scatter all of the colours of the spectrum by about the same amount so white light from the sun emerges from the clouds still white sometimes clouds have a yellowish or brownish tinge – this is a sign of air pollution why do clouds stop growing upwards condensation involves the release of latent heat this is the ‘invisible’ heat which a water droplet ‘stores’ when it changes from a liquid into a vapour its subsequent change of form again releases enough latent heat to make the damp parcel of air warmer than the air surrounding it this allows the parcel of air to rise until all of the ‘surplus’ water vapour has condensed and all the latent heat has been released therefore the main reason which stops clouds growing upwards is the end of the release of latent heat through the condensation process there are two other factors which also play a role faster upper atmospheric winds can plane off the tops of tall clouds whilst in very high clouds the cloud might cross the tropopause and enter the stratosphere where temperatures rise rather than decrease with altitude this thermal change will prevent further condensation why are there no clouds on some days even when it is very warm and sunny there might not be any clouds and the sky is a clear blue the usual reason for the absence of clouds will be the type of pressure with the area being under the influence of a high pressure or anticyclone air would be sinking slowly rather than rising and cooling as the air sinks into the lower part of the atmosphere the pressure rises it becomes compressed and warms up so that no condensation takes place in simple terms there are no mechanisms for clouds to form under these pressure conditions measuring clouds the cloud amount is defined as ‘the proportion of the celestial dome which is covered by cloud’ the scale used is eighths or oktas with observers standing in an open space or on a rooftop to get a good view or panorama of the sky complete cloud cover is reported as 8 oktas half cover as 4 oktas and a completely clear sky as zero oktas if there is lowlying mist or fog the observer will report sky obscured the reporter will also report the amount of each cloud level – 2 oktas of cumulus and 3 oktas of cirrus etc the frequent passage of depressions across the united kingdom means that the most commonly reported cloud amount is not surprisingly 8 oktas a clear blue sky ie zero oktas is less common as often on hot sunny days there are small wispy layers of cirrostratus or fine tufts of thin cirrus at high altitudes the formation of precipitation cooling condensation and cloud formation is the start of the process which results in precipitation but not all clouds will produce raindrops or snowflakes – many are so shortlived and small that there are no opportunities for precipitation mechanisms to start there are two theories that explain how minute cloud droplets develop into precipitation101 the bergeron findeisen icecrystal mechanism if parcels of air are uplifted to a sufficient height in the troposphere the dewpoint temperature will be very low and minute ice crystals will start to form the supercooled water droplets will also freeze on contact with these ice nuclei the ice crystals subsequently combine to form larger flakes which attract more supercooled droplets this process continues until the flakes fall back towards the ground as they fall through the warmer layers of air the ice particles melt to form raindrops however some ice pellets or snowflakes might be carried down to ground level by cold downdraughts102 longmuir’s collision and coalescence theory this applies to ‘warm’ clouds ie those without large numbers of ice crystals instead they contain water droplets of many differing sizes which are swept upwards at different velocities so that they collide and combine with other droplets it is thought that when the droplets have a radius of 3 mm their movement causes them to splinter and disintegrate forming a fresh supply of water droplets this theory allows droplets of varying sizes to be produced and as shown in the table below each will have a different terminal or falling velocity particle radius mm terminal velocity mscloud 00010005001050000100025001025drizzle 010250720rain

particles into clouds that act as condensation or freezing nuclei this cloud seeding involves the addition into the atmosphere from aircraft of dry ice silver iodide or other hygroscopic substances
