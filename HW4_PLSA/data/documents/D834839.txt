jan 2 2014 · author has 202 answers and 662k answer views cooked chicken in the home shouldnt be kept for more than four days it doesnt matter how its cooked i realize the usda gives you the wonderful chart separating it out if you have that chart use it but 4 days is going to be a safe factor for almost all your food leftovers i recommend using one number unless you are actually going to date mark your products with one number to use you know that if you prepped it on the 1st it will be good for 4 days which would be the 5th is your throw out date but some people do date mark which is great but i havent seen more than 2 home owners so far and retail food establishments that have to do it every day still forget mess etc365k views · view upvoters · answer requested by bonnie hollings sr timothy sly foodborne diseases epidemiologist toronto answered feb 3 2016 · author has 36k answers and 56m answer views it depends on so many factors surviving postheating bacterial load and species moisture as water activity p h or potential salt s phenols and other natural preservatives temperature of the fridge etc and how soon it went into the fridge after cooking but in short look at it closely take several good sniffs if you have a good nose you will detect the first signs of souring in the chicken that will happen usually before any visible signs of mold or discoloration due to bacteria you might find it keeps longer with a loose fitting lid or no lid at all because of the drying process but i would begin to get a bit suspicious after three days although it may survive another two days the best action would have been to freeze it on day 1 then you could keep it for some weeks359k views · view upvoters aileen olsen hampton food science fascinates me as a banquet

answered jan 31 2017 · author has 77 answers and 693k answer views it is generally not healthy to eat food kept in the fridge however if you do have to eat refrigerated food because of time constraints i suggest you make a batch and keep it in the freezer and take required quantity to be thawed as and when necessary you can freeze for about 56 days dont keep it for more than that if you keep in the fridge my advice would be to use it within 48 hours not more than that hope this helps41k views · view upvoters · answer requested by kishor jogu christine louie home cooking answered mar
