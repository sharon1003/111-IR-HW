psychology outline history subfields basic types showapplied psychology showlists showpsychology portalv t e from a sociological perspective social norms are informal understandings that govern the behavior of members of a society 1 social psychology recognizes smaller group units such as a team or an office may also endorse norms separately or in addition to cultural or societal expectations 2 in other words norms are regarded as collective representations of acceptable group conduct as well as individual perceptions of particular group conduct 3 they can be viewed as cultural products including values customs and traditions 4 which represent individuals basic knowledge of what others do and think that they should do 5furthermore in the field of social psychology the roles of norms are emphasized which can guide behavior in a certain situation or environment as mental representations of appropriate behavior 6 for example it has been shown that normative messages can promote prosocial behavior including decreasing alcohol use 7 and increasing voter turnout 8 and sustainability 9 10 according to the psychological definition of social norms behavioral component norms have two dimensions how much a behaviour is exhibited and how much the group approves of that behavior 2 both of these dimensions can be used in normative messages to alter norms and subsequently alter behaviors for example a message can target the former dimension by describing high levels of voter turnout in order to encourage more turnout at the same time norms also can be changed contingent on the observed behavior of others how much behavior is exhibited in fact in sherif 1936 one confederate was able to affect the development of a group norm related to the autokinetic effect

further reading12 external links behavior  editnorms running counter to the behaviors of the overarching society or culture may be transmitted and maintained within small subgroups of society for example crandall 1988 noted that certain groups eg cheerleading squads dance troupes sports teams sororities have a rate of bulimia a publicly recognized lifethreatening disease that is much higher than society as a whole social norms have a way of maintaining order and organizing groups 11social control  editalthough not considered to be formal laws within society norms still work to promote a great deal of social control 12 they are statements that regulate conduct the cultural phenomenon that is the norm is the prescriber of acceptable behavior in specific instances ranging in variations depending on culture race religion and geographical location it is the foundation of the terms some know acceptable as not to injure others the golden rule and to keep promises that have been pledged 13 without them there would be a world without consensus common ground or restrictions even though the law and a states legislation is not intended to control social norms society and the law are inherently linked and one dictates the other this is why it has been said that the language used in some legislation is controlling and dictating for what should or should not be accepted for example the criminalisation of familial sexual relations is said to protect those that are vulnerable however even consenting adults cannot have sexual relationships with their relatives the language surrounding these laws conveys the message that such acts are supposedly immoral and should be condemned even though there is no actual victim in these consenting relationships 14social norms can be enforced formally eg through sanctions or informally eg through body language and nonverbal communication cues because individuals often derive physical or psychological resources from group membership groups are said to control discretionary stimuli groups can withhold or give out more resources in response to members adherence to group norms effectively controlling member behavior through rewards and operant conditioning 15 social psychology research has found the more an individual values groupcontrolled resources or the more an individual sees group membership as central to his definition of self the more likely he is to conform 15 social norms also allow an individual to assess what behaviors the group deems important to its existence or survival since they represent a codification of belief groups generally do not punish members or create norms over actions which they care little about 15 16 norms in every culture create conformity that allows for people to become socialized to the culture in which they live 1as social beings individuals learn when and where it is appropriate to say certain things to use certain words to discuss certain topics or wear certain clothes and when it is not thus knowledge about cultural norms is important for impressions 17 which is an individuals regulation of their nonverbal behavior one also comes to know through experience what types of people heshe can and cannot discuss certain topics with or wear certain types of dress around typically this knowledge is derived through experience ie social norms are learned through social interaction  17 wearing a suit to a job interview in order to give a great first impression represents a common example of a social norm in the white collar work force sociology  editfor talcott parsons of the functionalist school norms dictate the interactions of people in all social encounters on the other hand karl marx believed that norms are used to promote the creation of roles in society which allows for people of different levels of social class structure to be able to function properly 1 marx claims that this power dynamic creates social order heinrich popitz is convinced that the establishment of social norms that make the future actions of alter foreseeable for ego solves the problem of contingency  niklas luhmann  in this way ego can count on those actions as if they would already have been performed and does not have to wait for their actual execution social interaction is thus accelerated important factors in the standardization of behavior are sanctions 18 and social roles emergence and transmission  editrulemaking is one of the basic impulses humans have for organizing and simplifying actions everyday there are new rules put into place as well as old rules that are more structured whether it be for a group or an individual yet not only do humans make rules they strive on finding the rules that come eye to eye about how the world works 19 these rules once accepted by an individual or a group after trial and error then become a norm groups may adopt norms through a variety of ways norms can arise formally where groups explicitly outline and implement behavioral expectations laws or club rules serve as an example of this 20 a large number of these norms we follow naturally such as driving on the right side of the road in the us and on the left side in the uk or not speeding in order to avoid a ticket many formal norms serve to provide safety to the general public however social norms are much more likely to develop informally emerging gradually as a result of repeated use of discretionary stimuli to control behavior 15 21 not necessarily laws set in writing informal norms represent generally accepted and widely sanctioned routines that people follow in everyday life 22 these informal norms if broken may not invite formal legal punishments or sanctions but instead encourage reprimands warnings or othering incest for example is generally thought of as wrong in society but many jurisdictions do not legally prohibit it transfer of norms between groups  editindividuals may also import norms from a previous organization to their new group which can get adopted over time 16 23 without a clear indication of how to act people typically rely on their past history to determine the best course forward what was successful before may serve them well again in a group individuals may all import different histories or scripts about appropriate behaviors common experience over time will lead the group to define as a whole its take on the right action usually with the integration of several members schemas 23 under the importation paradigm norm formation occurs subtly and swiftly 23 whereas with formal or informal development of norms may take longer groups internalize norms by accepting them as reasonable and proper standards for behaviour within the group once firmly established a norm becomes a part of the groups operational structure and hence more difficult to change while possible for newcomers to a group to change its norms it is much more likely that the new individual will adopt the groups norms values and perspectives rather than the other way around 15deviance from social norms  editnormal is a bad word a graffito in ljubljana slovenia deviance is defined as nonconformity to a set of norms that are accepted by a significant number of people in a community or society 24 more simply put if group members do not follow a norm they become labeled as a deviant in the sociological literature this can often lead to them being considered outcasts of society yet deviant behavior amongst children is somewhat expected except the idea of this deviance manifesting as a criminal action the social tolerance given in the example of the child is quickly withdrawn against the criminal crime is considered one of the most extreme forms of deviancy according to scholar clifford r shaw 25 what is considered normal is relative to the location of the culture in which the social interaction is taking place in psychology an individual who routinely disobeys group norms runs the risk of turning into the institutionalized deviant similar to the sociological definition institutionalized deviants may be judged by other group members for their failure to adhere to norms at first group members may increase pressure on a nonconformist attempting to engage the individual in conversation or explicate why he or she should follow their behavioral expectations the role in which one decides on whether or not to behave is largely determined on how their actions will effect others 26 especially with new members who perhaps do not know any better groups may use discretionary stimuli to bring an individuals behavior back into line over time however if a member continues to disobey the group will give up on him as a lost cause while the group may not necessarily revoke his membership they may give him only superficial consideration 15 if a worker is late to a meeting for example violating the office norm of punctuality a boss or other coworker may wait for the individual to arrive and pull him aside later to ask what happened if the behavior continues eventually the group may begin meetings without him since the individual is always late the group generalizes the individuals disobedience and promptly dismisses it thereby reducing the members influence and footing in future group disagreements group tolerance for deviation varies across membership not all group members receive the same treatment for norm violations individuals may build up a reserve of good behavior through conformity which they can borrow against later these idiosyncrasy credits provide a theoretical currency for understanding variations in group behavioral expectations 27 a teacher for example may more easily forgive a straighta student for misbehaving—who has past good credit saved up—than a repeatedly disruptive student while past performance can help build idiosyncrasy credits some group members have a higher balance to start with 27 individuals can import idiosyncrasy credits from another group childhood movie stars for example who enroll in college may experience more leeway in adopting school norms than other incoming freshmen finally leaders or individuals in other highstatus positions may begin with more credits and be appear to be above the rules at times 15 27 even their idiosyncrasy credits are not bottomless however while held to a more lenient standard than the average member leaders may still face group rejection if their disobedience becomes too extreme deviance also causes multiple emotions one experiences when going against a norm one of those emotions can be widely attributed to guilt this emotion is connected to the ethics of duty which in turn becomes a primary object of moral obligation guilt is followed by an action that is questioned after its doing 28 it can be described as something negative to the self as well as a negative state of feeling used in both instances it is both an unpleasant feeling as well as a form of selfpunishment using the metaphor of dirty hands 29 it is the staining or tainting of oneself and therefore having to self cleanse away the filth it is a form of reparation that confronts oneself as well as submitting to the possibility of anger and punishment from others guilt is a point in both action and feeling that acts as a stimulus for further honorable actions operant conditioning  editthe probability of these actions that are committed are coined to b f skinner that states that operant conditioning plays a role in the process of social norm operant conditioning is the increase that an action will occur again by increasing the reinforced response this process is that of reward and punishment or trial and error hand in hand with deviance the consequences of one’s behavior whether positive or negative will determine the probability of reoccurrence as well as the push towards regulating one’s decisions in the future containing five sub categories this conditioning treatment is an influence in the actions one commits and the feelings one experiences afterwards in the case of social deviance an individual who has gone against a norm will feel the negative connotation that comes with defying the conditioning that was taught therefore indicating negative reinforcement a perfect example is that of a little girl painting on the wall of the house as she seeks her mother’s approval of her artistic work when the child witnesses the mother putting her in a time out she realizes that if she were to paint on the wall again it will lead to punishment therefore causing her to notice her negative reinforcement which then makes the probability of her painting the wall again decrease immensely he also states that humans are conditioned from a very young age on how to behave and how to act with those around us considering the outside influences of the society and location one is in 30 built to blend into the ambiance and attitude around us deviance is a frowned upon action focus theory of normative conduct  editcialdini reno and kallgren developed the focus theory of normative conduct to describe how individuals implicitly juggle multiple behavioral expectations at once expanding on conflicting prior beliefs about whether cultural situational or personal norms motivate action the researchers suggested the focus of an individual’s attention will dictate what behavioral expectation they follow 31types  editdescriptive versus injunctive  editdescriptive norms depict what happens while injunctive norms describe what should happen cialdini reno and kallgren 1990 define a descriptive norm as peoples perceptions of what is commonly done in specific situations it signifies what most people do without assigning judgment the absence of trash on the ground in a parking lot for example transmits the descriptive norm that most people there do not litter 31 32 an injunctive norm on the other hand transmits group approval about a particular behavior it dictates how an individual should behave 31 32 33 34 watching another person pick up trash off the ground and throw it out a group member may pick up on the injunctive norm that he ought to not litter prescriptive and proscriptive  editprescriptive norms are unwritten rules that are understood and followed by society and indicate what we should do 35 expressing gratitude or writing a thank you card when someone gives you a gift represents a prescriptive norm in american culture proscriptive norms in contrast comprise the other end of the same spectrum they are similarly societys unwritten rules about what one should not do 35 these norms can vary between cultures while an acceptable greeting in some european countries kissing a stranger on the cheek constitutes a proscriptive norm in the united states subjective  editsubjective norm is determined by beliefs about the extent to which important others want them to perform a behavior social influences are conceptualized in terms of the pressure that people perceive from important others to perform or not to perform a behavior 34mathematical representations  editover the last few decades several theorists have attempted to explain social norms from a more theoretical point of view by quantifying behavioral expectations graphically or attempting to plot the logic behind adherence theorists hoped to be able to predict whether or not individuals would conform the return potential model and game theory provide a slightly more economic conceptualization of norms suggesting individuals can calculate the cost or benefit behind possible behavioral outcomes under these theoretical frameworks choosing to obey or violate norms becomes a more deliberate quantifiable decision return potential model  editfigure 1 the return potential model reproduced from jackson 1965 developed in the 1960s the return potential model provides a method for plotting and visualizing group norms in the regular coordinate plane the amount of behavior exhibited is plotted on the xaxis label a in figure 1 while the amount of group acceptance or approval gets plotted on the yaxis  b in figure 1 2 the graph represents the potential return or positive outcome to an individual for a given behavioral norm theoretically one could plot a point for each increment of behavior how much the group likes or dislikes that action for example it may be the case that among firstyear graduate students strong social norms around how many daily cups of coffee you drink exist if the return curve in figure 1 correctly displays the example social norm we can see that if someone drinks 0 cups of coffee a day the group strongly disapproves the group does not approve of member behavior until someone hits four cups of coffee a day the graduate students as represented by the return curve find it excessive to drink more than seven cups however as the approval again dips below zero as exhibited by the coffee example the return potential model displays for each increment of behavior how much group approval one can anticipate point of maximum return the point with the greatest ycoordinate is called the point of maximum return as it represents the amount of behavior the group likes the best 2 while c in figure 1 is labeling the return curve in general the highlighted point just above it at x6 represents the point of maximum return extending our above example the point of maximum return for firstyear graduate students would be 6 cups of coffee they receive the most social approval for drinking exactly that many cups any more or any fewer cups would decrease the approval range of tolerable behavior label d represents the range of tolerable behavior or the amount of action the group finds acceptable 2 it encompasses all the positive area under the curve in figure 1 the range of tolerable behavior extends is 3 as the group approves of all behavior from 4 to 7 and 743 carrying over our coffee example again we can see that firstyears only approve of having a limited number of cups of coffee between 4 and 7 more than 7 cups or fewer than 4 would fall outside the range of tolerable behavior norms can have a narrower or wider range of tolerable behavior typically a narrower range of behavior indicates a behavior with greater consequences to the group 15intensity the intensity of the norm tells how much the group cares about the norm or how much group affect is at stake to be won or lost it is represented in the return potential model by the total amount of area subsumed by the curve regardless of whether the area is positive or negative 2 a norm with low intensity would not vary far from the xaxis the amount of approval or disapproval for given behaviors would be closer to zero a highintensity norm however would have more extreme approval ratings in figure 1 the intensity of the norm appears high as few behaviors invoke a rating of indifference crystallization finally norm crystallization refers to how much variance exists within the curve translated from the theoretical back to the actual norm it shows how much agreement exists between group members about the approval for a given amount of behavior 2 it may be that some members believe the norm more central to group functioning than others a group norm like how many cups of coffee first years should drink would probably have low crystallization since a lot of individuals have varying beliefs about the appropriate amount of caffeine to imbibe in contrast the norm of not plagiarizing another students work would likely have high crystallization as people uniformly agree on the behaviors unacceptability showing the overall group norm the return potential model in figure 1 does not indicate the crystallization however a return potential model that plotted individual data points alongside the cumulative norm could demonstrate the variance and allow us to deduce crystallization game theory  editmain article game theory another general formal framework that can be used to represent the essential elements of the social situation surrounding a norm is the repeated game of game theory rational choice a branch of game theory deals with the relations and actions socially committed among rational agents 36 a norm gives a person a rule of thumb for how they should behave however a rational person only acts according to the rule if it is optimal for them the situation can be described as follows a norm gives an expectation of how other people act in a given situation macro a person acts optimally given the expectation micro for a norm to be stable peoples actions must reconstitute the expectation without change micromacro feedback loop a set of such correct stable expectations is known as a nash equilibrium thus a stable norm must constitute a nash equilibrium 37 in the nash equilibrium no one actor has any positive incentive in individually deviating from a certain action 38 social norms will be implemented if the actions of that specific norm come into agreement by the support of the nash equilibrium in the majority of the game theoretical approaches 38from a gametheoretical point of view there are two explanations for the vast variety of norms that exist throughout the world one is the difference in games different parts of the world may give different environmental contexts and different people may have different values which may result in a difference in games the other is equilibrium selection not explicable by the game itself equilibrium selection is closely related to coordination for a simple example driving is common throughout the world but in some countries people drive on the right and in other countries people drive on the left see coordination game  a framework called comparative institutional analysis is proposed to deal with the game theoretical structural understanding of the variety of social
