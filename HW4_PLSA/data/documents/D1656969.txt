we thought we had found us a nice hotel to stay at for the two nights we were in town for a funeral well it was not what we were expecting upon arriving to our room we first noticed how dirty things were with no carpet in the room it made for a dirty gritty place to walk as it was snowing outside as if that wasnt enough the mirrors in the room were so filthy that you could barley see yourself thru there was layers of dust laying everywhere i have to say i have stayed at a lot of hotels as we like to travel and this has been by far the worst place i have stayed date published 20180316rated
