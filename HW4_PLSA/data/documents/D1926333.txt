gemstone a variety of the mineralcorundum  aluminium oxide  other varieties of gemquality corundum are called sapphires ruby is one of the traditional cardinal gems together with amethyst sapphire emerald and diamond 3 the word ruby comes from ruber latin for red the color of a ruby is due to the element chromium the quality of a ruby is determined by its color cut and clarity which along with carat weight affect its value the brightest and most valuable shade of red called bloodred or pigeon blood commands a large premium over other rubies of similar quality after color follows clarity similar to diamonds a clear stone will command a premium but a ruby without any needlelike rutileinclusions may indicate that the stone has been treated ruby is the traditional birthstone for july and is usually more pink than garnet although some rhodolite garnets have a similar pinkish hue to most rubies the worlds most valuable ruby is the sunrise ruby contents1 physical properties11 ruby vs

harder with diamond having a mohs hardness of 100 and moissanite falling somewhere in between corundum ruby and diamond in hardness sapphire ruby and pure corundum are αalumina the most stable form of al 2 o 3 in which 3 electrons leave each aluminum ion to join the regular octahedral group of six nearby o 2− ions in pure corundum this leaves all of the aluminum ions with a very stable configuration of no unpaired electrons or unfilled energy levels and the crystal is perfectly colorless when a chromium atom replaces an occasional aluminum atom it too loses 3 electrons to become a chromium 3 ion to maintain the charge balance of the al 2 o 3 crystal however the cr 3 ions are larger and have electron orbitals in different directions than aluminum the octahedral arrangement of the o 2− ions is distorted and the energy levels of the different orbitals of those cr 3 ions are slightly altered because of the directions to the o 2− ions 4 those energy differences correspond to absorption in the ultraviolet violet and yellowgreen regions of the spectrum transmittance of ruby in optical and nearir spectra note the two broad violet and yellowgreen absorption bands and one narrow absorption band at the wavelength of 694 nm which is the wavelength of the ruby laser if one percent of the aluminum ions are replaced by chromium in ruby the yellowgreen absorption results in a red color for the gem 4 additionally absorption at any of the above wavelengths stimulates fluorescent emission of 694nanometerwavelength red light which adds to its red color and perceived luster after absorbing shortwavelength light there is a short interval of time when the crystal lattice of ruby is in an excited state before fluorescence occurs if 694nanometer photons pass through the crystal during that time they can stimulate more fluorescent photons to be emitted inphase with them thus strengthening the intensity of that red light by arranging mirrors or other means to pass emitted light repeatedly through the crystal a ruby laser in this way produces a very high intensity of coherent red light all natural rubies have imperfections in them including color impurities and inclusions of rutile needles known as silk gemologists use these needle inclusions found in natural rubies to distinguish them from synthetics simulants or substitutes usually the rough stone is heated before cutting these days almost all rubies are treated in some form with heat treatment being the most common practice untreated rubies of high quality command a large premium some rubies show a threepoint or sixpoint asterism or star these rubies are cut into cabochons to display the effect properly asterisms are best visible with a singlelight source and move across the stone as the light moves or the stone is rotated such effects occur when light is reflected off the silk the structurally oriented rutile needle inclusions in a certain way this is one example where inclusions increase the value of a gemstone furthermore rubies can show color changes—though this occurs very rarely—as well as chatoyancy or the cats eye effect ruby vs pink sapphire generally gemstonequality corundum in all shades of red including pink are called rubies 5 6 however in the united states a minimum color saturation must be met to be called a ruby otherwise the stone will be called a pink sapphire 5 drawing a distinction between rubies and pink sapphires is relatively new having arisen sometime in the 20th century often the distinction between ruby and pink sapphire is not clear and can be debated 7 as a result of the difficulty and subjectiveness of such distinctions trade organizations such as the international colored gemstone association icga have adopted the broader definition for ruby which encompasses its lighter shades including pink 8 9natural occurrence the mogok valley in upper myanmar burma was for centuries the worlds main source for rubies that region has produced some exceptional rubies however in recent years few good rubies have been found in central myanmar the area of mong hsu began producing rubies during the 1990s and rapidly became the worlds main ruby mining area the most recently found ruby deposit in myanmar is in namya namyazeik located in the northern state of kachin historically rubies have also been mined in thailand in the pailin and samlout district of cambodia as well as in afghanistan australia brazil colombia india namibia japan and scotland after the second world war ruby deposits were found in madagascar nepal pakistan tajikistan tanzania and vietnam 10 in sri lanka lighter shades of rubies often pink sapphires are more commonly found the republic of macedonia is the only country in mainland europe to have naturally occurring rubies they can mainly be found around the city of prilep macedonian rubies have a unique raspberry color the ruby is also included on the macedonian coat of arms 11 a few rubies have been found in the u s states of montana north carolina south carolina and wyoming spinel another red gemstone is sometimes found along with rubies in the same gem gravel or marble red spinels may be mistaken for rubies by those lacking experience with gems however the finest red spinels can have values approaching that of an average ruby 12factors affecting value rubies as with other gemstones are graded using criteria known as the four cs namely color cut clarity and carat weight rubies are also evaluated on the basis of their geographic origin color in the evaluation of colored gemstones color is the most important factor color divides into three components hue saturation and tone hue refers to color as we normally use the term transparent gemstones occur in the pure spectral hues of red orange yellow green blue violet 13 in nature there are rarely pure hues so when speaking of the hue of a gemstone we speak of primary and secondary and sometimes tertiary hues ruby is defined to be red all other hues of the gem species corundum are called sapphire ruby may exhibit a range of secondary hues including orange purple violet and pink a naturally occurring ruby crystal natural ruby with inclusions a cut pink ruby purple rubies victorian ruby and diamond brooch the finest ruby is described as being a vivid mediumdark toned red secondary hues add an additional complication pink orange and purple are the normal secondary hues in ruby of the three purple is preferred because it reinforces the red making it appear richer 13 purple also occupies a position on the color wheel halfway between red and blue when a purplishred ruby is set in yellow the yellow neutralizes its complement blue leaving the stone appearing to be pure red in the setting  original research treatments and enhancements improving the quality of gemstones by treating them is common practice some treatments are used in almost all cases and are therefore considered acceptable during the late 1990s a large supply of lowcost materials caused a sudden surge in supply of heattreated rubies leading to a downward pressure on ruby prices improvements used include color alteration improving transparency by dissolving rutile inclusions healing of fractures cracks or even completely filling them the most common treatment is the application of heat most rubies at the lower end of the market are heat treated to improve color remove purple tinge blue patches and silk these heat treatments typically occur around temperatures of 1800 °c 3300 °f 14 some rubies undergo a process of low tube heat when the stone is heated over charcoal of a temperature of about 1300 °c 2400 °f for 20 to 30 minutes the silk is partially broken and the color is improved another treatment which has become more frequent in recent years is lead glass filling filling the fractures inside the ruby with lead glass or a similar material dramatically improves the transparency of the stone making previously unsuitable rubies fit for applications in jewelry 15 the process is done in four steps the rough stones are prepolished to eradicate all surface impurities that may affect the process the rough is cleaned with hydrogen fluoride the first heating process during which no fillers are added the heating process eradicates impurities inside the fractures although this can be done at temperatures up to 1400 °c 2500 °f it most likely occurs at a temperature of around 900 °c 1600 °f since the rutile silk is still intact the second heating process in an electrical oven with different chemical additives different solutions and mixes have shown to be successful however mostly leadcontaining glasspowder is used at present the ruby is dipped into oils then covered with powder embedded on a tile and placed in the oven where it is heated at around 900 °c 1600 °f for one hour in an oxidizing atmosphere the orange colored powder transforms upon heating into a transparent to yellowcolored paste which fills all fractures after cooling the color of the paste is fully transparent and dramatically improves the overall transparency of the ruby 16if a color needs to be added the glass powder can be enhanced with copper or other metal oxides as well as elements such as sodium calcium potassium etc the second heating process can be repeated three to four times even applying different mixtures 17 when jewelry containing rubies is heated for repairs it should not be coated with boracic acid or any other substance as this can etch the surface it does not have to be protected like a diamond the treatment can identified by noting bubbles in cavities and fractures using a 10x loupe 18synthetic and imitation rubies artificial ruby under a normal light top and under a green laser light bottom red light is emitted in 1837 gaudin made the first synthetic rubies by fusing potash alum at a high temperature with a little chromium as a pigment in 1847 ebelmen made white sapphire by fusing alumina in boric acid in 1877 frenic and freil made crystal corundum from which small stones could be cut frimy and auguste verneuil manufactured artificial ruby by fusing ba f 2 and al 2 o 3 with a little chromium at red heat in 1903 verneuil announced he could produce synthetic rubies on a commercial scale using this flame fusion process 19 by 1910 verneuils laboratory had expanded into a 30 furnace production facility with annual gemstone production having reached 1000 kilograms 2000 lb in 1907 other processes in which synthetic rubies can be produced are through czochralskis pulling process flux process and the hydrothermal process most synthetic rubies originate from flame fusion due to the low costs involved synthetic rubies may have no imperfections visible to the naked eye but magnification may reveal curves striae and gas bubbles the fewer the number and the less obvious the imperfections the more valuable the ruby is unless there are no imperfections ie a perfect ruby in which case it will be suspected of being artificial dopants are added to some manufactured rubies so they can be identified as synthetic but most need gemological testing to determine their origin synthetic rubies have technological uses as well as gemological ones rods of synthetic ruby are used to make ruby lasers and masers the first working laser was made by theodore h maiman in 1960 20 maiman used a solidstate lightpumped synthetic ruby to produce red laser light at a wavelength of 694 nanometers nm ruby lasers are still in use rubies are also used in applications where high hardness is required such as at wear exposed locations in modern mechanical clockworks or as scanning probe tips in a coordinate measuring machine imitation rubies are also marketed red spinels red garnets and colored glass have been falsely claimed to be rubies imitations go back to roman times and already in the 17th century techniques were developed to color foil red—by burning scarlet wool in the bottom part of the furnace—which was then placed under the imitation stone 21 trade terms such as balas ruby for red spinel and rubellite for red tourmaline can mislead unsuspecting buyers such terms are therefore discouraged from use by many gemological associations such as the laboratory manual harmonisation committee lmhc records and famous rubies rubies at the national museum of natural history washington d c usathe smithsonians national museum of natural history in washington d c has some of the worlds largest and finest ruby gemstones the 231 carats 462 g burmese ruby set in a platinum ring with diamonds was donated by businessman and philanthropist peter buck in memory of his late wife carmen lúcia this gemstone displays a richly saturated red color combined with an exceptional transparency the finely proportioned cut provides vivid red reflections the stone was mined from the mogok region of burma now myanmar in the 1930s 22in 2007 the london jeweler garrard  co

designed and constructed by theodore h ted maiman on the 16th of may 1961 at hughes research laboratories 20 28 the concept of electromagnetic radiation amplification through the mechanism of stimulated emission had already been successfully demonstrated in the laboratory by way of the maser using other materials such as ammonia and later ruby but the ruby laser was the first device to work at optical 6943 nm wavelengths maimans prototype laser is still in working order historical and cultural references in job 2818 and proverbs 315 wisdom is more valuable than rubies in proverbs

carried along this ancient trackway moving westward from china 29rubies have always been held in high esteem in asian countries they were used to ornament armor scabbards and harnesses of noblemen in india and china rubies were laid beneath the foundation of buildings to secure good fortune to the structure 30see also book gemstones gemology and jewelry portal anyolite list of gemstones list of
