summary and comment  general medicine august 23 2011followup chest xrays after pneumonia allan s brett md reviewing tang kl et al arch intern med 2011 jul 11 followup imaging probably can be limited to older patients older guidelines recommended routine followup chest xrays at about 6 weeks after episodes of communityacquired pneumonia presumably to screen for malignancy after an acute infiltrate has cleared more recent u s guidelines dont address this issue  clin infect dis 2007 44 suppl 2 s27  and a recent u k guideline recommends this practice only for patients with persistent symptoms or those “at higher risk of underlying malignancy especially smokers and those aged 50 years”  thorax 2009 64 suppl 3iii1  in this populationbased cohort study canadian researchers identified all 3398 patients without known cancer who received inpatient or outpatient treatment for pneumonia between 2000 and 2002 in metropolitan edmonton the incidence of newly diagnosed lung cancer was 11 at 90 days and 17 at 1 year only 40 of patients had followup chest xrays performed within 90 days all but 1 of the 57 patients in whom cancer was diagnosed within 1 year were 50 or older thus the authors conclude that routine followup chest xrays should be restricted to people in that age group comment because less than half the patients underwent followup chest xrays and because this study was not a randomized comparison of imaging versus no imaging the benefit of routine radiography after pneumonia remains unclear however the low 1year incidence of lung cancer provides reassurance that a selective approach — limiting followup chest xrays to middleaged and older adults — is reasonable obviously patients of any age who remain symptomatic also should undergo followup imaging read the case history of a pneumonia patient and decide if you would order a followup xray citation s tang kl et al incidence correlates and chest radiographic yield of new lung cancer diagnosis in 3398

loved one he had problems and had to be admitted to the hospital unbelievable that you did not do a followup reply cm bsn ph d nursenppa3 feb 2016 553 pmdue to the complexity of the patients condition id recommend a followup chest xray when symptoms subside to ensure that no other etiologies are involved reply terry pontino other healthcare professional family medicinegeneral practice cardiopulmonary primary care office7 oct 2013 841 pmyes i would to check for a malignancy you never know replybimlesh pandey5 jun 2012 325 pmi would get cxr for reasons in endemic country or region like india bangladesh pakistan you may cap like presentation with tuberculosis these region also has high prevalence of drug resistance to usual organisms for these 2 reasons we require few more cxr than our counterpart in europe or america competing interests none declared reply angela crowell29 may 2012 1154 amgiven that pt presented with a difficult pneumonia and was unresponsive to first treatment thus needing to be hospitalized i would have ordered a chest xray to rule out late stage lung cancer the fact that he was not a smoker and feeling better should not have been a deciding factor in not ordering an xray we all know that a large majority of lung cancer patients have never smoked and many never present symptons until cancer has become metatasis competing interests none declared replyhassan ayoub14 may 2012 626 pmi think that it should be an indication for graphy follow up post pneumoniaie in critical pneumonia  unresponsive for treatmentdiabeticimunnocompromizedcorton usingetc patients this should undergo a trial of cost benefit and treatment outcome thanks competing interests none declared reply gerson luiz penna bastos17 may 2012 412 pmid start with amoxicillinclavulanate and with  50 yo id add azythromicin we cannot infer his curb65 risk but probably was low when he was examined for the first time given that he felt himself 100 better i would not order a followup cxr competing interests none declared reply amine el eid2 apr 2012 541 pmi would have done an xray after 6 weeks but not in this case the ct scan eliminated the presence of tumour the patient is symptom free  physical examination is normal i would have used ampicilline  clavulanic acid combination to start with competing interests none declared reply martie j lynch19 mar 2012 606 pmbecause all of my patients are older than 65 my decision making paradigm considers the usual standards of care along with softer factors such as level of frailty pre and post cap even in the absence of quantitative markers of fever cough and fatigue hospitalization for any reason can be the first domino to fall in an otherwise medically stable 76 yr old the benefit of a post cap xray at 6 weeks far outweighs the risk competing interests none declared reply barbara h chaffee md19 mar 2012 606 pmi would do the 6 week xray but would not have done the ct scan in the setting of acute pneumonia when the interpretation would be difficult in terms of finding an occult mass the 6 week study would be cheaper and would give the needed information competing interests none declared replychris graviss md physician radiology va8 dec 2014 602 pmits so hard to teach this to the clinicians reply susan m womeldorf2 mar 2012 430 pmwhile not routinely needed i would have gotten a follow up chest x ray on the patient described in the case history his course was complicated enough that despite imaging done while ill i would still want a cxr after recovery competing interests none declared reply abdulrazak a ahmad12 mar 2012 636 pmi would have used combination of amicillin and azithromycin or amoxycillin and clavulanate to start with having had ct chest and bronchoscopy done i dont think a follow up chest xray will be more informative any way if this is taking with symptomatic relief and no history of smoking i will not go further competing interests none declared reply michael f bone9 mar 2012 436 pmlovely example of right middle lobe pneumonia in the first instance i would probably have used coamoxyclavulanic acid unless patient allergic the ct scan showed no obstructive lesion so im not sure i would have performed a bronchoscope at that time remember the natural history of pneumonic resolution usually takes 3 weeks with the phases of red and the successive grey hepatisation i would have performed a repeat cxr follow up cxr is not only indicated for the exclusion of lung cancer especially in a 75 year old man it would be reassuring to know that there had been no sequelae such as empyema or bronchiectasis competing interests none declared reply ashley e29 aug 2011 439 pmi do not feel that a follow up chest xray is necessary for the
