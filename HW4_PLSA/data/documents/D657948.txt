currents coastal currents 1 2 3 4longshore currents are generated when a train of waves reach the coastline and release bursts of energy longshore currents the speed at which waves approach the shore depends on sea floor and shoreline features and the depth of the water as a wave moves toward the beach different segments of the wave encounter the beach before others which slows these segments down as a result the wave tends to bend and conform to the general shape of the coastline also waves do not typically reach the beach perfectly parallel to the shoreline rather they arrive at a slight angle called the “angle of wave approach”when a wave reaches a beach or coastline it releases a burst of energy that generates a current which runs parallel to the shoreline this type of current is called a “longshore current”discover how does an island disappear longshore drift can be very destructive to manmade structures click the image to view a slideshow and learn more longshore currents are affected by the velocity and angle of a wave when a wave breaks at a more acute steep angle on a beach encounters a steeper beach slope or is very high longshore currents increase in velocity conversely a wider breaking angle gentler beach slope and lower wave height slows a longshore current’s velocity in either case the water in a longshore current flows up onto the beach and back into the ocean as it moves in a “sheet” formation as this sheet of water moves on and off the beach it can “capture” and transport beach sediment back out to sea this process known as “longshore drift” can cause significant beach erosion back to 1 continue to 3 4 top
