february 14 2014match made in heaven comments 19johnny weir and tara lipinski have made for a surprisingly effective broadcasting pair at the sochi olympics getty imagesjohnny weir did something totally unexpected bordering on radical in the nbc sports broadcast booth this week he made a statement that trumped his most audacious style choices  a hotpink chanel blazer here a lace top there some unfathomably bouffant confection surfacing from his scalp paid to deliver commentary on the mornings live figure skating action from russia he sat through the winning free skate for the pairs competition in silence for more than four minutes weir said not a word his partners 1998 gold medalist tara lipinski and sportscaster terry gannon chirped a couple of times during the routine but weir just watched russias maxim trankov and tatiana volosozhar spin gold from the sounds of jesus christ superstar he waited several beats after they had finished to say of course they were nervous they were a little stiffer than were used to seeing but it doesnt matter who knew that weir could be such a minimalist if you do a google search of his name and then do another using his name and the word flamboyant youll get the same number of results before weirs autobiography confirmed that he was gay reporters routinely leaned on the word as code afterward they kept on using it because it was comfortable and a lot simpler than trying to come up with succinct language to explain weir as it turns out they should have asked him to craft the description his commentary for nbcs cable and satellitedish network nbcsn is remarkably vivid concise and informative listen to him describe a failed quadruple jump from the mens short program he broke out of the revolutions too soon for a quad you need to hold until you feel your foot hit the ice in two brief sentences he put the viewer inside a skaters mind and body very few commentators can pull that off scott hamilton weirs primetime counterpart will use three times as many words to convey less than half as much insight weirs wit was presumed to be his resume topper for this gig and it has turned up often but its his rapport with lipinski that has defined the broadcast and spawned a hilarious instagram account their realityshow pitch is shaping up thusly its nick and nora on ice meets hepburn and tracywill and grace their banter is unlike anything weve ever heard from olympic commentators when gannon prompted them to explain the new rules that will allow music with lyrics next year weir said i cant wait to see an eminem short program from one of the boys lipinski countered why not the girls you know id love that weir disagreed with her on a skaters performance and she said slyly i hear you johnny he holds a definite edge in colorful quotes describing the feeling of popping out of a jump thats kind of a situation like throwing a cat into a bathtub where they just splay their legs out and you cant control it on an austrian skater who wore an unorthodox costume i applaud her use of short shorts reminiscent of our own terry gannon in the 1983 college basketball championship  on what russian superstar evgeni plushenko will do in retirement i dont think youll ever see him in some caftans or short shorts sipping mai tais by a pool lipinski meanwhile is queen of the metaphor she went deep to describe the roles in a skating pair the man has to be the frame and the woman has to be the pretty picture she also does her homework and uses the information well she foreshadowed plushenkos stunning withdrawal by pointing out that he had not done any jumps in his last practice and appeared to be in substantial pain the two are at their best when they simply analyze as they watched an italian pair she said sometimes i notice him when i should be noticing her i think his skating needs to improve or that to happen on a pairs throw that led to a fall he observed she didnt use her own foot to jump she was relying totally on him just to toss her up and to be a good pairs partner you have to help one another related articles temporary homes sochis olympic venues have generally been excellent yet

after theyve fallen from heaven lipinski and weir rarely impose themselves on the scene they know when to back off weir tends to drop his voice when he makes a brief comment during a program and it can often be difficult to hear him over the crowd noise the audience seems to be more intrusive during the live broadcast than in the tape delayed one although its hard to compare hamiltons loud staccato bursts could not be drowned out by landing aircraft for the primetime broadcast hamilton and choreographer sandra bezic set the emotional tone in the morning lipinski and weir let the skaters do it the morning crew has a significant advantage with two hours of air time and almost 20 performances to cover they can let conversations develop bezic hamilton and their colleague tom hammond rarely present more than six skaters the elite of the competition the weaker skaters generated the most insight their flaws make ideal fodder for a commentator if lipinski and weir can incisively explain the details separating one medal contender from another they should be unstoppable if they can do live coverage theyre not far from being able to handle tape delays for prime time its just question of when prime time will be ready for them
