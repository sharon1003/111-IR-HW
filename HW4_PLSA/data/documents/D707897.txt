planet cool but rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are turning down this global air conditioner according to a new study in some regions more than a quarter of the warming from increased carbon dioxide is due to its direct impact on vegetation in addition to its betterknown effect as a heattrapping greenhouse gas share full storymap of globe shows percentage of predicted warming due to the direct effect of carbon dioxide on plants carbon dioxide warms the earth because it is a greenhouse gas in the atmosphere but it also causes plants to provide less evaporative cooling a study by long cao and ken caldeira of the carnegie institution for science finds that in some places darkest orange over 25 percent of the warming from increased atmospheric carbon dioxide is a result of decreased evaporative cooling by plants credit carnegie institution trees and other plants help keep the planet cool but rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are turning down this global air conditioner according to a new study by researchers at the carnegie institution for science in some regions more than a quarter of the warming from increased carbon dioxide is due to its direct impact on vegetation this warming is in addition to carbon dioxides betterknown effect as a heattrapping greenhouse gas for scientists trying to predict global climate change in the coming century the study underscores the importance of including plants in their climate models plants have a very complex and diverse influence on the climate system says study coauthor ken caldeira of carnegies department of global ecology plants take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere but they also have other effects such as changing the amount of evaporation from the land surface its impossible to make good climate predictions without taking all of these factors into account plants give off water through tiny pores in their leaves a process called evapotranspiration that cools the plant just as perspiration cools our bodies on a hot day a tree can release tens of gallons of water into the air acting as a natural air conditioner for its surroundings the plants absorb carbon dioxide for photosynthesis through the same pores called stomata but when carbon dioxide levels are high the leaf pores shrink this causes less water to be released diminishing the trees cooling power the warming effects of carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas have been known for a long time says caldeira but he and fellow carnegie scientist long cao were concerned that it is not as widely recognized that carbon dioxide also warms our planet by its direct effects on plants previous work by carnegies chris field and joe berry had indicated that the effects were important there is no longer any doubt that carbon dioxide decreases evaporative cooling by plants and that this decreased cooling adds to global warming says cao this effect would cause significant warming even if carbon dioxide were not a greenhouse gas in their model the researchers doubled the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide and recorded the magnitude and geographic pattern of warming from different factors they found that averaged over the entire globe the evapotranspiration effects of plants account for 16 of warming of the land surface with greenhouse effects accounting for the rest but in some regions such as parts of north america and eastern asia it can be more than 25 of the total warming if we think of a doubling of carbon dioxide as causing about four degrees of warming in many places three of those degrees are coming from the effect of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and one is coming from the direct effect of carbon dioxide on plants the researchers also found that their model predicted that high carbon dioxide will increase the runoff from the land surface in most areas because more water from precipitation bypasses the plant cooling system and flows directly to rivers and streams earlier models based on greenhouse effects of carbon dioxide had also predicted higher runoff but the new research predicts that changes in evapotranspiration due to high carbon dioxide could have an even stronger impact on water resources than those models predict these results really show that how plants respond to carbon dioxide is very important for making good climate predictions says caldeira so if we want to improve climate predictions we need to improve the representation of land plants in the climate models more broadly it shows that the kind of vegetation thats on the surface of our planet and what that vegetation is doing is very important in determining our climate we need to take great care in considering what kind of changes we make to forests and other ecosystems because they are likely to have important climate consequences the study is published in the may 37 online edition of the proceedings of the national academy of sciences story source materials
