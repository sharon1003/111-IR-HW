list of mathematical functions from wikipedia the free encyclopedianavigation search in mathematics a function or groups of functions are important enough to deserve their own names this is a listing of articles which explain some of these functions in more detail there is a large theory of special functions which developed out of statistics and mathematical physics a modern abstract point of view contrasts large function spaces which are infinitedimensional and within which most functions are anonymous with special functions picked out by properties such as symmetry or relationship to harmonic
