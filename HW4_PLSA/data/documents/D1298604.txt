a growing trend does your bond issue have a yield “kick” or “kicker” a recent growing trend in the municipal bond market is pricing longterm callable bonds at a premium this pricing approach has emerged due to a preference among certain institutional investors and consequently underwriters that sell bonds to these particular investors what does this mean for investors under rules governing municipal bonds callable premium bonds must be priced to the date resulting in the worst lowest yield for the investor generally this means that the bonds are priced to the first call date this is attractive to investors because in the event the bonds are not called the yield to maturity will be much higher furthermore in a rising rate environment premium bonds retain their value better than par or discount bonds what does this mean for municipal issuers for cities schools and other political subdivisions premium pricing of callable bonds may result in higher total bond financing costs issuers should be aware that premium pricing creates rates that are substantially higher than prevailing market yields in addition premium pricing of callable bonds may lead issuers to believe they received yields as low or lower than prevailing market yields when in fact the yields are higher the yield kick refers to the difference between the yield to maturity and the yield to the call date because the yield to maturity is higher than the yield to the call date investors receive a higher rate of return the yield kick if the bonds are not called for the issuer the kick results in a higher true interest cost tic premium pricing basics below are several tables illustrating the effect of premium pricing each of these examples is based on a bond issue with the following characteristics maturity  20 years par amount  10000000 bond yield to maturity  450 underwriting spread fee  1the following table shows that when a noncallable bond issue is priced at a premium or when a bond issue regardless or whether it is callable is priced at par 100 the true interest cost is essentially the same comparison of noncallable premium bonds to bonds sold at par noncallable bonds sold at premium

yield to the call date in the above example the price to the call date is 100998 compared to 101964 if the bonds were not callable2 the official statement for the callable bonds will show the bond prices and yields based on the yield to call consequently the issuer is likely to believe it received a very favorable 450 yield even though the yield to maturity is 457 stated differently an issuer will not be able to determine how its bond yields compare to other issuers unless it analyzes the yields to maturity3 in the above example the true interest cost is 07 higher for the callable premium priced bonds premium pricing strategies for issuers premium pricing increases debt service while simultaneously increasing the purchase price funds available to the issuer when an issuer requires additional capital and can afford to pay higher debt service premium pricing can be a favorable pricing strategy for noncallable bonds premium pricing can be effective because the premium paid to the issuer increases proportionately with the rise in interest cost as a result the true interest cost paid by the issuer remains unchanged this is demonstrated in the following table premium priced

the price paid to the issuer declines in proportion to the added debt service cost and the true interest cost increases premium priced bonds – callable in 8 years at 100bonds with 465 rate bonds with

issuer’s perspective what do we learn from the above example1 although the yield to the call date remains at 450 which is the rate that would be shown in the official statement as the rate on the bonds is increased the yield to maturity is progressively higher2 in the above example the increase in rates from 465 to 495 increases the true interest cost by 143 due to the added cost of premium callable bonds issuers may want to consider limiting the premiums on their callable bonds issuers will realize a true interest cost savings provided that the yield to maturity is no higher than the issuer would obtain with premium pricing for example if the issue were priced at par with a yield to maturity that is less than 472 the true interest cost would be lower than for the issue above that has a rate of 495 and a yield to call of 450 issuer considerations1 to determine how the yields assigned to your issue compare to those of other issuers make sure you compare the yields to maturity regardless of whether the issues were priced with yields to the call date2 working with your independent financial advisor issuers should work to minimize premiums on callable bonds without impairing bond marketability3 although restrictions that limit premium pricing may result in a different mix of buyers or fewer institutional buyers for the bonds the issuer will realize a savings provided that the yields to maturity and true interest cost remain below the yields to maturity in a premium pricing model  true interest cost tic is the cost of issuing a bond taking into account both the underwriter’s fees and the interest rate tic measures the cost in present value time value of money stated differently tic is the rate of interest compounded semiannually required to discount the payments of principal and interest paid over the life of the issue to the original purchase price note actual figures may vary somewhat from those shown in the tables above due to rounding march 23
