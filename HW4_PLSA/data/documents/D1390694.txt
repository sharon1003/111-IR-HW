cetus constellation cetus constellation is located in the northern sky also known as the whale it is one of the largest constellations in the sky the constellation was named after cetus the sea monster from the greek myth about andromeda in the myth the princess was sacrificed to the monster as punishment for her mother cassiopeia’s boastfulness the constellation cetus lies in the region of the sky called the water along with several other constellations with names evocative of water eridanus the river aquarius the water bearer pisces the fish etc it was catalogued by the greek astronomer ptolemy in the 2nd century cetus is home to the barred spiral galaxy messier 77 and several wellknown stars deneb kaitos beta ceti menkar alpha ceti tau ceti and the famous variable star mira omicron ceti facts location  mapcetus is the fourth largest constellation in the sky occupying an area of 1231 square degrees it lies in the first quadrant of the southern hemisphere sq1 and can be seen at latitudes between 70° and 90° the neighboring constellations are aquarius aries eridanus fornax pisces sculptor and taurus cetus belongs to the perseus family of constellations along with andromeda auriga cassiopeia cepheus lacerta pegasus perseus and triangulum cetus has 14 stars with known planets and contains one messier object messier 77 m77 ngc 1068 the brightest star in the constellation is deneb kaitos beta ceti there are three meteor showers associated with cetus the october cetids the eta cetids and the omicron cetids cetus constellation map by iau and skytelescope magazine mythcetus represents the sea monster from the greek myth of the princess andromeda whose boastful mother cassiopeia angered the sea god poseidon and the nereids sea nymphs by claiming that she was more beautiful than any of them to appease the sea god and the nymphs cassiopeia and her husband king cepheus had to sacrifice their young daughter to cetus a sea monster sent by poseidon to punish the king and queen or watch the monster ravage their land andromeda was chained to a rock and left to the sea monster but to her good fortune the hero perseus was passing by just as cetus was about to devour her perseus rescued the princess and killed cetus he and andromeda were later married cetus was commonly depicted by the greeks as a hybrid creature it had forefeet huge jaws and a scaly body like a giant sea serpent even though the constellation is also known as the whale the mythical creature in the depictions does not in fact look like a whale major stars in cetusdeneb kaitos diphda – β ceti beta cetibeta ceti is the brightest star in the constellation it has an apparent magnitude of 204 and is approximately 963 lightyears distant beta ceti is an orange giant belonging to the spectral type k0 iii it has left the main sequence stage of evolution and is on its way to becoming a red giant with a surface temperature of 4800 k the star is slightly cooler than the sun beta ceti is sometimes known by its traditional names deneb kaitos and diphda deneb kaitos is derived from the arabic phrase al dhanab al ḳaiṭos al janūbīyy which means “the southern tail of cetus” and diphda comes from aḍḍafdaʿ aṯṯānī which is arabic for “the second frog” the star fomalhaut in piscis austrinus is usually referred to as the first frog menkar menkab – α ceti alpha cetialpha ceti is a very old red giant star approximately 249 light years distant the star will eventually eject its outer layers to form a planetary nebula leaving a large white dwarf remnant it has an apparent magnitude of 254 the star’s traditional name menkar comes from the arabic word for “nostril” alpha ceti is often used in works of science fiction most notably in star trek the original series alpha ceti v was the planet on which khan and his crew were exiled in star trek enterprise the same planet provided refuge to humanity after the xindi destroyed the earth mira – ο ceti omicron cetiomicron ceti better known as mira is a binary star consisting of a red giant and a companion star the system is approximately 420 light years distant mira a a red giant belonging to the spectral type m7 iiie is an oscillating variable star that serves as a prototype for an entire class of variables the mira variables there are between 6000 and 7000 known stars belonging to this group they are all red giants whose surfaces oscillate in such a way as to cause variations in brightness over periods ranging from 80 to more than 1000 days location of mira and tau ceti star map by torsten bronger mira was the first nonsupernova variable star discovered with the possible exception of algol in the constellation perseus which was confirmed as a variable only in 1667 mira is believed to be about six billion years old the companion star mira b is a high temperature white dwarf that is accreting mass from the red giant the two form a symbiotic pair the closest one of its kind to the sun mira is the brightest periodic variable star that cannot be seen by the naked eye during a part of its cycle it has a period of 332 days its variability was first documented by the german astronomer david fabricius in 1596 fabricius believed it was a nova until he saw the star again in 1609 frisian astronomer johannes holwarda who determined the star’s variation cycle is usually credited for discovering its variability it was the polish astronomer johannes hevelius who named the star mira meaning “wonderful” in latin the star is shedding a trail of material from its outer envelope nasa’s galaxy evolution explorer space telescope has revealed a tail 13 light years in length trailing after miraτ ceti tau cetitau ceti is a cool class g g85 dwarf with an apparent magnitude of 35 it is one of the nearest stars to our solar system lying only 119 light years away it has a mass only about 78 percent that of the sun and is one of the very few stars less massive than the sun that are nevertheless visible to the naked eye it is a metaldeficient star with a high proper motion its luminosity is equal to only 55 of the sun’s luminosity tau ceti and epsilon eridani in eridanus constellation were the two nearby stars similar to the sun that cornell university astronomer frank drake picked for project ozma a pioneering seti experiment in 1960 aiming to discover intelligent signals from space needless to say there weren’t any significant findings deep sky objects in cetusmessier 77 ngc 1068 authors – xray nasa cxc mit c canizares d evans et al optical nasa stsc i radio

is one of the largest galaxies listed in messier’s catalogue messier 77 was discovered by the french astronomer pierre méchain in 1780 and then catalogued by charles messier méchain originally described the object as a nebula while messier and william herschel described it as a star cluster the galaxy can be easily found 07 degrees eastsoutheast from delta ceti a fourth magnitude star the galaxy has an active galactic nucleus agn which is blocked from view by intergalactic dust the galaxy’s core is a strong radio source bernard yarnton mills was the first to discover this he designated

astronomer william herschel in 1783 next to messier 77 ngc 1055 is a largest member of a galaxy group that also includes ngc 1073 and several smaller irregular galaxies it has a diameter of about
