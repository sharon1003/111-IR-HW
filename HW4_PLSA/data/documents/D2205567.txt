boomerang a boomerang is a thrown tool typically constructed as a flat airfoil that is designed to spin about an axis perpendicular to the direction of its flight a returning boomerang is designed to return to the thrower it is well known as a weapon used by indigenous australians for hunting boomerangs have been historically used for hunting as well as a sport and entertainment they are commonly

from where it was sent a boomerang is traditionally a long wooden device although historically boomeranglike devices have also been made from bones modern boomerangs used for sport are often made from thin aircraft plywood plastics such as abs polypropylene phenolic paper or even hightech materials such as carbon fibrereinforced plastics boomerangs come in many shapes and sizes depending on their geographic or tribal origins and intended function many people think of a boomerang as the australian type although today there are many types of more easily usable boomerangs such as the crossstick the pinwheel the tumblestick the boomabird and many other less common types an important distinction should be made between returning boomerangs and nonreturning boomerangs returning boomerangs fly and are examples of the earliest heavierthanair humanmade flight a returning boomerang has two or more airfoil wings arranged so that the spinning creates unbalanced aerodynamic forces that curve its path so that it travels in an elliptical path and returns to its point of origin when thrown correctly while a throwing stick can also be shaped overall like a returning boomerang it is designed to travel as straight as possible so that it can be aimed and thrown with great force to bring down the game its surfaces therefore are symmetrical and not uneven like the aerofoils which give the returning boomerang its characteristic curved flight the most recognisable type of the boomerang is the lshaped returning boomerang while nonreturning boomerangs throwing sticks or shaunies were used as weapons returning boomerangs have been used primarily for leisure or recreation returning boomerangs were also used to decoy birds of prey thrown above the long grass to frighten game birds into flight and into waiting nets modern returning boomerangs can be of various shapes or sizes historical evidence also points to the use of nonreturning boomerangs by the native americans of california and arizona and inhabitants of southern india for killing birds and rabbits 2 indeed some boomerangs were not thrown at all but were used in hand to hand combat by indigenous australians 3 ancient egyptian examples however have been recovered and experiments have shown that they functioned as returning boomerangs 4boomerangs can be variously used as hunting weapons percussive musical instruments battle clubs firestarters decoys for hunting waterfowl and as recreational play toys the smallest boomerang may be less than 10 centimetres 4 in from tip to tip and the largest over 180 cm 59 ft in length 5 tribal boomerangs may be inscribed andor painted with designs meaningful to their makers most boomerangs seen today are of the tourist or competition sort and are almost invariably of the returning type etymology  editthe origin of the term is mostly certain but many researchers have different theories on how the word entered into the english vocabulary one source asserts that the term entered the language in 1827 adapted from an extinct aboriginal language of new south wales australia but mentions a variant womurrang which it dates to 1798 6 the boomerang was first encountered by western people at farm cove  port jackson  australia in december 1804 when a weapon was witnessed during a tribal skirmish 7 the white spectators were justly astonished at the dexterity and incredible force with which a bent edged waddy resembling slightly a turkish scimytar was thrown by bungary a native distinguished by his remarkable courtesy the weapon thrown at 20 or 30 yards 18 or 27 m distance twirled round in the air with astonishing velocity and alighting on the right arm of one of his opponents actually rebounded to a distance not less than 70 or 80 yards 64 or 73 m leaving a horrible contusion behind and exciting universal admiration— the sydney gazette and new south wales advertiser 23 december 1804david collins listed womurrāng as one of eight aboriginal names of clubs in 1798 8 a 1790 anonymous manuscript on aboriginal language of new south wales reported boomerrit as the scimiter 9in 1822 it was described in detail and recorded as a boumarrang in the language of the turuwal people a subgroup of the darug of the georges river near port jackson the turawal used other words for their hunting sticks but used boomerang to refer to a returning throwstick 10history  editdistribution of boomerangs in australia australian aboriginal boomerangs depictions of boomerangs being thrown at animals such as kangaroos appear in some of the oldest rock art in the world the indigenous australian rock art of the kimberly region which is potentially up to 50000 years old 11 stencils and paintings of boomerangs also appear in the rock art of west papua including on birds head peninsula and kaimana likely dating to the last glacial maximum when lower sea levels led to cultural continuity between papua and arnhem land in northern australia 12 the oldest surviving australian aboriginal boomerangs come from a cache found in a peat bog in the wyrie swamp of south australia and date to 10000 bc though traditionally thought of as australian boomerangs have been found also in ancient europe egypt and north america hunting sticks discovered in europe seem to have formed part of the stone age arsenal of weapons 13 one boomerang that was discovered in jaskinia obłazowa in the carpathian mountains in poland was made of mammoths tusk and is believed based on ams dating of objects found with it to be about 30000 years old 14 15 in the netherlands boomerangs have been found in vlaardingen and velsen from the first century bc king tutankhamun the famous pharaoh of ancient egypt who died over 3300 years ago owned a collection of boomerangs of both the straight flying hunting and returning variety 13no one knows for sure how the returning boomerang was invented but some modern boomerang makers speculate that it developed from the flattened throwing stick still used by the australian aborigines and other indigenous peoples around the world including the navajo in north america a hunting boomerang is delicately balanced and much harder to make than a returning one the curving flight characteristic of returning boomerangs was probably first noticed by early hunters trying to tune their throwing sticks to fly straight 13modern use  editmodern sport boomerangs today boomerangs are mostly used for recreation there are different types of throwing contests accuracy of return aussie round trick catch maximum time aloft fast catch and endurance see below the modern sport boomerang often referred to as a boom or rang is made of finnish birch plywood hardwood plastic or composite materials and comes in many different shapes and colours most sport boomerangs typically weigh less than 100 grams 35 oz with mta boomerangs boomerangs used for the maximumtimealoft event often under 25 grams 09 oz boomerangs have also been suggested as an alternative to clay pigeons in shotgun sports where the flight of the boomerang better mimics the flight of a bird offering a more challenging target 16the modern boomerang is often computeraided designed with precision airfoils the number of wings is often more than 2 as more lift is provided by 3 or 4 wings than by 2 17 18in 1992 german astronaut ulf merbold performed an experiment aboard spacelab that established that boomerangs function in zero gravity as they do on earth french astronaut jeanfrançois clervoy aboard mir repeated this in 1997 19 in 2008 japanese astronaut takao doi again repeated the experiment on board the international space station 20 21hunting  editit is thought by some that the shape and elliptical flight path of the returning boomerang makes it useful for hunting birds and small animals or that noise generated by the movement of the boomerang through the air or by a skilled thrower lightly clipping leaves of a tree whose branches house birds would help scare the birds towards the thrower it is further supposed by some that this was used to frighten flocks or groups of birds into nets that were usually strung up between trees or thrown by hidden hunters 22 in southeastern australia it is claimed that boomerangs were made to hover over a flock of ducks mistaking it for a hawk the ducks would dive away toward hunters armed with nets or clubs 1 despite these notions and similar claims by a few european writers there is no independently contemporaneous record of any aboriginal peoples using a returning boomerang as a weapon traditionally most boomerangs used by aboriginal groups in australia were nonreturning these weapons sometimes called throwsticks or kylies were used for hunting a variety of prey from kangaroos to parrots at a range of about 100 metres 330 ft a 2kg 44 lb nonreturning boomerang could inflict mortal injury to a large animal 1 a throwstick thrown nearly horizontally may fly in a nearly straight path and could fell a kangaroo on impact to the legs or knees while the longnecked emu could be killed by a blow to the neck  citation needed hooked nonreturning boomerangs known as beaked kylies used in northern central australia have been claimed to kill multiple birds when thrown into a dense flock it should be noted that throwsticks are used as multipurpose tools by todays aboriginal peoples and besides throwing could be wielded as clubs used for digging used to start friction fires and are sonorous when two are struck together design  editboomerangs for sale at the 2005 melbourne show a returning boomerang is a rotating wing though it is not a requirement that the boomerang be in its traditional shape it is usually flat a falling boomerang starts spinning and most then fall in a spiral when the boomerang is thrown with high spin a boomerang flies in a curve rather than a straight line when thrown correctly a boomerang returns to its starting point returning boomerangs consist of two or more arms or wings connected at an angle each wing is shaped as an airfoil as the wing rotates and the boomerang moves through the air this creates airflow over the wings and this creates lift on both wings however during onehalf of each blades rotation it sees a higher airspeed because the rotation tipspeed and the forward speed add and when it is in the other half of the rotation the tip speed subtracts from the forward speed thus if thrown nearly upright each blade generates more lift at the top than the bottom 23while it might be expected that this would cause the boomerang to tilt around the axis of travel because the boomerang has significant angular momentum gyroscopic effect causes the plane of rotation to tilt about an axis that is 90 degrees to the direction of flight and this is what curves the flight in such a way that it will tend to return 23thus gyroscopic precession is what makes the boomerang return to the thrower when thrown correctly this is also what makes the boomerang fly straight up into the air when thrown incorrectly with the exception of longdistance boomerangs they should not be thrown sidearm or like a frisbee but rather thrown with the long axis of the wings rotating in an almostvertical plane fast catch boomerangs usually have three or more symmetrical wings seen from above whereas a long distance boomerang is most often shaped similar to a question mark 24 maximum time aloft boomerangs mostly have one wing considerably longer than the other this feature along with carefully executed bends and twists in the wings help to set up an autorotation effect to maximise the boomerangs hovertime in descending from the highest point in its flight some boomerangs have turbulators —bumps or pits on the top surface that act to increase the lift as boundary layer transition activators to keep attached turbulent flow instead of laminar separation modern construction  editthis section does not cite any

pattern is placed on the plywood so that the wood grain runs across from the tip of one end of the boomerang to the tip of the other end try to get the grain of the outer ply running at 45 degrees to the length of the arms if there is any warp in the wood make sure that this produces dihedral on the upper side of the boomerang ie if the airfoil is uppermost and the boomerang is on a flat surface then the wingtips are raised slightly above the surface any anhedral and the boomerang wont fly the pattern is traced on to the boomerang with a pencil the boomerang shape is cut out of the plywood this basic cut out is called the blank an outline is drawn on the top of the blank to show the areas to be shaped for the leading and trailing edges of the wings the profiles of the wings are shaped the top of the leading edge of each wing is decreased at a 45° angle while the rear of the wing is angled down to leave 1–2 mm thick trailing edge the bottom face of the leading edge is trimmed back slightly the tips of the wings are shaped down to the same thickness as the trailing edge the various layers of the plywood serve as an outline that helps the worker achieve equal slopes a shallow section may also be cut out from the bottom surface of each wing for example this might consist of a 5cm long strip near the wing tip and behind the leading edge using progressively finer sandpaper the surface of the boomerang is smoothed carefully check the boomerang for a slight amount of dihedral 2–3 mm on both wings at this point if there isnt any introduce some by heating the boomerang either over a heat source or a brief spell in the microwave oven about 30 seconds on high – if the boomerang is just about uncomfortably hot to handle youve got it just about right bend up the tips of the wings and place the boomerang on a flat surface with a coin under each tip and a weight bag of sugar on the elbow of the boomerang allow it to cool for twenty minutes or more after spraying the surface with sanding sealer the surface is smoothed with fine steel wool the boomerang is then painted again tuning the flight  editthis section does not cite any sources please help improve this

times to check if it works the extreme subtleties of the aerodynamic forces on the light wooden boomerang make it surprisingly difficult to predict how the finished boomerang will perform two apparently identical boomerangs may radically differ in their flight patterns for example they may climb uncontrollably they may fall repeatedly into the ground they may exhibit long narrow pattern nonreturning flight or display other erratic behaviour the only sure way to know is to flighttest them there are several methods to correct problems for example the wing profiles might be adjusted by additional sanding plywood boomerangs may be heated for a short time in a microwave oven which softens the glue between the layers and then can be carefully intentionally warped angle of attack of the leading arm and the dingle arm can be adjusted as can the overall dihedral angle of the wings all with some effect there are many other esoteric tuning techniques as well tuning boomerangs is more of a slowly learned art than a science the quality of the boomerang is also checked throughout this process a tuned boomerang should be stored carefully on a flat surface away from too much humidity direct sunlight or heat these conditions can subtly affect the shape of the boomerang and ruin its flight characteristics and the boomerang will then need to be retuned the hunting boomerang is more delicately balanced and is therefore much harder to make than a returning one when thrown this type of boomerang needs to develop no unbalanced aerodynamic forces that would affect its flight path so that it will fly true to the target art renaissance  editthis section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be

40 m 22 and 44 yd boomerangs are generally thrown in treeless large open spaces that are twice as large as the range of the boomerang a right or lefthanded boomerang can be thrown with either hand but the flight direction will depend upon the boomerang not the thrower throwing a boomerang with the wrong hand requires a throwing motion that many throwers may find awkward the correct launch orientation makes the boomerangs flight begin by flying into the wind then having its flight take it through the eye of the wind and finally returning downwind using the winds speed to help complete its flight back to the thrower it is the spin that makes the boomerang return and the strength of throw and spin must be varied according to the speed of the wind – the stronger the wind the less power is required to provide lift enough to make the return journey in other words the stronger the wind the softer the boomerang is thrown a light wind of three to five miles per hour is considered ideal if the wind is strong enough to fly a kite then it is usually too strong for boomerangs a properly thrown boomerang should curve around to the left climb gently level out in midflight arc around and descend slowly and then finish by popping up slightly hovering then stalling near the thrower ideally this momentary hovering or stalling will allow the catcher the opportunity to clamp their hands shut horizontally on the boomerang from above and below sandwiching the centre between their hands competitions and records  editin international competition a world cup is held every second

october 2009longdistance boomerang throwers aim to have the boomerang go the furthest possible distance while returning close to the throwing point in competition the boomerang must intersect an imaginary surface defined as an infinite vertical extrude of a 40metre 44 yd large line centred on the thrower outside of competitions the definition is not so strict and the thrower is happy whenever heshe does not have to travel 50 metres 55 yd after the throw to recover the boomerang general properties  editlongdistance boomerangs are optimised to have minimal drag while still having enough lift to fly and return for this reason they have a very narrow throwing window which discourages many beginners from continuing with this discipline for the same reason the quality of manufactured longdistance boomerangs is often nondeterministic todays longdistance boomerangs have almost all an s or – question mark shape and have a beveled edge on both sides the bevel on the bottom side is sometimes called an undercut this is to minimise drag and lower the lift lift must be low because the boomerang is thrown with an almost total layover flat longdistance boomerangs are most frequently made of composite material mainly fibre glass epoxy composites flight path  editthe projection of the flight path of longdistance boomerang on the ground resembles a water drop for older types of longdistance boomerangs all types of socalled big hooks the first and last third of the flight path are very low while the middle third is a fast climb followed by a fast descent nowadays boomerangs are made in a way that their whole flight path is almost planar with a constant climb during the first half of the trajectory and then a rather constant descent during the second half from theoretical point of view distance boomerangs are interesting also for the following reason for achieving a different behaviour during different flight phases the ratio of the rotation frequency to the forward velocity has a ushaped function ie its derivative crosses 0 practically it means that the boomerang being at the furthest point has a very low forward velocity the kinetic energy of the forward component is then stored in the potential energy this is not true for other types of boomerangs where the loss of kinetic energy is nonreversible the mtas also store kinetic energy in potential energy during the first half of the flight but then the potential energy is lost directly by the drag related terms  editin noongar language kylie is a flat curved piece of wood similar in appearance to a boomerang that is thrown when hunting for birds and animals 29 kylie is one of the aboriginal words for the hunting stick used in warfare and for hunting animals 30 instead of following curved flight paths kylies fly in straight lines from the throwers they are typically much larger than boomerangs and can travel very long distances due to their size and hook shapes they can cripple or kill an animal or human opponent the word is perhaps an english corruption of a word meaning boomerang taken from one of the western desert languages for example the warlpiri word karli see also  editbatarang
