the best seedling heat mats and thermostats september 3 2016share pin whats app when starting seeds — no matter if you’re starting them for hydroponics or otherwise — it’s important to provide them the perfect germination conditions each type of seed has different conditions but as a general rule most seeds like to be in a growing medium that’s warm because most of us are starting seeds indoors either in preparation for the coming season or to grow them indoors we don’t have the luxury of warm soil so what to do that’s where the almighty seedling heat mat comes into play before i got one of these my germination times for almost anything i was growing were longer and my germination percentage was also lower if you want to look at the products mentioned here they are apollo horticulture 10″x20″ heat mat w digital thermostat hydrofarm 9″x195″ heat mat hydrofarm 48″x20″ heat mat jump start heat mat thermostat for pricing and more info see below why should you germinate with a plant heat mat a graph of soil temperature and seed germination source seeds need four things to germinate properly heat light or lack thereof moisture and oxygen every seed is different and needs different amounts of each of these four variables for now let’s just talk about heat in a normal garden your soil temperature is almost always 510 degrees cooler than your air temperature this is due to water evaporation from the soil causing evaporative cooling as spring comes around and the air temperature rises the temperature of your soil follows suit — but it can take a while gardeners that want to take advantage of spring as soon as it’s sprung almost always opt to germinate indoors so they don’t have to wait for the soil to warm up outside there are other benefits to using a seedling heat mat as well your seeds will be provided a uniform temperature that can be calibrated to the exact requirements of the specific seeds you’re trying to germinate if you have a seedling heat mat with a thermostat by providing your seeds with the optimal temperature moisture light and oxygen you are sending them a signal that it’s time to start growing should you get a heat mat with a thermostat in short yes while you might save about 10 buying a cheap seedling heat mat without a thermostat the benefits of having one are too big to ignore temperature is so important in the germination phase so having the thermostat will allow you to more finely control and set safety shut offs if you decide not to buy one with a thermostat you’re not completely out of luck almost all quality plant heating mats come with a built in safety shut off that will trigger when the heat mat reaches a temperature of 10 degrees above the room temperature however this means you have to germinate in small rooms otherwise the heat mat will work too hard to keep the temperature 10 degrees above a colder room and burn itself out the verdict either buy a heat mat with a thermostat or germinate in a smaller room i personally like the flexibility and control of the thermostat it’s not much more expensive so it’s worth it to me seedling mat faqq do i leave the heat mat on 247 yes you leave it on 24 hours a day…but only during seed germination once your seeds sprout and start to pop out of your rapid rooters or soil you should remove the heat mat otherwise the temperature will be too high and your roots will effectively get “cooked”q how do i know what soil temperature my seeds need to germinate well because each plant is different look at the back of your seed packet to figure out the right temperature and timing almost all of them will tell you what temperature to shoot for q what type of growing medium should i use for germination i personally use rapid rooter starter cubes they don’t make a mess hold moisture well and are easy to transplant but you can use standard potting soil or seedling mix as well if you want to q can i make a diy seedling heat mat here’s a pretty good tutorial for diy seedling heat mats but i would personally not bother with it unless you get a lot of joy out of making things yourself it’s probably less effective than a commercial heat mat and when the most expensive heat mats are around 30 it just doesn’t seem worth it to me best seedling heat mat with thermostat apollo horticulture 9x20 seedling heating mat and digital thermostat combo set
