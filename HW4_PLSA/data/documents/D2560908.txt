tachycardiainduced cardiomyopathy an article from the ejournal of the esc council for cardiology practice vol7n°16  13 jan 2009a perezsilva dr jose luis merino fesctachycardiainduced cardiomyopathy is a reversible cause of heart failure and dilated cardiomyopathy tachycardiainduced cardiomyopathy should be considered in all patients with a dilated cardiomyopathy of uncertain origin and who have tachycardia or atrial fibrillation with a fast ventricular rate abolishing tachycardia with drugs or catheter ablation often results in clinical improvement and ventricular function recovery topic s arrhythmias and device therapy background congestive heart failure is one of the major health care problems in western countries its prevalence is increasing and together with diabetes and atrial fibrillation it is considered one of the three cardiovascular epidemics of the third millennium emphasising the importance of diagnosing potentially reversible etiologies of heart failure tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy tic is defined as systolic andor diastolic ventricular dysfunction resulting from a prolonged elevated heart rate which is reversible upon control of the arrhythmia or the heart rate tic has been reported in both experimental models and in patients with incessant or very frequent tachyarrhythmia experimental animal models with sustained rapid pacing can produce severe biventricular systolic dysfunction whipple et al established the first experimental model for biventricular systolic dysfunction in 1962 1 and his model has since been used for many further studies on this topic in the clinical setting tic is usually seen in patients with no previous structural heart disease although it may be responsible for ventricular dysfunction aggravation in those with underlying heart disease 2 data from several studies and from case reports have shown that rate control by cardioversion negative chronotropic agents catheter ablation or antitachycardia pacing results in improvement of the ventricular systolic function i  pathophysiology the normal heart rate in humans is between 55 and 95 beats per minute 3 the sustained heart rate limit above which tic will appear is not well established however a prolonged heart rate above 100 beats per minute may be relevant 4 and deserves attention tic may manifest months to years after the onset of the responsible tachycardia but because tic is a rate dependent cardiomyopathy those patients with higher tachycardia rates develop tic earlier 56 time to onset of ventricular dysfunction is also dependent on the presence of an underlying structural heart disease other factors include the type and duration of tachyarrhythmia the patient’s age drugs and coexisting medical conditions 7 high ventricular rates initially result in cardiac dilatation and mitral regurgitation which are typically associated with elevated ventricular filling pressures decreased contractility right and left ventricular wall thinning and eventually heart failure with neurohormonal activation cardiac output is usually reduced and systemic vascular resistances are typically elevated 8 in experimental models some of these changes can be seen as early as 2448 hours after rapid cardiac pacing with continuing deterioration in ventricular function for up to 35 weeks abnormal calcium handling reduced cellular energy storing and abnormal energy use have been proposed as the underlying mechanisms responsible for this syndrome these mechanisms determine myocardial remodeling cellular changes include loss of myocytes cellular elongation myofibril misalignment and loss of sarcomere register which may be due to derangement of the extracellular matrix 9 table 1  described arrhythmias associated with

reentry vt ventricular pacing at high rates ii  clinical features and diagnosis tic may present itself at any age and has been reported as a result of various tachyarrhythmia mechanisms table i 1014 supraventricular tachycardias are more frequently involved than ventricular arrhythmias fig 1 figure 1 incessant supraventricular tachycardia due to atrioventricular reentry by a concealed accessory pathway in a young male the tachycardia is terminated following adenosine infusion but with almost immediate spontaneous reinitiation however more recently tic has also been described as a result of frequent ventricular ectopic beats this has been explained by the asynergic and inefficient left ventricular contraction of the ectopic beats which is similar to that reported in patients with left bundle branch block or right ventricular pacing the resulting abnormal left ventricular torsion may cause disruption and further progression of asynergic left ventricular wall motion the diagnosis of tic requires awareness about this condition as the underlying arrhythmia may not always be apparent it should be suspected in patients with structural heart disease and heart failure who suffer from chronic or frequently recurring tachyarrhythmias and in all patients with no other obvious explanation for ventricular dysfunction the diagnosis of tic in this latter setting can be only confirmed after cardiac function restoration following tachycardia or heart rate control fig 2 1516 figure 2 chest xray images of the same patient of figure 1 wich were taken on admission left panel and 3 months after right panel successful ablation of the accessory pathway significant resolution of cardiomegaly is apparent iii treatment heart rate normalisation either with rate or rhythm control is the cornerstone of therapy in tic most of the data available come from patients with atrial fibrillation in this setting normalisation of heart rate using any of the two methods rate or rhythm control improves systolic function however in other clinical scenarios tic treatment should be directed to termination of the responsible arrhythmia and to treating heart failure this approach may include antiarrhythmic drug therapy and dc cardioversion although due to the serious potential consequences of this syndrome a definitive cure to the arrhythmia as can be obtained with a catheter ablation should be pursued whenever possible 17 atrioventricular junction conduction ablation followed by pacemaker implantation is also an option for those patients in whom a definitive cure cannot be obtained by other means however it has recently been suggested that even heart rate control using this latter approach is inferior in terms of left ventricular ejection fraction recovery to catheter ablation of the arrhythmia substrate fig 3 18  figure 3 ejection fraction improvement following pulmonary vein isolation and av nodal ablation in patients with heart failure 18iv  prognosis ventricular dysfunction recovery in tic patients following sinus rhythm restoration is variable it depends on the rate and duration of the responsible arrhythmia both experimental models and some reports in humans 1821 showed the greatest left ventricular ejection fraction recovery 1 month after arrhythmia cessation and a more gradual recovery reaching a complete normalisation up to one year thereafter in some cases nevertheless the impact of recurrent or new tachyarrhythmias on left ventricular function has been poorly assessed this has been studied in a group of patients with tic who were followed for 12 years 22 and those who had recurrent tachycardia had a rapidly declining left ventricular function heart failure and a high incidence of sudden cardiac death tachycardiainduced cardiomyopathy is a reversible cause of heart failure and dilated cardiomyopathy tachycardiainduced cardiomyopathy should be considered in all patients with a dilated cardiomyopathy of uncertain origin and who have tachycardias or atrial fibrillation with a fast ventricular rate abolishing tachycardia with drugs or catheter ablation often results in clinical improvement and ventricular function recovery q and a 16 jan 2009  question dr savaş celebi ankaratürkiye  how can we discriminate tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy from those secondary tachycardias just following cardiomyopathy for example tic after atrial fibrillation vs atrial fibrillation due to cardiomyopathy answer prof jose l merino you can suspect tic or a component of tic in a patient already with ventricular dysfunction due to other causes when the patient presents with an almost incessant heart rate above 130 bpm and there is no apparent cause infection shock etc for it nevertheless sometimes distinction between tic and other causes of ventricular dysfunction can be very tricky and only possible after hr control references1 whipple gh sheffield lt woodman eg reversible congestive heart
