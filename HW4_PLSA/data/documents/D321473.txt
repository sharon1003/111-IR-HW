have traffic lights outside the cities road conditions are considerably worse panama experiences heavy rains from april to december and even in the cities this can lead to road closings further its

smuggle narcotics and people if boating avoid suspicious vessels and report any suspicious activity to the authorities a word on health in general the medical facilities in the cities are very good
