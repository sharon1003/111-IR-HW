control the visibility and display of objects in a plan view every plan view has a property called view range also known as a visible range the horizontal planes that define the view range are top cut plane and bottom the top and bottom clip planes represent the topmost and bottommost portion of the view range the cut plane is a plane that determines the height at which certain elements in the view are shown as cut these 3 planes define the primary range of the view range view depth is an additional plane beyond the primary range change the view depth to show elements below the bottom clip plane by default the view depth coincides with the bottom clip plane the following elevation shows the view range of a plan view top cut plane bottom offset from bottom primary range and view depth the plan view on the right shows the result for this view range display of elements in the plan view elements outside the view range do not display in the view unless you specify an underlay to show a level outside the view range for information about the underlay view property see view properties elements display in the plan view using the cut line weight the projection line weight or the beyond line style according to the rules described in the sections below to change the display of line weights for cut elements and projection elements use the object styles tool to change the display of the beyond line style use the line styles tool display of elements in reflected ceiling plan rcp views is similar to their display in plan views with the exception that elements are presented as viewed from below and mirrored elements intersected by the cut plane in a plan view revit uses the following rules to display elements that are intersected by the cut plane these elements are drawn using the cut line weight of the element category when the element category does not have a cut line weight the category is not cuttable the element is drawn using the projection line weight exceptions for the display of elements intersected by the cut plane include the following walls shorter than 6 feet or 2 meters are not cut even if they intersect the cut plane the 6 feet or 2 meters are measured from the top of the bounding box to the bottom of the primary view range for example if you create a wall whose top is 6 feet above the bottom clip plane the wall is cut at the cut plane when the top of the wall is less than 6 feet the entire wall shows as projection even where it intersects the cut plane this behavior always occurs when the top constraint property for the wall is specified as unconnected for some categories individual families are defined as cuttable or noncuttable if a family is defined as noncuttable and its elements intersect the cut plane they are drawn using the projection line weight see about noncuttable families in the following elevation blue highlighting indicates elements that intersect the cut plane the plan view on the right shows the following elements that are drawn using the cut line weight walls door and windowelements that are drawn using the projection line weight because they are noncuttable casework elements below the cut plane and above the bottom clip plane in a plan view revit draws these elements using the projection line weight of the element category in the following elevation blue highlighting indicates elements that are below the cut plane and above the bottom clip plane the plan view on the right shows the following elements that are drawn using the projection line weight because they are not intersected by the cut plane cabinet desk and chairelements below the bottom clip plane and within the view depth elements within the view depth are drawn using the beyond line style regardless of the elements category exceptions floors structural floors stairs and ramps located outside the view range use an adjusted range that is 4 feet about 122 meters below the bottom of the primary range within this adjusted range the elements are drawn using the projection line weight for the category if they exist outside this adjusted range but within the view depth these elements are drawn using the beyond line style for example in the following elevation blue highlighting indicates elements that occur below the bottom clip plane and within the view depth the plan view on the right shows the following an element foundation within the view depth that is drawn using the beyond line style an element that is drawn using the projection line weight for its category because it meets the exception conditions elements above the cut plane and below the top clip plane these elements are not displayed in a plan view unless their categories are window casework or generic model elements in these 3 categories are drawn using the projection line weight as viewed from above for example in the following elevation blue highlighting indicates elements that occur between the top of the view range and the cut plane the plan view on the right shows the following wallmounted casework that is drawn using the projected line weight in this case the dashed line style for projection lines is defined in the casework family the wall sconce a lighting category that is not drawn in the plan because its category is not window casework or generic model parent topic plan views related concepts about plan views about plan
