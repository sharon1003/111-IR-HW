home  garden other  home  garden do i have to vent my dryer and why exactly i have a clothes dryer inside my house i spent a long time closing every hole in said house and ive no interest in poking new ones but everyone tells me that i will ruin my walls if i dont vent the dryer to the outside sooner rather than later a what is the worstcase scenario if i dont vent it show more update i need to know the specifics of what the moisture will really do i mean i also take showers and that moisture doesnt hurt anything follow 8 answers answers relevance rating newest oldest best answer dont underestimate the amount of moisture released during a single load drying much more than accumulates during a typical shower think mold mildew fungus etc also the dryer will not dry as well without proper venting longer dry times and more clothes damage due to increased time in the dryer will more than offset any heat loss due to the vent most new vent caps come with a flap that closes when there is no outgoing airflow to keep some air and critters out like the previous answerer lint flying around your house is never good not just dust but uncaptured lint is a leading cause of dryer fires source s10 years appliance manufacturingsalesshuey24 · 9 years ago3 0 comment heating is expensive but so is drywall if it rots from the heat it will then you have to keep that wall replaced very expensive i have done the thing with the stocking but only in a large basement room  you do have to empty it quite often you would still have some of the extra dust  just not as much if your dryer is in the living part of the house lint dust will build up  can be a fire hazard the best thing is to go ahead  have it vented it saves you money in the long run  may even save your life it is not expensive to do  you can seal around the vent to make it permanent if done correctly it will not let in cold air in the winter timemazell41 · 9 years ago1 0 comment lots of mold you probably keep the door closed when you are showering i bet also if you use pantyhose to block the lint the air flow from the dryer is blocked and it will work a lot harder to get the clothes dry if you are really concerned about the dryer vent you can get an allinone washerdryer it is designed so the lint goes down the drain but it uses more energy and usually you have to take half of the clothes out in order for them to dry plus the nylon or whatever you use to block the lint will be a fire hazard oh and the usual solution if you live in a house is to put the dryer in the garage or other small room attached to the house where you can shut the door build a little enclosed porch or something but remember if it gets too cold outside and you have a washer outside the pipes might freeze and burst trillian · 9 years ago1 1 comment if moisture is the concern then why do people use humidifiers when the heats on your house will become dusty from the lint but the solution to that is putting a knee high hose over the vent on the back of the dryer make sure to fasten it with a rubber band so that it will stay on if the dryer is in the basement your helping keep the basement warm judy · 9 years ago1 1 comment in the winter when the heat is running your house may actually be very dry and the extra moisture could be a good thing many people run a humidifier in the winter to add moisture but you would want to run the vent into a trap device that keeps the lint out of the air this is what we used to do before we got a humidifier in the summer when your house is apt to be humid venting outside would be smart to help you keep your house cool b anne · 9 years ago2 1 comment i agree you need an inside dryer vent kit available at home centers or appliance stores the nylon over the hose idea is baaaad for all the stated reasonsmps · 9 years ago0 0 commentthe moisture that the dryer takes out of your clothes will go in your house  bad and the lint that the lint screen misses doesnt seem like much but it will add up and make your house really dustycherrihill · 9 years ago0 0 comment you need an insider dryer vent kit i used one for years and never had any problems httpwwwimprovementscatalogcomhomek h · 9 years ago0 0 comment maybe you would like to learn more about one of these should you donate your car look for franchises for sale considering an online college looking for a roofing contractor
