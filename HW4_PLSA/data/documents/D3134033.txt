mmos that is around i can hear the pitchforks and mob startingpermalink embed save – thundercat456 3 points 3 years ago in fact the newest expansion is my personnal favorite they made the so much better yeah for their 10th anniversary permalink embed save parent – lokiness 2 points 3 years ago ive been playing elite dangerous a lot lately epic first person space sim complete missions collect bounties upgrade your ship buy new ships explore the billions of star systems its both relaxing and intense at times i highly recommend it only downside is that the in game tutorial is pretty bad pretty much have to watch some videos to figure out how to landdock at space ports best way to mauvere ships etc this will be my primary game for a whileat least until star citizen comes outpermalink embed save – glimpee 1 point 2 years ago i didnt have to watch any videos the games pretty intuitive once you look at the keybindings imothe initial launch check really helped toopermalink embed save parent – sirsersur 1 point 3 years ago league of legends is undoubtedly the one game with the biggest playerbasepermalink embed save – deleted 1 point 3 years ago i recommend checking out insurgency and red orchestra 2 they have active communities and you wont have any trouble getting into well populated gamespermalink embed save – redundancy2 1 point 3 years ago just picked up insurgency over the winter sale been a lot of fun bought it for a friend and he stopped playing after one match because its too hard permalink embed save parent – deleted 1 point 3 years ago lol its not fun if its not hardpermalink embed save parent – glimpee 3 points 2 years agowhat if its hard because it has complex controls but once you master them you can do amazingsuper fun stuffactually reminds me of the attack on titan emulatorlook it up its the only browser game i toleratepermalink embed save parent – deleted 3 points 2 years ago that looks very strange but im interested ill give that a go tonightpermalink embed save parent – glimpee 2 points 2 years agoits hard to learn but fun as you begin to master it idk if you watched attack on titan but they are giant maneating people whos only weakness is the back of their neck the goal is to build up as much speed as possible and then slash the back of a neck it takes intense precision and skill as well as basic understanding of physics on a mechanical level once you learn how to actually get kills it gets fun but that might take a few days eventually you can just go so fast and do the craziest shit super fun for a browser gamepermalink embed save parent – deleted 1 point 3 years ago id say team fortress 2 definitely make it on any list of most popular multiplayer gamespermalink embed save – block xelite 1 point 3 years ago have you tried smite its a f2p moba but not the same as dota and lo l the viewing angle is from a behindthebackoverhead type viewpoint and new players can get into the learning curve pretty fast with some help from youtube and nice players that you find every so often also if you do consider this game just dont play leagued matches if you dont want to encounter the supercompetitvepermalink embed save – ishatbrx 1 point 3 years ago i like the fps elements of gameplay such as the crosshair on screen at all times to aim with smite is a lot of funpermalink embed save parent – ellisd326 1 point 3 years ago payday2 hit me up on steam ill help get you started if you end up grabbing itpermalink embed save – haightn ashbury 1 point 3 years ago battlefield 4 has some packed servers extra packed with splosionspermalink embed save – mt1rdt 1 point 3 years ago has to be league and dotapermalink embed save – x1131  s 2 points 3 years ago havent tried lol i tried dota and got annihilated everyone is just so competitive if you screw up once you wont be able to catch up to your opponents levelpermalink embed save parent – deleted 2 points 3 years ago you can catch up in dota its just one of those things you have to learn and to some extent it depends on your hero if you choose a hard carry and die a couple times early game yeah youre fucked but if youre playing support as new players should you can die and its not a big dealpermalink embed save parent – nonnegotiable 1 point 3 years ago i dont know if its changed since i tried it back when steam was handing out beta passes like candy but when i tried i couldnt even figure out how to play it it was just pick a guy gopermalink embed save parent – deleted 1 point 3 years ago i recommend playing the single player tutorials the game is explained to you just imagine each hero as a pokemon with unique skills and effectiveness versus certain other heroes once you know the basic gameplay mechanics it becomes a lot more strategizing hero pickspermalink embed save parent – nonnegotiable 1 points 3 years ago im guessing those werent in when i tried it i remember launching the game looking at the main menu and being absolutely lost i think it took me almost half an hour to figure out how to start a match with just bots and then when i wanted a match with just me and my friend things took even longer to set up has the uimenus been made morenavigable since its actually been released i know i shouldnt let my prerelease impressions impact my opinion on the game but it was just frustrating even trying to get into a gamepermalink embed save parent – packfanmoore 1 point 3 years ago with those games u will get anhilated early on ive been playing for a long while im too busy to try elo climbing so i know basic builds positioning rotations etc ive been helping a good friend of mine by playing in the same room n mentoring him a bit hes way farther than i was at his lvl so if u get into that try seeing if a friend will come play a few games a week with you to help you along n explain what you did wrong it helps tremendouslypermalink embed save parent – deleted 1 point 3 years ago try lo l its a blast i love pv p but suck at it terribly so i play a ton of team vs ai bots a lot of fun stillpermalink embed save parent – glimpee 3 points 2 years ago mobas are not true pv ppermalink embed save parent – deleted 1 point 3 years ago for sure league and dota 2 hearthstone got huge over its first year of release tons and tons of players and content for the game super casual to get into but can offer quite a bit of competition if you are looking for it heroes of the storm seems like it will end up big after its beta wo w got a boost this last expansion csgo and tf2 typically are at the top of steam charts but you already mentioned those you can also look into warframe there are a lot of players and its something different payday 2 h1z1 not sure if it will last and arma 3 are other games that typically hit top 1020 on steampermalink embed save parent – den422 3 points 3 years ago h1z1 is everything that day z was not i love it great graphics awesome gameplay nice world cool weapons rust is another fun one its like minecraft but real life and actually goodpermalink embed save – shaddupwillya 2 points 3 years ago and h1z1 is only 20 for a soon to be f2p game hard passpermalink embed save parent – kenman 1 points 3 years ago whats your endgoal it seems like you might not be completely forthcoming in your post i need recommendations for popular multiplayer pc games one with lots of players emphasis addedwhy must it be popular and with lots of players there are plenty of games that arent in the top 5 or even the top 50 that still have thriving communities with lots of regular active players i just feel that youre looking for the wrong things and setting yourself up for disappointment are you looking for a social aspect to the game and that more players will mean more social opportunities or are you looking to get involved in activities outside of the game ie producing a website or app that supports the game etc  where more players would mean more recognition andor revenue or is there some other motivationpermalink embed save – x1131  s 3 points 3 years ago i figure the game that the most people are playing should be the funnest in theory anyway allot of people are playing allot of crappy games the more people there are the lower the chance that the community could die off and more chances for social interactions plus playing popular games gives me a false sense of socialization by interacting with people as a community all i want to do is sit at home and play video games while simultaneously communicating and interacting with people via that video gamepermalink embed save parent – kenman 2 points 3 years ago ok so that helps a lot i wouldnt worry about the community dying off too much if i were you as long as its not an early access game if its popular now itll probably remain relatively popular for at least several more years anyways it sounds like youre really after the social aspects of gaming and i think you can find social opportunities for pretty much any online game but you need to determine the type of social interaction youre after as well as judge the playerbase to see if its a fit for you example minecraft is wildly popular and it is somewhat social online though its almost purely through chat unless you organize and get voice comms theres also a wide variety of players in mc and so it might be hitormiss finding your type of people your age group etc lo l is the obvious most popular game but its really not very social at all unless you have some friends that you can consistently play with otherwise the ingame community can be very harsh to newcomers and besides that theres very few actual social opportunities other than chatting after the game which rarely happens beyond a gg most mobas are going to be like this now it wont be impossible to make it social but its going to be external to the game and youre going to have to work for it probably the most social type of game out there is going to be an mmo since theyre pretty much built around forging social bonds theres quite a few people that are tired of whatever mmo theyre playing but they keep playing because they enjoy socializing with their friends same story for me when i played wo w i didnt want to quit because i had 80 friends that i was going to miss talking to all the time if youve never tried an mmo ignore what others have said and give it a try for a little while if you can find a nice guild its like finding a lot of longlost friendspermalink embed save parent – mookler 1 points 3 years ago i tried day z and it was mostly crap doesnt mean thousands of people arent playing itpermalink embed save – x1131  s 4 points 3 years ago i find that odd the top reviews are all negative and frankly the game played like an alpha its like the players are masochists that like playing broken gamespermalink embed save parent – mookler 2 points 3 years ago yeah trends dont really make sense sometimes do theypermalink embed save parent – koverp 2 points 3 years ago day z the standalone is of course nowhere as good as the mod of a great gamepermalink embed save parent – deleted 1 point 3 years ago thats because everyone who enjoys it is playing it permalink embed save parent
