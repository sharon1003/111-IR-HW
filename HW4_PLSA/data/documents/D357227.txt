advertisementlike beef pork is divided into primal or wholesale cuts that refer to the part of the animal they come from pork is further subdivided into retail cuts which are the ones found in the supermarket for fresh pork the cut determines the fat content and cooking method only onethird of the pork produced each year is sold fresh the rest is cured smoked or processed curing was once a method of preserving meat so that it would be available throughout the winter today pork is cured for flavor and though the method lengthens cured pork’s storage life most cured pork must be kept refrigerated fresh and cured pork are very different therefore they are discussed separately below fresh pork pork leg fresh hams come from the leg of the hog the whole leg can be sold as a ham that weighs 10 to 14 pounds more often it is divided into butt half and shank half the butt half of which is much meatier these cuts are sold with or without the bone you may also find top leg inside roast sometimes slices are cut from the leg and sold as pork cutlets the leg can be roasted or braised and leg cutlets can be broiled braised or sautéed pork loin this part of the pig supplies the largest number of fresh cuts and also the leanest with meat that is tender and flavorful the loin is divided into three parts blade loin nearest the shoulder center loin and sirloin nearest the leg you may also find top loin chops and center loin cutlets the cuts from either end are not as tender as the center loin and thus the center loin is the most expensive you’ll find both roasts and chops with or without the bone thick chops—an inch or more in thickness—can be broiled sautéed or braised roasts can be roasted or braised pork tenderloin the tenderloin comes from the center loin it is often sold on its own as a roast and is included as part of loin or sirloin chops it is about a foot long and 2 inches in diameter at its thickest point it’s well worth the price—the meat is exceptionally tender and the tenderloin is the leanest cut of fresh pork roast or braise the whole tenderloin it cooks rapidly or slice it into medallions and sauté the slices pork crown roast the loin is also the source of the impressive crown roast which is two center rib roasts fastened together in a circle to form a hollow that can be stuffed and then roasted crown roasts are usually ordered from a butcher since the backbone must be removed or cracked and the rib ends must be trimmed the shoulder end of the loin produces countrystyle ribs which are not true spareribs spareribs come from the side meatier and leaner than spareribs they can be braised broiled or roasted pork shoulder from this section come two large pork roasts boston or shoulder butt and picnic shoulder which is really the foreleg of the pig a boston butt roast is flavorful but contains a lot of sinew it is best braised to dissolve this connective tissue picnic shoulder can be roasted or braised you can also cut these roasts into chunks—or have the butcher do so—then marinate them and grill or broil them pork side the only fresh cut from this section is spareribs these are extremely fatty they are best roasted broiled or braised you can reduce the fat in spareribs if you parboil them before cooking cured pork bacon unlike fresh pork cured ham will retain its rosy color even when fully cooked this is because the nitrites used in curing the pork react chemically with the meat’s myoglobin the type of hemoglobin found in muscle fibers to form nitrosomyoglobin which stays pinkishred even at high temperatures bacon pork belly which comes from the side of the hog is called bacon once it has been cured and smoked a solution of brine and water is injected into the pork belly a smoked flavor may also be injected or the bacon may be smoked after it is cured bacon is very high in fat saturated fat and sodium canadian bacon a leaner alternative to regular bacon canadian bacon is smoked and cured pork loin in canada and great britain it is called back bacon it’s used in much the same way as bacon though it resembles ham in appearance and taste pancetta pancetta is an italianstyle bacon made with

nitrite and sugar some hams are drycured in which the meat is rubbed with salt sugar sodium nitrate sodium nitrite and seasonings these may also be called country hams the drycuring process draws out moisture and intensifies the color and flavor of the meat most hams are sold “fully cooked” that is they have been cooked to a high enough internal temperature to make them safe to eat hams that

protein “ham with natural juices” is at least 185 percent protein “ham–added water” is at least 17 percent protein “ham and water product” can contain any amount of water but must state the percentage of added ingredients on the label you’ll also find some hams labeled lean or extralean lean hams must contain no more than 10 percent fat by weight extralean hams on the other hand contain no more than 5 percent sausage technically sausage can be made from any kind of chopped or ground meat—including poultry fish and even some plant proteins—but most of the familiar varieties are porkbased
