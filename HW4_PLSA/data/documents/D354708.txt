has 359 answers and 11m answer views originally answered what is the physical significance of the maximum power and maximum torque ratings of an automobile as you may have already read horsepower is just a function of torque and engine speed first some definitions horsepower is the rating that describes how powerful an engine is torque can be described as how flexible or how much force can be expressed in a given gear how fast the car accelerates its top speed how fast it feels are all results of the tuning of other components of the car  such as transmission suspension programming etc what many people neglect to notice is that horsepower and torque figures are almost always expressed at a certain engine speed for example you may read 130 hp  3400 rpm 109 ftlb  2800 rpm for most drivers a car will feel more responsive and generally faster when the rpm requirements are low because most divers do not like to have their engine racing along at 6000 rpm compare this to a honda s2000 237 hp  8300 rpm 153 ftlb  7500 rpm what you may or may not know is that most cars cant even run their engines this fast the s2000 is has a considerable amount of power available for the size of the car but in order to access it the driver needs to get into the accelerator and get the engine really spinning this is not how many drivers want to experience driving and will result in the driver experiencing less than the peak capabilities of the car this probably had some effect on the poor sales of the car how does this get back to your original question the peak numbers only tell a part of the story but generally the higher the hp the more powerful the car is more power typically  faster overall acceleration higher maximum speeds higher weight limitstowing capacities etc higher torque numbers result in better ingear acceleration useful for passing or getting the car under way lower engine speed at a given load towing a trailer uphill in an accord and a f150 may be possible for both but the gearing and torque of the accord will make it sound the engine is racing all the way up i should mention that one of the downsides of high torque is when there is limited traction in snow gravel or wet pavements high torque can make it easier to spin out this could impact your ability to get moving from a stop to making the vehicle more prone to losing control when in motion3404k views

owner of several modified audis updated mar 7 2016 · author has 111 answers and 2227k answer views originally answered what is the difference between horsepower and torque i think the physics side has been covered but in practical terms you only need the power curve to describe the performance of a car power is work over time so it directly describes ability to move a certain weight and shape of car from a to b power is used for pretty much any performance calculation out there lets say you want to pass the car in front and need to accelerate your car from speed x to speed y within the space you have available and for simplicity lets say you need an average power somewhere near 150hp during your acceleration now the only question we need to look at is which rpm range will provide you this power in a 18 liter 200 hp high rev na engine you would only get 200hp in a narrow band right up by the redline so you need a close ratio gearbox and pull 60008000 rpm through gear after gear to make your average running the engine right to the redline would be fun but exhausting in a modern 200hp turbo engine you will typically have a wide power band allowing you to make this acceleration pulling 30007000 rpm possibly staying in a single gear a modern 200 hp turbo diesel would give you a wide power band letting you pull 25004000 in each gear but the rpm range is narrow and you would need to use two or three gears and your typical 57 litre lsx v8 would do this pull in pretty much any gear as the power curve barely drops below 150hp anywhere notice how the only change is in rpm this is why imho torque is irrelevant to performance the diesel engine uses the lowest revs so it makes the most torque that only means it needs the beefiest transmission its no faster or slower than the others the reason torque is practically irrelevant is that we have a transmission connected to the engine it makes no difference to performance if you make the required power at 1000 or 10000 rpm you only need to be in the right gear rpm and refinement does make a world of difference to the comfort and driving style though so loads of torque often actually means my diesel can pass in fifth gear which is nice but so can many engines with a good power band but they can rev too i think of torque of the maximum amount if energy the engine can produce in a single combustion stroke while i think of power as the maximum pumping capacity of the engine that is a simplification but stick with it how do you make torque you need maximum flow to get as much fuel and air as possible as aggressive an ignition as the engine can take and minimum flow restriction in and out of the chamber how do you make power you rev past the torque peak until you hit a flow restriction you make less and less energy per combustion stroke but you add more and if them when you add  more cam to make more power you often sacrifice maximum torque for an ability to rev further and ultimately being able to process more air and fuel your engine will extract less energy from the fuel you feed it but you create more power the ultimate example of this is perhaps an f1 engine  making less torque than your everyday family

at maruti suzuki india limited 20152016answered dec 28 2016i will try to give a clear explanation all of us have heard that diesel produces more torque than gasoline engine while gasoline produces more power but only few of us are actually able to feel this concept blogs are already available on internet to develop the thinking for this idea this section however may help you better realise the idea behind this concept let us consider two engines x – bmw 3 series inline 6cylinder petrol engine y – bmw 3 series inline 6cylinder diesel engine the facts are that both x and y have approximately same power averaging 235 kw and same capacity of 29955 cubic centimeter 3l but y generates an impressive 630 nm torque while x generates 450 nm which is way less here we need to understand that why does y which is diesel engine produces much more torque that x let us first try to understand the meaning of – “diesel engine has a higher compression ratio 141 to 251 than gasoline engine 81 to 121” it simply means that the capacity to compress the air in a diesel engine is more than a gasoline engine ie diesel can compress air to a lower final volume than gasoline theoretically compression ratio is total volume of chamber divided by clearance volume volume remaining when piston reaches top dead center so a higher compression ratio would mean either a higher total volume or a lower clearance volume both mean that either piston travels a long distance in cylinder or remaining volume is less when piston reaches top dead center respectively  but actually in the abovespecified example it is a fact that both engines have same volume it means y has lower clearance volume  we have understood that diesel has higher compression ratio now let us see how does it lead to higher torque close your eyes and imagine two engines of same volume where one is y with higher compression ratio probably 161 and other one is x with less compression ratio probably 111 also imagine that compression stroke is coming to end with piston reaching at top in y fuel is injected and burning occurs reaching maximum pressure in x spark is discharged and burning occurs reaching max pressure the max pressure reached in y is 15 to 25 times higher than x this is due to the fact that diesel has higher compression ratio ie air is compressed to a lower volume in diesel now just imagine you are playing the game where we need to hit a given surface with hammer to gain points one who hits with more force gets higher points similar forces are applied on the piston when it reaches the top dead center obviously with much higher magnitude in y due to higher peak pressure the thrust applied is much higher than x it is able to apply a higher thrust force throughout the power stroke due to this higher thrust applied on piston a diesel suv is able to move up a hill with 5 to 6 people sitting in it because higher torque is transferred to the wheels coming from crankshaft in x instead thrust is less which is not sufficient to lift such loads power torque  angular speed angular speed can be seen as the speed with which piston moves up and down inside the cylinderx  y have same power of 235 kw but y has higher torque to achieve the same power as of y with less torque x must have higher angular speed due to less peak pressures in gasoline it is made up of lighter materials like piston and engine block due to this piston in x is able to move faster inside the chamber producing more speed to the wheels this is the reason sport cars have gasoline engines thus we saw how x  y having same volumes can be very different their abilities y produces more torque and x produces more speed95k views · view upvoters francois dovat studied mechanical engineering at etml lausanne updated nov 2 2017 · author has

component called the moment m of the torque acting on the axis of a shaft as a fulcrum while trying to turn a wheel a key in a lock screwing a bolt opening or closing a faucet one exerts a torque on these things if the thing rotates a certain work w is carried out torque a torque is for example the force a cyclist presses on the pedal multiplied by the crank arm length power is torque multiplied by the speed of rotation in practice it means that the more force the biker applies on the pedals and the faster they rotate the more power he produces at identical torque the faster the pedals spin or the engine spins the more quickly a given work is carried out and therefore the power grows linearly with the revs power a cyclist pushing of all his 200 lbs on a 056 ft long crank arm develops a torque of 200 lbs x 056 ft  112 lbsft which is about that of a 16 liters gas engine its easy to understand why the power of the 16 liters engine is higher than that of the cyclist because it spins much faster for a given torque the faster the pedals or the engine spin the more quickly a given work is carried out and therefore power grows linearly with the revs everything else being equal a cyclist can climb a hill in the same time with half torque on the pedals but by doubling their speed of rotation in selecting a different transmission ratio for example 4224 instead of 4212 power developed and torque at the rear wheel will be identical in both cases gears are rotating levers they convert torque into angular velocity and reciprocally but if we neglect the small mechanical losses they cause power at their inlet and outlet is equal it’s the same for motor vehicles except that unlike cyclists steam engines or electric motors alternating internal combustion engines ice can’t produced a torque at zero revs that’s why they need an electric starter from their idling speed the torque they can produce increases up to some rpm at higher revs than that it will start to decrease but the power will still increase up to a certain rpm where torque become so weak that any further increase in rpm won’t be able to compensate for that loss of torque the torque developed by an engine is measured on a test bench under full load wide open throttle  wot and at various rpm by graphically linking the points of measurement the torque curve is obtained the power curve is then calculated using one of the formulas below the power developed p is greater as the lapse of time t necessary to achieve a given work w is shorter p  w  t the power can also be calculated by the relation p  m x ω ω is the speed of rotationa horsepower hp or bhp is the power necessary to raise 33000 lbs of 1 foot in 1 minute if the torque is given in lbsft and the revs in rpm the relation

without relating it to max power the value of the engine max torque has no practical interest for the driver — although it is useful for the engineer designing the transmission because the higher this torque is the stronger the gearbox must be and its ratios as well as the axle ratio should be chosen accordingly what matters for the driver is the torque backup and rpm span in  between idling max torque and max power torque backup is the max engine torque divided by its torque at max power it’s the  of torque increase as the engine revs are slowed down from max power revs since engine torque is given in nm or in lbsft and power in k w or in hp unfortunately one can’t figure out how they relate to each other without a bit of arithmetic we can calculate the power at max torque by one of the above formulas conversely we can calculate torque at max power by inverting the formulas a practical example becomes really needed here…let’s take the data of a 3cylinders ford ecoboost 10 735 k w 98 hp  6000 rpm and 170 nm from 1400 to 4000 rpm its torque at 6000 rpm is then735  6000 x 9549  117 nm with these data i could draw its power curve and calculate its torque backup 170117  145 — or 45

a little over a horsepower for a short time cars if you are talking about a car the torque curve tells a lot more than the about the engine than the horsepower curve and the horsepower curve can easily be derived from the torque curve——the question changed a little —the quoted numbers for torque and horsepower are the peak numbers over the operating range power is what really provides the performance of the car but not just peak power this is a very misleading value particularly in older cars with conventional fuel and ignition systems theoretically if a car with a higher peak power could be operated at that peak power continuously it would out accelerate an equivalent car with less peak power in the real world what really matters for acceleration is the shape of the torque curve and the ability of the transmission to get the maximum area under the torque curve unfortunately this is an obscure layperson definition fundamentally a better accelerating more drivable car will have a broader flatter torque curve peak power is not a good indicator of this a car with 300 hp and a flat torque curve will out perform an equal weight car with 350 hp and a narrow peaky torque curve some generalizations to help if the torque curve is not available these are mostly related to conventional engines some are always true and so noted peak torque occurs at peak volumetric efficiency ability of the engine to breathe always true peak engine efficiency will occur at peak torque as well but keep in mind that cruising requires only a fraction of peak torque and part throttle torque may not be at the same rpm always true peak torque always happens at an rpm below peak horsepower always true peak horsepower occurs when the decrease in torque is equal to the increase in rpm beyond this torque drops faster as rpm increases and horsepower torquerpm drops off always true an engine with peak torque and horsepower closer together in rpm will typically be more “peaky” narrower torque curve than an engine with more separation in rpm between peak hp and torque many modern turbocharged engines have peak torque at very low rpm eg 1500 these are wellcontrolled by the engine management system and will typically have extremely flat torque curves bmw dual turbocharged engines and ford ecoboost engines are good examples older turbocharged engines lacked the level of boost control and were very “peaky” turbocharging variable valve timing and other modern engine control features can overcome some of these generalizations i’ll try to edit more when i’m not typing on a phone25k views

difference between torque and power they both have a connotation of oomph torque is the turning force it really the force multiplied by the distance from the rotation point to where the force is applied and yeah if the force is not perpendicular then you have to do trig to get the component but basically its force times distance ftlb nm if you are tightening a bolt you may be applying a lot of torque but unless it is actually turning at some speed its not doing any work if you manage to turn the bolt through an angle or make the wheels of your bicycle turn then you are doing work work is torque multiplied by the angle over which you apply the torque but it has to be radians not degrees so if you turn the bolt 1 radian about 60 degrees then you will do work equal to the torque times 1 radian if you turn it 2 radians then twice the work but since radians are dimensionless the units are still nm and we can convert that to joules 1 nm  j theres a subtlety in this ill come back to still not to power power is a measure of how fast you are doing work so if you do the work in 1 second then the power will be the work divide by 1 sec if you did it in 05 seconds then it would be the work divided by 05 seconds this will be in js or ftlbs well a js is also called a watt 1 w  1 js so the power is basically how fast the torque is doing work you could have a small torque going really fast or a large torque going slowly and get the same power more later the subtlety i mentioned has to do with the units of torque versus the units of work they are both in nm but you cannot express the torque as w even though the work can be expressed as w they are both newtons times meters but there is a big difference between torque and work getting more mathematical torque is r x f where r is the radial vector and f is the force there are both vectors and the cross product produces another vector which is the torque so the units are really mx n meters crossed with newtons when the torque is multiplied by the angle that is a dot product between two vectors and produces a scalar now it becomes n dot m that is work that is joules people are more familiar with work being force dotted with the distance travelled and that is still nm so we can convert that to j but we cannot convert mx n to joules but our unit system does not represent these vector operations somehow we just have to know that torque stays as nm and work can be changed to w506k views · view upvoters john wayne jones former swat f15cf5e pilot retired airline captain answered mar 9 2017 · upvoted by anudeep reddy b m e

relationship that few people understand correctly when you see a vehicle advertised as having “500 horsepower” an important question is “where was this horsepower measured”horsepower in cars is typically measured in two places at the engine’s flywheel and at the car’s drive wheels if measured at the wheels that is the horsepower you are able to put to the road in that car if measured at the flywheel you have to deduct for the gears the transmission and differential which is substantial one horsepower is the power needed to move 550 pounds one foot in one second or the power needed to move 33000 pounds one foot in one minute we measure horsepower on a dyno or dynamometer the dynamometer places a load on the engine and measures the twisting force the engine crankshaft places against the load the load is usually a brake preventing the wheels from spinning but the dyno actually measures torque in a vehicle torque is measured at various engine speeds or revolutions per minute rpm these two numbers are fed into a formula  torque times rpm divided by 5252  to arrive at horsepower horsepower is determined from torque because torque is easier to measure torque is defined specifically as a rotating force that may or may not result in motion its measured as the amount of force multiplied by the length of the lever through which it acts torque is the capacity to do work while power is how quickly that task can be accomplished torque is like using a large breaker bar to get a stuck bolt loose you compound the power of your arm by the length of the wrench the longer the wrench the more twisting power you can put on that bolt but you can’t turn that wrench very fast because it is so long that is kind of like a diesel engine or a big block with a long stroke all torque now you can’t breakloose a stuck bolt with a short wrench because you just can’t make any “torque” to break it loose but once that bolt is loose you can turn that wrench very fast and unscrew it quicker with that short wrench than if you were trying to sling around a 30” breaker bar…horsepower in most engines “horsepower” isn’t really in play until 5000 rpm so most of your driving depends more on the “torque” factor than the “horsepower” factor the little v8s in f1 cars make 1200 horsepower but you have to rev ’em up and dump the clutch just to get them moving without stalling them because they have almost no torque the rods are very short like that short wrench…but they can move very fast typically about 14000 rpm if you put an f1 engine in your 4 door pickup it would be undrivableway too much weight for that engine to handle you wouldn’t even be able to get it moving without smoking the clutch weird huh116k views · view upvoters · answer requested by macky rivera

torque the horsepower of an engine or electric motor tells us the rate at which it can do work a motor or engine is said to have one horsepower if it can lift thirty three thousand pounds one foot vertically in one minute a two horse power motor could lift twice the weight the same distance in the same time etc torque does not measure power in any way shape form or fashion most people who talk about big v8 engines having tons of torque at low speeds simply do not understand that what they really mean to say is that such engines have lots of horsepower at low rpm here is an explanation that actually makes the relationship clear we will assume no losses to friction to simplify the illustration let us suppose that we have an engine that has two hundred foot pounds of torque at three thousand rpm the mathematical relationship between horsepower torque and rpm is torque times rpm divided by 5252 equals horsepowerso two hundred times three thousand divided by 5252 tells us the horsepower of this engine at three thousand rpm  the horsepower produced by any given engine usually increases as the rpm increases  up to certain limits so this engine might produce more horsepower at higher speeds and would likely produce less at lower speeds this engine would have roughly 120 horse power rounding the 5252 to five thousand to save hunting up a calculator now let us suppose we attach a transmission to the engine that has a four to one gear reduction in first gear the torque coming out of the transmission will be four times greater eight hundred pounds but the rpm will be four times less 750 in if second gear is a two to one reduction then the torque will be doubled but the rpm will be halved if third gear is direct  one to one neither the torque or rpm will change in every case the amount of horsepower available at the transmission output shaft is exactly the same as the engine horsepower the transmission neither uses nor produces horsepower except for frictional losses it’s just a device that swaps high rpm and low torque for high torque and low rpm when the situation calls for doing so torque measures the amount of twisting force applied to a wheel or axle or gear if you want a truck or car to go up a steep hill it takes a lot of torque to make the wheels turn if you pedal a single or fixed speed bicycle on level ground you don’t have to apply much torque to the pedals to make it go if you want to go up a hill you have to push really hard on the pedals the more torque you have at a given rpm the more horsepower you have at that given engine

a quick answer to the difference between horsepower and torque just keep in mind that horsepower involves the amount of work done in a given time while torque is simply a measurement of force and is thus a component of horsepower to see how torque and horsepower interact imagine your favorite suv at the base of a steep hill the engine is idling and the gear lever is in the fourlow position as the driver begins to press on the throttle the engines rpm increases force is transmitted from the crankshaft to each wheel and the suv begins to climb upward the twisting force going to each wheel as the vehicle moves up the hill is torque lets say the engine is at 3000 rpm the gear ratio is 3 and the vehicle is creating 300 poundfeet of torque using the following formula we can calculate horsepower take the torque of 300 multiplied by a shaft speed of 1000 3000 rpm divided by a gear ratio of 3 for a total of 300000 divide 300000 by 5252 and you get 571 horsepower that the suv is making as it begins to ascend the hill it is interesting to note that since 5252 is used to calculate horsepower by way of torque and shaft speed it is also the number in the rpm range at which torque and horsepower are always equal lets have a look at one more example for instance we all know that a car moves from a dead stop in 1st or low gear yet as the cars speed increases the gears must be moved up through 2nd 3rd and 4th to maintain acceleration this is because at low speeds the transmissions gears work to transmit maximum torque from the engine to the wheels you want this because it takes more force or torque to move a vehicle that is at rest than it does to move a vehicle in motion newtons 1st law at the same time once a vehicle is underway you want less torque and more horsepower to maintain a high speed this is because horsepower is a measurement of work done and includes a time element such as wheel revolutions per minute necessary to maintain 75 mph so power at 4500 rpm

you better pulling power ie better start off the line whereas higher bhp gets you higher top speed but it is really a lot more complicated than this torque and power are very much related the amount of power an engine produces at a certain rpm depends on the amount of torque produced at that rpm for example the honda i vtec produces 132nm at 4700rpm now to calculate the power we will have to convert nm to lb ft which comes to 9734 lb ft now using the formula bhp  torque  rpm5252 we get 9734  4700 5252  8710 bhp so the i vtec produces 8710 bhp at 4700 rpm imo the ideal torque curve would be if an engine were to produce max torque as low as 2000 rpm and keep it there for as long as possible if the i vtec engine was to keep that max torque of 9734 lb ft beyond 4700 rpm the engine would have produced 106 bhp at 571925 rpm and would have gone all the way to 12603 bhp at 6800 rpm so the power of an engine depends on how much torque is produced at different engine speeds diesel engines

amount of twisting force on a crankshaft in terms of real world results torque is that necksnapping feeling when you take off power on the other hand most closely correlates with the topspeed of a car the fastest cars in the world have 1000hp in automotive terms we care greatly about both however horsepower is generally a function of torque and rpms revolutions per minute some cars put down power to the wheels very efficiently and some do not this is why you can see 2 different cars with identical peakhorsepower numbers but the one which supplies more torque to the wheels early in the powerband will easily win here is dynamometer chart for a car showing both horsepower and torque charted over rpms the line in blue shows the torque if you study these charts after a while youll recognize that a nice torque curve is flat  like a plateau shape porsche while a weak torque curve will steadily rise nissan for instance819k views · view upvoters peter mills studied at university of

power and torque are closely related powerrpmtorque where rpm is revolution speed in everyday parlance this is measured in revolutions per minute in physics we generally use angular velocity or radians per second and the units are set up so that there is no multiplication coefficient ie powerconstrpmtorque  const1 what this means is that power translates into torque provided you have the right mechanical advantage internal combustion engines cannot generate torque on startup this is why you have a starter motor and generally produce relatively little torque especially at low rpm they gain power by spinning at very high speeds this means that you need to increase the mechanical advantage when starting off or when going up a hill that is you need gears a more useful measure than these individual ratings is the power curve which gives the output power at each rpm up to redline flat power curves give you more useful power in everyday driving conditions you can accelerate to pass or drive up a steep hill without having to gear down high maximum torque ratings relative to the power rating usually but not always indicate flat power curves on the other hand if the power curve is peakedthat is maximum power occurs within a distinct narrow bandthen you or the cars automatic transmission will have to work hard to maintain the right gear so that the car is always working within that range in general higher power gives higher acceleration and higher top speed balancing that heavier cars will accelerate more slowly other things being equal like weight with acceleration drag will bring down top speed and is governed by the frontal area of the car how tall and wide it is and by the drag coefficient how sleek it is a peaked power curve may also reduce acceleration especially if the car does not have appropriate gearing even if the gears are right they will need to be shifted more precisely in order to achieve maximum performance101k views · view upvoters rahul

v12 in simple and easy to understand language edit this answer was originally an answer to another question about power torque and engine cylinder countarchitecture bhp and horsepower refer to the same thing though the former is more technically useful  it refers to the way the horsepower is measured by using a brake torque is turning force which is essentially what you need for acceleration  power being a more uniform way of describing the torque with time component for a more detailed understanding of horspower vs torque look up similar topic on quora itself internal combustion engines can have multiple cylinders each with its own piston valves  and connecting rod to a single crankshaft when the cylinders are all placed in a single row it is called an inline arrangement and the inline 4  4 cylinders in a row is the most common type of engine among cars and larger capacity motorcycles some have inline triple cylinder engines like the alto 800 some have inline five cylinder engines like the t5 on volvo s60  and some have inline six configuration like many bmw cars and the honda cbx1000 when engineers want to build an engine with more than six cylinders then usually the cylinders are arranged in two rows instead of one but using the same common crankshaft such an engine arrangement is called a vtype engine and the number of cylinders may vary from 2 to 12 usually they are paired so vtwins are common on motorcycles with harley davidson and ducati being the main users of such a type v4 engines are favored on sportier motorcycles like the honda vfr800 and yamaha vmax images v twin you have two cylidners but both move in different planesaxes because of the v angle inline 3 see three exhaust pipes exiting from same side thats an inline triple inline 4 see those 4 exhaust pipes on one side that is an inline 4 the four pistons are on the same axis and on the same crankshaft v4  see the four silver exhaust pipes now split  two on each side  the black pipes are intake ducts here is another picture of a v4 inline 6 this is rarely used on motorcycles but there are some like the bmw k1600 below count six exhaust pipes  v6 this is how the six cylinderspistons of a v6 are arranged the v6 is popular among luxury cars like bmw audi mercedes benz having v6 petrol and diesels in the midrange models each topend or flagship modelsvarians tend to have v8s some motorcycles like honda valkyrie and honda goldwing use v6 engines as well v8 a v8 is like two inline 4 engines joined together on a single crankshaft occasionally vtype engines have two crankshafts one per bankrow in order to reduce vibrations by balancing the loads but mostly engines only have a single crankshaft v10 a v10 has 10 cylinders forming the v 5 per row this large pipe openings are on the inner side of the v those are the intake tracts the exhaust piper are on the outer sides of the vhttp8wforixcomenginesgvjpg v12 and a v12 has 6 cylinders on each side each bank or row169k views ·

specifications such as power 898 bhp 3750 rpm and torque 2171 kgm 4500 rpm whenever we define an engine there are 2 things that are of interest the engine rpm at which it produces max torque 2171kgm  4500 rpmin this case the engine rpm at which it produces max power 898 bhp  3750rpm in this case this range of rpm 37504500 is called power band its desirable to have a large power band answering your second part how its useful to buyers the more the torque an engine produces at lesser rpm the smoother it drives the car from rest 1st gear also the more is the peak value of horse power the powerful the engine is higher top speed  also compare engine ratings on cars within similar categories eg santro with wagonr and not of alto and tata safari one more thing the peak power always occurs at higher rpm than peak torque i think you must have interchanged those values 3750 and 4500 by mistake20k views · view upvoters amit sudan answered dec 20 2015for this question an analogy will help let us say we need to move a large number of heavy boxes from one point to another we can use an elephant or a horse the elephant can move many more boxes per trip than the horse this corresponds to the torque so elephant can generate greater torque in our example but does that mean that elephant will move the boxes quicker not necessarily because we know that the horse can move faster so it may be able to make more trips in a given time and thus end up moving all the boxes faster the number of trips per minute will correspond to the rpm and the number of boxes moved per minute is then number of trips x boxes per trip which corresponds to power generated so we see that a weaker engine horse can end up generating more power boxes per minute if it can move at significantly higher rpm trips per minute the analogy also makes it clear why bigger vehicles need more torque  if each individual box is heavier than what the horse can carry it cannot move even a single one no matter how much faster it can gallop43k views · view upvoters cameron reid engine builder maintenance tech auto hobbyist and enthusiast answered jan 28 2014originally answered what is horsepower and what is torque in the context of understanding car specifications as far as someone just wanting to know why buy a car with different figures than another torque relates to more powerful acceleration and horsepower relates to overall speed a car with lots of torque and adequate horsepower may feel very fast going from 040mph yet may not keep that momentum up to higher speeds generally because because most engines producing large amounts of torque dont have a high rpm powerband trucks that need need to tow heavy loads will reflect this yet a car with a ton of horsepower and not so much torque may not feel quick until it starts revving in a higher rpm many japanese engines reflect this theres more to it and im sure someone will add to this but thats laymens terms134k views · view upvoters aakash prasad car

work remember from physics that work is force x distance and horsepower is the rate at which it can do work power is the rate of work over time so what does this actually mean in the context of a car think of the engine as a crank if you have a long lever that you can turn its easier to turn it eg you have more leverage thats more torque if the engine has more torque it can turn the crankshaft despite more resistance this is great for suvs and trucks since they are typically designed to tow heavy loads however to make the car go really fast you need to turn the crank really quickly so here horsepower matters more when people talk about sports cars they talk about horsepower more than torque although these days some cars have a lot of both you can have a smaller lever arm here so you can turn the crank faster and the result is an engine with higher horsepower and lower torque the naturally aspirated s65 bmw m3 engine is an example of this it has 420hp but only 290lbft torque its not great for towing but the engine can go all the way to 8300rpm before it redlines and thats pretty sick134k views · view upvoters1 2 3 4 5 next →related questions what is the meaning of torque and
