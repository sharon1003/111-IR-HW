1846 and was headquartered in philadelphia pennsylvania it was called the pennsylvania railroad because it was established in the state of pennsylvania the prr was the largest railroad by traffic and revenue in the u s for the first half of the 20th century over the years it acquired merged with or owned part of at least 800 other rail lines and companies 1 at the end of 1925 it operated 10515 miles of rail line 2 in the 1920s it carried nearly three times the traffic as other railroads of comparable length such as the union pacific or atchison topeka  santa fe railroads its only formidable rival was the new york central nyc which carried around threequarters of prrs tonmiles at one time the prr was the largest publicly traded corporation in the world with a budget larger than that of the u s government and a workforce of about 250000 people 3 the corporation still holds the record for the longest continuous dividend history it paid out annual dividends to shareholders for more than 100 consecutive years 4in 1968 prr merged with rival nyc to form the penn central transportation company which filed for bankruptcy within two years 5 the viable parts were transferred in 1976 to

between new york and pittsburgh over the former prr main line background  editwith the opening of the erie canal 1825 and the beginnings of the chesapeake and ohio canal 1828 philadelphia business interests became concerned that the port of philadelphia would lose traffic the state legislature was pressed to build a canal across pennsylvania and thus the main line of public works was commissioned in 1826 6 it soon became evident that a single canal would not be practical and a series of railroads inclined planes and canals was proposed 7 the route consisting of the philadelphia and columbia railroad canals up the susquehanna and juniata rivers an inclined plane railroad and tunnel across the allegheny mountains and canals down the conemaugh and allegheny rivers to pittsburgh on the ohio river was completed in 1834 because freight and passengers had to change cars several times along the route and canals froze in winter it soon became apparent that the system was cumbersome and a better way was needed 7 8early history  editthe commonwealth of pennsylvania granted a charter to the pennsylvania railroad in 1846 to build a private rail line that would connect harrisburg to pittsburgh 9 the directors chose john edgar thomson an engineer from the georgia railroad to survey and construct the line he chose a route that followed the west bank of the susquehanna river northward to the confluence with the juniata river following its banks until the foothills of the allegheny mountains were reached at a point that would become altoona pennsylvania 7 in order to traverse the mountains the line climbed a moderate grade for 10 miles until it reached a split of two mountain ravines which were cleverly crossed by building a fill and having the tracks ascend a 220degree curve known as horseshoe curve that limited the grade to less than 2 percent the crest of the mountain was penetrated by the 3612foot gallitzin tunnels and then descended by a more moderate grade to johnstown the western end of the line was simultaneously built from pittsburgh east along the banks of the allegheny and conemaugh rivers to johnstown prr was granted trackage rights over the philadelphia and columbia and gained control of the three short lines connecting lancaster and harrisburg instituting an allrail link between philadelphia and pittsburgh by 1854 in 1857 the prr purchased the main line of public works from the state of pennsylvania and abandoned most of its canals and inclined planes the line was double track from its inception and by the end of the century a third and fourth track were added over the next 50 years prr expanded by gaining control of other railroads by stock purchases and 999year leases 8john edgar thomson thomson 1808–1874 was the entrepreneur who led the prr from 1852 until his death in 1874 making it the largest business enterprise in the world and a worldclass model for technological and managerial innovation he served as prrs first chief engineer and third president 10 thomsons sober technical methodical and nonideological personality had an important influence on the pennsylvania railroad which in the mid19th century was on the technical cutting edge of rail development while nonetheless reflecting thomsons personality in its conservatism and its steady growth while avoiding financial risks his pennsylvania railroad was in his day the largest railroad in the world with 6000 miles of track and was famous for steady financial dividends high quality construction constantly improving equipment technological

pennsylvania air line service via the northern central railway and columbia pennsylvania this service was 545 miles 875 km longer than the old route but avoided the transfer in baltimore the union railroad line opened on july 24 1873 this route eliminated the transfer in baltimore prr officials contracted with both the union railroad and the philadelphia wilmington and baltimore railroad pwb railroad for access to this line the prrs new york–washington trains began using the route the next day ending pennsylvania air line service in the early 1880s the prr acquired a majority of pwb railroads stock this action forced the baltimore and ohio railroad bo to build the baltimore and philadelphia railroad to keep its philadelphia access where it connected with the reading railroad for its competing royal blue line passenger trains to reach new york in 1885 the prr began passenger train service from new york city via philadelphia to washington with limited stops along the route this service became known as the congressional limited express 14 the service expanded and by the 1920s the prr was operating hourly passenger train service between new york philadelphia and washington in

such signals which featured a large round target with up to eight ambercolored lights in a circle and one in the center could be lit in various patterns to convey different meanings were more visible in fog and remained effective even when one light in a row was inoperative 33signal aspects or meanings were displayed as rows of three lit lights the aspects corresponded with upperquadrant semaphore signal positions vertical for proceed a 45° angle rising to the right for approach horizontal for stop a 45° angle rising to the left for restriction a x shape for take siding and a full circle used in electrified territory for lower pantograph additional aspects were conveyed with a second target head below the first either a single light a partial target or a full target separate manual block signal aspects existed as well 33in later years interlocking home signals north and west of rockville near harrisburg were modified so that the two outside lights in the horizontal stop row had red lenses the center lamp would be extinguished when the signal displayed stop 33 such redeye lenses were also temporarily installed at overbrook interlocking near philadelphia 33starting in the late 1920s the prr installed pulse code cab signaling along certain tracks used by highspeed passenger trains information traveled through the rails using track circuits was picked up by a sensor on the locomotive and displayed in the engineers cab prr ultimately installed cab signals on its new yorkwashington philadelphiapittsburgh and pittsburghindianapolis lines the latter which was later downgraded by pc and ultimately abandoned by conrail prr also experimented with cab signals without wayside signals an approach later expanded by conrail  conemaugh line and norfolk southern railway

existence prr was conservative in its locomotive choices and pursued standardization both in locomotive types and their component parts 34 almost alone among u s railroads the prr designed most of its steam locomotive classes itself it built most of them in altoona outsourcing only when prr facilities could not keep up with the railroads needs in such cases subcontractors were hired to build to prr designs 35 unlike most railroads that ordered to broad specifications and left most design choices to the builder 34the prrs favorite outsourcer was baldwin locomotive works which received its raw materials and shipped out its finished products on prr lines the two companies were headquartered in the same city prr and baldwin management and engineers knew each other well when the prr and baldwin shops were at capacity orders went to the lima locomotive works in lima ohio 35 only as a last resort would the prr use the american locomotive company  alco  based in schenectady new york which also built for prrs rival nyc the prr had a design style that it favored in its locomotives one example was the squareshouldered belpaire firebox this britishstyle firebox was a prr trademark that was rarely used by other locomotive builders in the u s prr also used track pans extensively to retrieve water for the locomotive while in motion using this system meant that the tenders of their locomotives had a comparatively large proportion of coal which could not be taken on board while running compared to water capacity locomotives of the prr had a clean look to them only necessary devices were used and they were mounted neatly on the locomotive 34 smoke box fronts bore a round locomotive number board denoting a freight locomotive or a keystone number board denoting a passenger locomotive otherwise the smoke box was uncluttered except for a headlamp at the top and a steamdriven turbogenerator behind it in later years the positions of the two were reversed since the generator needs more maintenance than the lamp 34each class of steam locomotive was assigned a class designation 32 early on this was simply a letter but when these ran short the scheme was changed so that each wheel arrangement had its own letter and different types in the same arrangement had different numbers added to the letter subtypes were indicated by a lowercase letter superheating was designated by an s until the mid1920s by which time all new locomotives were superheated a k4sa class was a 462 pacific type k of the fourth class of pacifics designed by prr it was superheated s and was of the

drive  locomotives and the s2 turbine locomotive unlike most of their competition prr did not acquire any 484 locomotives prrs competitors managed this period better with their diesel locomotive rosters 3 prr voluntarily preserved a roundhouse full of representative steam locomotives at northumberland pennsylvania in 1957 and kept them there for several decades these locomotives with the
