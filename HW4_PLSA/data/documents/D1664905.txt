and the international terminal there is also a moving sidewalk on the underground level of the domestic terminal which you might want to take if you have time and want to get some exercise or if the trains are full or not operating escalators down to the trains and moving sidewalks are immediately following the security checkpoints and in the center of each domestic concourse usually around gate 19 generally speaking very high 30 and very low 3 gate numbers are the furthest away from the trains there are not moving sidewalks in the concourses so the walks can be long 1015 gates if you have to walk to the end if you are connecting check the monitors to confirm your concorse and gate then proceed directly to your new gate as transit between concourses can take some time not that big of a deal to go between ab but significant if you have to go from t to e there are concessions located at the center points of the concourses and other restaurants vending machines and concessions are scattered throughout there are also concessions located in the atrium of the ticketingbaggage claim area outside of security the new international concourse f opened in 2012 so international flights are operated seperately from the domestic terminal occasionally a domestic flight will depart or arrive from the international terminal if you are departing internationally take i75 exit 239 or make sure your driver knows to take you to the international departure terminal if you are arriving and connecting from an international flight the customs and immigration process requires that you get your bags from international baggage claim go through customs and then recheck your bags before connecting to your next flight or proceeding to baggage claim to recollect your baggage to travel
