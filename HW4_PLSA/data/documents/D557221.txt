a curious adult from australia july 24 2013yes this is definitely possible in this case the most likely explanation is that dad is a carrier for being rh and mom is a carrier for blood type o what happened was that dad and mom each passed both an o and an rh negative to the baby the end result is an o negative child each of their kids has around a 1 in 8 chance of having o negative blood this is possible because both o and rh are something called recessive traits this means they can hide out in your dna without you even knowing it until you have a baby with that trait that is…as you can probably tell there is a lot going on here for something as seemingly simple as a blood type in the next couple of sections i’ll explain what is going on and why each of their kids had a 1 in 8 chance for having an o child two genes one blood type there is a separate gene for each part of the blood type we are discussing here the abo gene is in charge of the a and o and b and ab parts of blood type and the rhd gene is responsible for the positive and negative parts to explain what happened in your situation we need to take a step back and think about our genes in fact we need to focus on four things we have two copies of most of our genes we pass one of our two copies chosen at random down to our child genes can come in different versions or allelessome gene versions can overpower others the next step is seeing how these apply to the abo and rhd genes at the end you’ll see how the baby ended up o with an a mom and an o dad abo  the abo gene comes in three different versions a b and o keeping in mind that we have two copies of the abo gene this means there are six different genetic combinations they are as i said some gene versions can overpower other ones in geneticsspeak these alleles are dominant over the recessive alleles in the case of the abo gene a and b are dominant over o here is what that means for blood type
