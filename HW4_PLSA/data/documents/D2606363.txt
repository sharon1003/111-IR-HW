wide crete consists of four prefectures chania rethimno heraklion and lasithi if there was a beauty contest for greek islands crete would surely be among the favorites indeed some say there is no place on earth like crete this view is strongly supported by those fortunate enough to have visited the island crete with a population of approximately 650000 is not just sun sea and sand it is a quite distinct place full of vitality warmth hospitality culture and of course an excellent infrastructure crete is well known for its seas and beaches but it has a very contrasting landscape the island goes from fertile coastal plains to rugged mountains and from busy metropolitan cities to very peaceful hillside villages if you travel throughout crete you can clearly see remnants of roman and turkish aqueducts and architecture from when these people invaded the island long ago you will also find ancient minoan ruins around the island agios pavlos on cretes southern coast regions

attractive city as it was built haphazardly with little planning oversight although there are a number of attractive old buildings and churches the old town has largely disappeared the harbor a major cruise and ferry port boasts venetian walls and a venetian fort agios nikolaos — the charming capital of lasithi prefecture once known as a partying hotspot for northern europeans especially brits it

period including a few old turkish hammans turkish baths souda bay just outside of chania is an important nato naval base as such you will run across many americans mostly military personnel in the city this is unusual as americans are definitely in the minority of tourists chersonissos  hersonissos — a charming harbor town in winter and very popular with tourists in the summer while there are many party spots this town is more sedate and refined than its neighbor malia elounda — once a small fishing town this is now the jet set area of the island visited by celebrities like brad pitt and angelina jolie with many four and fivestar resorts and exclusive villas its located on elounda bay with the abandoned spinalonga island a former turkish fortress and leper colony the town virtually closes down during the winter as do many of the smaller cities dependent of tourism ierapetra — the southernmost city of europe with some of the longest and finest sandy beaches on the island also site of an old venetian fort malia — today malia has taken over as the party capital of the island popular mostly with young especially british travelers and with a fairly unsavory reputation for drunken tourists staggering around the streets and beaches until dawn the town is filled with discos and music bars as well as many restaurants catering specifically to tourist tastes including mexican indian and british restaurants there is even a mc donalds and kfc virtually all of these establishments arre open only during the tourist season rethymno — capital of rethymnon prefecture with a fascinating and wellpreserved old town which is a maze of lanes and alleys mostly reserved for pedestrians the old town sits at the foot of a massive venetian fortress sitia — mediumsized harbor city on the eastern tip of the island with access to some very unspoiled beaches it has a very good sandy beach right in town near the harbor which is lined with traditional tavernas it is quite popular with french tourists and there are direct charter flights during the tourist season ferries also put in here other destinations  editsamaria gorge samaria national park — a breathtaking gorge

carpeted the floor of the valley active windmills today are powere by diesel and electricity understand  edita chapel in crete agriculture  tourism  editagriculture is the most important industry of the island although tourism is extremely important to the economy the island has begun to rely on tourism more and more since the 1970s many towns serve no other purpose and virtually close down during the winter there are only about 60 days of rain per year and just about every single home and business is topped with solar panels the west part of the island is more forested and receives more rain than the east the entire island was once completely covered with forest primarily cedar and pine it has been largely deforested for firewood and to make room for the olive trees and vineyards there are many contrasts in this region you can go from incredible beaches to impressive mountains from big and chaotic cities to really small picturesque villages from very dry almost desert areas to very green zones like the springs in the center upper  lower villages  editexcept for the major port cities and towns settlements near the coast were built on the hills above the water this practice dated to ancient times and the purpose was for residents to be able to see pirates and other invaders from afar they could then rush to the sea to challenge them or flee higher up in the mountains today there are many settlements right on the water that began to develop as tourism exploded in the 1960s and 1970s these new lower villages are called kato κάτω while the old upper villages are called epano επάνω most towns and villages especially along the coast will be in two sections  the upper and lower when asking for directions let them know if you are going kato or epano history  editminoan palace in knosson crete was the center of the minoan civilization a sophisticated bronze age culture from 26001150 b c the island bears witness to their achievements in the form of palaces tombs and sacred sites this civilization was so sophisticated that they even had a large navy the minoan decline was likely initiated by tsunami waves from the eruption of a huge volcano in santorini greece in 1450 b c towards the end of the late bronze age the minoans were superseded by mycenaeans from the greek mainland thereafter crete very much followed in the classical mainstream of greece and  much later  rome crete was invaded by romans from 69330 a c and this period of time plus the byzantine era actually brought much wealth to the island the beauty and wealth of this time can still be seen today by mosaics and monuments around the island crete was the site of an airborne invasion by german troops and a spirited resistance by allied mainly british new zealand and australian troops and the people of crete during the 1941 nazi invasion of greece during this invasion many cretans were executed for initially resisting the germans and the cities of chania and heraklion were bombed so heavily that you may still see the destruction even today crete history is very much related to famous myths like when the king of crete minos refused to sacrifice a bull to the greek gods poseidon in turn forced minoss wife to fall in love with a bull which created the mythical beast the minotaur talk  editthe spoken dialect of greek in crete is similar to that of mainland greece but it has some differences the true cretan dialect is spoken in pure form only in remote villages although most native cretans do know it the language used in crete is greek although in the cities and tourist areas people have no problem understanding english even in small villages you usually have no problem for basic things like shopping or eating education is good on the island and english is taught from the first grade additionally tourism is important so many people will speak english the island welcomes a large number of tourists from around the world especially northern europe therefore many in the tourist industry will speak other european languages the menus in tavernas that cater to tourists are usually in several languages  russian french italian english and german get in  editby plane  editthe island has three significant airports nikos kazantzakis at heraklion there are long term plans to replace heraklion airport which is too close to the city by a new inland airport at kasteli southeast of heraklion it is a small airport located at the edge of heraklion has basic facilities and a small parking lotthe military airport daskalogiannis at chania chania airport is much smaller and far less busy than heraklion airport located on the northwestern part of the island and the airport is also known as the k daskalogiannis airporta new public airport in sitia sitia airport serves currently only a small number of domestic flights mainly tofrom athens there are daily flights from athens airport by olympic air 1 aegean airlines 2 and athens airways

rethymno sitia and kastellikassamos get around  editon the winding eastwest road between hora sfakion visible down the coast and aradaina european route e75by car  edithiring a car is easy as long as you have your driving license with you check though that the insurance is comprehensive and make sure when you take the car that all previous marks on it are recorded so that you dont get charged for these insurance on hire cars doesnt usually cover the underside of the car or damage to tires gas stations often close around 9pm particularly in villages most gas stations expect you to pay cash  they serve you so you can choose for them to fill the tank or put in gas to a cash value on the national highway there are service stations but they are often 30 miles or so apart  make sure you fill up with gas before bank holidays and sundays when you may have more difficulty finding an open station be careful when driving in crete as cretans havent got used yet as of driving in a morethanone lane road national roads were recently upgraded near iraklion to twolane roads and will easily drive in the middle between the lanes trespass the doubleline or flash the headlights to drive you into safety lane for them to pass stop signs are rarely respected by locals and the best way to avoid accidents is to reduce speed to the point that you could easily stop the car and avoid collision whenever you approach a crossroad stay on the safe side legally in order to maintain your rights in case of accident despite the fact that most roads including the new national highway are full of twists and turns through mountains cretans usually drive aggressively fast and on the edge of safety you need to have your wits about you while driving obstacles to look for are the ubiquitous quads rented out by tourists during the season and motorbikes of all descriptions in rural and mountainous areas which is almost everywhere there can be goats sheep donkeys and stray dogs on the roads police periodically set up checkpoints and will wave you over mostly they are looking to ensure your car is properly licensed and insured pull over be polite and speak your own language or english if you are caught drunk driving is severely punished  be smart cretans drive on the right side of the road which is excellent for most tourists if you come from the uk or another leftdriving country you should take even more care parking is a challenge  especially in cities you are better off finding the center and parking in a pay lot and walking most cities and towns are easy to walk around in cities like herklion you can easily receive an expensive parking ticket even if you park on the curb where many other vehicles are parked driving in cities and towns is also a challenge  the roads are narrow and it can look like a freeforall taxi services are another way to get around crete but can be quite expensive they are however very accessible and you will find taxi stands in the center of virtually all villages towns and cities greek taxis all work under the greek state and the taxi driver must always charge by the meter price which he must turn on as soon as you get into the cab taxi drivers are perhaps the most aggressive of drivers on the island there are 2 taxi tariffs in greece tariff 1 is day hours ranging from 500am to midnight and tariff 2 is night hours ranging from midnight to 500am most major road signs in in both english and greek usually the greek sign is first followed by an english sign by bus  editpublic transportation is fairly frequent and timetables 6 quite trustworthy bus drivers usually divert from their marked routes to enter little villages if asked to do so bus services along the north coast and towards the south coast are excellent reliable frequent and cheap most of these bus services are run by kino tamio eisproxeon leoforon ktel which are groups of families which individually run their own bus companies this in turn creates a much more homely environment for cretans and tourists and these families provide excellent service and show off their great deal of pride cretan bus stations are very simple for the most part except for in heraklion which has two major bus stations one for buses going in town and one for ktel run buses boats in the harbour  heraklion by ferry  editferry services from piraeus to heraklion rethimno and chania and from thessaloniki and the cyclades to heraklion  since there are no roads along the southwest coast there is a ferry line 7 with connections between paleochora sougia agia roumeli loutro and hora sfakion sfakia there is also a connection with the islet of gavdos europes southernmost point cape tripiti on foot  editalthough crete is the largest of all greek islands you can get around on foot especially the countryside in the western part of crete offers some rough country walking and there are good paths between chania and chora sfakion these go via forests with cypress evergreen oak and cypress various gorges and of course olive and orange groves this part of crete is good for walking holidays see  edit  add listingview of psiloritis mountains from west spinalonga island famous minoan fresco from palace of knossos currently in herakleion museum crete is a large island with much to see and do to see the highlights of the entire island will take about two weeks to explore all that in more depth would take a good month distances and driving times from one highlight to another can be long landscapes unless you stay only in an allinclusive beach resort you will have to drive places this reveals the diversity and beauty of the cretan landscapes tall mountains rise steeply from the sea and spectacular views of the sea are available from many points lush valleys and mountainsides support olive groves vineyards orange and lemon orchards fields of artichokes and olive trees there are dramatic gorges and idyllic beaches there are thickly forested areas and desertlike areas filled with exotic cacti and palm trees ruins of ancient minoan civilization the palace of knossos in knossos is by far the most extensive and famous and the archaeological museum of heraklion contains wonderful treasure the ruins of phaistos gortys and the palace of malia mallia are also impressive but the island is covered with these treasures and there are many hidden gems like the ruins of gournia gournia these sites as well as historic monasteries and other sites of interest are marked with brown road signs in both english and greek worldclass archeological art and historical museums are found in all the big cities including chania rethymnon and heraklion but you will also find fascinating small museums even in the most remote small villages if you see a sign in a small village that advertises a folklore or traditional house museum give it a try you are apt to be treated to a walk back in time to 19th and early 20th century life on the island with lovingly preserved artifacts spinalonga island located in the elounda bay in eastern crete this island is fascinating it was a venetian fortress that was later occupied by the turkish it was the last turkish outpost of the ottoman empire on the island in 1903 it was turned into a leper colony which was made famous in the novel the island by victoria hislop the novel was later made into a television miniseries in 1957 after a cure was found for leprosy the island was abandoned today it is open to tourists and provides a fascinating look at the architecture of all the periods and a look into the lives of the lepers who were exiled there monasteries these are found all over the island they are almost all marked by brown road signs and almost all will allow visitors if you pass by a sign it is worth trying to go in the structures are lovely and there is almost always a small museum and a beautiful church with ornate frescoes and decorations one of the most accessible and elaborate is the st george of selinari monastery located on the main national road between malia and agis nikolaos here is a very wide place in the highway with plenty of parking and a souvlaki truck that provides quick snack for truck drivers and fresh barbecue for those with more time there are clean toilets and a gift shop selling icons and religious articles above this is the monastery itself which is a massive byzantine complex caves the island is riddled with more than 3000 caves some are quite famous like the cave in southwestern crete where st paul lived and preached after he was supposedly washed up on the island after a hurricane another famous and very accessible cave is the cave of milatos milatos is a small village in the lasithi province and the cave above the village is where villagers fled from the turks in 1823 they lasted for almost two weeks but most were eventually killed or sold into slavery inside the cave is a small white chapel and an ossuary containing the supposed bones of those killed if you see a sign for a cave give it a try you should have sensible shoes and a flashlight do  edit  add listingbeaches the beach of elafonisi at low tide connected to the main island of

find yourself in a small village stop and have a coffee a beer a raki or an ouzo at one tavernas are as prevalent as kafeneia they are everywhere along the sea in tourist towns but try to find a small

tell edit eat  edit  add listingcrete is famous for its tasty and healthy cuisine the cretan diet which is also called the mediterranean diet has been attributed with great health benefits and nutritional value this healthy diet had relied heavily on fresh vegetables and fruits in season and fish with meat served usually only once a week or on special occasions like weddings and festivals today cretans eat meat fairly regularly as well as processed foods and sweet confections a good tip is to join any of the hundreds of traditional festivals in villages which offer food like barbecued meat fried potatoes salad stuffed grape leaves dolmades wine there is usually live music and dancing olives  olive oil  editthe island of crete is covered with olive trees virtually every family has at least some trees the olive harvest season occurs in november and december and every single member of the family helps with the harvest most villages have an olive pressing factory some villages even have very old presses with huge stone wheels that have been preserved for cultural value todays olive press factories are modern but it is still possible to stop into one during the season to see the liquid gold being produced olive oil is used in copious amounts for cooking and in salads although most restaurants use sunflower or similar oil for cooking fried foods like french fried potatoes olives themselves are commonly served as mezes with raki they are an ingredient in many salads and an olive paste is often served with bread honey  yogurt  editthere are also bee hives all over crete and many families make their own pure honey yogurt is often served as dessert with honey drizzled on it cheese  editgreek salad with feta cheese feta cheese is a greek product protected by designation of origin in the eu to qualify to be sold as true feta in the eu the cheese must be made in a certain manner in a certain area parts of mainland greece and the island of lesvos however it is produced

a small local restaurant offering the local cuisine most dishes are fresh from that day the menu is only for tourists cretans ask the waiter for specialties and have a look in the kitchen or in a vitrine glass display case dinner is usually outside during the warmer months fresh fish becomes more and more rare and is expensive priced by its weight restaurants and tavernas by law have to display if the fish that they offer is fresh or frozen thus always ask your waiter to show you the fish and weight it in front of you before you order common appetizers tsatziki famous cucumber dip

edit  add listingtsikoudia is the predominant alcohol drink produced and consumed by the locals this drink is also known as raki and is made from the left over distilled wine tsikoudia alcohol precentage varies a bit usual average is 2045 it has a grapey taste and is usually served with some meze accompaniments like hard cheese olives cucumber or cold cuts while raki is turkish in origin this is what the cretans call it and you are apt to be looked at strangely if you ask for tsikoudia tsikoudia usually is a goodbye gift from many restaurants that serve it along with dessert or fruit right after you ask for the bill most restaurants and tavernas follow this tradition the quality and alcohol content of raki varies quite a bit if you find a restaurant or taverna with good raki it is perfectly acceptable to ask the owner if he will sell you a liter to take home tsikoudia and raki production is strictly controlled by alcohol taxing laws who permit production for a single 48hour period each year for which authorities issue licenses for distilleries operation many families make their own but the majority is distilled in factories scattered across the island to which locals bring their grapes if you happen to fall within the period august through november and you are into local fiestas try to visit a rakokazano which is local a tsikoudia distillery this could be an experience to remember arrange for returning to hotel beforehand usually rakokazanos are located away from tourist vacances deep into the mainland near vineyards due to the nature of the event tsikoudia production escalates to a fiesta where freshly produced raki is tested between feasts of unpeeled oven potatoes with oliveoil or lemon and salt lamb meat and wine you are not expected to be sober after visiting one of those but usually a local has to invite you along and drive you home afterwards although not as popular as in the mainland or the north aegean islands cretans also enjoy drinking ouzo which is an alcoholic drink made by distillation of grapes it looks milky when water is poured in but it doesnt contain milk or derivates of milk during the distilling process it is made with ginger cinamon aromatic seeds plants and fruits which give it a distinct taste apart from local spirits a great variety of wines are produced locally and sometimes from local ancient grape cultivars and can escort supper or dinner most restaurants would serve varieties of local wines or even the restaurant owners own production as barrel wine youth can enjoy their booze at dancing bars which are open till late along the coast line near tourist places like in malia and hersonissos 30km from iraklion or platanias 25km from chania sleep  edit  add listingtypes of lodging  editthere are hundreds of various types of lodging possibilities on the island representative examples of each type are listed in each category credit cards are generally accepted at most of the mainstream properties many properties will offer a discount if you pay cash some private homes may have a pay pal or similar method of payment and the currency is often in that of the owners native country uk pounds for instance very small hotels and rent rooms may accept only cash almost all properties will be happy to assist with sightseeing questions tours and can help arrange for a licensed guide for certain sites apartments  aparthotels  editthere is a plethora of these types of accommodations ranging from a a single apartment you can rent directly from an owner to more sophisticated aparthotels the latter usually have cooking facilities in the roomssuites a small restaurant breakfast often included and bar laundry facilities a swimming pool and free wi fi hotels  editthese range from simple twostar to lavish fivestar properties with all the amenities and facilities you would expect of a world class hotel there are city hotels business hotels and beach resort hotels there are also a number of allinclusive resorts with all the bells and whistles to keep visitors on the property the latter are promoted heavily in northern europe as part of package holidays that include everything including air fare should you choose one of these it is highly recommended that you rent a car and venture out into the countryside a least a couple times during your stay in order to experience the unique culture found in small hidden villages and not in the crowdedtouristic places villas  private homes  edityou will find numerous villas and private homes available for rent all over the island these range from small onebedroom cottages to very lavish multibedroom villas with swimming pools and hot tubs some are offered privately by owners and some are developments of two four or more detached villas there is a large fulltime and parttime expat population mostly from northern europe on the island some fulltime residents rent out their homes during the tourist season many parttime residents will rent their homes during the time they are away these villas invariably come fully furnished and with all the dishes linens towels etc that you need for a week or two many will have free wi fi rooms  edityou will see rent room signs just about everywhere you go these are rarely advertised on the internet and you usually can only make advance reservations if you have someone local make the arrangements for you when you see a place you might like just go in or phone the number on the sign always ask to see the room before you seal the deal these are usually simple rooms for sleeping although many will have basic cooking facilities microwave hot plate and a mini fridge there are many holiday specials for villas in crete cope  edittravelers with physical disabilities  editsince entering the european union there have been some efforts to make access for the disabled easier however a combination of factors has made this far from comprehensive the major factors are the topography of the island the nature of its most import sites and the economy many hotels and other types of accommodations are in historic buildings without elevators and often with many stairs to various facilities this is especially true in small villages and in the old town sections of cities getting into most public establishments and to the toilet once youre in there usually means stairs historic sites like the ancient ruins of knossos will be very difficult to fully explore for those confined to wheelchairs and who have difficulty walking although many of them including knossos have significant sections that can be explored to create a rewarding experience the old towns of cities like chania and small mountain villages are hilly often with steps from one area to another nonetheless there are still places in most of these that can be explored a wheelchairbound person or one with walking difficulty will not be able to see everything but they can still see a rewarding amount of things most government buildings hospitals museums and office buildings in cities and large towns have elevators and wheelchair ramps you will also find wheelchair ramps at many restaurants and hotels in areas that cater to tourists virtually all of the four and fivestar hotels have ramps elevators andor handicapped accessible rooms and facilities sidewalks in cities and larger towns will have ramps at intersections even ablebodied travelers should take care whenever crossing a street as cars rarely stop for pedestrians in crosswalks  although they usually stop at red lights if you have physical difficulties with walking or are confined to a wheelchair it is important that you research your prospective lodging carefully and ask clear questions ask the advice of people who live on the island or go on one of the expat forums to get questions answered even with the obstacles that exist it is possible to enjoy a rewarding visit smoking  editwhen greece entered the european union smoking was also addressed  sort of no smoking signs are required inside all restaurants bars and tavernas you are entirely likely to see the owner sitting under one of those signs and smoking as well as many of the patrons also smoking the main tourist season is during warm weather virtually every eating and drinking establishment has an outdoor area people will be smoking in those areas but at least you are outside better hotels and restaurants will enforce bans and better hotels will have nonsmoking rooms get out  editthis article is an outline and needs more content it has a
