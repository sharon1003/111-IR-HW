if blood is red why do veins look blue by matt soniak march 19 2010note readers commenting under todays friday happy hour post brought up an age old question is blood blue when its inside the veins matt soniak kindly put together this response why do veins look blue one answer youre likely to hear is that veins look blue because the blood inside actually is blue because its deoxygenated if you wonder why youve never seen blue blood before someone might tell you thats because when you bleed the blood is oxygenated upon contact with air and immediately turns red more from mental floss studios an unanticipated problem was encountered check back soon and try again error code mediaerrunknownsession id 20180411d8c65af77c0cf334905689af player element id my player idokfirst things first our blood is not blue it is always red 1 even when its deoxygenated even in the absence of oxygen in a vacuum remember when you get blood drawn at your doctors office they use a vacutainer which is essentially a vacuum in a tube√¢ the tube is attached to the needle in your arm exposing the inside of the vein to the vacuum and drawing the blood out how red it is varies after your blood is pumped to your lungs by your heart its bright red because hemoglobin  the ironcontaining oxygentransporting protein in our red blood cells  binds to the oxygen the blood just picked up from the lungs the blood goes back to the heart this is called pulmonary circulation which pumps it out to the rest of the body via the arteries and into tiny blood vessels called capillaries where it gives its oxygen to the bodys tissues systemic circulation on its return trip to the heart through the veins the oxygendepleted blood is dark red or maroon because the hemoglobin is no longer bound to oxygen why so blue now im no surgeon but real doctors will tell you that when you poke around inside a human being and see a vein or artery in its naked glory it isnt blue if blood isnt blue and veins and arteries arent actually blue why do our veins look blue through our skin when you look down at the veins in your arm light of different wavelengths is hitting the skin the veins and the blood some of that light is being absorbed and some is getting scattered and reflected back to your eye different wavelengths of light have different properties and abilities as it turns out blue light compared to red light 1 doesnt penetrate the skin as well 2 is absorbed by the blood more and 3 is more likely to be scattered and make it back to your eye so if a vein is close to the surface of the skin most of the blue light will be absorbed and even though red light doesnt reflect as much the red lightblue light ratio is high enough to make the vein appear red with deeper veins the blood doesnt absorb as much blue or red light but the blue lights inability to penetrate as deeply as red light makes the veins appear blue1note the our in that statement humans and all other animals with backbones have red blood but some animals such as lobsters crabs crawfish octopodes squid mussels and clams do have blue bloodtopstory facebook 0 twitter email
