seaman status in united states admiralty law from wikipedia the free encyclopedianavigation search the status of a seaman in admiralty law provides maritime workers with protections such as payment of wages working conditions and remedies for workplace injuries under the merchant marine act of 1920 jones act and the doctrines of  unseaworthiness  and  maintenance and cure  1 each of these remedies have the same criteria for the status of seaman 2 having the status of seaman provides maritime employees with benefits that are not available to those without the status however the determination of who is a seaman is complex contents  hide 1 history11 seamens act and jones act12 wilander13 chandris inc v latsis2 who is a seaman3 references history  editthe term seaman has been used in admiralty law for centuries u s courts have continued to narrow the definition of the term and the remedies available to those with the status through their rulings over that time the supreme court notably tried to summarize the remedies available to those with the status in the osceola 3the court codified the maintenance and cure and unseaworthiness remedies but their ruling on remedies involving negligence did not go over well with congress the court stated that seamen cannot recover for injuries caused by the negligence of another crewmember and that they are not allowed to recover an indemnity for the negligence of the master or any member of the crew 4seamens act and jones act  editthe merchant marine act of 1915 seamens act was in response to the ruling in the osceola it attempted to create a negligence action for seamen ยง20 of the 1915 act provided that in any suit to recover damages for any injury sustained on board vessel or in its service seamen having command shall not be held to be fellowservants with those under their authority 5in 1920 congress passed the jones act which provides a cause of action in negligence for any seaman injured in the course of his employment 6 the act was passed in part in response to the supreme courts prior ruling in chelentis v luckenbach s s co that did not provide remedies for an injured fireman because it was caused by a superior officer who was considered a member of the crew and not a fellow servant 7the jones act requires that those seeking remedies under the act are seaman but does not define the term 8 u s courts have attempted to interpret the term in their rulings since the 1920 act was passed as justice sandra day oconnor said in her mc dermott international inc v wilander opinion seaman is a maritime term of art  9 wilander interprets congresss use of the term to be the established meaning in general maritime law up to the passing of the jones act the use of the term prior to the jones act was extremely broad including not only sailors and ships officers of all known types but also bartenders cabin boys carpenters chambermaids clerks cooks coopers divers doctors dredge workers engineers firemen fishermen harpooners horsemen interpreters masons muleteers musicians pilots pursers radio operators seal hunters stewards surveyors and waiters 10u s courts including the supreme court continued to interpret the seaman status liberally until international stevedoring co v haverty 11 when the court held that a stevedore is a seaman under the act justice oliver wendell holmes jr recognized that as the word is commonly used stevedores are not seamen 12 but words are flexible we cannot believe that congress willingly would have allowed the protection to men engaged upon the same maritime duties to vary with the accident of their being employed by a stevedore rather than by the ship 13 justice holmes quickly found out that he was incorrect in his assumption that congress wanted to make the term even broader within a year congress responded to the haverty ruling by enacting the longshore and harbor workers compensation act lhwca 14 to restrict maritime workers other than masters or members of a crew of any vessel to a workers compensation remedy against their employers 15swanson v marra brothers inc made it clear that the lhwca provides relief for land workers and the jones act provides relief for master or member of a crew of any vessel 16wilander  editprior to wilander the u s courts often followed one of two tests to see if a maritime worker was eligible for the status of seaman the robinson test 17 was to see if a seaman contributed to the function of the vessel or to the accomplishment of its mission the test from johnson v john f beasley const was whether the employee made a significant contribution to the maintenance operation or welfare of the transportation function of the vessel 18in wilander oconnor determined that at the time the jones act was passed it was only necessary that a person be employed on board a vessel in furtherance of its purpose and that the jones act established no requirement that a seaman aid in navigation 19chandris inc v latsis  editin 1995 the supreme court was again faced with the question of who qualifies for seaman status in chandris inc v latsis oconnor again wrote the majority opinion and here laid out two elements necessary to qualify as a seaman under the jones act the workers duties must contribute to the function of the vessel or to the accomplishment of its mission and the worker must have a connection to a vessel in navigation or an identifiable fleet of vessels that is substantial in terms of both its duration and its nature 20who is a seaman  editbecause seaman is not defined in the statutes providing them with these special protections it is necessary to analyze the case law interpreting the statutes and come up with a general rule to qualify as a seaman a maritime employee must be a seabased employee and a master or a member of a vessels crew who makes some contribution to the ships work it is not necessary for the employee to assist in the navigation or transportation of the vessel but the employee must have a connection to a vessel in navigation or to an identifiable fleet of such vessels that is substantial in terms of both its duration and its nature 21however according to 46 u s c s 10101 3 a seaman is an individual  except scientific personnel sailing school instructors or sailing school students engaged or employed in any capacity on board a vessel 22additionally to qualify as a seaman under the jones act a maritime worker must have spent 30 of his career aboard a vessel in navigable waters 23references  edit frank l maraist thomas c galligan jr
