save sarah o’connor economics reporter april 20 2012 0prices paid for secondhand clothes in the uk have tripled in the past five years sparking a battle between charities criminals companies and local councils for the nation’s castoffs this latest commodities boom is not playing out on city traders’ terminals but on the country’s industrial estates small town shopping parades and supermarket car parks specialist shops and online entrepreneurs are exchanging cash for bin bags of old clothes which are then exported to eastern europe and africa where british high street labels command great cachet“people need the money these days” christine williams said from behind the counter of a tiny cash4clothes shop in rugeley an exmining town in the midlands cash4clothes which has 31 shops and plans to open another 50 this year pays £5 for a full bin bag of clothes“ emerging markets are getting slightly more wealthy now they can afford to buy secondhand clothing” said michael mc dermott the company’s manager polish bargain hunting used clothing sold in the uk ends up in shops like virgo a couple of blocks from one of warsaw’s main thoroughfares where the main sound is the “click”of coat hangers as the mostly female clientele hunts for bargains writes jan cienski in warsaw“the price is certainly right – it’s a lot cheaper than in shops with new clothing” says henryka jackowska a warsaw pensioner virgo specialises in uk clothing and follows the model used by most polish used clothing shops selling clothes by the kilo the highest price of 79 zlotys €1880 per kilo is on monday the first day of delivery of new stock and falls to 29 zlotys by saturday when all the best bargains have been picked overmore the price rag dealers pay for used clothes has climbed from about £220 a tonne in 2007 to about £650 a tonne today according to trade publication letsrecyclecom demand has mushroomed since the european union expanded eastward in the mid2000s creating accessible markets for winter clothing that rag dealers cannot sell in africa sterling’s tumble has accelerated the trend charities say donations are falling in the face of new high street competition “clothing has always been seen as something charitable” said maria chenowethcasey chief executive of charity traid which runs secondhand clothes shops “vintage clothing is dying    it’s sad to see it shipped out of the country without even being looked at”criminals are also drawn to the high prices in 2008 when ms chenowethcasey noticed the “yield” of her charity’s textile banks dropping she hid a tracker inside a bank and followed the signal to an industrial estate in havering in north london the stolen clothes were in a trailer bound for east europe last year city of london police arrested four men as part of a “major strike” against an organised crime gang suspected of stealing hundreds and thousands of pounds’ worth of used clothing intended for charities however some charities are benefiting from the price increase “donated textiles in the uk marketplace are now seen to be a highly valuable commodity” noted the latest annual report of the salvation army trading company a subsidiary of the christian charity that collects and sells donated clothing its revenues have tripled in the past five years to £237m local governments grappling with severe budget cuts scent an opportunity too following the lead of councils in hertfordshire 16 london councils are considering putting out to tender a contract to operate textile banks on all their sites the winner would pay the councils a certain amount per tonne of clothing collected a london councils spokesman confirmed that discussions were “at a very early stage” charities are livid “councils are starting to evict charities from clothes banks sites and flog them off” said the charity scope “when you donate clothes do you want them to line wealthy businessmen’s pockets”in reality the relationship is more complex charities with shops usually sell their leftover clothes to rag dealers while others often team up with companies to collect donations from doorstep or textile banks“charities think we are minting money and it is not true they increase the prices and we have to accept it” said tosh vyas who collects clothes from uk charity shops and sorts them in poland to reduce costs in 2002 he paid charities 3p a kilo now he pays 70p a kilo “we can’t make it pay at this price” he said alan wheeler of the textile recycling association said two members have gone out of business in the past month east londonbased lmb textile recycling is one of the few companies that has not outsourced clothes sorting to poland and managing director ross barry admits he is being undercut on commercial contracts with councils “we’re not competing as much as everyone else” mr barry shrugged “we can’t see how they his company’s rivals can afford it if the endmarket price drops what do they do then i think it’s a big bubble”copyright the financial times limited 2018 all rights reserved latest on uk business  economy brexit norway ready to roll over uk trade deals after brexit the big read uk housing a crisis in
