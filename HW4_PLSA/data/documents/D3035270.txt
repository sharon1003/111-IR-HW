if the address is not printed on theremykatesmom · 9 years ago0 0 comment i can only tell you what id do and let you choose if thats what you want or not id use my debit card for local purchases and id use my checks for paying bills and ordering items or for like paying for school having a checking account with a printed name on it is of benefit because it says to the person youre giving the check to that you are stable and had a real address and thats a good thing so when i order a first batch of checks i always make sure the first number that i use is 700 or higher so that that signifies youve had the account for a while anything under 400 is questioned by the person who takes your check and shows its a new account and they are hesitant to give you the items you buy its better to have the checks printed up they really dont cost that much and you can get one box of checks for about 16 dont get them from the bank but from a place like checks unlimited and you dont really need a check register if you do your budgeting on something like quicken and you dont need a leather cover or anything if you change your address you can notify your bank but you can still use the old address on the checks or use one of those address stickers up in the corner just changing the address but not obliterating your name yeah i think youd be better off if people thought you had a

your credit card bills or car payments they arent going to care if it isnt on there but walking into walmart or some other store they may wonder why you dont have an address and will probably ask you
