contested in the summer and winter olympic games the 2016 summer olympics included 28 sports with five additional sports due to be added to the 2020 summer olympics the 2014 winter olympics included seven sports 1 the number and kinds of events may change slightly from one olympiad to another each olympic sport is represented by an international governing body namely an international federation if 2 the international olympic committee ioc establishes a hierarchy of sports disciplines and events 2 according to this hierarchy the olympic sports can be subdivided into multiple disciplines which are often assumed to be distinct sports examples include swimming and water polo disciplines of aquatics represented by the international swimming federation  3 or figure skating and speed skating disciplines of skating represented by the international skating union  4 in their turn disciplines can be subdivided into events for which medals are actually awarded 2 a sport or discipline is included in the olympic program if the ioc determines it is widely practiced around the world that is the number of countries that compete in a given sport is the indicator of the sports prevalence the iocs requirements reflect participation in the olympic games as well—more stringent toward men as they are represented in higher numbers and summer sports as more nations compete in the summer olympics previous olympic games included sports which are no longer present on the current program like polo and tug of war 5 these sports known as discontinued sports were later removed either because of lack of interest or absence of an appropriate governing body 2 archery and tennis are examples of sports that were competed at the early games and were later dropped by the ioc but managed to return to the olympic program in 1972 and 1988 respectively demonstration sports have often been included in the olympic games usually to promote a local sport from the host country or to gauge interest and support for the sport 6 some such sports like baseball and curling were added to the official olympic program in 1992 and 1998 respectively baseball however was discontinued after the

removed september 2014  learn how and when to remove this template messagethe term sport in olympic terminology refers to all the events that are sanctioned by one international sport federation a definition that may be different from the common meaning of the word sport one sport by olympic definition may be divided into several disciplines which are often regarded as separate sports in common language for example aquatics is a summer olympic sport that includes six disciplines swimming synchronized swimming diving water polo open water swimming and high diving the last of which is a nonolympic discipline since all these disciplines are governed at international level by the international swimming federation 1 skating is a winter olympic sport represented by the international skating union and includes four disciplines figure skating speed skating on a traditional long track short track speed skating and synchronized skating the latter is a nonolympic discipline 1 the sport with the largest number of olympic disciplines is skiing with six alpine skiing crosscountry skiing ski jumping nordic combined snowboarding and freestyle skiing other notable multidiscipline sports are gymnastics artistic rhythmic and trampoline cycling road track mountain and bmx volleyball indoors and beach wrestling freestyle and grecoroman canoeing flatwater and slalom and bobsleigh includes skeleton the disciplines listed here are only those contested in the olympics—gymnastics has two nonolympic disciplines while cycling and wrestling have three each it should also be noted that the ioc definition of a discipline may differ from that used by an international federation for example the ioc considers artistic gymnastics a single discipline but the international federation of gymnastics fig classifies mens and womens artistic gymnastics as separate disciplines 7 similarly the ioc considers freestyle wrestling to be a single discipline but united world wrestling uses freestyle wrestling strictly for the mens version classifying womens freestyle wrestling as the separate discipline of female wrestling 8on some occasions notably in the case of snowboarding the ioc agreed to add sports which previously had a separate international federation to the olympics on condition that they dissolve their governing body and instead affiliate with an existing olympic sport federation therefore not increasing the number of olympic sports an event by ioc definition is a competition that leads to the award of medals therefore the sport of aquatics includes a total of 46 olympic events of which 32 are in the discipline of swimming eight in diving and two each in synchronized swimming water polo and open water swimming the number of events per sport ranges from a minimum of two until 2008 there were sports with only one event to a maximum of 47 in athletics which despite its large number of events and its diversity is not divided into disciplines changes in olympic sports curling was promoted to official olympic sport at the nagano 1998 winter olympics the list of olympic sports has changed considerably during the course of olympic history and has gradually increased until the early 2000s when the ioc decided to cap the number of sports in the summer olympics at 28 the only summer sports that have never been absent from the olympic program are athletics aquatics  the discipline of swimming has been in every olympics  cycling fencing and gymnastics  the discipline of artistic gymnastics has been in every olympics  the only winter sports that were included in all winter olympic games are skiing only nordic skiing  skating  figure skating and speed skating  and ice hockey figure skating and ice hockey were also included in the summer olympics before the winter olympics were introduced in 1924 for most of the 20th century demonstration sports were included in many olympic games usually to promote a nonolympic sport popular in the host country or to gauge interest and support for the sport 6 the competitions and ceremonies in these sports were identical to official olympic sports except that the medals were not counted in the official record some demonstration sports like baseball and curling were later added to the official olympic program this changed when the international olympic committee decided in 1989 to eliminate demonstration sports from olympics games after 1992 9 an exception was made in 2008 when the beijing organizing committee received permission to organize a wushu tournament 10 11a sport or discipline may be included in the olympic program if the ioc determines that it is widely practiced around the world that is the number of countries and continents that regularly compete in a given sport is the indicator of the sports prevalence the requirements for winter sports are considerably lower than for summer sports since many fewer nations compete in winter sports the ioc also has lower requirements for inclusion of sports and disciplines for women for the same reason women are still barred from several disciplines but on the other hand there are womenonly disciplines such as rhythmic gymnastics and synchronized swimming sports that depend primarily on mechanical propulsion such as motor sports may not be considered for recognition as olympic sports though there were powerboating events in the early days of the olympics before this rule was enacted by the ioc 2 12 part of the story of the founding of aviation sports international governing body the fai originated from an ioc meeting in brussels belgium on june 10 1905 13these criteria are only a threshold for consideration as olympic sport in order to be admitted to the olympic program the ioc session has to approve its inclusion there are many sports that easily make the required numbers but are not recognized as olympic sports mainly because the ioc has decided to put a limit on the number of sports as well as events and athletes in the summer olympics in order not to increase them from the 28 sports 300 events and 10000 athletes of the 2000 summer olympics no such limits exist in the winter olympics and the number of events and athletes continue to increase but no sport has been added since 1998 the latest winter sport added to the winter olympics was curling in 1998 previous olympic games included sports which are no longer present on the current program like polo and tug of war 1 in the early days of the modern olympics the organizers were able to decide which sports or disciplines were included on the program until the ioc took control of the program in 1924 as a result a number of sports were on the olympic program for relatively brief periods before 1924 2 these sports known as discontinued sports were removed because of lack of interest or absence of an appropriate governing body or because they became fully professional at the time that the olympic games were strictly for amateurs as in the case of tennis 2 several discontinued sports such as archery and tennis were later readmitted to the olympic program in 1972 and 1984 respectively curling which was an official sport in 1924 and then discontinued was reinstated as olympic sport in 1998 the olympic charter decrees that olympic sports for each edition of the olympic games should be decided at an ioc session no later than seven years prior to the games changes since 2000the only sports that have been dropped from the olympics since 1936 are baseball and softball which were both voted out by the ioc session in singapore on july 11 2005 14 a decision that was reaffirmed on february 9 2006 15 these sports were last included in 2008 although officially they remain recognized as olympic sports in the olympic charter therefore the number of sports in the 2012 summer olympics was dropped from 28 to 26 following the addition of womens boxing in 2012 and womens ski jumping in 2014 there are only grecoroman wrestling and nordic combined respectively that are only for men in those games two previously discontinued sports golf and rugby returned for the 2016 summer olympics on august 13 2009 the ioc executive board proposed that golf and rugby sevens be added to the olympic program for the 2016 games 16 on 9 october 2009 during the 121st ioc session in copenhagen the ioc voted to admit both sports as official olympic sports and to include them in the 2016 summer olympics 17 the ioc voted 81–8 in favor of including rugby sevens and 63–27 in favor of reinstating golf thus bringing the number of sports back to 28 17in february 2013 the ioc considered dropping a sport from the 2020 summer olympics to make way for a new sport modern pentathlon and taekwondo were thought to be vulnerable but instead the ioc recommended dismissing wrestling 18 on september 8 2013 the ioc added wrestling to the 2020 and 2024 summer games 19on august 3 2016 the ioc voted to add baseball  softball karate sport climbing surfing and skateboarding for the 2020 summer olympics 20summer olympics at the first olympic games nine sports were contested 21 since then the number of sports contested at the summer olympic games has gradually risen to twentyeight on the program for 2000–2008 at the 2012 summer olympics however the number of sports fell back to twentysix following an ioc decision in 2005 to remove baseball and softball from the olympic program these sports retain their status as olympic sports with the possibility of a return to the olympic program in future games 14 at the 121st ioc session in copenhagen on 9 october 2009 the ioc voted to reinstate both golf and rugby to the olympic program meaning that the number of sports to be contested in 2016 was once again 28 22in order for a sport or discipline to be considered for inclusion in the list of summer olympics sports it must be widely practiced in at least 75 countries spread over four continents current
