youre in the market for a credit card you can save yourself lots of money by shopping around and then picking the card with the features that best fit your needs read on to learn the terms you need to understand when choosing a credit card annual percentage rate credit card companies must disclose the interest rate as an annual percentage rate apr the apr is the percentage you’ll pay in interest each year assuming you carry a balance credit card companies charge different aprs and have different terms based on the individual applicants credit report or score each month if you havent paid the balance in full by the due date the credit card company applies the apr to the account balance to compute the finance charge for that month the finance charge is the dollar amount you pay to use the credit here are some guidelines when considering aprs if you won’t ever carry a balance on your credit card then the apr isn’t important you wont ever pay interest if you dont pay your bill in full each month the apr is crucial the lower the apr the better watch out for introductory rates which are also called a teaser rates if conspicuously disclosed credit card issuers can increase teaser rates after six months make sure the advertised rate applies to you sometimes it only applies to certain people such as those earning a high income those who dont qualify get a higher rate card issuers generally cant raise your interest rate for the first year after you open the account but some exceptions apply—like when a variable rate changes a promotional rate ends or a required minimum payment is over 60 days late—so be sure to read the fine print some aprs vary monthly based on a benchmark like the prime rate the application or solicitation must disclose that the rate may vary and state how the rate is determined because federal law—specifically the credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure card act of 2009 —requires that the apr be calculated in a standard way
