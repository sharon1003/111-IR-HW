sequel fatigue for the second chapter of any cinematic saga is generally a given but “avengers age of ultron” sags under the weight of not only its 10 marvel cinematic universe predecessors but also the dozen or so alreadyannounced followups in the first “avengers” writerdirector joss whedon showed a facility for bringing modern comic books to the screen with equal parts snappy banter and aweinspiring mayhem and while those gifts remain evident in “ultron” you can feel the functionality of disney’s marvel movies overwhelming the fun this latest film isn’t a cheat but neither is it a delight also read hulk battles hulkbuster in new avengers age of ultron clip video“ultron” begins with the action already in progress with iron mantony stark robert downey jr captain america  chris evans  thor chris hemsworth the hulk  mark ruffalo  black widow  scarlett johansson and hawkeye jeremy renner storming the castle of baron strucker thomas krestchmann the last uncaptured agent of hydra strucker possesses the staff of loki which contains a jewel that drives the plot in various directions particularly when stark realizes that there’s an intelligence within the stone that could provide ai for an army of robotic iron men to keep earth safe from outside invaders stark is swiftly punished for his hubris when that artificial intelligence becomes ultron voiced by james spader who infiltrates the world’s computers and begins assembling his own mechanical army to erase humanity and allow the planet to start over without us aiding ultron are two former lieutenants of strucker’s twins wanda elizabeth olsen and pietro maximoff aaron taylorjohnson whose powers as scarlet witch and quicksilver are succinctly summed up by shield’s maria hill cobie smulders “he’s fast and she’s weird” hill is too tactful to point out that their powers do not include successfully grappling with an eastern european mooseandsquirrel accent there are moments of respite between the big battles and that’s when whedon can give us his trademark badinage what he does less successfully is fit in quotidian moments with black widow hulk and hawkeye the characters who haven’t had movies named after them over the last three years add some crammedin cameos from the sidekicks from “captain america the winter soldier” “thor the lost world” and “iron man 3” and the film starts to resemble a phone booth crammed with frat pledges also read mtv movie awards robert downey jr accepts generation award from avengers costars anyone not present and accounted for — gwyneth paltrow and natalie portman had other engagements apparently — is at least mentioned in dialogue all these minor characters and blueprints for their function in the coming chapters give “ultron” a bloat that the prior film didn’t have and while the movie jumps through enough hoops to remain entertaining on a basic level it doesn’t have the giddy enjoyment factor of “avengers” and “the dark world” nor the smarts and character development of “the winter soldier” marvel movie diehards will come away having found nuggets of pleasure but those who complain about superhero sagas will find plenty to support their arguments here also readavengers sequel tracking to beat originals record opening with 200 millionplus the ensemble cast which also includes don cheadle stellan skarsgård linda cardellini and of course samuel l jackson knows exactly what they need to do and delivers it with a minimum of fuss the scenestealer of the bunch turns out to be spader who makes ultron one of the screen’s drollest destroyers of worlds ultron is menacing but never unmotivated and spader knows just how to give whedon’s dialogue the right lilt to make it both witty and terrifying it may well be that we’ll eventually stop looking at these marvel films as discrete individual experiences rather than chapters in an epic bingewatch but even by those standards “avengers age of ultron” feels like a solid but overstuffed episode one more concerned with being connective tissue than anything else future marvelmovie marathoners will find plenty of sandwichgrabbing opportunities during its running time your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available click here to visit our frequently asked questions about html5 video000  219show comments firefox chrome internet explorer 11safari cardi b shuts down celina powell’s claim that offset is her baby daddyfeatured by related content movies mtv movie awards ‘antman’ teaser debuts ahead of full trailer videoby joe otterson  april 12 2015  715 pmmovies‘avengers age of ultron’ will not have postcredits scene says joss whedon and kevin feige by greg gilman  april 8 2015  709 ammovies‘avengers infinity war’ officially welcomes its directors joe and anthony russo by linda ge  april 7 2015  914 ammovies‘avengers age of ultron’ trailer dubbed by kids is adorably action packed videoby joe otterson  april 3 2015  844 am
