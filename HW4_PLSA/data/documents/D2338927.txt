who really won on the 1st of september 1939 nazi germany invaded poland two days later great britain and france declared war on germany and thus begun the second world war the biggest and most deadly conflict in out planet’s history in short time it engulfed 3 continents its participants came from every continent bar antarctica it lasted 6 years and one day it was not until september the 2nd of 1945 that japan surrendered countless millions perished hundreds of cities were turned to ruins but who actually gained from the conflict who achieved their aims in the strictest military sense all those on the side of the allies won germany was defeated italy surrendered and imperial japan finally gave up after the united states dropped two atomic bombs on two of japan’s cities all their puppet states and allied nations like hungary bulgaria romania surrendered so every year since 1945 those who fought on the side of the allies celebrate ve and vj days however not many have a lot to celebrate at least until recently war brings change and a significant geopolitical change followed wwii the world looked much different than it did just six short years earlier borders we realigned countries went missing some new ones appeared everyone needed new maps empires died in the aftermath of wwii the so called victors lost most of their territories it seems that from all of the participants there were only two nations who actually won world war ii yes it came at a great price and to the victors should go the spoils but we are led to believe that there were more than two victors hell tens of nations have parades and commemorations every year celebrating the defeat of the axis powers great but lets look at what they actually won take poland for example you know that country in the center of europe that everyone went to war over yes that one the one germans invaded and the brits and the french would not allow to perish well in the end it turned out to be a bit more than just a fight for danzig but that’s where it started so what did poland get for losing almost 6 million of its citizens for having many of its cities in ruins for 5 years of brutal occupation for losing its best and brightest well it lost some of its most polish cities like lvow and vilno it lost its eastern territories to be fair uncle joe and roosevelt gave poland some of germany’s territories richer more developed but poland also lost its freedom because the price for breslau and stettin was 45 years of brutal communist rule under the yoke of stalin and his successors poland’s legitimate government became exiled its best and brightest those whom hitler did not manage to murder were thrown in jails or gulags were tortured murdered made paupers were exiled hooray for poland for losing almost 20 of its population in fighting the nazi menace well that’s one country that did not enjoy victory as much as it should but its only poland so who cares even if it was the fourth largest contributor to the fight against the nazis it was not seen as a serious country that mattered much lets look at real powers those who stood with poland yes the major powers of great britain and france won wwii only to lose most if their influence and power and their empires now the last of those was a good thing freedom is great but i doubt that is how the french and the brits envisioned their victories lets keep going shall we the baltic states ceased to exist alltogether they were swallowed by the soviet union yugoslavia did ok but it fell under tito and his murderers belgium and holland also lost whatever was left of their empires soon after wwii iceland became a protectorate of the united states instead of denmark norway managed to make out ok but finland pushed under hitler’s protection by stalin lost some of its territories the nations allied with great britain new zeeland australia canada south africa got just a thank you asia became one big mess korea is still divided to this day half of it still under a despotic maniac always on the brink of starvation to say nothing of oppression china already in a civil war lost millions and fell under the red menace vietman was divided all this just for a promise from uncle joe to declare war on japan what a deal easiest victory ever the soviet union did fight and gallantly too but before it did lets remember something it made a pact with hitler allowing him to start wwii it also invaded poland finland lithuania latvia and estonia soviet judges then presided over nazi generals and tried them for waging wars of aggression you can’t make this stuff up soviet union it appears was allied with nazi germany yes but it managed to do this in a way that allied powers did not see it as an enemy hell even the poles hardly fought the red army after it invaded then when hitler invaded the ussr the commies became part of the allies the allies bent over backwards to accommodate the soviets sacrificing whole nations to please uncle joe now i get realpolitik and understand why it was done i too would probably say what churchill said about the communists fair enough but there it something fundamentally wrong with this picture so what did uncle joe get for allying himself with adolf and then being betrayed by him well he got the baltic states gained territories from poland germany romania finland china and japan also control of easter europe and parts of asia did i miss anyone the soviet union became a proper empire with control of large parts of the world and influence that outgrew anything they could have imagined its amazing a truly genius political move they helped start wwii and got rewarded in the end they did not even want to switch sides stalin was quite willing to see hitler’s germany destroy large parts of europe and the world before he would actually do anything but hitler was an idiot and the commies won the other victors were the americans while they did not receive major territories for their troubles they did gain influence the isolationist america became a leading world power its influence was truly worldwide its only challenger was the soviet union instead of letting the world burn on its own america developed alliances all over the globe the world became polarized between the forces of democracy led by the united states and the forces of communism those were of course led by the kremlin fortunately the cold war is over now most of the places touched by wwii have once again become free and can finally truly celebrate however for decades there were only two places that could really celebrate on may 9th and september the 2nd and those were washington dc and moscow because for all their sacrifice and blood in defeating the nazi menace most other nations were not really victorious its not true that there are no victors in war but there are not as many as we like to believe advertisements share this reddit like this like be the first to like
