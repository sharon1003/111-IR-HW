confessions of a ragbrai addict warning bicycling across iowa can be habitforming why iowa  when is it  whats supported camping  iowa weather  roadside entertainment  the lottery  ragbrai on the web one july i tossed my bicycle into the back of my car and drove 1300 miles to iowa for my summer vacation everyone back home in vermont thought i was crazy iowa their eyes bulged their jaws dropped the misconceptions rolled off their tongues its going to be 100 degrees the whole state smells like pigs they grow a lot of potatoes right where you going ohio well at least its flat they were all wrong it was such a great vacation that ive done it five more times why because of ragbrai ragbrai is a weeklong party on two wheels the fact that you ride your bicycle across an entire state is incidental because the total experience is much more than that the carnival atmosphere in every town the delicious homecooked food street dancing to live bands the colorful sea of tents in the campgrounds the hilarious cycling team costumes thousands of tan and beautiful fellow cyclists to meet and your hosts the people of iowa all join forces to make this bicycle tour an experience youll remember for the rest of your life no wonder ragbrai is addictive just ask some riders how many times theyve done the tour youll get answers of 10 20 or even 30 years team cheddarhead from wisconsin are those ansiapproved helmets why iowa why is the biggest and best bicycle tour in the world located in the state of iowa you might think it’s just an accident of history but there are some really good reasons why a tour that started with 300 people in 1973 soared so rapidly into international prominence these reasons include the scenery the roads and most importantly the people first of all iowa is not flat it may look flat when viewed through the windshield of a speeding car on interstate 80 but when your legs are the engine you feel every uphill and every downhill and you move at a slow enough speed to appreciate the beauty of the landscape iowa is the most agricultural state in the usa with something like 98 percent of its land area under cultivation this translates to quaint villages surrounded by oceans of corn and soybean fields in late july the corn is seven or eight feet tall and you can quickly disappear from view by stepping just a few rows in it’s almost like walking into a cool shady forest that’s why cornfields serve as impromptu restrooms on ragbrai chicagos witches on wheels pause to rehydrate second iowa has an outstanding network of paved back roads with very little traffic allowing the ragbrai organizers to map out a completely new and different itinerary each year the traffic is further minimized by the iowa state police who set up roadblocks at every major intersection to keep nonemergency vehicles off the bicycle route the result is a solid mass of cyclists 20 feet wide and 20 miles long taking possession of the pavement and showing those smelly cars and trucks who’s the boss this jubilant demonstration of pedal power rolls across the state for an entire week lastly it’s the people that make ragbrai a worldclass event it’s not just being surrounded by 10000 fellow cyclists many of them sporting unique costumes all of them in a festive mood it’s also the people who live along the route warm and friendly people whose generosity is legendary these are people who take the day off from work and join the army of volunteers in each town they pull out all the stops to make you feel special iowa isn’t a tourist mecca like vermont or california so tourists are worshiped not reviled at farmhouses and street corners along the route you’ll find food stands serving up everything from grilled burgers bratwurst pork chops and turkey tenderloins to fresh sweet corn pasta salad homemade pie and handcranked homemade ice cream as you approach a town if it’s a hot day you’ll be greeted by lawn sprinklers aimed out into the road and maybe a ridethrough street shower set up by the fire department in town there’s often a street dance with a live band or dj and the municipal swimming pool usually offers a free swim and a hot shower this is their way of saying thanks for livening up our sleepy little town and pumping up the local economy pella shows off its dutch heritage with a windmill on the town square needless to say towns across the state compete each year to be chosen for next year’s ragbrai route each year in february when the official route is announced there are celebrations in several dozen towns that made the route and disappointment in all the others that will have to wait another year but for the cyclists who participate year after year the february route announcement begins five months of eager anticipation of another good time when is it ragbrai always happens the last full week in july starting on a sunday and ending the following saturday next years dates are july 25 through july 31 travelin heavy team bad boys gear includes bikemounted cooler and charcoal grill whats a supported camping tour for most cyclists ragbrai is a supported camping tour that means you stuff a tent sleeping bag and some clothes into a duffel bag which you load on a truck or van each morning on a typical day you ride 60 to 70 miles passing through several small towns along the way at the end of the day you follow signs into your campground where you’ll find your gear and set up your tent again this allows you to travel light and carry only a water bottle a bathingsuit a camera and some money by the way bring a cell phone if you have one finding an unoccupied phone booth can be a real hassle puffing up piffer hill iowa is definitely not flat if you don’t like camping you can try to find host families in the overnight towns this you do by sending a written request and one dollar to the chamber of commerce in each town if you want to sleep indoors definitely request it in writing but if they run out of beds youll be asked politely to pitch your tent in the back yard either way it’s fun to meet a local family and you stand a good chance of being invited into their house for supper andor breakfast and a shower too personally i prefer camping in the back yard as it’s often cooler than sleeping indoors and i hate air conditioning you can also rent an rv and sleep on board surrounded by dozens of other rvs with their engines running all night no thanks a small minority of cyclists stay in motels – but they’re expensive and they’re booked up within a few days after the route is announced in february again not for me eating isnt a problem it’s one of the joys of ragbrai there is food everywhere it’s homecooked delicious and inexpensive compared to the east or west coast plan on 3 or 4 for an allyoucaneat pancake breakfast a similar amount for lunch on the road and 5 or 6 for an allyoucaneat spaghetti lasagna or chicken supper the best food is served by churches and civic groups i’m religious about attending the church suppers they’re a great way to meet people you sit at long tables and you might end up sitting across from someone from your home state or someone from halfway around the world just don’t worry about gaining weight after cycling all day you can eat as much as you want its been said that the average ragbrai participant gains about five pounds during the week but everyone ends up tanner and slimmer the physiological explanation is that you’ve converted flabby fat into dense muscle tissue a prominent feature of ragbrai is the bicycle clubs and the teams these groups charter buses and rent trucks to get you your gear and your bicycle to and from the ride they also carry your gear all week long from one campground to the next who could resist homemade pie and ice cream the author on a hot date the rainbow cyclists bike club based in waterloo offers all that plus more on a nonprofit basis and charges about 150 for the week which includes the 90 ragbrai registration fee rainbow’s truck drivers have developed the campground setup procedure into an art form first they erect a 20by30foot tent canopy then they pull out a stack of lawn chairs and set them up under the canopy then they bring out an array of coolers and fill them with soda called pop in the midwest juice and ice the final steps in making the campground homey are setting up the portable shower enclosures and laying everyone’s shower bags out in the sun to heat up these rugged plastic bags hold up to five gallons of water which is more than enough to shower with the plastic is clear on one side and black on the other if you fill it with cold water and lay it black side down in the sun the water quickly heats up to 100 degrees or more then you hang it on a hook in the shower enclosure open the nozzle and you’re in business team gumbys converted school bus has a rooftop observation deck there are always lots of alternatives for showering – schools college dorms swimming pools etc – but showering right in the campground is hard to beat unless you’re staying with a host family another wellrun club is team mooreon based in sacramento california they travel with two rvs to carry gear and stay with a host family every night the biggest challenge is getting to iowa if you don’t already live there about half the riders come from out of state and they represent all 50 states plus a couple dozen foreign countries if you fly out charter buses will pick you up at the omaha or des moines airport and drive you to the starting point of the ride the same buses will collect you at the finish and drop you off at the nearest airport there’s a long list of charter bus operators and the best advice is to sign up with one of them before making your plane reservations most cyclists arrive at ragbrais starting point on saturday camp overnight and theyre ready to roll out at dawn on sunday but consider doing all your traveling a day early on friday then on saturday you can take a short warmup ride in the morning and spend the afternoon relaxing and watching the convoys of buses roll into town and disgorge crowds of anxious cyclists searching frantically for campsites this makes ragbrai a nine or tenday vacation iowa weather the weather in iowa only makes the news if it’s severe usually it’s not daytime high temperatures are typically in the 80s sometimes with low humidity sometimes high lows are in the 60s it usually doesnt cool off at night in iowa the way it does in vermont but there are exceptions in five ragbrais ive seen it a chilly 50 degrees in the morning and a steamy 95 degrees in the afternoon but not both in the same day most days are sunny and there have been ragbrais where not a drop of rain fell except at night make sure not to pitch your tent in a low spot the wind is usually at your back because ragbrai always travels west to east like the prevailing wind severe weather if there is any usually hits late in the day which provides a strong incentive to get up early and finish early the most popular riding schedule is to start between 6 and 7 am and finish around 2 or 3 pm which allows plenty of time to join in the festivities in each town along the way when the official route is announced you’ll find out a lot about what’s in store there’s a threeyear cycle central iowa 2001 northern 2002 and southern 2003 so the 2004 route should cross central iowa as the cycle repeats the hilliest parts of iowa are the southwest and northeast corners northwest and northcentral iowa are the flattest and they also have the coolest driest climate but whatever the route it always starts by the banks of the missouri river on the west and finishes on the mississippi river front on the east by tradition riders dip their rear tires in the missouri on the first day and dip their front tires in the mississippi on the last some overexuberant participants actually ride their bikes into the river until they tip over and start to float away warning 20yearold bikes don’t appreciate that kind of treatment roadside entertainment regardless of the weather you’ll find plenty of entertainment some of it stationary some on two wheels and some on four in the first category are the ubiquitous bicycle sculptures made with anything from hay bales to weldedtogether junk bikes in the twowheeled category are the team costumes ranging from custom headgear to implausible items attached to the rear ends of bicycles then there are the tshirts some of the memorable ones witches on wheels team mosquito we really suck pms express we go with the flow tall dog bike club a leg up on the rest other tshirt designs rely more heavily on graphics than on slogans finally there are the tshirts that commemorate the trials and tribulations of lessthanperfect ragbrais in years past rain wind hills heat – my kind of vacation drink enough you’ll forget it’s iowa and heres one thats particularly appealing if you’re not having fun lower your standards and don’t forget the fourwheeled attractions the team buses old school buses which have been repainted creatively emblazoned with colorful graphics outfitted with rooftop observation decks and which tend to show up in the late afternoon wherever the music is loud a wholesome way to get a quick spurt of energy is to visit the local swimming pool preferably around lunchtime you can always get a good hot shower there either before or after your swim or both make sure your hairs still damp when you climb back on your bike and it will keep you cool for miles as it slowly airdries sag wagons and bike repair vans patrol the official route during the day in the evening the bike mechanics team up with tshirt vendors to set up a bustling shopping arcade in the main campground nearly everyone buys at least one commemorative tshirt with a route map printed on the back a custom dating back to the 1974 tour if you want a tshirt plan to get one early in the week or your favorite design will probably be sold out the same goes for ragbrai postcards buttons stickers and other paraphernalia over the years ragbraiers have even created their own language aside from regionalisms like pop soda and sack bag you’ll certainly encounter the word kybo which means portable toilet a common fixture in the campgrounds another essential term to grasp is beer slide a bizarre competition in which contestants launch themselves on their bellies and slide across a welllubricated bar room floor not recommended on wood floors due to the risk of splinters the lottery admission to ragbrai is by lottery and if you’re chosen it costs 90 to register some years ragbrai doesn’t fill up but usually it does and it helps to plan ahead the main drawing takes place in april request an entry form from the des moines register beginning the last sunday in february and mail it in before march 31 most of the iowa bike clubs such as rainbow cyclists get a special allocation of ragbrai passes and the clubs hold their own drawings in january fortunately membership in these clubs is open to outofstaters but to enter a club drawing you must join the club no later than november and you will receive an entry form in the club newsletter which you typically must postmark on january 2nd in order to have a chance if you lose out in the club
