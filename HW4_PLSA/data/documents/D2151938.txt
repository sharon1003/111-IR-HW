will southwest airlines follow west jets example of international expansion canadas secondlargest airline is entering a new phase in its international growth could it serve as an outline for southwests potential international plans alexander mac lennan  tulip speculator1jul 8 2014 at 926amcanadas west jet airlines  tsx wja is often thought of as the southwest airlines  nyse luv of the north west jet having started out decades after an expanding southwest found reliable profits in a turbulent industry is now canadas secondlargest airline behind the 78yearold air canada but as west jet looks beyond the domestic canadian market for growth does its expansion strategy give us a hint at what southwest airlines may do next challenging the big guys southwest and west jet have both built their businesses on challenging big established legacy airlines in southwests case it was the legacy carriers that had divided domestic and international flying among themselves and in west jets case it was competition with the privatized former crown corporation air canada these two airlines managed to succeed in an industry where almost all startups perish dragging millions of investor dollars down along with them but having established themselves solidly in their respective domestic markets southwest and west jet are increasingly looking abroad for additional growth where to go despite being around nearly 30 years longer than its canadian counterpart southwest hasnt needed to look internationally for continued growth as much as west jet with the canadian market being about oneninth the size of the u s market based on population continued growth has pushed west jet to launch flights to the u s mexico the caribbean and central america meanwhile the larger u s market has provided plenty of room for southwests expansion with flights to mexico being available only through air tran which southwest acquired in 2011 southwest is now busy making former air tran routes into southwest routes and recently announced plans to switch its international service in the caribbean from air tran to southwest while not brandnew expansion of the companys overall network it does begin international service under the southwest name continuing in its own expansion west jet looked to europe next starting seasonal flights between st johns newfoundland and dublin ireland while transatlantic flights seem like a major increase in distance for an airline that previously kept to within the americas west jet notes that st johns is actually closer to dublin than it is to calgary following west jet west jet has long been seen as a follower of southwest by introducing the model of a lowcost carrier into the canadian market but as expanding airlines know the domestic market can only fulfill growth plans for so long before international expansion is required west jet ran into this issue faster because of the smaller size of the canadian market and began expanding internationally and across the atlantic sooner than southwest did fleet management southwest and west jet have taken very similar fleet management strategies with both carriers having boeing 737 variants as their only jet aircraft allowing them to benefit from reduced maintenance costs and increased pilot flexibility but west jet is realizing it will need new equipment to compete in the transatlantic market on longer routes and has noted plans to introduce widebody aircraft within the next couple of years while having 737 aircraft as its only jets makes sense for a fleet flying within the domestic market and the americas transatlantic flights always always involve larger aircraft looking at how west jet is adding widebody aircraft for transatlantic operations it wouldnt be surprising to see southwest do the same once it decides to expand across the atlantic transatlantic expansion is probably at least a few years down the road for southwest since the airline is still working to restructure flights in mexico and the caribbean however if southwest does decide to expand beyond the americas investors should keep an eye on what new equipment the airline buys has the student become the master southwest airlines posted a remarkable record of growth and profitability from over the past few decades and a similar strategy and performance by west jet has led to frequent comparisons between the two but as southwest has expanded within the domestic u s market west jet has sought opportunities outside its smaller domestic canadian market this has led west jet to begin transatlantic flights and even discuss ordering widebody aircraft for further overseas growth so as west jet expands beyond its home market southwest investors should watch to see what may
