service catalog – business services versus technical services submitted by joni roenspie on dec 5 2013 itil and itsm have been around a long time and many it professionals still do not understand what an it service is including many itil experts itil defines a service asa means of delivering value to customers by facilitating outcomes which customers want to achieve without the ownership of specific costs and risks while this is succinct it is far too esoteric to effectively aid in defining services or even what components make up a service and this is a good place to start in short an it service is everything the it user consumes defining it service parameters before an it department can define what services they provide there needs to be an understanding of what components make up a service people – those resources necessary for delivering the service processes – lays the foundation and provides direction for supporting the service technology – hardware software infrastructure outcome – the results of the above components then once defined the list of it services becomes the service catalog based on the itil methodology the service catalog is broken down into two categories business services technical services therein lies an area of confusion it professionals are experienced at defining what technical services are but struggle to understand business services business service catalog – it service components and provisioning the business service catalog contains services that customers need and use as seen from their perspective which could come to it in the form of an incident or a request examples of items in this catalog are email requesting a new laptop howto questions and reporting service disruptions the technical service catalog defines the it components necessary to support the provisioning of services to end users eg hosting network backup security etc the audience for this catalog is the it department and these services should not be included in the business user view of the service catalog technical services required for business services technical services are required in order to provide business services it operations groups usually begin the service catalog journey with the technical service catalog where they define technical services such as email application hosting data backup and recovery etc however the value is higher for the business service catalog in the eyes of executives and the organization as a whole outside of customerfacing areas like service desk desktop services senior it leadership and to some extent project managers most it professionals have very little contact with their customer or understanding of the impact that technical services have on the business this is in large part due to a lack of relating technology to business functions information technology infrastructure library itilinformation technology infrastructure library itil was created on the foundation of building a culture of it as a service but without a clear understanding of the relationship between technical services and their impact on the business implementing itil aligned processes and tools will only get you so far a network engineer should not be expected to understand the technology and process needs of the finance department any more than an accounts payable specialist should know about routers hubs and switches a business relationship manager brm can bring significant value to an it department and the business and often plays an overlooked and undervalued role in it in order to get the most value out of adopting itil or any other methodology it needs to clearly understand the business it supports the needs of the business the services they provide and the success criteria in the eyes of the business user for more information on itil or itsm please visit our landesk page email linked in twitter google share
