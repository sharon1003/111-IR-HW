… debt collectors a debt collector came after me for 897the first thing you must do before paying off debt may 13 2014 • 5 min read by gerri detweiler 43 comments maybe you can’t pay or maybe you won’t pay either way you have an old debt hanging out there what if you just decide to let it go and do nothing about it that’s what creditcom reader dave who says he can’t afford to pay off the old debts he owes asks my credit card debt is roughly 12000 i consulted a bankruptcy attorney he said filing bankruptcy should not be my first option since the amount is quite low and the collectors have stopped calling in california is there a 3 or 4 years of limit by which the collection agency can file lawsuit after that time they can’t sue then what happens can they still collect but not sue debt still stays on credit files if they can’t sue me since it’s about 4 years since it went into collection and the attorney said filing may not be good idea for such small amount then what dave’s question is hardly unusual plenty of people wonder what will happen if they simply do nothing about an old debt“there is no law saying that they cannot try to collect after the statute of limitations has expired” says southern california consumer law attorney robert brennan at least not in california where he practices and in most states it’s the same — though if you’re considering this move you’ll want to consult an attorney who knows your state’s rules “in california on written contracts the statute is four years from the date of breach which in most cases will probably be the same as date of first delinquency”he goes on to explain that “under the fair debt collection practices act debt collectors may not make false representations in connection with collecting debts and may not take or threaten to take legal action that cannot be taken so if a debt collector threatens to sue the consumer past the statute of limitations this may well be a fdcpa violation and i would argue that it is if a debt collector tells a consumer that it can sue the consumer five years past the date of first delinquency this is a false representation made in connection with debt collecting and is also actionable under fdcpa”in other words if a debt collector threatens to take you to court after the statute of limitations has expired you can actually sue them in which case they may end up owing you money does any of this mean dave won’t hear anything more about these debts probably not “if a collector makes routine debt collection phone calls and does not otherwise violate the fdcpa or mislead the consumer the debt collector may continue to attempt to collect the debt” says brennan nevertheless consumers always have the right to tell a debt collector not to contact them and if the debt collector continues to call they again may be in violation of the fdcpa the statute of limitations varies from state to state and may be different for various types of consumer debts in many states they often range from four to six years calculated from the last payment on the debt want to reduce your student loan payments compare your options privacy policy collections  your credit as far as dave’s credit reports are concerned these debts can’t be reported forever collection accounts may be reported for seven years plus 180 days from the original date of delinquency — the date he first fell behind with the original creditor so if he missed a payment to his credit card company on jan 1 2000 and it was later sent to collections jan 1 2000 is the original date of delinquency after that 7 12year time period elapses all collection accounts related to that particular debt can no longer be reported regardless of whether they are paid or not there is the risk however that one of the current collectors sells the account to another collection agency and that creates a new collection account starting over in addition to wondering about his old debt dave wonders what to do about his credit going forward would you suggest i apply of secure card can i even though i’ve debts in collection and would a new secure card improve my fico even though my old debts are showing up in my files a secured card which requires the cardholder to place a security deposit with the issuer is often an excellent option for rebuilding credit and the applicant generally need not have good credit to get one of these cards since the line of credit is fully backed up by the deposit at least initially  we explain secured credit cards in greater detail here  when it comes to rebuilding credit it’s usually best to start as soon as possible it takes time to build positive credit references one of the factors used to calculate credit scores is the age of accounts at the same time however dave should also be thinking about ways to shore up his finances so he’ll have adequate emergency savings in case he runs into difficult times in the future he can review his credit reports for free once a year and monitor his credit scores for free on sites like creditcom updates are available every 14 days where he will also get an action plan for improving his credit over time as

years ago i just recently finished a garnishment on my job it was started to me by a medaition company that there was nothing that could be done about this because the collection agency went through the proper procedure the debt was from 1998 then it was in the hands of another collection that bought the debt up to 2008 they then proceed it in 2013 i was force to pay a debt that started out being 685 and totaled to be 2100 debt plus interest and penalties  can you possibly explain how this could be michael bovee • 3 years ago the best explanation as to how what happened was possible or if what happened should not have would likely come from an experienced debt collection defense attorney in your state you can find one through wwwnacanet kevin • 3 years ago gerry what state are you in nursemaru • 3 years ago you say here there is the risk however that one of the current collectors sells the account to another collection agency and that creates a new collection account  while it does create a new account the original date of delinquency still stands the new collection account does not mean that the clock starts over on the debt the original date always governs the time of reportability no matter who owns the debt just wanted to make that clear because its a bit confusing in the article gerri detweiler • 3 years ago yes thats correct thanks for pointing that out kaiser sa • 10 months ago exactly samuel pong • 2 years agothank you for that mi wi • 3 years ago i received a super nasty call from a debt collector about a month ago re a credit card first opened in 1997 my credit had been ruined and still is due to identity theft due to relatives  some of them have troubles with drugs and their friends obtaining my information this credit card was given to me for a business trip by my employer who had no intention of ever paying it i actually paid off and on for this debt until december of 2007 until i could just no longer afford to even though i paid the amount never really went down due to interest charges the debt collector stated that they are filing a claim against me for this debt which is now at 7000 although the original was about 1800 i havent seen any paperwork regarding this before or after they started calling what can i do gerri detweiler • 3 years ago in this situation i would really recommend you talk with a consumer law attorney since this is a business debt and not a consumer debt the normal consumer protection laws do not all apply here however it sounds questionable as to whether you should have been held responsible in the first place if the employer gave you the card and you never signed anything and secondly it sounds as though the statute of limitations may have expired but youll want to check with an attorney who understands this area of law to make sure visit the national association of consumer advocates website if you need a referral wsay • 3 years ago what is all thismay stuff if the consumer advises in writing a creditor or debt collector or attorney trying to collect the debt that he or she wishes the person to stop contacting them under the law theyre required to stop contacting them period if they do contact you after that they absolutely violated the fdcpa and you should sue them your attorney fees and costs will be paid by the debt collector you will not have to pay them at all as for the credit report while it is true that it can be reported on your credit for seven years plus 31 days not 7 12 years as reported here once you sue the debt collector under the fdcpa you can usually negotiate it away from your credit report gerri detweiler • 3 years ago if you ask the debt collector to stop contacting you they are required to stop if they dont they have broken the law the reason the word may is in there is because they are allowed to contact you about legal action they are taking to collect the debt we didnt get into that in detail in this article though we have written many other articles about collection that include other aspects of the issue as for the time period that collection accounts may be reported the fcra says c running of reporting period 1 in general the 7year period referred to in paragraphs 4 and 62 of subsection a shall begin with respect to any delinquent account that is placed for collection internally or by referral to a third party whichever is earlier charged to profit and loss or subjected to any similar action upon the expiration of the 180day period beginning on the date of the commencement of the delinquency which immediately preceded the collection activity charge to profit and loss or similar action wsay • 3 years ago i understand however it is very dangerous for them to contact you about legal action they are taking to collect the debt because if they make the slightest effort to collect the debt in the process of telling you that they have violated the fdcpa and since the fdcpa is strict liability and since they will have to pay all the consumers attorney fees and costs when they lose ive never heard of a debt collector who sends a letter telling a consumer about legal action they are taking to collect the debt as for the 180 day period i also do not think that that is carved in stone however i will admit that the fdcpa is somewhat complicated in the way its written i think another very important piece of advice that should be given to consumers is that under the fdcpa it makes no difference if they dispute the debt with the credit provider they have to dispute the debt with the credit reporting agency they can be disputing the debt with the creditor for years and if they never dispute the debt with the credit reporting agency they cannot bring a lawsuit under the fdcpa larry gonzales • 3 years ago i would like to know if i took out a loan to pay off some of or maybe all of my delinquent bills on my credit report would that be wise to do and in doing that will that help in improve my credit score or hurt my score chris m • 3 years ago if you send a cd letter to the collection agency they are indeed allowed one final communication with you said communication has to either be paraphrasing we are ceasing all further collection efforts or well see you in court the latter only applies if the debt is still within the sol of course theres also some case law about this type of letter and having the words this is an attempt to collect a debt printed on the front of the page being a violation but its complicated and easily defeated example we are ceasing all collection efforts and the this is an attempt to collect a debt being preprinted at the bottom of the page theyll likely win from bona fide error as for your second paragraph i can only assume you mean fcra instead of fdcpa the fdcpa does not apply to creditors period it only applies to 3rd party debt collectors including attorneys who regularly attempt to collect debts for others disputing with the cra andor creditor has nothing to do with the fdcpa you can technically make an fcra case out of it section 623 but you have to take steps in a very specific order or the consumer has no private right of action under that part of the act gerri detweiler • 3 years ago good points  thanks for weighing injb • 3 years ago the consumer should come up with a plan to pay back what is owed and then be concerned with applying for new credit thanks marcie • 3 years ago keep in mind that even if you do tell a debt collector to stop contacting you that does not mean they have to stop all efforts to collect the debt including filing a lawsuit and getting a judgment wjich can then be liquidated via garnishment liens seizing assets freezing accounts etc as long as the sol hasnt run and if they sell the debt to another collection agency the statute could conceivably never run out once someone has a judgment youre never off the hook as judgments can be renewed if theyre not satisfied before they run out and judgments last a lot longer than the typical sol and judgments also accrue statutory interest until paid in full the rate varying by state or the contract they also will include attorneys fees costs and any other expenses in connection with the default of the debt like late fees over limit fees etc in the end youre far better off either making a payment arrangement with the original creditir if youre having a problem ir even with the first collection agency if its already gone that far telling them to stop will only make the problem worse andyou wont even have the benefit of advance warning i was a collection attorney many years ago and i can tell you its only gotten worse for debtors in the past few years your best move is to communicate with the creditor to make the best arrangement you can as soon as possible then stick to the agreement get receipts and a paid in full letter when its done alvin • 3 years ago marcie said  if they sell the debt to another collection agency the statute could conceivably never run outthis is incorrect selling a debt sites not restart or revive the statute of limitations period marcie said once someone has a judgment youre never off the hook as judgments can be renewed if theyre not satisfied before they run outthis is generally incorrect most judgments like judgments for credit card debt cannot be renewed forever and eventually will expire notable exceptions are criminal restitution and child support judgments which never expire marcie said in the end youre far better off either making a payment arrangement with the original creditir sic if youre having a problem ir sic even with the first collection agency if its already gone that far telling them to stop will only make the problem worse andyou wont even have the benefit of advance warning your best move is to communicate with the creditor to make the best arrangement you can as soon as possible then stick to the agreement get receipts and a paid in full letter when its done this is bad advice as a blanket statement because each debt situation is different for example some debtors may be collection proof because they dont own many assets and only have exempt income like social security income for those folks a letter telling the debt collectors to cease communications might be their best move or some debtors might have multiple creditors and be unable to get them all to agree on an affordable payment plan for those debtors bankruptcy might be the smart course of action a payment plan might work for some but its not a onesuitefitsall solution marcie said   i can tell you its only gotten worse for debtors in the past few yearsreally how has it gotten worse for debtors please be specific because as a consumer bankruptcy attorney i see honest but unfortunate debtors getting relief from their overwhelming debts everyday marcie said i was a collection attorney many years agobottom line i dont think it is wise for debtors to take advice from a former collections attorney alvin • 3 years ago sorry for my typos i meant to say selling a debt does not restart or revive the statute of limitations period and a payment plan might work for some but its not a onesizefitsall solution jimmy • 3 years ago i made a terrible mistake of authorizing a second card on my personal card for an associate with a small business the credit line on my card was 21k and this person was able to stretch it to 65k by entering false payments to clear the credit and cash advances before the payment rejected bottom line is im left with 65k in debt and my former associate is no where to be found and not willing to pay looking for a miracle here gerri detweiler • 3 years ago so sorry to hear this you should at least talk with a bankruptcy attorney sounds like you really need legal advice tom gibson • 5 days ago i received a notification from credit karma today that a collection account had been added to my trans union report i was a little surprised

a huge amount of debt from a private loan company from school i have my repayment starting in june and the payments are like 1000 a month which i cannot afford ive called the company and they said the only option was forbearance my coworkers were telling me that they wouldnt pay a single thing and just wait out 7 years because then i will be able to rebuild my credit and the debt will be gone the amount i owe is about 87700 in student loans from sallie mae not sure what to do because right now my credit is nearly at 700 so i was wondering how hard my credit will be hit for those 7 years i also am fairly young and do not plan on buying a house or a car in the near future need advicejeanine skowronski • 11 months ago ignoring the debt would severely damage your credit for that timeframe beyond that you could face a judgment and garnishment if you just ignore the debt and leave it unpaid also worth noting private students loans are subject to the 7year credit reporting window but other student loans arent  as such its worthwhile to pursue forbearance options more herehttpblogcreditcom2015httpblogcreditcom2015 thanksjeanine marni • 1 year ago can someone give me some advice please i got a car in the the summer of 2013 after my college graduation i paid the note on time for a little over 15 years after that i lost my job and moved to a different city the car was repossessed the original amount that i owed for the car was about 17k my credit report now shows that the account for the car loan is in the charged offcollections status the balance showing on my credit report is 3776 last year in january i guess the bank sent the account to their law firm or maybe its the collection agencys law firm they sent me a letter saying that i owed 45k and to contact them to set up a payment plan and if i dont they can sue well i didnt do it and this year they sent me another letter in january the exact wording saysin view of your failure to pay the balance referenced above or agree and adhere to a reasonable plan for payment we have recommended and the creditor has authorized the institution of suit against you please take a moment to help yourself by contacting this office as soon as possible or we may be forced to forward the matter to local counsel in your area with instructions to institute suit if suit is instituted in addition to the balance outstanding the suit will seek you be found liable for cost incurred or court costs and process server costs plus interest in summary we are willing to work with you but at this point your cooperation is essential so please guide your actions accordingly the amount is now 46k should i just set up a payment plan with them i dont want my wages garnished my worry is whats going to stop them from continuing to increase the balance they didnt give me a breakdown of the charges so im worried jeanine skowronski • 1 year ago so if the collector does sue it could lead to a judgment which could result in wage garnishment and more adverse affects to your credit as such it could be worthwhile to call the creditor and see what they are offering in regards to a payment plan but whether you agree to one is entirely up to you you can find more about the pros and cons of debt settlement herehttpblogcreditcom2012 if you do decide to work something out with them be sure to get the agreement in writing youll want to ask them to stipulate the total amount you will owe and what the payments will be you should also ask them to agree in writing not to pursue further adverse action against you meaning a lawsuit while you are paying you may also want to consult a consumer attorney about your best recourse here some do offer free consults and remember while collectors have every right to try to recoup a legitimate debt there are things they are prohibited from doing while they try to do so it can help to familiarize yourself with your rights under fdcpa when dealing with a debt collector

full in november of 2002 i lost my career through no fault of my own due to sabotage by hostile coworkers at this point i could no longer work in any work environment and havent to this day now feb 2017 it took over ten years but i was finally processed on federal disability in 2015 back in 2003 when i lost my career i called in to my car loan and gave the car back to them in pristine 34 month old condition by voluntary repossession since i would no longer have income through any fault of my own nor ability to change they not i chose to sell the car at auction for half its value they could have sold the car for 500 or 1000 off and as a multi billion dollar car company written off the small loss without blinking an eye instead in typical conservativeamericangreed fashion they have chosen to try to ruin my life since this point over the past 14 years various debt collectors have constantly harassed me through mail each one choosing random debt amounts ive had some ask for 1500 and now this week i got a letter demanding 18000 more than the vehicle originally cost one collection agency several years ago even went to court for a garnishment and lost money as i have no garnishable income and so long as there is a threat of garnishment for a debt i do not owe as i will not pay for air which is what they are asking me to do i will never move to a position where i am making garnishable income as i will not tolerate the theft of my wages i paid for the vehicle while i had it i returned it and they undersold it not my responsibility i will never pay a cent for charges and fees that are arbitrary mobgangster style lending practices my question is at what point do i have grounds to sue the collection agencies that are harassing me they are damaging my health by exasperating the generalized anxiety disorder and depression i suffer from causing me untold costs in healthcare and sickness all over an invalid debt that is 14 years old by a greedy corporation and

to collect that depends on state law and what property is exempt the best person to answer those specific questions is a bankruptcy attorney the california courts website actually provides some useful information on collecting judgments that may help you understand what they may try to do as for the timeshare i am afraid i dont know enough of the specifics of california law to advise you generally the creditor would try to get a judgment as you expect and then will be able to try to collect in the same way mentioned above marc tee • 2 years ago what type of debt is the hoa duesannual
