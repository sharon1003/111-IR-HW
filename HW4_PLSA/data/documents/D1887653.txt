kalakand milk burfi recipe how to make kalakand recipe  kalakand recipe august 21 2017 by maria 10 comments kalakand milk burfi recipe a traditional indian sweet also known as milk cakes  when is kalakand milk burfi made mostly made on janmashtami lord krishna’s birth durga puja raksha bandhan diwali and some more festive occasions in india this sweet is soft tempting healthy tasty and is my favorite there are lots of ways to make kalakand milk burfi however like usual i have chosen the tough way to make it so please be patient while making this milk barfi this is purely made with milk chenna and sugar what is chenna its indian cottage cheese made home you could also call use ready cottage cheese from the market however making chenna paneer home is different fun i have changed the pictures of this recipe as didn’t liked the previous pics so i have slightly modified the recipe and pictures also you could replace sugar with condensed milk and also add some milk powder if you add milk powder the milk thickens much faster although i haven’t used i will still encourage you to use milk powder as the milk thickening process takes real long time so if you add milk powder the time consumed will be much lesser but this choice i leave upto you …this kalakand milk burfi comes with a twist instead of spreading them on a platter have shaped them in small tequila glasses also further to enhance its flavor and presentation have added frozen mango puree this is optional you could go the regular plain jane way or stylish way upto you if you looking for more festive sweets then do
