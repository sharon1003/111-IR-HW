regularly exhibit unique variations in price behaviour and this year is no exception in recent weeks average delivered elevator prices for crimson lentils in saskatchewan have enjoyed a strong rally new crop crimson bids have been pulled up to levels which are higher than postharvest prices were in 2012 and 2013 this buoyancy is bound to attract acreage and increase future supplies note crimson’s proximity to their old highs which could provide overhead resistance and the approach of their typically steep seasonal downturn in contrast laird lentil prices have been relatively lethargic and are currently well below their old highs and 5 and 9 year averages even new crop laird prices are about ¾ of a centlb below crimsons some can be forgiven if they are not excited but if the result is relatively tighter future supplies this year’s typical postharvest price recovery could be better than average pinto beans are demonstrably more volatile than navy and black beans but the magnitude of their 2014 price drop is remarkable although pintos do not have a history of “leading” the others the price differences may have encouraged acreage switches in favour of the higher priced navies and blacks if so greater supplies of navies and blacks and a smaller crop of pintos could encourageprices to converge again however this does pose a risk that navy bean and pinto prices could soften somewhat finally remember that edible beans tend to make abrupt price adjustments each year in june so any surprise should be sooner rather than later yellows may be caught in a near term tugofwar between the bullish threat of excess moisture and the bearish menace of weaker corn looking at yellow pea prices in isolation their slow recovery and shallow uptrend line seems to be stalling underneath a zone of overhead resistance moreover the typical seasonal tendency suggests the threat of a fairly immediate downturn given that yellow pea prices have a rough relationship with both corn and feed wheat cbot corn’s recent retreat is reminiscent of the 2009 experience that ultimately pulled the other two lower however in 2009 it is noteworthy that yellows had a late bout of strength arrow before heading down might this year’s excessive rains produce similar behaviour p rairie crop charts converted to a subscriber based service on september 1 2014 don’t miss out onfuture crop

market has a major decision to make for crimson lentils one question to be answered concerns the significance of this year’s tardy and lighter than normal indian monsoon rains over coming weeks south asian buyers will make productionsupply judgements based on local conditions and set their import strategy accordingly as a major crimson exporter canada often fills the role of “swing” supplier and our prices reflect their decisions while waiting for a chart breakout or failure note that new crop crimson prices are below old crop and not far from the long term average of 0226lb this may suggest ongoing commercial caution in front of a probably large canadian crop for the moment the crimson chart can not confirm if recent price gains represent simple precautionary buying or the first sign of a scramble that answer should come soon pea charts and commentary available to subscribers only lentil charts and commentary available to subscribers only pea charts and commentary available to
