rights first published mon dec 19 2005 substantive revision wed sep 9 2015rights are entitlements not to perform certain actions or not to be in certain states or entitlements that others not perform certain actions or not be in certain states rights dominate modern understandings of what actions are permissible and which institutions are just rights structure the form of governments the content of laws and the shape of morality as it is currently perceived to accept a set of rights is to approve a distribution of freedom and authority and so to endorse a certain view of what may must and must not be done this entry begins by describing the nature of rights their classification their composition and their function it then reviews the history of the language of rights and various relationships between rights and reasons the major contemporary philosophical approaches to the justification of rights are compared and the entry concludes by surveying criticisms of rights and “rights talk” the focus throughout is on general theoretical issues instead of on the analysis or justification of specific rights or types of rights those looking for fuller introductions to rights

to vote to work to strike a right to one phone call to dissolve parliament to operate a forklift to asylum to equal treatment before the law to feel proud of what one has done a right to exist to sentence an offender to death to launch a nuclear first strike to castle kingside to a distinct genetic identity a right to believe ones eyes to pronounce the couple husband and wife to be left alone to go to hell in ones own way we encounter assertions of rights as we encounter sounds persistently and in great variety making sense of this profusion of assertions requires that we class rights together by common attributes rightsassertions can be categorized for example according to who is alleged to have the right childrens rights animal rights workers rights states rights the rights of peoples what actions or states or objects the asserted right pertains to rights of free expression to pass judgment rights of privacy to remain silent property rights bodily rights why the rightholder allegedly has the right moral rights are grounded in moral reasons legal rights derive from the laws of the society customary rights exist by local convention how the asserted right can be affected by the rightholders actions the inalienable right to life the forfeitable right to liberty and the waivable right that a promise be kept many of these categories have subcategories for instance natural rights are the subclass of moral rights that humans have because of their nature or again the rights of political speech are a subclass of the rights of free expression the study of particular rights is primarily an investigation into how such categories and subcategories overlap there has been much discussion for example of whether human rights are natural rights whether the right to privacy is a legal right and whether the legal right to life is a forfeitable right for the central jurisprudential debate over the relation between legal and moral rights see legal positivism  natural law theories and the nature of law  sometimes theorists will also focus within some subcategory for example steiner 2013 questions whether inalienable or unwaivable rights are logically possible and andersson 2013 discusses who moral rightholders are2 the analysis of rights categorization sorts the profusion of rights assertions to understand the exact meaning of any assertion of a right we need to understand more precisely how rights are constructed and what they do an analysis of rights has two parts a description of the internal structure of rights their form and a description of what rights do for those who hold them their function the hohfeldian system for describing the form of rights is widely accepted although there are scholarly quarrels about its details which theory gives the best account of the function of rights has been much more contentious we turn to that debate in section 321 the form of rights the hohfeldian analytical system analysis reveals that most familiar rights such as the right to free expression or the right of private property have a complex internal structure such rights are ordered arrangements of basic components much in the same way that most molecules are ordered arrangements of chemical elements the four basic components of rights are known as “the hohfeldian incidents” after wesley hohfeld 1879–1918 the american legal theorist who discovered them these four basic “elements” are the privilege the claim the power and the immunity each of these hohfeldian incidents has a distinctive logical form and the incidents fit together in characteristic ways to create complex “molecular” rights211 privileges or libertiesyou have a right to pick up a shell that you find on the beach this right is a privilege a has a privilege to φ if and only if a has no duty not to φ to say that you have a right to pick up the shell is to say that you have no duty not to pick it up you will not be violating any duty not to pick up the shell should you decide to do so similarly your right to sit in an empty seat in the cinema and your right to paint your bedroom red are also privileges privilegerights mark out what their bearer has no duty not to do when us presidents invoke “executive privilege” they deny an assertion that they have a duty not to conceal evidence they assert a hohfeldian privilege similarly a license to drive to perform surgery to kill endows its holder with a privilege to engage in the licensed activity some writers on rights have preferred to speak of “liberties” instead of “privileges” eg steiner 1994 59–60 others have given these two terms different definitions eg thomson 1990 53–55 to avoid confusion this entry will always use “privilege” and never “liberty” to refer to the incident defined above 212 claims a contract between employer and employee confers on the employee a right to be paid her wages this right is a claim a has a claim that b φ if and only if b has a duty to a to φ the employee has a claim that the employer pays her her wages which means that the employer has a duty to the employee to pay those wages as seen in the definition and the example every claimright correlates to a duty in at least one dutybearer what is distinctive about the claimright is that a dutybearers duty is “directed at” or “owed to” the rightholder some claimrights exist independently of voluntary actions like signing a contract and some claimrights correspond to duties in more than one agent for example a childs claimright against abuse exists independently of anyones actions and the childs claimright correlates to a duty in every other person not to abuse him ie the claim right is in rem  this example of the childs right also illustrates how a claimright can require dutybearers to refrain from performing some action ie that “phi” can be a negative verb such as “not abuse her” bodily and property rights are paradigmatic rights with claimrights at their core213 powers privileges and claims define what hart called “primary rules” rules requiring that people perform or refrain from performing particular actions hart 1961 indeed the primary rules for all physical actions are properly analyzed as privileges and claims were we to know all privileges and claims concerning physical actions we would know for every possible physical action whether that action was permitted required or forbidden two further hohfeldian incidents define what hart called “secondary rules” rules that specify how agents can introduce and change primary rules the hohfeldian power is the incident that enables agents to alter primary rules a has a power if and only if a has the ability to alter her own or anothers hohfeldian incidents a ships captain has the powerright to order a midshipman to scrub the deck the captains exercise of this power changes the sailors normative situation it imposes a new duty upon the sailor and so annuls one of his hohfeldian privileges not to scrub the deck similarly a promisor exercises a powerright to create in the promisee a claim that the promisor will perform a certain action the promisors exercise of her powerright to promise creates in the promisee a claim that the promisor do what she promised to do or again a neighbor waives his claim that you not enter his property by inviting you into his home thus endowing you with a corresponding privilege ordering promising waiving sentencing consenting selling and abandoning are all examples of acts by which a rightholder exercises a power to change his own hohfeldian incidents or those of another powers can alter not only “firstorder” privileges and claims but “secondorder” incidents as well sumner 1987 31 an admiral for example has the powerright to relieve a captain of her powerright to command a ship powerrights to alter the authority of others are as we will see definitive of all developed legal and political systems214 immunities the fourth and final hohfeldian incident is the immunity when a has the ability to alter b s hohfeldian incidents then a has a power when a lacks the ability to alter b s hohfeldian incidents then b has an immunity b has an immunity if and only if a lacks the ability to alter b s hohfeldian incidents the united states congress lacks the ability within the constitution to impose upon american citizens a duty to kneel daily before a cross since the congress lacks a power the citizens have an immunity this immunity is a core element of an american citizens right to religious freedom similarly witnesses in court have a right not to be ordered to incriminate themselves and civil servants have a right not to be dismissed when a new government comes to power all of these rights are immunities corresponding to an absence of a power in some other party to alter the rightholders normative situation in some way215 opposites and correlatives hohfeld arranged the four incidents in tables of “opposites” and “correlatives” so as to display the logical structure of his system in order to fill out the tables he added some further terminology for instance if a person a has a claim then a lacks a “noclaim” a noclaim is the opposite of a claim and if a person a has a power then some person b has a “liability” a liability is the correlative of a power opposites if a has a claim then a lacks a noclaim… a privilege … a duty… a power … a disability… an immunity … a liability correlatives if a has a claim then some person b has a duty… a privilege … a noclaim… a power … a liability… an immunity … a disability216 molecular rights each of the “atomic” incidents—the privilege claim power and immunity—can be a right when it occurs in isolation and as mentioned above these atomic incidents also bond together in characteristic ways to form complex rights following for example is part of the “molecular” structure of the property right that you have over your computer part of the “molecular” structure of a property right in the figure the “firstorder” rights are your legal rights directly over your property—in this case your computer the privilege on this first level entitles you to use your computer the claim correlates to a duty in every other person not to use your computer the “secondorder” rights are your legal rights concerning the alteration of these firstorder rights you have several powers with respect to your claim—you may waive the claim granting others permission to touch the computer annul the claim abandoning the computer as your property or transfer the claim making the computer into someone elses property also on the second order your immunity prevents others from altering your firstorder claim over your computer your immunity that is prevents others from waiving annulling or transferring your claim over your computer the four incidents together constitute a significant portion of your property right of course all of these incidents are qualified you have no privilege to use your computer as a weapon or to use your computer to hack into someone elses machine and your immunity may not entirely block out the states power of expropriation if for example the computer becomes evidence in a criminal case these qualifications to the incidents carve the contours of your property right but they do not affect its basic shape there may also be more incidents associated with ownership than shown in the figure above wellman 1985 1995 describes each right as having a “defining core” surrounded by “associated elements” which may be present or absent in a particular case your property right for instance may also be protected by a qualified thirdorder immunity against the government altering your secondorder rights over your property for example under the “takings clause” of the fifth amendment to the us constitution the government cannot simply annul your right to sell a parcel of your land217 active and passive rights the distinction between active and passive rights lyons 1970 maps neatly onto the hohfeldian incidents the privilege and the power are “active” rights that concern their holders own actions the claim and the immunity are “passive” rights that regulate the actions of others active rights are signaled by statements of the form “ a has a right to φ” while passive rights are signaled by statements of the form “ a has a right that b φ” in both of these formulas “φ” is an active verb a naval captain has an active privilegeright to walk the decks and an active powerright to order that the ship set sail a player in a chess tournament has a passive claimright that his opponent not distract him and a professor has a passive immunityright that her university not fire her for publishing unpopular views218 negative and positive rights a distinction between negative and positive rights is popular among some normative theorists especially those with a bent toward libertarianism the holder of a negative right is entitled to noninterference while the holder of a positive right is entitled to provision of some good or service a right against assault is a classic example of a negative right while a right to welfare assistance is a prototypical positive right narveson 2001 since both negative and positive rights are passive rights some rights are neither negative nor positive privileges and powers cannot be negative rights and privileges powers and immunities cannot be positive rights the privilege right to enter a building and the power right to enter into a binding agreement are neither negative nor positive it is sometimes said that negative rights are easier to satisfy than positive rights negative rights can be respected simply by each person refraining from interfering with each other while it may be difficult or even impossible to fulfill everyones positive rights if the sum of peoples claims outstrips the resources available however when it comes to the enforcement of rights this difference disappears funding a legal system that enforces citizens negative rights against assault may require more resources than funding a welfare system that realizes citizens positive rights to assistance as holmes and sunstein 1999 43 put it in the context of citizens rights to state enforcement all rights are positive moreover the point is often made that the moral urgency of securing positive rights may be just as great as the moral urgency of securing negative rights shue 1996 whatever is the justificatory basis for ascribing rights—autonomy need or something else—there might be just as strong a moral case for fulfilling a persons right to adequate nutrition as there is for protecting that persons right not to be assaulted22 the function of rights the will theory and the interest theory221 conceptual analysis versus definitional stipulation all rights can be represented by hohfeldian diagrams like the diagram of the part of the property right “molecule” above however some diagrams of hohfeldian incidents that we could construct do not correspond to any right rights are only those collections of hohfeldian incidents that have a certain function or perhaps certain functions to take an analogy all engagement rings are rings but only rings with a certain function are engagement rings the question of the function of rights is the question of what rights do for those who hold them before discussing the two major positions on this issue we can survey some statements that theorists have made that may appear to be describing which hohfeldian incidents are rights to have a right is to have a “valid claim” feinberg 1970 257“in the strictest sense” all rights are claims hohfeld 1919 36“a right in the most important sense is the conjunction of a privilege and a claimright” mackie 1979 169“rights are permissions rather than requirements rights tell us what the bearer is at liberty to do” louden 1983 95“no one ever has a right to do something he only has a right that some one else shall do or refrain from doing something” williams 1968 125“a person who says to another ‘i have a right to do it’ is not saying that … it is not wrong to do it he is claiming that the other has a duty not to interfere” raz 1994 275“a right is an established way of acting” martin 1993 1“it is hard to think of rights except as capable of exercise ” hart 1982 185“a right is a power which a creature ought to possess” plamenatz 1938 82“all rights are essentially property rights” steiner 1994 93“rights are themselves property things we own” feinberg 1973 75at first this survey might remind one the proverb of the blind men and the elephant however we should distinguish between two different aims that a theorist might have when he make a statement of the form “all rights are x ” a theorist may be attempting to analyze the meaning of our ordinary concept of rights or he may be stipulating a definition of “rights” within her own ethical political or legal theory consider for example mills famous assertion in utilitarianism when we call anything a persons right we mean that he has a valid claim on society to protect him in the possession of it either by the force of law or by that of education and opinion… to have a right then is i conceive to have something which society ought to defend me in the possession of mill 1861 54as an analysis of the everyday concept of a right mills assertion would be weak through history many have asserted for example that god has the right to command man yet presumably no one asserting such a right would maintain that society ought to defend god in the possession of anything indeed there seems nothing incoherent in the thought that individuals have a right not to be protected by society yet this thought could not make sense on mills characterization of what rights are on mill see also hart 1982 100–04 mills statement is better seen as a stipulative definition of the term “right” mill stipulates this particular definition because the concept of “those possessive relations that are valuable enough that it is worthwhile for society to institute sanctions to protect them” is a concept that works well within his larger utilitarian theory so where mills statement departs from the common understanding of rights we should charitably read mill as prescribing instead of describing usage many authors pronouncements about rights are charitably interpreted as these kinds of exercises in stipulation rather than as attempts to analyze the ordinary concept of rights to take an example from the scholarly literature it is not uncommon to encounter a general statement that all rights are or at least include claimrights see eg raz 1986 166 173–75 steiner 1994 55 kramer steiner and simmonds 1999 9–14 again these “all rights are claims” statements are better interpreted as stipulative rather than as analyses of common usage “all rights are claims” positions cannot recognize for example the rights in the hobbesian state of nature in which each person has unlimited privilegerights of selfdefense yet no claimrights against attack neither could an “all rights are claims” theory recognize that the us constitution gives congress the sole powerright to declare war the statement that rights are claims is prescriptive for not descriptive of usage occasionally a theorist will say that she is presenting neither an analysis of the ordinary concept of a right nor merely stipulating a new meaning for the term “right” but is rather offering some third type of characterization for instance wellman 1995 136 says that his narrow specification of “a right” is needed to provide “a clearer and more revealing map of the law” raz 1986 166 frames a contrasting “philosophical definition” that he says “illuminates a tradition of political and moral discourse in which different theories offer incompatible views of what rights there are and why” whether there is room for such a third category of “philosophical definition” which goes beyond both ordinary analysis and stipulation is contested wenar 2008222 the will theory and the interest theory there are two main theories of the function of rights the will theory and the interest theory each theory presents itself as capturing an ordinary understanding of what rights do for those who hold them which theory offers the better account of the functions of rights has been the subject of spirited dispute literally for ages will theorists maintain that a right makes the rightholder “a small scale sovereign” hart 1982 183 more specifically a will theorist asserts that the function of a right is to give its holder control over anothers duty your property right diagrammed in the figure above is a right says the will theorist because it contains a power to waive or annul or transfer others duties you are the “sovereign” of your computer in that you may permit others to touch it or not at your discretion similarly a promisee is “sovereign” over the action of the promisor she has a right because she has the power to waive or annul the promisors duty to keep the promise in hohfeldian terms will theorists assert that every right includes a hohfeldian power over a claim in colloquial terms will theorists believe that all rights confer control over others duties to act in particular ways interest theorists disagree interest theorists maintain that the function of a right is to further the rightholders interests an owner has a right according to the interest theorist not because owners have choices but because the ownership makes owners better off a promisee has a right because promisees have some interest in the performance of the promise or alternatively some interest in being able to form voluntary bonds with others your rights the interest theorist says are the hohfeldian incidents you have that are good for you the contest between willbased and interestbased theories of the function of rights has been waged for hundreds of years influential will theorists include kant savigny hart kelsen wellman and steiner important interest theorists include bentham ihering austin lyons mac cormick raz and kramer each theory has stronger and weaker points as an account of what rights do for rightholders the will theory captures the powerful link between rights and normative control to have a right is to have the ability to determine what others may and may not do and so to exercise authority over a certain domain of affairs the resonant connection between rights and authority the authority to control what others may do is for will theorists a matter of definition however the will theorys account of the function of rights is unable to explain many rights that most think there are within the will theory there can be no such thing as an unwaivable right a right over which its holder has no power yet intuitively it would appear that unwaivable rights are some of the most important rights that we have consider for example the unwaivable right not to be enslaved mac cormick 1977 197 moreover since the will theorist holds that all rights confer sovereignty she cannot acknowledge any rights in beings incapable of exercising sovereignty within the will theory it is impossible for incompetents like infants animals and comatose adults to have rights yet we ordinarily would not doubt that these incompetents can have rights for example the right not to be tortured mac cormick 1982 154–66 will theories also have difficulties explaining bare privilegerights such as in the hobbesian state of nature which are not rights of authority over others the interest theory is more capacious than the will theory it can accept as rights both unwaivable rights the possession of which may be good for their holders and the rights of incompetents who have interests that rights can protect the interest theory also taps into the deeply plausible connection between holding rights and being better off however the interest theory is also misaligned with any ordinary understanding of rights we commonly accept that people can have interests in x without having a right to x and contrariwise that people can have a right to x without having interests sufficient to explain this in the first category are “third party beneficiaries” lyons 1994 36–46 you may have a powerful interest in the lottery paying out for your spouses winning ticket but you have no right that the lottery pays out to your spouse in the second category are many of the rights of officeholders and rolebearers jones 1994 31–32 wenar 2013b whatever interest a judge may have in exercising her legal right to sentence a convict to life in prison the judges interests cannot possibly justify ascribing to her the power to make such a dramatic change in the convicts normative situation the difficulties of the interest theory have often been noted in razs version which is perhaps the most prominent in razs account “x has a right if x can have rights and other things being equal an aspect of xs wellbeing his interest is a sufficient reason for holding some other person s to be under a duty” raz 1986 166 yet there appear to be many rights for which the interests of the putative rightholder are not sufficient to hold other person s to be under a duty for example raz himself allows that the interest of a journalist in protecting his sources is not itself sufficient reason to hold others to be under the corresponding duty raz 1986 179 247–8 it is rather the interests of the general public in an active and independent media that grounds the journalists right to protect his sources yet as kamm observes “if the satisfaction of the interests of others is the reason why the journalist gets a right to have his interest protected his interest is not sufficient to give rise to the duty of noninterference with his speech” kamm 2002 485 nor does this difficulty only affect the rights of officeholders like journalists raz admits that weighty rights such as the rights of free expression and freedom of contract are not justified solely by the interests of the individual citizens who hold them raz 1996a 30–43 131 or again parents may have the right to receive child benefit payments from the state but here only the interests of the children and not the interests of the parents could be sufficient to hold the state to be under a duty razs version of the interest theory continues to be the most widelycited account of the function of rights despite such concerns that are now commonplace in the specialist literature kramers version of the interest theory which specifies necessary conditions for holding a legal right is the major contemporary alternative kramer 2013 246 n 4 will theorists and interest theorists have developed their positions with increasing technical sophistication the issues that divide the two camps are clearly defined and the debates between them are often intense kramer simmonds and steiner 1998 van duffel 2012a kramer 2013 the seemingly interminable debate between these two major theories has driven some to conclude that the debate itself rests on the mistaken premise that there is a single concept of a right for which these theories provide rival analyses van duffel 2012b hayward 2013 the deadlock has encouraged other theorists to develop alternative positions on the function of rights“demand” theories fill out the idea that as feinberg 1973 58–59 puts it “a right is something a man can stand on something that can be demanded or insisted upon without embarrassment or shame” for darwall 2006 18 to have a claimright “includes a secondpersonal authority to resist complain remonstrate and perhaps use coercive measures of other kinds including perhaps to gain compensation if the right is violated” on skorupskis account 2010 xii6 xiv2–3 rights specify what the rightholder may demand of others where “demand” implies the permissibility of compelling performance or exacting compensation for nonperformance like the will theory these demand theories center on the agency of the rightholder they do not turn on the rightholders power over the duty of another so they do not share the will theorys difficulty with unwaivable rights they may however have more difficulties in explaining powerrights demand theories also share the willtheorys challenges in explaining the rights of incompetents and in explaining privilegerights other recent analyses of what rights do for rightholders are varied scanlon 2003 2013 defends the position that rights are constraints on the discretion of individuals or institutions to act sreenivasan 2005 2010 puts forward a “hybrid” analysis of the claimright that grafts the interest theory onto the will theory here the function of the claimright is to endow the rightholder with the amount of control over anothers duty that advances her interests wenar 2005 abandons the idea that all rights have any single function and sets out a “several functions” on which rights perform six distinct functions scanlons analysis is criticized in gilbert 2004 wenar 2013a sreenivasans and wenars analyses are critiqued in kramer and steiner 2007 may 2012 recently theorists have attempted to make progress on the question of functionality by scrutinizing the claimright in particular and by shifting attention onto the corresponding duty as above on the standard account what is distinctive about the claimright is that a dutybearers duty is “directed at” or “owed to” the rightholder the promisor for example owes a duty of performance to the promisee  yet what could account for the directionality of such “directed duties” may 2015 after all not all duties are directed to specific others duties of charity or benevolence are not and “directed duties” appear to have special normative significance the violation of any duty may be wrong it may be wrong not to give to charity but the violation of a directed duty is a wronging of the being to whom the duty is owed it wrongs that being and unlike a mere wrong the wronging of some being calls ceteris paribus for apology and compensation cruft 2013 further argues that the violation of any duty owed to a being is disrespectful of that being the question is what could possibly account for the extra significance of the duties that have direction hedahl 2013 presents a hybrid “priority” explanation of directionality in which a duty is directed to some entity just in case that entitys prioritization controls the normative strength of the duty for instance in a case of conflicting duties both duties are directed to a iff a s authorization or failing that a s interests determine which duty should be performed wenar 2013b sets out a “kind desire” theory in which the directions of duties are explained by what rolebearers like journalists and parents want as such and more generally by what beings like humans want qua the kinds of beings that they are3 the history of the language of rights intellectual historians have tangled over the origins of rights these debates are sometimes framed in terms of when “the concept of a right” emerged yet insofar as it is really the emergence of the concept of a right that is at issue the answer lies beyond the competence of the intellectual historian and within the domain of the anthropologist even the most primitive social order must include rules specifying that certain individuals or groups have special permission to perform certain actions moreover even the most rudimentary human communities must have rules specifying that some are entitled to tell others what they must do such rules ascribe rights the genesis of the concept of a right was simultaneous with reflective awareness of such social norms the more productive characterization of the debate within intellectual history concerns when a word or phrase appeared that has a meaning close to the meaning of our modern word this debate turns on when in history the premodern “objective” sense of “right” came also to bear our modern “subjective” sense of “a right”“right” in its older objective sense means “what is just” or “what is fair” finnis 1980 206 aristotle uses dikaion for example to indicate that a society is “rightly ordered” that it displays the correct structure of human relationships “right” in this objective sense can also be attributed to individuals the roman jurist ulpian for instance held that justice means rendering each his right  ius  in this sense a persons “right” is what is due to him given his role or status this objective sense of “right” is not the same as our modern idea of “a right” for instance ulpian noted that the ius of a parricide was to be sewn into a sack of snakes and tossed into the tiber tierney 1997 16 the scholarly inquiry into when our modern subjective sense of “a right” became established as a meaning of some word or phrase has proved long and divisive the ancient authors often used words imprecisely and smeared their meanings across and beyond the hohfeldian categories the intellectual historians themselves have occasionally congested the discussion by taking different features of rights as definitive of the modern concept moreover the scholarly debate has sometimes accepted overoptimistic assumptions about the sharpness of conceptual boundaries nevertheless two broad trends in the scholarly discussions are clear the first is to push the origins of a term indicating a modern subjective sense of “a right” back further into history from locke to hobbes to grotius in the seventeenth century then to gerson in the fifteenth century ockham in the fourteenth perhaps even to gratian in the twelfth brett 1997 tierney 1997 donohue 2010 now argues that ius is used in a subjective sense throughout the works of the classical roman jurists in the first century bce to the third century ce the second and related trend has been to establish that terms referring to active rights what we would call privilegerights and powerrights predate terms referring to passive rights what we would call claimrights and immunityrights it appears that the earliest medieval debates using recognizably modern rightslanguage for instance concerned topics such as whether the pope has a power right to rule an earthly empire and whether the poor have a privilege right to take what they need from the surplus of the rich4 rights and freedom most rights entitle their holders to freedom in some sense indeed holding a right can entail that one is free in one or more of a variety of senses in the most general terms the active incidents—the privilege and the power—entitle their holders to freedom to act in certain ways the passive incidents—the claim and the immunity—often entitle their holders to freedom from undesirable actions or states we can be more specific a privilegeright makes it holder “free to” in the sense of nonforbiddenness a government employee with a security clearance for instance has a privilegeright that makes him free to read classified documents one can be free in this nonforbidden way without having the physical ability to do what one is free to do you may be free to join the march even when both your knees are sprained the actions you are free to do in this sense may or may not be possible for you but at least they are not disallowed someone who has a pair of privilege rights—no duty to perform the action no duty not to perform the action—is free in an additional sense of having discretion over whether to perform the action or not you you may be free to join the march or not as you like this dual nonforbiddenness again does not imply physical ability a rightholder may be permitted to perform or not perform some action but this still does not mean that she is capable of performing the action that she is free to perform in contrast the holder of a powerright does have an ability this is the normative ability to exercise authority in a certain way sumner 1987 28 this normative ability confers freedom in a different sense a judge is free to sentence a convicted criminal to prison the judge is not merely allowed to sentence the prisoner her powerright gives her the ability—that is the authority—to do so her power right makes her free to sentence in a way that nonjudges are not free to sentence as for the passive rights many claimrights entitle their holders to be free from the physical interference or surveillance of others other claimrights entitle their holders to be free from undesirable conditions like hunger or fear immunityrights parallel claimrights one level up immunityrights make their holders free from the authority of others and so entitle their holders to be free from conditions like tyranny or exploitation a legal system can be seen as a distribution of all of these varieties of freedom any legal system will set out rules specifying who is free to act in which ways and who should be free from unwanted actions and conditions a developed legal system will also determine who has the authority and so who is free to interpret and enforce these rules more generally any political constitution can be seen as a multileveled structure of rights that distributes authority over rules of conduct in a distinctive way a democratic constitution for example may give voters the power to elect legislators who have certain powers to enact laws which the judiciary has certain powers to interpret and the police have certain powers to enforce leaving certain courses of conduct open as legal for citizens to pursue the facts about who should be free to do what within any legal or political system as well as the facts about who should be free from which actions and conditions can be represented as a complex layered structure of rights—exponentially more complex than in the diagram of the property right above5 rights and reasons51 rights as trumps though there are disputes over the function of rights and the history of rights language most agree that rights have special normative force the reasons that rights provide are particularly powerful or weighty reasons which override reasons of other sorts dworkins metaphor is of rights as “trumps” dworkin 1984 rights permit their holders to act in certain ways or give reasons to treat their holders in certain ways or permit their holders to act in certain ways even if some social aim would be served by doing otherwise as mill wrote of the trumping power of the right to free expression “if all mankind minus one were of one opinion mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person than he if he had the power would be in silencing mankind” mill 1859 20 how rights become imbued with this special normative force is a matter of ongoing scholarly inquiry as sreenivasan 2010 notes a hohfeldian claimright in itself only entails the existence of a duty with a certain structure and not a duty with a certain force a has a claim against b if and only if b has a duty to a in this definition it is the “direction” of b s duty that it is owed to a which correlates b s duty to a s right nothing is said in the definition about the dutys strength why “directed duties”—as above those owed to an entity—have greater normative priority remains an open question the only broad consensus is that they do see thompson 2004 on “bipolar” judgments dworkins metaphor suggests that rights trump nonright objectives such as increasing national wealth what of the priority of one right with respect to another we can keep to the trumps metaphor while recognizing that some rights have a higher priority than others within the trump suit a jack still beats a seven or a three your right of way at a flashing yellow light has priority over the right of way of the driver facing a flashing red and the right of way of an ambulance with sirens on trumps you both this metaphor of trumps leads naturally to the question of whether there is any right that has priority to absolutely all other normative considerations whether there is an “ace of rights” gewirth 1981 asserts that there is at least one such absolute right the right of all persons not to be made the victim of a homicidal project for such a right to be absolute it would have to trump every other consideration whatsoever other rights economic efficiency saving lives everything not all would agree with gewirth that even this very powerful right overrides every conceivable normative concern some would think it might be justifiable to infringe even this right were this somehow necessary for example to prevent the deaths of a great many people if it is permissible to kill one in order to save a billion then not even gewirths right is absolute52 conflicts of rights most theorists would agree that a s claimright gives b what raz 1975 35–48 calls an exclusionary reason a secondorder reason not to act on some firstorder reason dworkins trumping metaphor makes it tempting to characterize the normative force of rights in the stronger terms of conclusive reasons we could indeed attempt to define the hohfeldian incidents in these terms a s having a claimright that b φ would imply that b has a conclusive reason to φ and a s having a privilegeright to φ would imply that a has no conclusive reason not to φ powers and immunities would then determine the ways in which agents were and were not able to alter the patterns of conclusive reasons in the world were we to go this route we would need to temper the “conclusiveness” of the conclusive reasons implied by rights assertions to accommodate the facts that some rights have priority to others and that few if any rights outweigh absolutely all nonright considerations in all circumstances if we associate rights with conclusive reasons then for at least most rights these reasons can only be conclusive with respect to some but not all competing considerations this line of thought can be developed by saying that the reasons associated with rights are conclusive within the area covered by the right but are not conclusive outside of that area each right trumps competing considerations in most circumstances but there are certain circumstances in which another right with higher priority—or a pressing nonright consideration—determines what may or should be done from this perspective the conclusive reasons implied by rights assertions really are conclusive but only within certain circumstances every right is absolute within a precisely delimited space contrast this position with gewirths defense of a single unqualified absolute right the theoretical position at the end of this line of thought is called “specificationism” shaferlandau 1995 oberdiek 2008 the specificationist holds that each right is defined by an elaborate set of qualifications that specify when it does and when it does not apply a set of qualifications that define the rights “space”the test of specificationism is how convincingly it can explain what occurs when rights appear to conflict rights do often appear to conflict sinnottarmstrong 1996 kamm 2007 262301 for example on a certain day it may seem that the publics right to protest is conflicting with the governments right to keep order on public property when confronted with a case like this one we will judge that one or the other say the publics right should prevail however we do not believe that one of these rights is always stronger than the other given different circumstances our judgment might favor the other in this case the governments right when rights appear to conflict like this the usefulness of the image of rights as trumps begins to dim both of these rights are trump cards yet it does not appear that one right always trumps the other a specificationist will attempt to dispel any appearance of conflict of rights for example a specificationist will say that what is colloquially referred to as “the publics right to protest” is actually on closer examination “the publics right to protest unless the protest would cause serious risk to life or property or would lead to the spread of a deadly disease or…” similarly the governments right should really be specified more fully as the right “to control what happens on public property but not to the extent of stopping peaceful protest unless the protest would lead to the spread of deadly disease but not…” on the specificationist view rights never do conflict in the sense of overlapping in a given case rather rights fit together like pieces in a jigsaw puzzle so that in each circumstance there is only one right which determines what is permitted forbidden or required every right is absolute within its own area but the area in which each right prevails is elaborately gerrymandered rights never conflict they are always to use steiners phrase “compossible” steiner 1994 feinberg 1980 221–51 and thomson 1990 82–104 object to this specificationist view of rights first fully specified rights would be unknowable no one could set out all of the qualifications that define even the simplest right second rights so understood lose their explanatory force for the specificationist rights can only be the conclusions not the premises of arguments concerning which side in any dispute should prevail third specificationists cannot explain the “moral residue” of a “defeated” right for instance consider a case in which your property right in the pie cooling on your window sill conflicts with johns right to do what he must do to keep from starving johns right may prevail in this case john may have a right to eat your pie still after john rightfully eats your pie he should apologize to you and compensate you if he can thomson alleges that specificationists cannot explain the requirements that john apologizes to and compensates you since on the specificationist view there is no right of yours that he has violated when he consumes your food thomson prefers the view that there really are conflicts of rights and suggests that we should speak of a “defeated” right as being permissibly “infringed” instead of “violated” leaving residual obligations on the infringer frederick 2014 chases down some specificationist replies to these objections and concludes that although moral rights are strong moral considerations they are only pro tanto53 support among rights philosophers have discussed not only how rights can conflict but how they sometimes support one another for example henry shue has argued that both rights of security and rights of subsistence are “basic rights” because they are indispensable for the full enjoyment of all other rights—while other rights are nonbasic because they are not indispensable for the enjoyment of these two if the enjoyment or realization of a controversial right is an important precondition for the enjoyment of an uncontroversial right one can defend the controversial right by documenting its strong supporting role such a “linkage argument” is used by shue to defend the right to subsistence as a basic right and by sen to defend rights to democracy and freedom of the press as supportive of the right to adequate nutrition in developing countries shue 1996 sen 1999 shues and sens assertions have been criticized as exaggerated nickel 2008 myhvoldhanssen 2003 in the other internet resources nickel 2008 2010 develops a typology of supporting relations between rights see also gilabert 2010 one right strongly supports another when it is logically or practically inconsistent to endorse the implementation of second right without endorsing the simultaneous implementation of the first for example the right to bodily security strongly supports the right to freedom of assembly one right weakly supports another when it is useful but not essential to it the right to education for example weakly supports the right to a fair trial nickel argues that the strength of supporting relations between rights varies with quality of implementation poorly implemented rights provide little support to other rights while ones that are more effectively implemented tend to provide greater support to other rights the right to due process supports the right to equal treatment for members of different racial and ethnic groups—but the support will be soft if the right to due process is only weakly implemented rights that weakly support each other are interdependent rights that strongly support each other are indivisible beginning with the 1968 proclamation of teheran the united nations has promoted the idea that “since human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible the full realization of civil and political rights without the enjoyment of economic social and cultural rights is impossible” see whelan 2010 nickel holds that this indivisibility thesis exaggerates the density and strength of supporting relations among human rights he allows however that many supporting relations exist between rights—particularly under highquality implementation—and endorses the use of linkage arguments when indispensability can be shown54 rights to do wrong are there rights to do wrong many have thought so waldron 1993 63 gives the example of antiwar protesters organizing a rowdy demonstration near a remembrance day service wellman 1997 33 offers the illustration of edging into a checkout line with a full cart just ahead of a tired woman carrying triplets the puzzle is how the positive normative force of “a right” can exist so close to an opposed negative normative pole “wrong” in hohfeldian terms how can there be a right no duty not to do what it is wrong duty not to do similar questions arise about “the abuse of rights” schauer 1984 there are two main readings of rights to do wrong the first reading characterizes most rights as furthering the holders autonomy rights entitle their holders to make choices and as waldron 1993 says the importance of a persons having choices would be diminished if she were forced to do the right thing even though the person has no privilege right to perform an action that is wrong it would nevertheless violate an important claim right of hers for others to compel her not to do that thing to take the speech example we respect the autonomy of speakers when we allow them to speak unmolested—even when they do wrong by expressing themselves in disrespectful ways for a defense of this reading against objections from galston and george see herstein 2012 on the existence and value of legal rights to do legal wrongs see herstein 2013 the second reading of rights to do wrong sees them as involving a midsentence shift in domains of reasons there is no mystery after all in having a legal right to do something morally wrong the potential for a legal right to do a moral wrong arises from the fact that the domains of legal and moral reasons are not perfectly overlapped one has a legal privilege to edge in front of the tired mother in the checkout line but this is something that one has a moral duty not to do similarly one might have a moral privilege to do what one has no customary privilege to do a moral right to do a customary wrong and so on each domain of reasons is distinct and however conclusive are the reasons that any particular rightsassertion implies these are only reasons within a single domain of reasons moral or legal or customary55 rights to believe feel and want moral rights legal rights and customary rights all define domains of rights within the realm of rights of conduct rights concerning how agents should act when our reasons within these three different domains conflict we may have reasons of different kinds to act in different ways yet there are also rights entirely beyond the realm of conduct these are rights to believe to feel and to want for example the prime minister asserts that he had a right to believe what his advisors told him the artist says she has a right to feel angry at her critics the frustrated suburbanite complains he has a right to want more out of life the realm of rights of rights to believe to feel and to want are the realms of epistemic of affective and of conative rights together with the realm of rights of conduct these are the four realms of rights each of these four realms of rights defines a separate conceptual space there are no epistemic rights to act and no affective rights to believe what is distinctive about the three realms of rights beyond the rights of conduct is that they seem only to contain only privilegerights wenar 2003 one may for example have a privilegeright to believe what ones eyes tell one and a privilegeright to feel proud of what one has done it is interesting to consider why these epistemic affective and conative realms contain no claims powers or immunities philosophers have long been interested in epistemic rights in particular though there is also skepticism about this category as in glick 2010 william james for instance calls the will to believe “an essay in justification of faith a defense of our right to adopt a believing attitude in religious matters in spite of the fact that our merely logical intellect may not have been coerced” jamess “radical” conclusion in the essay is that “we have the right to believe at our own risk any hypothesis that is live enough to tempt our will” james 1897 2 29 similarly the deepest questions in kants philosophy are framed in terms of rights in the critique of pure reason the transcendental deduction of the categories aims to prove the validity of the employment of the concepts of pure understanding in the critique of practical reason the deduction of freedom aims to demonstrate our entitlement to regard ourselves as free in both deductions the central question is a quaestio iuris  “by what right” kants questions are by what right do we employ the categories and by what right do we think of ourselves as free6 three approaches to the justification of rights there are two leading philosophical approaches to explaining which fundamental rights of conduct there are and why these rights should be respected these two approaches are broadly identifiable as deontological and consequentialist status theories hold that human beings have attributes that make it fitting to ascribe certain rights to them and make respect for these rights appropriate instrumental theories hold that respect for particular rights is a means for bringing about some optimal distribution of advantages each approach has characteristic strengths and weaknesses the longrunning contest between them is ongoing quinn 1993 170 sketches a modern status theory this way a person is constituted by his body and his mind they are parts or aspects of him for that very reason it is fitting that he have primary say over what may be done to them—not because such an arrangement best promotes overall human welfare but because any arrangement that denied him that say would be a grave indignity in giving him this authority morality recognizes his existence as an individual with ends of his own—an independent being  since that is what he is he deserves this recognition quinn claims that there is some attribute of the person—here being “an individual with ends of his own”—that merits recognition from others the recognition that is due to each individual can be accorded to that individual by respecting his fundamental rights quinn contrasts his status approach to rights with one that ascribes rights “because such an arrangement best promotes overall human welfare” his target is consequentialist theories of rights the paradigm of which are utilitarian theories we met such a utilitarian theory of rights above in john stuart mills conceptualization of rights as “something which society ought to defend me in the possession of” mill believed that society ought to defend the individual in possession of her rights because doing so would bring about the greatest utility summed across the members of that society for mill as for other instrumental theorists rights are a tool for producing an optimal distribution of interests across some group the two approaches differ sharply over the role of consequences in the justification of ascribing rights status theorists hold that rights should be respected because it is fitting to do so and not because of the good consequences that will flow from so doing by contrast within an instrumental theory good consequences are the justification for promulgating and enforcing rights as quinn 1993 173 says about the status approach it is not that we think it fitting to ascribe rights because we think it is a good thing that rights be respected rather we think respect for rights a good thing precisely because we think people actually have them—and… that they have them because it is fitting that they should within a status approach rights are not means for the promotion of good consequences they are rather in nozicks phrase side constraints on the pursuit of good consequences nozick 1974 29 a status approach frowns on any rights violation even for the sake of maximizing the nonviolation of rights overall as in a “utilitarianism of rights” such an approach emphasizes the “agentrelative” reasons that each person has to avoid violating the rights of others a statusbased justification thus begins with the nature of the rightholder and arrives immediately at the right the instrumental approach starts with the desired consequences like maximum utility and works backward to see which rightsascriptions will produce those consequences61 statusbased rights status theories belong to the tradition of natural rights theories all natural rights theories fix upon features that humans have by their nature and which make respect for certain rights appropriate the theories differ over precisely which attributes of humans give rise to rights although nonreligious theories tend to fix upon the same sorts of attributes described in more or less metaphysical or moralized terms free will rationality autonomy or the ability to regulate ones life in accordance with ones chosen conception of the good life natural rights theorists agree that human reason can grasp the fact that it is appropriate to treat beings with such attributes in certain ways although they disagree on whether such facts are selfevident natural rights theory reached its high point in the early modern era in the work of grotius hobbes pufendorf and especially locke locke argued that men have rights to “life liberty and estate” in a prepolitical state of nature and that these natural rights put limits on the legitimate authority of the state lockes influence can be seen in the revolutionary american and french political documents of the eighteenth century and especially in jeffersons declaration of independence 1776 “we hold these truths to be selfevident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness”the revival of status theory within contemporary philosophy began with nozicks anarchy state and utopia 1974 while nozick does acknowledge a debt to lockes theory of property his work belongs within the kantian tradition of natural rights theorizing nozick centers his explanation of the moral force of individual rights on the kantian imperative against treating humanity merely as a means to an end each persons rights impose sideconstraints on others pursuit of their goals nozick says because each person possesses an inviolability that all others must respect “individuals have rights” he wrote “and there are things no person or group may do to them without violating their rights” nozick 1974 ix many find this approach of grounding of rights in individual dignity appealing there is a directness and clarity to status explanations of fundamental rights for example kamm 2007 247 explains the right of free expression as follows the right to speak may simply be the only appropriate way to treat people with minds of their own and the capacity to use means to express it not recognizing a persons option of speaking is to fail to respect him to say that any given person is not entitled to the strong right to free speech is a way of saying that certain crucial features of human nature are not sufficient to generate the right in anyone and this seems to be a mistake moreover statusbased rights are attractively robust while the justifications of instrumental rights are always contingent on calculations concerning consequences statusbased rights are anchored firmly in individual dignity this makes it easy to explain why statusbased rights are strong almost unqualified rights and this is a position which many believe properly expresses the great value of each person however the strength of statusbased rights can also be seen as a weakness of the theory one does not wish to be carried from the great importance of each individual to the implausible position that all fundamental rights are absolute as nagel 2002 36 allows while defending a status view “there are evils great enough so that one would be justified in murdering or torturing an innocent person to prevent them” consequences if bad enough do justify the qualification of individual rights which leaves the status theorist needing to explain how a theory which rejects consequences so resolutely at the outset can concede their importance later on moreover the simplicity of the status approach to rights can also appear to be a liability on close examination the fundamental rights that most people believe in are intricately “shaped” for example consider the widelyaccepted right to free expression this right includes the right to make damning personal attacks on others yet the right is much more permissive about attacking public figures than it is about assailing private citizens how could a status approach explain this distinction between public figures and private citizens or again the right to free speech sometimes contains a right to say what the speaker knows to be untrue yet we tend to be more tolerant of deceitful speech in political campaigns than we are of deceitful speech in advertising or in the courtroom it is an open question whether status theory has the conceptual resources to explain why individual rights should be shaped in these specific ways status theory also faces the challenge of vindicating its foundations and its scope why after all is it “fitting” to ascribe individuals rights the kantian value of inviolability can look puzzling when presented independently of a metaphysical grounding as nagel 2002 34 admits “it has proven extremely difficult to account for such a basic individualized value such that it becomes morally intelligible” this is a quiet echo of benthams protest that the doctrine of natural rights “is from beginning to end so much flat assertion it lays down as a fundamental and inviolable principle whatever is in dispute” bentham 1796 66 cruft 2010 451 has attempted to deepen the theory of the noninstrumental value of basic rights by showing that such rights are constitutive of “relationships that bind all humans together in fellowship as members of a sharedprotocommunity”even so status theorists must also resolve an internal debate over exactly which rights should be thought to express an individuals inviolability nozick holds that statusbased rights include rights to whatever property one has acquired while other status theorists reject the “right libertarian”to which nozicks position leads the resolution of this debate has become more urgent as a group of neokantian and neolockean “left libertarian” theorists have advanced the view that the status of individuals requires that each be accorded strong rights to selfownership and also initially equal shares of “worldownership” vallentyne and steiner 2000 otsuka 200362 instrumental rights instrumental theories describe rights as instruments for achieving an optimal distribution of advantages the archetypal instrumental theory is some form of twolevel consequentialism such as rule utilitarianism within such a theory rights are parts of rules the general observance of which will lead to an optimal distribution of advantages in rule utilitarianism the optimal distribution is the one that contains the greatest aggregate utility the most common objection to grounding rights in such a theory is that the resulting rights will be too flimsy if rights are justified only insofar as they generate good consequences it may seem that the theory will need to prune its rights perhaps severely whenever maximum utility lies elsewhere why should it not be a rule in a twolevel system for example that one should frame an innocent man if this would prevent a major riot why should it not be a rule that one should “violate” the right of an innocent not to be killed if this would prevent the killings of two innocents elsewhere while statusbased rights can appear to be too strong instrumental rights can appear to be too weak see pettit 1988 for a counterargument weak rights are a problem for utilitarianism because its focus on maximization makes it indifferent to certain facts about how utility is distributed across individuals however utilitarianism is not the only kind of instrumental theory for example a pure egalitarian theory will portray rights as instruments for achieving a more equal distribution of advantages a prioritarian theory will define an optimal distribution in a manner similar to egalitarianism except that it will give extra weight to the interests of those worse off other instrumental theories characterize “optimal distribution” in other ways sumner 1987 171 instrumental theories that do not define an optimal distribution in terms of maximization may face less pressure than utilitarianism does from concerns about weak rights scanlon 1977instrumental theories differ over how they define what counts as an optimal distribution maximization equality etc they also differ in how they measure individual advantage for instance a utilitarians metric is utility sen works with a metric of capabilities dworkin with resources and so on whatever metric they use all instrumental theorists will have to address longstanding questions about the commensurability and interpersonal comparison of interests since instrumental theorists work with overall evaluations of how well off individuals would be were certain rights ascribed they must explain how distinct categories of interests eg health income opportunities for selfexpression social recognition trade off against one another they must also explain why they believe that these interests are similar enough across persons that it makes sense to use the same scales of measurement for different persons griffin 1989status theories are subject to the objection that they lack the conceptual resources to explain why the rights we believe in are intricately “shaped” to accommodate the particularities of different contexts and different rightholders instrumental theories are vulnerable to the mirrorimage objection an instrumental theorist can appeal to any number of distinct interests which are at stake for any number of differentlysituated individuals to explain why a certain right should be held only by certain persons or only in certain circumstances the danger for such a theorist is that the wealth of normative resources at her command will permit the ascription of whatever rights she favors the theorist begins with the rights that she wants to justify then gives a “just so” story in terms of an optimal distribution of interests that leads to exactly those rights tushnet 1984 frey 1985 moreover all instrumental justifications rely on empirical predictions concerning which ascriptions of rights would produce which consequences and there will typically be enough slack in these empirical predictions for instrumental theorists to fudge their derivations in order to reach the desired rights both status theories and instrumental theories of rights have held a perennial attraction because of this many have been tempted to search for a hybrid approach that would combine what is plausible in each eg sen 198263 contractual and justificatory rights a third approach to the justification of rights might be called “contractual” here rights are characterized neither as naturally fitting for independent beings nor as tools to promote the best state of affairs rather rights define principles that would be chosen by properly situated and motivated agents agreeing to the basic terms of their relations eg principles chosen in rawlss original position or principles within scanlons contractualism that no one could reasonably reject the fact that these principles would be agreed to under the specified conditions is their justification the rights that define fundamental principles within these theories are phrased in terms of what the theories agents have strong reason to want so for example rawls states that the role of a citizens right of personal property “is to allow a sufficient material basis for a sense of personal independence and selfrespect both of which are essential for the development and exercise of the two moral powers” rawls 1993 298 and scanlon says that reasonable individuals “have reason to insist  on basic rights which give them important forms of protection and control over their own lives” scanlon 2003 4 forst 2012 2014 combines critical and contractualist theory into a sophisticated account of rights beginning with a statusbased fundamental right to justification he shows how suitably idealized demands for justification from individuals subordinated within real relations of power can ground specific rights to relief from and redress for actual injustices forsts framework shows the enduring theoretical appeal and practical potential of the kantian tradition of understanding rights7 critiques of rights critiques of rights come in two forms the first is an attack on the substance of doctrines that give rights a central place these critiques allege that the content of such doctrines is in one way or other malformed or unjustified here we find for example the criticism that natural rights doctrines are “so much flat assertion” and that utilitarian rights tend to be implausibly weak the second form of critique attacks the language of rights itself the objection here is that it is inappropriate or counterproductive to express at least some kinds of normative concerns in terms of rights we should according to the second form of critique reduce or avoid “rights talk”71 critiques of rights doctrine marx attacked the substance of the revolutionary eighteenth century american and french political documents that proclaimed the fundamental “rights of man” liberty equality security property and the free exercise of religion marx objected that these alleged rights derive from a false conception of the human individual as unrelated to others as having interests can be defined without reference to others and as always potentially in conflict with others the rightsbearing individual is an “isolated monad… withdrawn behind his private interests and whims and separated from the community” marx 1844 146the right of property marx asserted exemplifies the isolating and antisocial character of these alleged rights of man on the one hand the right of property is the right to keep others at a distance the legal equivalent of a barbed wire fence on the other hand the right of property allows an owner to transfer his resources at his own pleasure and for his own gain without regard even for the desperate need for those resources elsewhere similarly marx held that the muchcelebrated individual right to liberty reinforces selfishness those who are ascribed the right to do what they wish so long as they do not hurt others will perpetuate a culture of egoistic obsession as for equality the achievement of equal rights in a liberal state merely distracts people from noticing that their equality is purely formal a society with formally equal rights will continue to be divided by huge inequalities in economic and political power finally these socalled “natural” rights are in fact not natural to humans at all they are simply the defining elements of the rules of the modern mode of production perfectly suited to fit each individual into the capitalist machine communitarians taylor walzer mac intyre sandel sound several of the same themes in their criticisms of contemporary liberal and libertarian theories the communitarians object that humans are not as such theories assume “antecedently individuated” nozicks “state of nature” theorizing for example errs in presuming that individuals outside of a stable stategoverned social order will develop the autonomous capacities that make them deserving of rights nor should we attempt as in rawlss original position to base an argument for rights on what individuals would choose in abstraction from their particular identities and community attachments there is no way to establish a substantive political theory on what all rational agents want in the abstract rather theorists should look at the particular social contexts in which real people live their lives and to the meanings that specific goods carry within different cultures this communitarian critique continues by accusing liberal and libertarian theories of being falsely universalistic in insisting that all societies should bend themselves to fit within a standardsized grid of rights insofar as we should admit rights into our understanding of the world at all communitarians say we should see them as part of ongoing practices of social selfinterpretation and negotiation— and so as rules that can vary significantly between cultures these kinds of criticisms have been discussed in detail eg gutmann 1985 waldron 1987b mulhall and swift 1992 their validity turns on weighty issues in moral and political theory what can be said here is that a common theme in most of these criticisms—that prominent rights doctrines are in some way excessively individualistic or “atomistic”—need not cut against any theory merely because it uses the language of rights ignatieff 2003 67 errs for example when he charges that “rights language cannot be parsed or translated into a nonindividualistic communitarian framework it presumes moral individualism and is nonsensical outside that assumption”as we saw above the language of rights is able to accommodate rightholders who are individuals as such but also individuals considered as members of groups as well as groups themselves states peoples and so on indeed the nonindividualistic potential of rightslanguage is more than a formal possibility the doctrine of international human rights—the modern cousin of eighteenth century natural rights theory—ascribes several significant rights to groups the international convention against genocide for example forbids actions intending to destroy any national ethnic racial or religious group and both of the human rights covenants ascribe to peoples the right to selfdetermination such examples show that the language of rights is not individualistic in its essence72 critiques of the language of rights the language of rights can resist the charge that it is necessarily complicit with individualism however critics have accused rights talk of impeding social progress our rights talk in its absoluteness promotes unrealistic expectations heightens social conflict and inhibits dialogue that might lead toward consensus accommodation or at least the discovery of common ground in its silence concerning responsibilities it seems to condone acceptance of the benefits of living in a democratic social welfare state without accepting the corresponding personal and civic obligations… in its insularity it shuts out potentially important aids to the process of selfcorrecting learning all of these traits promote mere assertion over reasongiving glendon 1991 14 here draws out some of the detrimental practical consequences of the popular connection between rights and conclusive reasons that we saw above since rights assertions suggest conclusive reasons people can be tempted to assert rights when they want to end a discussion instead of continuing it one plays a right as a trump card when one has run out of arguments similarly the ready availability of rights language may lead parties initially at odds with each other toward confrontation instead of negotiation as each side escalates an armsrace of rights assertions that can only be resolved by a superior authority like a court one line of feminist theory has picked up on this line of criticism identifying the peremptory and rigidifying discourse of rights with the confrontational masculine “voice” gilligan 1993it is not inevitable that these unfortunate tendencies will afflict those who make use of the language of rights as we have seen it may be plausible to hold that each right is “absolute” only within an elaborately gerrymandered area and it may be possible to produce deep theories to justify why one has the rights that one asserts however it is plausible that the actual use of rights talk does have the propensities that glendon suggests it seems no accident that america “the land of rights” is also the land of litigation another deleterious consequence of rights talk that glendon picks out is its tendency to move the moral focus toward persons as rightholders instead of toward persons as bearers of responsibilities this critique is developed by oneill 1996 127–53 2002 27–34 a focus on rightholders steers moral reasoning toward the perspective of recipience instead of toward the traditional active ethical questions of what one ought to do and how one ought to live rights talk also leads those who use it to neglect important virtues such as courage and beneficence which are duties to which no rights correspond finally the use of rights language encourages people to make impractical demands since one can assert a right without attending to the desirability or even the possibility of burdening others with the corresponding obligations criticisms such as oneills do not target the language of rights as a whole they aim squarely at the passive rights and especially at claimrights instead of at the active privileges and powers nevertheless it is again plausible that the spread of rights talk has encouraged the tendencies that these criticisms suggest the modern discourse of rights is characteristically deployed by those who see themselves or others as potential recipients entitled to insist on certain benefits or protections describing fundamental norms in terms of rights has benefits as well as dangers the language of rights can give precise expression to elaborate structures of freedom and authority when embodied in particular doctrines such as in the international human rights documents the language of rights can express in accessible terms the standards for minimally acceptable treatment that individuals can demand from those with power over them

of using rights language overbalance the hazards remains a live question in moral political and legal theory bibliography andersson ak 2013 “choices interests and potentiality what distinguishes
