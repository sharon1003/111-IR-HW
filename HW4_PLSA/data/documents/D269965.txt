your money stop payment now stop it again the haggler by david segal july 24 2010in this episode we return to the world of finance and look at a bank fee that’s kind of like a chronic disease q i wrote my landlord a check for rent this may days passed and then a week and then two and i saw that he had not cashed it i called him and he told me in a disgruntled tone that he had not received the check and that i needed to mail another to him immediately which i did i didn’t like the idea of putting two checks for the same month in the mail — if both were cashed i’d risk bouncing other checks so before i sent a second check i called bank of america to cancel the first“o k sir” said a bank of america rep “that’s going to be 30 to put a stop payment on that check”fine i said i wasn’t naïve enough to think that canceling the check was going to be free“o k it is done the stoppayment order you have just authorized is valid for six months” she said “is there anything else i can help you with today”the haggler helping aggrieved consumers for more than sixtenths of a decade hanging up his fedora the haggler bows out jun 9a rare opportunity to scream at the company’s owner may 5when ‘free’ really means irritation a pitch for eyeglasses that sounds eerily familiar unhappy customers make him happy and rich see more »six months“yes sir a stop payment on a check is only valid for six months”i asked if there was any way i could cancel the check permanently“yes sir you can renew your stop payment six months from now for an additional 30”at this point i was getting agitated“well technically you can renew stop payments indefinitely” she said as if this were the glimmer of hope i was searching for “however you will still have to pay 30 each time”so bank of america will graciously allow me to pay it 30 every six months till death do us part to cancel a single check i argued with the company’s check department and several customer service reps and they all repeated the same policy is this even legal what can i do lawrence lac brooklyn a “yes” to question 1 “cough it up if you’re really worried about the check” to question 2 christoph hitz for elucidation the haggler called a bank of america spokesman donald vecchiarello who said that generally a check older than six months is considered “stale” and is not cashed the key word here is “generally” left wide open is the possibility that bank of america would take a good whiff of say an eightmonthold check consider it fresher than morning dew then cash it mr vecchiarello stated that despite the conversations mr lac had with three bank of america employees reps of the bank are not encouraged to extract 30 stoppayment fees from customers instead he stated they tend to emphasize the “don’t worry it’ll go stale” side of this policy asked for written proof mr vecchiarello forwarded several paragraphs of the bank’s “deposit agreement and disclosures” a lengthy document that would make terrific beach reading in opposite land among the relevant sentences are these “a stop payment order generally expires after six months however we may in our sole discretion elect to honor a stop payment order for a longer period of time without notice to you if you want the order to continue after six months you must ask us to renew the order each renewal is treated as a new order”to the haggler’s ears this translates to “hey if you’d like to be sure that we don’t confuse the moldering old check for an aromatic young one you might want to spend 30 every six months until you or the party you don’t want to pay expire that said we might refuse to pay an old check so you never know roll the dice it’s exciting”in a followup email message mr vecchiarello noted that bank of america was merely following the uniform commercial code a comprehensive set of rules that cover most aspects of commercial law it states “a stoppayment order may be renewed for additional sixmonth periods”he added that the bank of america’s goal was not to get rich 30 at a time “we want to make sure our customers understand that a stop payment only lasts for six months and from time to time a stale check may get cashed” he wrote “we do not do this to encourage customers to renew stop payments instead we want to make sure our customers are fully educated on how our processes work and what the potential ramifications are”fair enough but there is apparently nothing in the uniform commercial code that says that the bank has to extract 30 for a stoppayment order and then suggest that it might be smart to chip in another 30 six months later in fact some of bank of america’s rivals have what might be called a onceisenough policy in this area calls to phone reps revealed chase charges 32 to stop payment on a check but that sum will stop the sucker for good you get the same deal at citibank for 30 at charles schwab a stoppayment order is free and permanent despite assurances that continuing stoppayment orders are rarely needed bank of america seems unwilling to ditch the potentially lucrative ambiguity built into its policy last week a rep from its executive customer response team called mr lac and apologized for the miscommunication of his service reps by which he seemed to mean the implication that mr lac definitely had to hand over 30 every six months to stop payment on that rent check but executive customer man also said — and you know it’s coming — that in some cases stale checks are cashed and further that if mr lac wanted to be extra supercertain about his check he should probably call in six months and renew the order‘to the guy’s credit” wrote mr lac who is 26 and works at an ad agency “he also said if i wanted to call and continue the stop payment for an additional six months the 30 fee would be waived”the haggler would like to end with a withering kicker about the 45 billion in bailout money that taxpayers handed over to bank of america but he won’t email
