anion with equal n–o bond lengths upon protonation the unstable weak acid nitrous acid is produced nitrite can be oxidized or reduced with the product somewhat dependent on the oxidizingreducing agent and its strength the nitrite ion is an ambidentate ligand and is known to bond to metal centers in at least five different ways 1 nitrite is also important in biochemistry as a source of the potent vasodilator nitric oxide in organic chemistry the no −2 group is present in nitrous acid esters and nitro compounds nitrites are also used in the food production industry for curing meat nitrate or

compound may decompose explosively on heating in organic chemistry nitrites are used in diazotization reactions structure  editthe two canonical structures of no −2 which contribute to the resonance hybrid for the nitrite ion the nitrite ion has a symmetrical structure c 2v symmetry  with both n–o bonds having equal length and a bond angle of about 115 deg in valence bond theory it is described as a resonance hybrid with equal contributions from two canonical forms that are mirror images of each other in molecular orbital theory there is a sigma bond between each oxygen atom and the nitrogen atom and a delocalized pi bond made from the p orbitals on nitrogen and oxygen atoms which is perpendicular to the plane of the molecule the negative charge of the ion is equally distributed on the two oxygen atoms both nitrogen and oxygen atoms carry a lone pair of electrons therefore the nitrite ion is a lewis base moreover it can act as an ambidentate ligand towards a metal ion donating a pair of electrons from either nitrogen or oxygen atoms acidbase properties  editdimensions of trans hono from the microwave spectrumin aqueous solution nitrous acid is a weak acid hno 2 ⇌ h   no −2 p k a ≈ 33 at 18 °c 4nitrous acid is also highly volatile – in the gas phase it exists predominantly as a trans planar molecule in solution it is unstable with respect to the disproportionation reaction3hno 2 aq ⇌ h 3 o   no −3  2nothis reaction is slow at 0 °c 1 addition of acid to a solution of a nitrite in the presence of a reducing agent such as iron ii is a way to make nitric oxide no in the laboratory oxidation and reduction  editthe formal oxidation state of the nitrogen atom in a nitrite is 3 this means that it can be either oxidized to oxidation states 4 and 5 or reduced to oxidation states as low as −3 standard reduction potentials for reactions directly involving nitrous acid are shown in the table below 5halfreaction e 0  vno −3  3 h   2 e − ⇌ hno 2  h 2 o 0942 hno 2

n 2  h 2 othis reaction is unusual in that it involves compounds with nitrogen in four different oxidation states 1coordination complexes  editthe nitrite ion is known to form coordination complexes in at least five different ways 1when donation is from nitrogen to a metal center the complex is known as a nitro complex when donation is from one oxygen to a metal center the complex is known as a nitrito complex both oxygen atoms may donate to a metal center forming a chelate complex a nitrite ion can form an unsymmetrical bridge between two metal centers donating through nitrogen to one metal and through oxygen to the other a single oxygen atom can bridge to two metal centers alfred werner studied the nitro–nitrito isomerism 1 and 2 extensively the red isomer of pentaamminecobalt iii with nitrite is now known to be a nitrito complex co nh 3 5 ono 2 it is metastable and isomerizes to the yellow nitro complex co nh 3 5 no 2  2 an example of chelating nitrite 3 was found in cu bipy 2 o 2 nno 3 – bipy is the bidentate ligand 22′bypyridyl with the two bipy ligands occupying four coordination sites on the copper ion so that the nitrite is forced to occupy two sites in order to achieve an octahedral environment around the copper ion examples of 4 and 5 are illustrated 1nitrite in food preservation and biochemistry  editsee also warmedover flavor sodium nitrite is used for the curing of meat because it prevents bacterial growth and as it is a reducing agent opposite of oxidation agent in a reaction with the meats myoglobin gives the product a desirable pinkred fresh color such as with corned beef this use of nitrite goes back to the middle ages and in the us has been formally used since 1925 because of the relatively high toxicity of nitrite the lethal dose in humans is about 22 milligrams per kilogram of body weight the maximum allowed nitrite concentration in meat products is 200 ppm at these levels some 80 to 90 of the nitrite in the average u s diet is not from cured meat products but from natural nitrite production from vegetable nitrate intake under certain conditions – especially during cooking – nitrites in meat can react with degradation products of amino acids forming nitrosamines which are known carcinogens 6 however the role of nitrites and to some extent nitrates in preventing botulism by preventing c botulinum endospores from germinating have prevented the complete removal of nitrites from cured meat and indeed by definition in the u s meat cannot be labeled as cured without nitrite addition 7 they are considered irreplaceable in the prevention of botulinum poisoning from consumption of cured dry sausages by preventing spore germination 8 to reduce nitrosamine generation sodium ascorbate or its stereoisomer sodium erythorbate may be added to cured meat 9 in mice food rich in nitrites together with unsaturated fats can prevent hypertension which is one explanation for the apparent health effect of the mediterranean diet 10nitrite is detected and analyzed by the griess reaction involving the formation of a deep redcolored azo dye upon treatment of a no −2 containing sample with sulfanilic acid and naphthyl1amine in the presence of acid 11 nitrite can be reduced to nitric oxide or ammonia by many species of bacteria under hypoxic conditions nitrite may release nitric oxide which causes potent vasodilation several mechanisms for nitrite conversion to no have been described including enzymatic reduction by xanthine oxidoreductase nitrite reductase and no synthase nos as well as nonenzymatic acidic disproportionation reactions organic nitrites  edita nitrite ester in organic chemistry nitrites are esters of nitrous acid and contain the nitrosoxy functional group nitro compounds contain the c–no 2 group nitrites have the general formula rono where r is an aryl or alkyl group amyl nitrite and other alkyl nitrites are used in medicine for the treatment of heart diseases and occasionally used recreationally for their rush and prolongation of orgasm particularly in males a classic named reaction for the synthesis of alkyl nitrites is the meyer synthesis 12 13 in which alkyl halides react
