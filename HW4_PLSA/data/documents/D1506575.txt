the german confederation 181566the congress of vienna 181415 convened after napoleons defeat sought to restore order to a europe disrupted by revolutionary and imperial france its members objective was a constellation of states and a balance of power that would ensure peace and stability after a quartercentury of revolution and war in addition to the delegates of many small states the congress included representatives of five large european states austria prussia russia britain and france after months of deliberations the congress established an international political order that was to endure for nearly 100 years and that brought europe a measure of peace the congress made no effort to restore the holy roman empire and its 300odd states instead it accepted the disappearance of many small states that had occurred since 1789 and created the german confederation the confederation consisted of thirtyeight sovereign states and four free cities and included the five large kingdoms of austria prussia saxony bavaria and w√ºrttemberg the confederation met at a diet in frankfurt with an austrian always serving as president prince clemens von metternich who directed austrias foreign policy from 1809 until 1848 was the dominant political figure within the confederation he waged a decadeslong campaign to prevent the spread of revolution in europe by seeking to restore much of the political and social order that had existed before the french revolution metternichs carlsbad decrees of 1819 established a pervasive system of press censorship and regulation of the universities that dampened german intellectual life and hindered the publication of writings advocating the principles of liberalism in the 1820s he engineered the formation of the holy alliance of the monarchs of austria prussia and russia to quash political social and economic developments within central and eastern europe thought to threaten political stability economic and political trends toward unification it was not possible for metternich and his allies to suppress completely the desire for liberal reforms including the establishment of constitutional parliamentary government economic freedom and civil liberties some of these reforms had already been under discussion during the eighteenthcentury enlightenment and awareness of their desirability had spread during the napoleonic era in addition the economic reforms introduced into the rhineland by france had taken hold the business class that formed after 1815 pressed for abolition of restrictive trade practices favored by traditional handicraft guilds businessmen also sought a common currency and system of measurements for germany as well as a reduction of the numerous tolls that made road and river travel expensive and slow during the 1820s significant progress was made in reducing customs duties among german states at prussian instigation the zollverein customs union began to form and by the mid1830s it included all the most important german states except austria prussia saw to it that its chief rival within germany was excluded from the union vienna for its part did not realize at this early point the political and economic significance of intragerman trade many of germanys liberal intelligentsialower government officials men of letters professors and lawyerswho pushed for representative government and greater political freedom were also interested in some form of german unity they argued that liberal political reforms could only be enacted in a larger political entity germanys small traditional states offered little scope for political reform among those groups desiring reform there was ironically little unity many businessmen were interested only in reforms that would facilitate commerce and they gave little thought to politics political liberals were split into a number of camps some wished for a greater degree of political representation but given a widespread fear of what the masses might do if they had access to power these liberals were content to have aristocrats as leaders others desired a democratic constitution but with a hereditary king as ruler a minority of liberals were ardent democrats who desired to establish a republic with parliamentary democracy and universal suffrage the ideal of a united germany had been awakened within liberal groups by the writings of scholars and literary figures such as johann gottfried herder 17441803 and by the achievements of french nationalism after the revolution frances easy victories over germanys small states made the union of a people with a common language and historical memory desirable for practical reasons alone others were impressed by the political and commercial accomplishments of britain which made those of the small german states seem insignificant some writers warmed to romantic evocations of germanys glory during the middle ages many members of germanys aristocratic ruling class were opposed to national unity because they feared it would mean the disappearance of their small states into a large germany metternich opposed a united germany because the habsburg empire did not embrace a single people speaking one language but many peoples speaking different languages the empire would not easily fit into a united germany he desired instead the continued existence of the loosely organized german confederation with its fortyodd members none equal to austria in strength prussias kings and its conservative elite sometimes objected to austrias primacy in the confederation but they had little desire for german unification which they regarded as a potential threat to prussias existence germanys lower classesfarmers artisans and factory workerswere not included in the discussions about political and economic reform germanys farmers had been freed to some degree from many obligations and dues owed to the landowning aristocracy but they were often desperately poor earning barely enough to survive farmers west of the elbe river usually had properties too small to yield any kind of prosperity farmers east of the elbe often were landless laborers hired to work on large estates artisans that is skilled workers in handicrafts and trades belonging to the traditional guilds saw their economic position worsen as a result of the industrialization that had begun to appear in germany after 1815 the guilds attempted to stop factory construction and unrestricted commerce but strong economic trends ran counter to their wishes factory workers in contrast were doing well compared with these other groups and were generally content with their lot when the economy as a whole prospered the revolutions of 1848europe endured hard times during much of the 1840s a series of bad harvests culminating in the potato blight of 184546 brought widespread misery and some starvation an economic depression added to the hardship spreading discontent among the poor and the middle class alike a popular uprising in paris in february 1848 turned into a revolution forcing the french king louis philippe to flee to britain the success of the revolution sparked revolts elsewhere in europe numerous german cities were shaken by uprisings in which crowds consisting mainly of the urban poor but also of students and members of the liberal middle class stormed their rulers palaces and demanded fundamental reform berlin and vienna were especially hard hit by what came to be called the revolutions of 1848 the rulers of both cities like rulers elsewhere quickly acceded to the demands of their rebellious subjects and promised constitutions and representative government conservative governments fell and metternich fled to britain liberals called for a national convention to draft a constitution for all of germany the national assembly consisting of about 800 delegates from throughout germany met in a church in frankfurt the paulskirche from may 1848 to march 1849 for this purpose the restoration within just a few months liberal hopes for a reformed germany were disappointed conservative forces saw that the liberal movement was divided into a number of camps having sharply different aims furthermore the liberals had little support left among the lower classes who had supported them in the first weeks of the revolution by constructing barricades and massing before their rulers palaces few liberals desired popular democracy or were willing to enact radical economic reforms that would help farmers and artisans as a result of this timidity the masses deserted the liberals thus conservatives were able to win sizable elements of these groups to their side by promising to address their concerns factory workers had largely withheld support from the liberal cause because they earned relatively good wages compared with farmers and artisans once the conservatives regrouped and launched their successful counterattack across germany many of the reforms promised in march 1848 were forgotten the national assembly published the constitution it had drafted during months of hard debate it proposed the unification of germany as a federation with a hereditary emperor and a parliament with delegates elected directly the constitution resolved the dispute between supporters of little germany that is a united germany that would exclude austria and the habsburg empire and those supporting large germany which would include both the constitution advocated the latter the prussian king friedrich wilhelm iv r 184058 was elected united germanys first emperor he refused the crown stating that he could be elected only by other kings at that point the assembly disbanded a few subsequent rebellions by democratic liberals drew some popular support in 1849 but they were easily crushed and their leaders executed or imprisoned some of these ardent democrats fled to the united states among them was carl schurz who later fought at the battle of gettysburg as a union officer served one term as a united states senator from missouri and was appointed secretary of the interior by united states president rutherford b hayes the german confederation was reestablished and conservatives held the reins of power even more tightly than before the failure of the 1848 revolutions also meant that germany was not united as many had hoped however some of the liberals more practical proposals came to fruition later in the 1850s and 1860s when it was realized that they were essential to economic efficiency many commercial restrictions were abolished the guilds with their desire to turn back the clock and restore preindustrial conditions were defeated and impediments to the free use of capital were reduced the hungry forties gave way to the prosperity of the 1850s as the german economy modernized and laid the foundations for spectacular growth later in the century germany history contents source area handbook of the us library
