a job and if you are a good technician you can pave your own way working outside when its nice which to me is 5075 degrees and not raining negatives being on call  but it comes with the territory very mentally stressful when its extreme temps and youre on your 15th hour of work for the third or 4th straight day the ot helps at the end of the week well for me anyway06172011 0717 pm 6yellowirenut

call lol and they will call someone else or be uncomfortable until monday unlike many folks i refuse to charge extra for after hour services but with my refusal to charge extra comes a scary condition i decide what constitutes an emergency not the customer elderly infants sick folks pregnant and product which will spoil that is emergency by my book and i will fix them at the standard rate no matter what time it is otherwise you can wait or call someone else makes me no difference funny thing is that the vast majority of my customers understand and appreciate the practice they like the fact that if it is a true emergency i will show up and fix the issue for no extra charge it might be a marketing ploy or laziness or wtfe but it makes my nights easier and causes customers to stay customers since i demonstrate a willingness to help them when needed at no extra charge and i dont have to explain to the current wtfe that i have to get out of bed get dressed and drive across town in the middle of our special time and if i do it is a genuine need to do so06172011 0841 pm 10johnbeck1000professional member join date jun 2011location puget sound area wa posts 130post likes originally

are working a lot you will be 4cold in the winter  warm in the summer you will freeze in the winter and find new ways to warm your self with open flames you will sun burn in the summer and sweat in places you didnt know possible you will get asked by everyone you know on a personal level to fix their hvac cheap or nearly free you will spend a small fortune on tools even if they are provided at work to fix said personal acquaintances hvac you will work when every one else is in bed sleeping you will adapt a keen sense of smile and nod if some one is too hot or cold when you have checked and rechecked to find the equipment is running properly i could go on and on and its only starting my third full year of work the more i learn the smarter i work06172011 0905 pm 12captube professional
