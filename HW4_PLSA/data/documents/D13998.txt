boats surprised one of these landing exercises exercise tiger 7  page neededin the months leading up to the invasion the allied forces conducted a deception operation operation fortitude aimed at misleading the germans with respect to the date and place of the invasion there were several leaks prior to or on dday through the cicero affair the germans obtained documents containing references to overlord but these documents lacked all detail 8 double cross agents such as the spaniard juan pujol codenamed garbo played an important role in convincing the german high command that normandy was at best a diversionary attack u s major general henry miller chief supply officer of the us 9th air force during a party at claridges hotel in london complained to guests of the supply problems he was having but that after the invasion which he told them would be before 15 june supply would be easier after being told eisenhower reduced miller to lieutenant colonel associated press june 10 1944 and sent him back to the u s where he retired 9 another such leak was general charles de gaulle s radio message after dday he unlike all the other leaders stated that this invasion was the real invasion this had the potential to ruin the allied deceptions fortitude north and fortitude south in contrast gen eisenhower referred to the landings as the initial invasion only ten days each month were suitable for launching the operation a day near the full moon was needed both for illumination during the hours of darkness and for the spring tide the former to illuminate navigational landmarks for the crews of aircraft gliders and landing craft and the latter to expose defensive obstacles placed by the german forces in the surf on the seaward approaches to the beaches a full moon occurred on 6 june allied expeditionary force supreme commander dwight d eisenhower had tentatively selected 5 june as the date for the assault the weather was fine during most of may but deteriorated in early june on 4 june conditions were clearly unsuitable for a landing wind and high seas would make it impossible to launch landing craft from larger ships at sea low clouds would prevent aircraft finding their targets the allied troop convoys already at sea were forced to take shelter in bays and inlets on the south coast of britain for the night it seemed possible that everything would have to be cancelled and the troops returned to their embarkation camps which would be almost impossible as the enormous movement of followup formations into them was already proceeding 10 the next full moon period would be nearly a month away at a vital meeting on 5 june eisenhowers chief meteorologist  group captain j m stagg forecast a brief improvement for 6 june 11 commander of all land forces for the invasion general bernard montgomery and eisenhowers chief of staff general walter bedell smith wished to proceed with the invasion commander of the allied air forces air chief marshal leigh mallory was doubtful but allied naval commanderinchief admiral bertram ramsay believed that conditions would be marginally favorable 10 on the strength of staggs forecast eisenhower ordered the invasion to proceed 12 as a result prevailing overcast skies limited allied air support and no serious damage would be done to the beach defences on omaha and juno 13the germans meanwhile took comfort from the existing poor conditions which were worse over northern france than over the english channel itself and believed no invasion would be possible for several days some troops stood down and many senior officers were away for the weekend field marshal erwin rommel took a few days leave to celebrate his wifes birthday 14 while dozens of division regimental and battalion commanders were away from their posts conducting war games just prior to the invasion 15codenames  editthe allies assigned codenames to the various operations involved in the invasion overlord was the name assigned to the establishment of a largescale lodgement on the northern portion of the continent the first phase the establishment of a secure foothold was codenamed neptune according to the dday museum the armed forces use codenames to refer to the planning and execution of specific military operations operation overlord was the codename for the allied invasion of northwest europe the assault phase of operation overlord was known as operation neptune … operation neptune began on dday 6 june 1944 and ended on 30 june 1944 by this time the allies had established a firm foothold in normandy operation overlord also began on dday and continued until allied forces crossed the river seine on 19 august 1944 16officers with knowledge of dday were not to be sent where there was the slightest danger of being captured these officers were given the codename of  bigot  derived from the words to gib to gibraltar that was stamped on the papers of officers who took part in the north african invasion in 1942 17 on the night of 27 april during exercise tiger a preinvasion exercise off the coast of slapton sands beach several american lsts were attacked by german e boats and among the 638 americans killed in the attack and a further 308 killed by friendly fire ten bigots were listed as missing as the invasion would be cancelled if any were captured or unaccounted for 18 their fate was given the

naval expeditionary force providing close protection and bombardment at the beaches was admiral sir bertram ramsay the allied naval expeditionary force was divided into two naval task forces western

reached its peak during 1944 tanks on the east front peaked at 5202 in november 1944 while total aircraft in the luftwaffe inventory peaked at 5041 in december 1944 by dday 157 german divisions were stationed in the soviet union 6 in finland 12 in norway 6 in denmark 9 in germany 21 in the balkans 26 in italy and 59 in france belgium and the netherlands 27 however these statistics are somewhat

napoleon bonaparte s navy compounding the difficulty of invasion was the extensive atlantic wall ordered by hitler in his directive 51 believing that any forthcoming landings would be timed for high

oberstleutnant freiherr von und zu aufsess comprising three bicycle battalions armoured reserves  editrommels defensive measures were frustrated by a dispute over armoured doctrine in addition to his two army groups rundstedt also commanded the headquarters of panzer group west under general leo geyr von schweppenburg usually referred to as von geyr this formation was nominally an administrative hq for rundstedts armoured and mobile formations but it was later to be brought into the line in normandy and renamed fifth panzer army geyr and rommel disagreed over the deployment and use of the vital panzer divisions rommel recognised that the allies would possess air superiority and would be able to harass his movements from the air he therefore proposed that the armoured formations be deployed close to the invasion beaches in his words it was better to have one panzer division facing the invaders on the first day than three panzer divisions three days later when the allies would already have established a firm beachhead geyr argued for the standard doctrine that the panzer formations should be concentrated in a central position around paris and rouen and deployed en masse against the main allied beachhead when this had been identified the argument was eventually brought before hitler for arbitration he characteristically imposed an unworkable compromise solution only three panzer divisions were given to rommel too few to cover all the threatened sectors the remainder nominally under geyrs control were actually designated as being in  okw reserve only three of these were deployed close enough to intervene immediately against any invasion of northern france the other four were dispersed in southern france and the netherlands hitler reserved to himself the authority to move the divisions in okw reserve or commit them to action on 6 june many panzer division commanders were unable to move because hitler had not given the necessary authorisation and his staff refused to wake him upon news of the invasion army group b reserve  edit21st panzer division generalmajor edgar feuchtinger  was deployed near caen as a mobile striking force as part of the army group b reserve however rommel placed it so close to the coastal defenses that under standing orders in case of invasion several of its infantry and antiaircraft units would come under the orders of the fortress divisions on the coast reducing the effective strength of the division the other two armoured divisions over which rommel had operational control the 2nd panzer division and 116th panzer division were deployed near the pas de calais in accordance with german views about the likely allied landing sites neither was moved from the pas de calais for at least fourteen days after the

last linked with paratroopers and a front line 10 to 16 kilometres 6–10 mi from the beaches however practically none of these objectives had been achieved it took six weeks for british and canadian troops to capture caen as they faced seven panzer divisions while their american allies although advancing more rapidly faced only two of these divisions overall the casualties had not been as heavy as some had feared around 10000 compared to the 20000 churchill had estimated and the bridgeheads had withstood the expected counterattacks once the beachhead was established two artificial mulberry harbours were towed across the english channel in segments and made operational around d3 9 june one was constructed at arromanches by british forces the other at omaha beach by american forces by 19 june when severe storms interrupted the landing of supplies for several days and destroyed the omaha harbour the british had landed 314547 men 54000 vehicles and 102000 tons of supplies while the americans put ashore 314504 men 41000 vehicles and 116000 tons of supplies 30 around 9000 tons of materiel were landed daily at the arromanches harbour until the end of august 1944 by which time the

across the english channel in over eight centuries they were costly in terms of men but the defeat inflicted on the germans was one of the largest of the war strategically the campaign led to the loss of the german position in most of france and the secure establishment of a new major front in larger context the normandy landings helped the soviets on the eastern front who were facing the bulk of the german forces and to a certain extent contributed to the shortening of the conflict there although there was a shortage of artillery ammunition at no time were the allies critically short of any necessity this was a remarkable achievement considering they did not hold a port until cherbourg fell by the time of the breakout the allies also enjoyed a considerable superiority in numbers of troops approximately 72 and armoured vehicles approximately 41 which helped overcome the natural advantages the terrain gave to the german defenders allied intelligence and counterintelligence efforts were successful beyond expectations the operation fortitude deception before the invasion kept german attention focused on the pas de calais and indeed highquality german forces were kept in this area away from normandy until july prior to the invasion few german reconnaissance flights took place over britain and those that did saw only the dummy staging areas ultra decrypts of german communications had been helpful as well exposing german dispositions and revealing their plans such as the mortain counterattack general bernard montgomery with british troops in normandy july 1944allied air operations also contributed significantly to the invasion via close tactical support interdiction of german lines of communication preventing timely movement of supplies and reinforcements—particularly the critical panzer units and rendering the luftwaffe ineffective in normandy nb 2 although the impact upon armoured vehicles was less than expected air activity intimidated these units and cut their supplies despite initial heavy losses in the assault phase allied morale remained high casualty rates among all the armies were tremendous and the commonwealth forces had to use a recently created category—double intense—to be able to describe them german leadership  editgerman commanders at all levels failed to react to the assault phase in a timely manner communications problems exacerbated the difficulties caused by allied air and naval firepower local commanders also seemed incapable of the task of fighting an aggressive defense on the beach as rommel had envisioned the german high command remained fixated on the calais area and von rundstedt was not permitted to commit the armoured reserve when it was finally released late in the day its chance of success was greatly reduced overall despite considerable allied material superiority the germans kept the allies bottled up in a small beachhead for nearly two months aided immeasurably by terrain factors although there were several known disputes among the allied commanders their tactics and strategy were essentially determined by agreement among the main commanders by contrast the german leaders were bullied and their decisions interfered with by okw field marshals von rundstedt and rommel repeatedly asked hitler for more discretion but were refused rundstedt was removed from his command on 29 june after he bluntly told the chief of staff at hitlers armed forces hq field marshal keitel to make peace you idiots rommel was severely injured by allied aircraft on 17 july sixty thousand of the 850000 in rundstedts command were raised from the many prisoners of war taken on the eastern front 33 many surrendered or deserted at the first available opportunity war memorials and
