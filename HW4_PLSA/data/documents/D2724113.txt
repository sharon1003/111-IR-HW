home  genealogy  cousins cousins an apology before we go into cousins about half the time i try to explain something i go into so much detail i bore people and the other half i leave out so much detail i confuse them once in a while i manage to be boring and confusing at the same time this page assumes you dont know anything about cousins so it will probably tell you some things you already know there is a navigation bar at the bottom of the page so you can leave now if you like there is a separate page if you are wondering can cousins date on with the explanation it depends heavily on a chart if a picture is worth a thousand words a chart is worth a couple of paragraphs the chart is only 6 kb so i put it in between each paragraph if you click on view  text size  smallest you should be able to see the chart and the paragraph below it without scrolling its the same chart shown five times here is a family mr a had two children b1 and b2 b1 and all of his offspring had two children b2 and all of his offspring had one child for simplicity im not showing the spouses b1 and b2 are siblings children of siblings are first cousins c1 and c2 are first cousins to c3 children of first cousins are second cousins d1 d2 d3 and d4 are all second cousins to d5 children of second cousins are third cousins e01 through e08 are all third cousins to poor lonesome e09 e01 through e08 borrow each others sweaters and go on double dates e09 wishes he had a close relative everyone on the same level is the same degree of cousin and is in the same generation counting mr a as the first generation the b level is the second generation c the third and so forth everyone in the e level  the third cousins row  is in the fifth generation from mr a he is their greatgreat grandfather most of them have a picture of him in his civil war uniform over their mantles so where does the removed business come in when you relate cousins who are in different generations thats when the red line shows why c3 is e08s first cousin twice removed if two cousins are on different levels they are removed from each other c2 has a grandson e08 c2 has a first cousin c3 the red line from e08 to c2 goes up two generation levels  where i put the short blue lines those are removeds it is also a removed if you go down if you start on d3 go left to his first cousins d1 and d2 then drop down a level to e01 e02 e03 and e04 youve reached d3s first cousins once removed mr a e01s greatgreatgrandfather is four levels up from e01 any of mr as cousins would be e01s cousins too four times removed lets try it a different way look at c3 he has two first cousins c1 and c2 his first cousins have children d1 through d4 they are c3s first cousins once removed one level down d1 d4s eight kids are two levels down from c3 they are c3s first cousins twice removed to summarize when cousins have children you add a degree children of first cousins are second cousins children of second cousins are third cousins children of third cousins are fourth cousins  when you go up or down a generation level you add a removed but you dont change the degree your fathers nth 1st 2nd 3rd    cousin is your nth cousin too but once removed your grandfathers nth cousin is your nth cousin twice removed your greatgrandfathers nth cousin is your nth cousin three times removed  you can keep adding removeds and degrees your grandfathers second cousin is your second cousin twice removed your greatgrandfathers third cousin is your third cousin three times removed  if this makes cousins really clear please share the url with thirty or forty of your closest friends i have a monthly bet on whose site gets the most hits with a fellow at work the loser treats for lunch if it doesnt makes cousins really clear please send me an email message with the link below ill revise the explanation this is part of the genealogy section of my web site but most people who use it just want to settle a bet not trace their family tree so i dont have the genealogy navigation bar on this page feel free to look around via the navigation bar below sections of my web site home  christmas letters  genealogy  homilies  misc essays  peace corps  web design problems comments or complaints need an opinion send email to ted packfire2wirecom this page updated june 21 2014
