they hole out one player tees off at the even holes and one on the odd holes handicap allowance is half of the combined total of both players played to strict rules of matchplay golfgreensomes matchplay game for teams of two where both partners drive and they choose the best drive and then play alternate shots for the rest of hole as in foursomes for handicap matchplay take the combined
