spacecom spaceflight reference apollo 8 first around the moon by elizabeth howell spacecom contributor  august 29 2012 0131pm etmorethe apollo 8 astronauts broadcast neverbefore views of the earth and moon on december 24 1968 credit nasaapollo 8 the second manned mission of the apollo program took astronauts farther than anyone had gone before and showed humanity just how small and special our planet is during their sevenday flight in december 1968 the crew became the first people to orbit another world awed by the sight of earth rising over the moons horizon they took one of the most iconic photographs in history this historic mission happened through a relatively lastminute decision on the part of nasa management initial plans were to test the lunar and command module components of the apollo spacecraft first before striking out for the moon but nasa management heard rumors that the russians were planning a crewed mission to lunar orbit after consultation with engineers and the astronauts nasa did a risky dosedo and decided to send the apollo 8 command module alone around the moon without a lunar module backup if something were to go wrong jim lovell bill anders and frank borman crew of apollo 8 credit nasathe astronauts spacecraft commander frank borman and crew member jim lovell were also crewmates on the gemini 7 endurance mission they spent nearly 14 days living together in a spacecraft about as big as a phone booth borman had also distinguished himself by serving on a review board investigating the apollo 1 fatal fire in 1967 bill anders was a former fighter pilot in the air force he had not flown in space before but served as a backup crew member for gemini 11 across the atlantic and the lunar gulf the night before launch aviation pioneer charles lindbergh paid a visit to the apollo 8 crew lucky lindy became the first man to solo the atlantic41 years before when chatting with the astronauts lindbergh asked how much fuel they would need to get into space when told the rocket would consume 20 tons a second lindbergh smiled and said in the first second of your flight tomorrow youll burn 10 times more fuel than i did all the way to paris apollo 8s own journey across the atlantic took only minutes after the launch on dec 21 they were the first astronauts to launch atop the saturn v rocket after settling into orbit around earth the crew did their final checks and received the go from nasa to do translunar injection this meant they were clear to fire their engines and point for the moon  video leap to lunar orbitjust 18 hours after launch apollo 8 experienced a major problem its commander got sick vomiting and also experiencing diarrhea borman felt better after getting some sleep but as a precaution the crew radioed his predicament to earth on a private channel it took a few hours before nasa heard what had happened as it was difficult for the crew to alert officials to listen without tipping off the public but when the agency did it was much concerned flight surgeon chuck berry consulted with borman and senior nasa management to determine if the mission should be altered to bring the astronauts back home as quickly as possible but after hearing borman was better they cautiously gave the thumbsup to continue christmas eve at the moon placing the apollo spacecraft in orbit was not an easy task and compounding the difficulty the engine burn to put it in the right spot had to happen while the spacecraft was out of contact with earth on the far side of the moon but they made it the astronauts stared at awe at the landscape below at least lovell and anders did while borman was reportedly more concerned about setting themselves up to head home but one thing that did take them all by surprise was the majesty of the earth rising above the moon anders decided to take an unscheduled photo op the resulting earthrise photo showing our delicate planet surrounded by blackness is credited as a major impetus for the environmental movement on christmas eve the crew had the chance to share their impressions with others via a public broadcast borman called the moon a vast lonely forbidding type of existence while lovell paid tribute to the earths grand ovation to the vastness of space then the crew read genesis reciting the biblical story of how earth came to be all that was left now was to come home mission controllers waited anxiously christmas morning as the crew turned their engine on again on the far side of the moon as they reemerged lovell called out please be informed there is a santa claus signalling they were headed back to earth the crew landed successfully dec 28 it was a risk to bring apollo 8 so far so fast but the audaciousness of nasa captured the worlds attention the success of the mission showed the world it was possible to bring people to the moon now nasa just had to figure out how to help astronauts to the surface related leaving home the legacy of apollo 8new
