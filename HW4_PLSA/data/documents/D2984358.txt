involved in many cardiovascular diseases with increased oxidative stress aldosteroneinduced cardiac fibrosis is abolished by blockade of angiotensin ii type1 at 1 receptor recently nongenomic vasoconstrictor effects of aldosterone were reported in various vascular beds we tested the hypothesis that aldosterone stimulates angiotensin at 1 receptor and causes vasoconstriction by increasing oxidative stress in coronary microcirculation coronary arterioles 60–120 μm were isolated from spontaneously hypertensive rats shr and control wistar kyoto wky rats aged 23–26 weeks they were cannulated and pressurized at 60 cm h 2 o effect of aldosterone 10 − 15 to 10 − 6 m on coronary arteriolar diameter was examined aldosterone rapidly and dosedependently decreased coronary arteriolar diameter in wky rats and shr diameter changes 84 ± 07 vs 139 ± 08 p  005 aldosteroneinduced vasoconstriction was enhanced by 16folds in shr compared to wky rats  p  005 mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone 10 − 6 m did not influence aldosteroneinduced vasoconstriction selective angiotensin at 1 receptor blocker valsartan 10 − 4 m or candesartan 10 − 7 m abolished aldosteroneinduced vasoconstriction similarly superoxide dismutase sod 300 uml and nadph oxidase inhibitor apocynin 10 − 4 m abolished it moreover the vasoconstrictor effect of aldosterone disappeared in denuded vessels realtime quantitative rtpcr revealed that angiotensin at 1 receptor m rna level in coronary arterioles of shr was upregulated by 15folds compared to that in wky rats  p  005 aldosterone causes vasoconstriction in coronary arterioles and this vasoconstrictor effect is enhanced by genetically defined hypertension aldosteroneinduced vasoconstriction is mediated by angiotensin at 1 receptor presumably via oxidative stress previous article next article keywords aldosterone coronary microcirculation vasoconstriction hypertension angiotensin receptor1 introduction aldosterone shows its classical effects through binding to the mineralocorticoid receptor which subsequently leads to activation or repression of target genes including the early response genes kras and several serum glucocorticoid kinases  verrey et al 1995  in addition to sodium potassium and extracellular volume homeostases aldosterone stimulates generation of collagen fibronectin and laminin and promotes cardiac hypertrophy remodeling and fibrosis independent of blood pressure  brilla et al 1990 fiebeler et al 2001  furthermore aldosterone increases oxidative stress via activation of nadph oxidase  sun et al 2002  and causes endothelial dysfunction  farquharson and struthers 2002 nagata et al 2006  although previously thought to be synthesized solely in the adrenal cortex recent studies showed that aldosterone was also produced in extraadrenal tissues such as the heart blood vessels and even in the failing human heart  hatakeyama et al 1994 mizuno et al 2001 silvestre et al 1998 slight et al 1999  recently rapid nongenomic aldosterone effects have been demonstrated in contrast to genomic aldosterone actions these effects are detected within seconds to few minutes and are not blocked by spironolactone and inhibitors of transcription and protein synthesis suggesting that they are independent of the mineralocorticoid receptor  wehling 1995  although it has been demonstrated that nongenomic aldosterone effects were mediated by a putative membrane receptor the mechanisms involved remain unclear angiotensin ii the main biological active peptide of the renin–angiotensin system causes hypertension by activating angiotensin ii type 1 at 1 receptor and is involved in myocardial hypertrophy and cardiac remodeling it was also reported that expression of angiotensin at 1 receptor was upregulated in the pathological state of hypertension  makino et al 1997 naito et al 2002 suzuki et al 1993  recently it was shown that aldosteroneinduced cardiac fibrosis was abolished by blockade of angiotensin at 1 receptor thereby raising the possibility that aldosterone stimulates angiotensin at 1 receptor directly or indirectly  robert et al 1999  it has been reported that aldosterone may exert direct vascular effects via nongenomic mechanisms in vivo aldosterone decreases coronary flow in rats  fujita et al 2005 moreau et al 1996  however in humans both rapid nongenomic vasodilatory and vasoconstrictive effects have been reported when aldosterone was infused into the forearm  romagni et al 2003 schmidt et al 1999 2003 wehling et al 1998  in vitro aldosterone causes vasoconstriction in afferent and efferent renal arterioles in rabbits  arima et al 2003 2004  in contrast it has also been reported that aldosterone has no effect on internal diameter of renal afferent arterioles in rats  uhrenholt et al 2003  thus there is controversy in effects of aldosterone on vascular tonus to the best of our knowledge there has been no study demonstrating direct vascular actions of aldosterone in coronary arterioles therefore the present study aimed to determine vasomotor actions of aldosterone in coronary arterioles and investigate whether angiotensin at 1 receptor could participate in the effects of aldosterone on microvessels and whether effects of aldosterone were influenced by hypertension2 materials and methods21 animal preparation male spontaneously hypertensive rats shr 23–26 weeks old n  30 and agematched wistar kyoto wky rats  n  30 as genetically normotensive control strains were used in this study all rats were

subepicardial coronary arterioles internal diameter 60–120 μm were dissected from surrounding cardiac tissues under cold 5 °c pss containing albumin at p h 74 each isolated microvessel was then transferred for cannulation to a lucite vessel chamber containing albuminpss p h 74 equilibrated with room air at ambient temperature both ends of the vessel were cannulated with micropipettes filled with albuminpss the cannulated vessel was securely tied to the micropipettes using 110 ophthalmic sutures alcon23 instrumentation after a vessel was cannulated the preparation was transferred to the stage of an inverted microscope ix70 olympus coupled to a ccd camera cs330 olympus and video micrometer microcirculation research institute texas am university health science center micropipettes were connected to an independent pressure reservoir system and intraluminal pressures were measured through side arms of the 2 reservoir lines by lowvolumedisplacement straingauge transducers isolated vessels were pressurized without flow by setting both reservoirs at the same hydrostatic level 60 cm h 2 o internal diameters of the vessel were measured throughout the experiment using video microscopic techniques24 drugs drugs and chemicals were obtained from sigma chemical co except as specifically stated valsartan was a gift from novartis pharma co candesartan cv11974 was a gift from takeda chemical industries ltd25 experimental protocols in isolated vessel studies each cannulated vessel was bathed in albuminpss and equilibrated with room air and temperature was maintained at 37

chemicals were administered to the vessel bath first effects of aldosterone 10 − 15 –10 − 6 m on coronary arteriolar diameter were observed to determine whether effects of aldosterone were genomic or

aldosterone effects of angiotensin at 1 receptor blocker valsartan 10 − 4 m or candesartan 10 − 7 m on aldosteroneinduced changes in coronary arteriolar diameter were examined to determine the role of superoxide anions in the action of aldosterone effects of the free radical scavenger superoxide dismutase sod 300 uml and the nadph oxidase inhibitor apocynin 10 − 4 m were also examined the vessel was exposed to each of spironolactone valsartan candesartan sod and apocynin for 30 min before the examination of the effect of aldosterone to determine the role of the endothelium in the action of

beds in human resistance arterioles intravenous application of aldosterone significantly increases systemic vascular resistance within a few minutes in vivo  schmidt et al 1999 wehling et al 1998  moreau et al 1996 reported that aldosterone decreased coronary flow maximally by 20 ± 4 in the isolated perfused rat heart moreover fujita et al 2005 recently reported that aldosterone dosedependently decreased coronary flow in the canine heart on the other hand barbato et al 2002 reported that aldosterone decreased coronary vascular resistance in isolated working hearts of rats although arima et al 2003 2004 reported that aldosterone caused direct vasoconstriction in afferent and efferent renal arterioles isolated from rabbits in vitro there is no evidence for the direct effect of aldosterone on tonus of coronary arterioles since aldosterone influences not only vessels but cardiac function the direct microvascular action of aldosterone is difficult to unequivocally be assessed in the isolated working heart furthermore in vivo increase in extracellular volume induced by aldosterone makes data interpretation more difficult because its secondary effects are attributable to subsequent flow and pressure changes with these considerations in mind isolated vessel approaches would provide a direct method in determining the vasomotor activity of aldosterone to the best of our knowledge this is the first study reporting direct effects of aldosterone on coronary microvessels in the present study we showed that aldosterone caused dosedependent vasoconstriction in coronary arterioles the decrease in diameter 84 or 139 of the basal internal diameter value in wky rats or shr respectively at the most induced by aldosterone appears to be smaller than those induced by other vasoconstrictors such as angiotensin ii however it represents an increase in vascular resistance by 18folds because vascular resistance is reciprocal to the fourth power of the vascular radius thus aldosterone may play an important role in regulation of vascular resistance and blood flow in coronary microcirculation at physiologic plasma levels approximately 01 n m in humans aldosterone appears to exert a small influence on coronary microcirculation in normotensive subjects because the decrease in coronary arteriolar diameter induced by aldosterone was only 46 in normotensive rats however under some pathological states plasma aldosterone concentration rises above 1 n m pedersen et al 1995 reported that plasma aldosterone concentration increased to 600 pgml approximately 16 n m in dogs with dilated cardiomyopathy naruse et al 2002 reported that plasma aldosterone concentration increased to approximately 12 n m in strokeprone shr at 20 weeks old we demonstrated that aldosterone caused dosedependent vasoconstriction and this effect was greater in shr than in wky rats therefore it is likely that aldosterone exerts more deleterious influences on the coronary microcirculation in pathological states with high plasma aldosterone concentration such as hypertension and heart failure in addition local production of aldosterone was reported in the rat heart and vessels  hatakeyama et al 1994  local aldosterone levels were estimated to be 20folds higher in rat heart tissues than in plasma  silvestre et al 1998  even in humans it has been reported that production of aldosterone was enhanced in failing hearts  mizuno et al 2001  therefore tissue levels of aldosterone rather than plasma levels might be elevated even in physiological conditions and range within levels of biological actions42 involvement of angiotensin at 1 receptor in aldosteroneinduced vasoconstriction we demonstrated that the vasoconstrictor effect of aldosterone was not abolished by spironolactone a classical antagonist of intracellular mineralocorticoid receptor moreover the vasoconstrictor effect of aldosterone was rapid and occurred within seconds these results were consistent with previous reports on nongenomic actions of aldosterone in this study we used only one dose of spironolactone 10 − 6 m we believed that this dose was enough to block mineralocorticoid receptor since in the previous study  uhrenholt et al 2003  10 − 7 m of spironolactone was shown to be able to block the action of aldosterone it was reported that bovine serum albumin bsaconjugated aldosteroneinduced vasoconstriction  arima et al 2003 fujita et al 2005  because bsaconjugated aldosterone would not permeate into the cytoplasm its effect is not mediated through intracellular mineralocorticoid receptor but is proposed to occur via a plasma membrane receptor in this study we clearly demonstrated that the vasoconstrictor effect of aldosterone was abolished by two kinds of angiotensin at 1 receptor blocker valsartan and candesartan suggesting that it is mediated by angiotensin at 1 receptor signaling and not by another pathway angiotensin ii binds to angiotensin at 1 receptor to activate nadph oxidase thereby leading to subsequent generation of reactive oxygen species and vasoconstriction shastri et al 2002 reported that angiotensin iiinduced vasoconstriction was partially abolished by 4hydroxy2266tetramethyl piperidinoxyl tempol in aortic rings and mesenteric arterioles and the inhibitor effect of tempol was absent after endothelium denudation and endothelial nitric oxide synthase inhibition therefore in these preparations angiotensin ii stimulates generation of superoxide anions and these anions scavenge and inactivate nitric oxide released from the endothelium resulting in vasoconstriction in the present study we clearly demonstrated that the vasoconstrictor effect of aldosterone was completely abolished by both sod and apocynin suggesting that it is mediated by superoxide anions being consistent with the finding of angiotensin iiinduced vasoconstriction in resistance arterioles aldosteroneinduced vasoconstriction is dependent on scavengers and inactivation of nitric oxide by superoxide anions generated after stimulation of angiotensin at 1 receptor it was confirmed that aldosteroneinduced vasoconstriction is endotheliumdependent because of its disappearance after endothelial denudation although further investigations are needed to identify how aldosterone activates angiotensin at 1 receptor the present findings suggest that a transmembrane receptor for aldosterone is present in rat coronary microvessels and angiotensin at 1 receptor is a candidate responsible for aldosteroneinduced vasoconstriction43 enhancement of aldosteroneinduced vasoconstriction in shrwe demonstrated that aldosteroneinduced vasoconstriction was enhanced by 16folds in shr compared to wky rats  p  005 quantitative analysis of arteriolar angiotensin ii receptor genes showed that expression of angiotensin at 1 receptor was 15folds greater than that in wky rats which was consistent with the predominance of aldosteronemediated vasoconstriction observed in our functional study therefore aldosteroneinduced vasoconstriction was enhanced according to the amount of angiotensin at 1 receptor in the pathological state of hypertension it was reported that expression of angiotensin at 1 receptor was upregulated in the rat heart  makino et al 1997 naito et al 2002 suzuki et al 1993  in the present study we clearly showed that even in coronary arterioles aldosteronemediated vasoconstriction was exaggerated especially in the pathological state of hypertension44 study limitation it may be pointed out that the results obtained from the isolated arterioles represent an in vitro phenomenon and may not represent the in vivo action of aldosterone further aldosteroneinduced vasoconstriction in the coronary arterioles was small in addition our study did not show how aldosterone activated angiotensin at 1 receptor it remains unclear whether aldosterone activates angiotensin at 1 receptor directly or indirectly we recently reported that aldosterone induces formation of angiotensin at 1 receptor dimerization  yamada et al 2006  which enhances angiotensin at 1 receptor responsiveness  abd alla et al 2004  further investigations are necessary to clarify the physiologic and pathophysiologic significances of the effect of aldosterone on vascular tonus in coronary microcirculation and the mechanism of activation of angiotensin at 1 receptor45 perspectives the randomized aldactone evaluation study rales and eplerenone neuro hormonal efficacy and survival study ephesus trialas established the beneficial effects of chronic blockade of aldosterone using mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist for patients with chronic heart failure  pitt et al 1999 2003  in this study we demonstrated that aldosterone caused dosedependent vasoconstriction in coronary microcirculation aldosteroneinduced vasoconstriction in coronary arterioles was significantly enhanced in rats with hypertension presumably being dependent on the increase in angiotensin at 1 receptor thus in addition to myocardial hypertrophy and cardiac fibrosis aldosterone appears to be involved in the reduction of coronary flow especially in the pathological state of hypertension we also demonstrated that aldosteroneinduced vasoconstriction was a nongenomic effect and was surprisingly mediated by angiotensin at 1 receptor through the formation of superoxide we thought that it was important to inhibit nongenomic effects of aldosterone using angiotensin at 1 receptor blocker in the pathological state of hypertension references abd
