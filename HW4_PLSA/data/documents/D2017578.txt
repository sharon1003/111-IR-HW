liver gall bladder what structure are required for exocrine organs to release their contents which glands have exocrine function only ducts salivary glands gall bladder liver do exocrine organs require ducts which glands have endocrine function only no thyroid and pituitary which organ has both exocrine and endocrine function pancreas etc what are the 3 major salivary glands what are the 5 minor salivary glands parotid submandibular and sublingual buccal lingual labial molar and palatine glands what are the 5 major proteins of saliva what is the mneumonic amylase amy lactoferrin lacks lingual lipase long nothing hair lysozyme lice lyz ig a ignoredis water a component of saliva what are the 4 electrolytes in saliva yes sodium potassium calcium phosphate are lingual or sublingual salivary glands major glands are palantine or parotid glands major salivary glands sublingual parotid what are the 4 main function of saliva what are the 2 things does saliva moisten lubrication digestion immunity and mineralization oral mucosa and food what does saliva serve as a medium for concerning digestion what chemical does saliva contain that buffers acidity what 2 enzymes of saliva aid in digesting food medium for dissolved food hco3 amylase lipase which 3 enzyme aid in immunity by being antibacterial lysozyme peroxidase ig awhat 2 types of exocrine ducts are in salivary glands which feeds into the other in tralobular duct and in terlobular in terlobular goes to in tralobular what type of ducts are in tralobular ducts how are the cells of the in tralobular duct joined what is another major characteristic of the intralobular duct  secretory duct via intercalations really dark lines between the cells it is striated where do in terlobular feed into what type of ducts are in terlobular  larger ducts excretory ducts what are acini what are the 3 types of secretory acini a small saclike dilatation in a glands serous mucous mixed what type of acini are in the parotid gland what are the 2 characteristics of the parotid gland serous yes well developed secretory ducts and large amount of adipose cells what type of acini do submandibular glands have what is a major characteristic of the ducts in submandibular glands are the ducts the same as in the parotid gland they are mixed both serous mucous they have intercalated ducts no they are less extensive what forms in the submandibular gland because they are fixed conventionally do they form when the slides undergo rapid freezing serous demilunes no what are the 2 main charcteristics of sublingual gland what are the major types of acini present in sublingual glands secretory ducts that are short or absent mucous what structure of the pancreas carries out the organs exocrine action what type of action does it do specifically what does it release and how does it release it what structures do they use to do so cells serous glands secretes 2 components digestive enzymes and bicarbonate serous acini cells secrete the enzymes and centroacinar cells secrete the bicarbonate what are the four main enzymes that the serous gland of the pancreas secretes what is the action that the bicarbonate ions do proteolytic amylolytic lipolytic and nucleolytic enzymes they create an alkaline p h via intercalated ducts what structure of the pancreas carries out the organs endocrine action what do they secrete 3 what does the endocrine portion of the pancreas regulate in the body the ilets of langerhan hormones insulin glucagon somastatin regulates blood glucose level what are the 3 major cell types of the islets of langerhans what do a cells secrete what percentage of ilet cell secretion is a cell product what do b cells secrete what percentage of ilet cell secretion is b cell product what do d cells secrete what percentage of ilet cell secretion is d cell product aalpha cellsbbeta and ddelta cells glucagon which is 20 of the islet cell secretions insulin which is 70 of the islet cell secretions somatostatin which is 10 of the islet cell secretions what other 2 cell types are present in the islet other cells what does each secrete g cells and f cells g cellsgastrin f cellspancreatic polypepetide are g cells predominant in the pancreas no what effect does insulin have on glucose blood levels how does it affect glucose metabolism decreases glucose blood levels promotes its uptake storage and use what effect does glucagon have on glucose blood levels how does it affect glucose metabolism increases glucose blood levels promotes its release and decreases its use what effect does insulin have on somatostatin blood levels not very clear what are the 6 major functions of the liver which function is exocrine endocrine produces plasma proteins store and converte vitamins controls glucose lipid and protein metabolism degrade and detoxifies body forms bile exocrine modify hormones endocrinelikewhich plasma proteins does the liver produce which vitamens does the liver store and convert what does it degrade and remove from the blood albumins nonimmune globulins lipoproteins vldls prothrombin fibronogen glycoproteins vitamin a d k and iron drugs and poisons what is the action of bile salts what are the 3 components of bile salt what chemical creates biles green pigment  the emulsification of fat cholesterol phospholipids and water bilirubin glucuronide what is bile glucuronide does the liver recycle it the waste product from the breakdown of red blood cells no what are the 4 structural components of the liver parenchyma made of hepatocyte plates connective tissue stroma sinusoids capillaries of liver perisinusoidal spaces spaces of dissewhat are the 3 types of lobes that a liver can be made into they can be classic portal or liver acinus which zone of a liver acinus has the most oxygenated blood and richest in nutrients which has the least oxygenated blood what lies between these 2 zones zone 1 zone 3 zone 2how are hepatocytes shaped what type of cytoplasm do they have color what type of nucleus can hepatocytes regenerate polygonal eosinophilic w basophilic regions round central you can have two or more polyploid yes what epithelium lines the sinusoid sinusoidal capillary of the liver what type of basement membrane is in sinusoid sinusoidal capillary of the liver what cells are present in the sinusoid  discontinuous fenestrated endothelium discontinuous basement membrane kupffer cells what are perisinusoidal space space of disse created from what structures project into them what occurs in the space what cells reside in the space what do they store made from space that lies between the fenesrated endothelium of sinusoid endothelium and hepatocytes microvilli from hepatocytes fluid exchange between leaky sinusoids and microvilli hepatic stellate cells ito cells vitamin awhat are the 3 surfaces of bile cells what occurs at each surface sinusoidal substance exchange canalicular bile drainage intercellular cellcell attachment what do bile caniculi open into intrahepatic bile ductules canals of hering what do intrahepatic bile ductules canals of hering open into interlobular bile ducts what do interlobular bile ducts open into left and right hepatic ducts what do left and right hepatic ducts open into common hepatic duct what do common hepatic duct open into what accompanies it common bile duct cystic duct what disorder can occur in the liver cirrhosis what are the 2 functions of gall bladder stores and concentrates bile release bile into duodenum does the gall bladder mucosa have a muscularis mucosa submucosa what is a discontinuous layer of the galbladder which layer is extensive what outer lining does it have where it is attached to the liver nope no thin muscularis externa the serosa adventitia what epithelium is associated with the mucosa of the gallbladder is it flat what organelle is present in high quantites what separates the muscousas lumen from its lateral intercellular spaces what gets pumped into the lateral intracellular spaces by gallbladder cells simple columnar epithelium w microvilli  no it has numerous folds mitochondria concentration apical junctional complexes na and cl and water follows what are the names of the spherical gaps that form in the submucosa of the gallbladder rokitanskyaschoff sinuses ras
