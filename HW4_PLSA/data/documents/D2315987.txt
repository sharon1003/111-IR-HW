what is obesity obesity is one of the most pervasive chronic diseases in need of new strategies for medical treatment and prevention as a leading cause of united states mortality morbidity disability healthcare utilization and healthcare costs the high prevalence of obesity continues to strain the united states healthcare system obesity is defined as excess adipose tissue there are several different methods for determining excess adipose fat tissue the most common being the body mass index bmi see below a fat cell is an endocrine cell and adipose tissue is an endocrine organ as such adipose tissue secretes a number of products including metabolites cytokines lipids and coagulation factors among others significantly excess adiposity or obesity causes increased levels of circulating fatty acids and inflammation this can lead to insulin resistance which in turn can lead to type 2 diabetes the biology of food intake is very complex involving olfaction smell taste texture temperature cognitive and emotional responses and metabolicautonomic information which signal the brain to initiate or cease eating recent scientific studies have identified several substances that act on the brain to signal a need for an increase in food intake likewise several substances have been identified that signal the brain to decrease food intake obesity is a disease that affects more than onethird of the u s adult population approximately 786 million americans the number of americans with obesity has steadily increased since 1960 a trend that has slowed in recent years but shows no sign of reversing today 69 percent of u s adults are categorized as being affected by obesity or having excess weight according to the cdc an estimated 112000 excess deaths per year are associated with obesity obesity puts individuals at risk for more than 30 chronic health conditions they include type 2 diabetes high cholesterol hypertension gallstones heart disease fatty liver disease sleep apnea gerd stress incontinence heart failure degenerative joint disease birth defects miscarriages asthma and other respiratory conditions and numerous cancers the healthcare costs of american adults with obesity amount to approximately 190 billion per year discrimination and mistreatment of person with obesity is widespread and sadly often considered socially acceptable obesity is increasing around the world high body mass index now ranks with major global health problems such as childhood and maternal undernutrition high blood pressure high cholesterol unsafe sex iron deficiency smoking alcohol and unsafe water in total global burden of disease for people with obesity weight loss based solely on lifestyle changes can be very difficult to achieve and even more challenging to maintain supporting strategies such as obesity medications can be important tools for effectively treating obesity in some individuals given the complex nature of the disease no single drug is likely to fix the epidemic additional research and development efforts are needed for obesity treatments – as there are more than 100 drugs available for related diseases like hypertension but only 6 medications approved for the longterm treatment of obesity what is bmi body mass index bmi is a mathematical calculation involving height and weight irrespective of family history gender age or race bmi is calculated by dividing a persons body weight in kilograms by their height in meters squared weight kg height m2 or by using the conversion with pounds lbs and inches in squared as shown below this number can be misleading however for very muscular people or for pregnant or lactating women weight lbs ÷ height in2  x 7045 bmi bmi calculator the bmi cutoffs are below 185 underweight 185249 normal weight 245299 overweight 30 and greater obese 40 and greater morbid or extreme obesity bmi is frequently used in population studies because of its ease of determination and wellsupported association with mortality and health effects however other measures of excess adipose tissue such as waist circumference waisttohip ratio and others are also used individuals may need to use additional factors to assess their individual risk including family history level of physical activity smoking and dietary habits waist circumference waist circumference is another widely used measurement to determine abdominal fat content an excess of abdominal fat when out of proportion to total body fat is considered a predictor of risk factors related to obesity men with a waist measurement exceeding 40 inches are considered at risk women are at risk with a waist measurement of 35 inches or greater references1 ogden cl carroll md mc dowell ma flegal km obesity among adults in
