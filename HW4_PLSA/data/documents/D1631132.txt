may29constitutional law  doctrine of colorable legislation and the constitution of india introduction doctrine of colorable legislation like any other constitutional law doctrine is a tool devised and applied by the supreme court of india to interpret various constitutional provisions it is a guiding principle of immense utility while construing provisions relating to legislative competence before knowing what this doctrine is and how it is applied in india let us first understand the genesis of doctrine of colorable legislation doctrine of colorable legislation is built upon the founding stones of the doctrine of separation of power separation of power mandates that a balance of power is to be struck between the different components of the state ie between the legislature the executive and the judiciary the primary function of the legislature is to make laws whenever legislature tries to shift this balance of power towards itself then the doctrine of colorable legislation is attracted to take care of legislative accountability definition black’s law dictionary defines ‘ colorable ’ as1 appearing to be true valid or right2 intended to deceive counterfeit3 ‘ color ’ has been defined to mean ‘ appearance guise or semblance’ the literal meaning of colorable legislation is that under the ‘ color ’ or ‘ guise ’ of power conferred for one particular purpose the legislature cannot seek to achieve some other purpose which it is otherwise not competent to legislate on this doctrine also traces its origin to a latin maxim“quando aliquid prohibetur ex directo prohibetur et per obliquum”this maxim implies that “ when anything is prohibited directly it is also prohibited indirectly ” in common parlance it is meant to be understood as “ whatever legislature can’t do directly it can’t do indirectly ” in our constitution this doctrine is usually applied to article 246 which has demarcated the legislative competence of the parliament and the state legislative assemblies by outlining the different subjects under list i for the union list ii for the states and list iii for both as mentioned in the seventh schedule this doctrine comes into play when a legislature does not possess the power to make law upon a particular subject but nonetheless indirectly makes one by applying this principle the fate of the impugned legislation is decided supreme court on colorable legislation one of the most cogent and lucid explanations relating to this doctrine was given in the case of k c gajapati narayana deo and other v the state of orissa 1“if the constitution of a state distributes the legislative powers amongst different bodies which have to act within their respective spheres marked out by specific legislative entries or if there are limitations on the legislative authority in the shape of fundamental rights questions do arise as to whether the legislature in a particular case has or has not in respect to the subjectmatter of the statute or in the method of enacting it transgressed the limits of its constitutional powers such transgression may be patent manifest or direct but it may also be disguised covert and indirect and it is to this latter class of cases that the expression ‘ colorable legislation’ has been applied in certain judicial pronouncements the idea conveyed by the expression is that although apparently a legislature in passing a statute purported to act within the limits of its powers yet in substance and in reality it transgressed these powers the transgression being veiled by what appears on proper examination to be a mere presence or disguise ”this doctrine is also called as “ fraud on the constitution ” the failure to comply with a constitutional condition for the exercise of legislative power may be overt or it may be covert when it is overt we say the law is obviously bad for non compliance with the requirements of the constitution that is to say the law is ultra vires when however the noncompliance is covert we say that it is a ‘fraud on the constitution’ the fraud complained of being that the legislature pretends to act within its power while in fact it is not so doing therefore the charge of ‘fraud on the constitution’ is on ultimate analysis nothing but a picturesque and epigrammatic way of expressing the idea of noncompliance with the terms of the constitution 2 limitations on the application of doctrine of colorable legislation1 the doctrine has no application where the powers of a legislature are not fettered by any constitutional limitation2 the doctrine is also not applicable to subordinate legislation3 the doctrine of colourable legislation does not involve any question of bona fides or mala fides on the part of the legislature the whole doctrine resolves itself into the question of competency of a particular legislature to enact a particular law if the legislature is competent to pass a particular law the motives which impelled it to act are really irrelevant on the other hand if the legislature lacks competency the question of motive does not arise at all whether a statute is constitutional or not is thus always a question of power 34 a logical corollary of the abovementioned point is that the legislature does not act on extraneous considerations 4 there is always a presumption of constitutionality in favour of the statute the principle of presumption of constitutionality was succinctly enunciated by a constitutional bench in ram krishna dalmia v shri justice s r tendolkar and ors 5“that there is always a presumption in favour of the constitutionality of an enactment and the burden is upon him who attacks it to show that there has been a clear transgression of the constitutional principles”there is a very famous rule of interpretation as well that explains why the courts strongly lean against a construction which reduces the statute to a futility the latin maxim “ construction ut res magis valeat quam pereat” implies that a statute or any enacting provision therein must be so construed as to make it effective and operative the courts prefer construction which keeps the statute within the competence of the legislature 65 when a legislature has the power to make law with respect to a particular subject it also has all the ancillary and incidental power to make that law an effective one 76 as already discussed above that the transgression of constitutional power by legislature may be patent manifest or direct but may also be disguised covert and indirect and it is only to this latter class of cases that the expression “colorable legislation” is being applied 8previous doctrine of waiver and the constitution of india previous doctrine of severability and the constitution of india previous
