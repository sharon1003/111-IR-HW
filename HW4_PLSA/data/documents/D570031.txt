bias is the lack of internal validity or incorrect assessment of the association between an exposure and an effect in the target population in which the statistic estimated has an expectation that does not equal the true value biases can be classified by the research stage in which they occur or by the direction of change in a estimate the most important biases are those produced in the definition and selection of the study population data collection and the association between different determinants of an effect in the population a definition of the most common biases occurring in these stages is given view full texthttpdxdoiorg101136jech2003008466the concept of bias is the lack of internal validity or incorrect assessment of the association between an exposure and an effect in the target population in contrast external validity conveys the meaning of generalisation of the results observed in one population to others there is not external validity without internal validity but the presence of the second does not guarantee the first bias should be distinguished from random error or lack of precision sometimes the term bias is also used to refer to the mechanism that produces lack of internal validity 1biases can be classified by the direction of the change they produce in a parameter for example the odds ratio or toward the null bias or negative bias yields estimates closer to the null value for example lower and closer or to 1 whereas away from the null bias produces the opposite higher estimates than the true ones an exaggeration of these biases can induce a switchover bias or change of the direction of association for example a true or 1 becomes 1 2there are several classifications of bias sackett 3 and choi 4 classified biases according to the stages of research that can occur reading up on the field specification and selection the study sample execution of the experimental manoeuvre measurement of exposuresoutcomes data analysis results interpretation and publication maclure and schneeweiss 5 applying the causal diagram theory offered an interesting explanation of the main sources of bias kleinbaum et al 2 based on olli s miettinen’s ideas classified biases in three main groups selection bias information bias and confounding steineck and ahlbom 6 based on the miettinen’s concept of study base considered in this order confounding misclassification similar to information bias misrepresentation which has a narrower meaning than selection bias and analysis deviation steineck and ahlbom keep confounding apart from biases in the statistical analysis as it typically occurs when the actual study base differs from the “ideal” study base in which there is no association between different determinants of an effect the same idea can be found in maclure and schneeweiss 5in this glossary definitions of the most common biases we have not been exhaustive in defining all the existing biases are given within the simple classification by kleinbaum et al 2 we have added a point for biases produced in a trial in the execution of the intervention biases in data interpretation writing and citing will not be discussed see for a description of them by sackett 3 and choi 4  biases in data analysis are very numerous but they are easily solved using appropriate procedures they are not commented on in this glossary unless a particular bias has an additional influence this occurs with post hoc analysis that may lead to a publication bias when significant results are more frequently reported confounding bias is kept apart from biases in data analysis according to the ideas of steineck and ahlbom 6 and maclure and schneeweiss 5  table 1 gives an alphabetical list of biases the type of bias and the design affected is also given view inline view popup table 1 alphabetical list of biases indicating their type and the design where they can occur1 selection biasthe error introduced when the study population does not represent the target population 7 8 selection bias can be controlled when the variables influencing selection are measured on all study subjects and either a they are antecedents of both exposure and outcome or b the joint distribution of these variables plus exposure and outcome is known in the whole target population or c the selection probabilities for each level of these variables are known 9 it can be introduced at any stage of a research study 7 design bad definition of the eligible population lack of accuracy of sampling frame uneven diagnostic procedures in the target population and implementation11 inappropriate definition of the eligible population in any kind of design ascertainment bias can occur it is produced when the kind of patients gathered does not represent the cases originated in the population 4 see pollock et al 10 for an illustration it may be produced among many possibilities by healthcare access bias lengthbiased sampling neyman bias competing risks or survivor treatment selection bias in studies on evaluation of a diagnostic test the spectrum bias is a kind of ascertainment bias the definitions of these biases in alphabetical order are the following competing risks when two or more outputs are mutually exclusive any of them competes with each other in the same subject it is more frequent when dealing with causes of death as any person only dies once the risk for a specific cause of death can be affected by an earlier one for example early death by aids can produce a decrease in liver failure mortality in parenteral drug users a proper analysis of this question should take into account the competing causes of death for instance estimating the probability of death by a specific cause of death if any other risk of death is removed the so called net probability of death 11 12healthcare access bias when the patients admitted to an institution do not represent the cases originated in the community this may be due to the own institution if admission is determined by the interest of health personnel on certain kind of cases  popularity bias  3 to the patients if they are attracted by the prestige of certain clinicians  centripetal bias  3 to the healthcare organisation if it is organised in increasing levels of complexity primary secondary and tertiary care and “difficult” cases are referred to tertiary care  referral filter bias  3 to a web of causes if patients by cultural geographical or economic reasons show a differential degree of access to an institution  diagnostictreatment access bias  3lengthbias sampling cases with diseases with long duration are more easily included in surveys this series may not represent the cases originated in the target population 13 these cases usually have a better prognosis neyman bias synonyms incidenceprevalence bias selective survival bias when a series of survivors is selected if the exposure is related to prognostic factors or the exposure itself is a prognostic determinant the sample of cases offers a distorted frequency of the exposure 14 this bias can occur in both cross sectional and prevalent casecontrol studies lets suppose that a casecontrol study is carried out to study the relation between tobacco smoking and acute myocardial infarction ami being cases interviewed one week after the coronary attack if smoker patients with ami die more frequently the leaving cases will show lower frequency of smoking undervaluing the association between smoking and ami it has been shown that the bias occurs only if the risk factor influences mortality from the disease being studied 15spectrum bias in the assessment of validity of a diagnostic test this bias is produced when researchers included only “clear” or “definite” cases not representing the whole spectrum of disease presentation andor “clear” or healthy controls subjects not representing the conditions in which a differential diagnosis should be carried out sensitivity and specificity of a diagnostic test are increased 16 a particular case is the purity diagnostic bias when selecting cases of a certain disease those with other comorbidities are excluded and the final sample does not represent the cases originated 3survivor treatment selection bias in observational studies patients who live longer have more probability to receive a certain treatment a retrospective analysis can therefore yield a positive association between that treatment and survival 17in occupational studies a bad definition albeit unavoidable of eligible population frequently occurs it is produced by the healthy worker effect the lower mortality observed in the employed population when compared with the general population furthermore those who remain employed tend to be healthier than those who leave employment 18inadequate definition of the eligible population can happen frequently in casecontrol studies where several specific biases have been described regarding the selection of the reference population controls the most common are in alphabetical order berkson’s bias first described by berkson in 1946 for casecontrol studies 19 it is produced when the probability of hospitalisation of cases and controls differ and it is also influenced by the exposure see feinstein et al 20 and flanders et al 21 for a discussion and solution exclusion bias when controls with conditions related to the exposure are excluded whereas cases with these diseases as comorbidities are kept in the study this was the explanation given for the association between reserpine and breast cancer controls with cardiovascular disease a common comorbidity and related to the use of reserpine were excluded but this criterion was not applied to cases thus yielding a spurious association between reserpine and breast cancer 22friend control bias it was assumed that the correlation in exposure status between cases and their friend controls lead to biased estimates of the association between exposure and outcome in a matched study with a matched analysis there is no bias if the exposure induced risks of disease are constant over time and there are not gregarious subjects individuals elected by more than one case 23inclusion bias produced in hospital based casecontrol studies when one or more conditions of controls are related with the exposure the frequency of exposure is higher than expected in the reference group producing a toward the null bias 1matching it is well known that matching either individual or frequency matching introduces a selection bias which is controlled for by appropriate statistical analysis matched analysis in studies with individual matching and adjusting for the variables used to match in frequency matching overmatching is produced when researchers match by a nonconfounding variable associated to the exposure but not to the disease and can underestimate an association 1relative control bias it was assumed that the correlation in exposure status between cases and their relative controls yield biased estimates of the association between exposure and outcome in a matched study with a matched analysis there is no bias if the exposure induced risks of disease are constant over time 24in systematic reviews and metaanalyses language bias is a kind of inappropriate definition of the eligible population the reports studying the relevant topic in systematic reviews and metaanalysis it has been common to exclude reports in other languages than english egger et al 25 showed that there was a trend to publish in english compared with german when the results achieved statistical significance later on the same group found that language bias has in general little effect on summary effect estimates 2612 lack of accuracy of sampling frame the most common bias in this group is nonrandom sampling bias obviously this selection procedure can yield a nonrepresentative sample in which a parameter estimate differs from the existing at the target population 4 a particular case of this bias is telephone random sampling bias it excludes some households from the sample thus producing a coverage bias in the us it has been shown that the differences between participants and nonparticipants are generally not large 27 but the situation can be very different in less developed countries in systematic reviews and metaanalyses focused only in published reports the most important selection biases are publication bias and other biases influencing the identification of relevant studies citation bias and dissemination bias citation bias articles more frequently cited are more easily found and included in systematic reviews and metaanalysis citation is closely related to the impact factor of the publishing journal 28 in certain fields citation has been related to statistical significance 29dissemination bias the biases associated to the whole publication process from biases in the retrieval of information including language bias to the way the results are reported 30post hoc analysis the fishing expeditions with data dredging originates post hoc questions and subgroup analysis with misleading results 4 given that the reports based on post hoc analysis are frequently reported when significant results are observed this bias is relevant for metaanalysis of published studies as a form of publication selection bias publication bias regarding an association that is produced when the published reports do not represent the studies carried out on that association several factors have been found to influence publication the most important being statistical significance size of the study funding prestige type of design and study quality 3113 uneven diagnostic procedures in the target population in casecontrol studies if exposure influences the diagnosis of the disease detection bias occurs particular types of this bias are exposure can be taken as another diagnostic criterion  diagnostic suspicion bias  3 exposure can trigger the search for the disease for instance benign anal lesions increases the diagnosis of anal cancer 32 exposure may produce a symptomsign that favours diagnosis  unmaskingdetection signalbias 3 or a benign condition close clinically to the disease  mimicry bias  3 in other designs such as cohort studies detection bias is an information bias14 during study implementation the three most common biases at this stage are losses to follow up missing information in multivariable analysis and nonresponse bias losseswithdrawals to follow up in both cohort and experimental studies when losseswithdrawals are uneven in both the exposure and outcome categories the validity of the statistical results may be affected 33missing information in multivariable analysis multivariable analysis selects records with complete information on the variables included in the model if participants with complete information do not represent the target population it can introduce a selection bias 7 this bias is relevant in studies mainly retrospective using data from the clinical chart in which patients with more complete data have more severe diseases or stay longer at hospital or both nonresponse bias when participants differ from nonparticipants for example melton et al 34 the healthy volunteer effect is a particular case when the participants are healthier than the general population 35 this is particularly relevant when a diagnostic manoeuvre such as a screening test is evaluated in the general population producing an away from the null bias thus the benefit of the intervention is spuriously increased2 information biasinformation bias occurs during data collection the three main types of information bias are misclassification bias ecological fallacy and regression to the mean other information biases are also described21 misclassification bias it is originated when sensitivity andor specificity of the procedure to detect exposure andor effect is not perfect that is exposeddiseased subjects can be classified as nonexposednondiseased and vice versa 36 given that perfect tools to gather data are very uncommon most studies must assume a certain degree of misclassification random error also can produce it 37 this implies that random errors in data entrycapture missing data end digit preference rounding to 5 or 0 frequently unavoidable also introduce misclassification there are two major types of misclassification bias differential misclassification bias when misclassification is different in the groups to be compared for example in a casecontrol study the recalled exposure is not the same for cases and controls the estimate is biased in either direction toward the null or away from the null 36nondifferential misclassification bias when the misclassification is the same across the groups to be compared for example exposure is equally misclassified in cases and controls for binary variables the estimate is biased toward the null value 36 however for variables with more than two categories polytomous this rule may not hold and an away from the null bias can be obtained 38the most common biases producing misclassification are the following detection bias in studies with follow up cohorts clinical trials is an information bias observerinterviewer bias the knowledge of the hypothesis the disease status or the exposure status including the intervention received can influence data recording  observer expectation bias  3 the means by which interviewers can introduce error into a questionnaire include administering the interview or helping the respondents in different ways even with gestures putting emphases in different questions and so on 39 a particular situation is when the measure of an exposure influences its value for example blood pressure  apprehension bias  3recall bias if the presence of disease influences the perception of its causes  rumination bias 3 or the search for exposure to the putative cause  exposure suspicion bias  3 or in a trial if the patient knows what they receive may influence their answers  participant expectation bias  3 this bias is more common in casecontrol studies in which participants know their diseases although it can occur in cohort studies for example workers who known their exposure to hazardous substances may show a trend to report more the effects related to them and trials without participants’ blinding 40reporting bias participants can “collaborate” with researchers and give answers in the direction they perceive are of interest  obsequiousness bias  3 or the existence of a case triggers family information  family aggregation bias  see khoury et al 41 for an example measures or sensitive questions that embarrass or hurt can be refused  unacceptable diseaseexposure  3 underreporting bias is common with socially undesirable behaviours such as alcohol consumption 42 the mode for mean bias occurs when frequencyquantity questionnaires are used to assess consumption of alcohol and foods subjects tend to report modal rather than average behaviour hence with data skewed towards zero the average intakes are underestimated leading to overestimation of the gradient with risk 43the last three biases can be reduced using blinding a procedure by which subjects ignore some important aspects of a research to avoid differential misclassification bias in trials blinding means that participants do not know the intervention they receive participants blinding andor observers do not know the intervention received by participants observer blinding andor data analysts do not know the labels of the groups to be compared 44 in observational research observer blinding can rarely be applied with the same goal of trials but more frequently observers and participants are blind to the main hypotheses and related questions of a research22 ecological fallacy it is a bias produced when analyses realised in an ecological group level analysis are used to make inferences at the individual level for instance if exposure and disease are measured at the group level for example exposure prevalence and disease risk in each country exposuredisease relations can be biased from those obtained at the individual level for example exposure status and disease status in each subject ecological fallacy can be produced by within group individual level biases such as confounding selection bias or misclassification and by confounding by group or effect modification by group 45 effect modification by group on an additive scale is produced when the rate difference for the exposure effect changes across communities 45 for example lets suppose three groups with exposure prevalences of 35 50 and 65 a similar rate of disease in the nonexposed of 100100 000 and rates of disease in the exposed of 286 200 and 154100 000 in this example the rate difference in each group is positive the exposure increases the risk of the disease although an ecological analysis do find a negative relation23 regression to the mean it is the phenomenon that a variable that shows an extreme value on its first assessment will tend to be closer to the centre of its distribution on a later measurement 46 this bias is relevant when the efficacy of a treatment to reduce high levels of a variable for example cholesterol is assessed when researchers are interested in the relation between the initial value of a variable and the change in that measurement over time or when two methods of measurement are compared 47 the two usual ways of neutralising this bias are with the existence of an appropriate reference group and a selection based on more than one measurement the regression dilution bias is related to the regression to the mean this bias is produced in longitudinal studies analysing baseline determinations of a continuous variable such as diastolic blood pressure dbp to an outcome for example stroke baseline dbp measurements randomly fluctuates among individuals because of two reasons variations in the measurement process and temporary deviations at the baseline determination from the usual dbp level this underestimates the real association between exposure and outcome because extreme categories include more people than they should that is the bottom category of baseline dbp has more people whose dbp level is somewhat lower than their usual dbp whereas the top category of dbp includes more subjects with higher baseline dbp than their usual dbp level 4824 other information biases hawthorne effect described in the 1920s in the hawthorne plant of the western electric company chicago il it is an increase in productivity—or other outcome under study—in participants who are aware of being observed 49 for example laboratory physicians increase their agreement rate after knowing that they participate in a research on reliability of diagnostic tests 50lead time bias the added time of illness produced by the diagnosis of a condition during its latency period this bias is relevant in the evaluation of the efficacy of screening in which the cases detected in the screened group has a longer duration of disease than those diagnosed in the nonscreened one 51protopathic bias when a exposure is influenced by early subclinical stages of disease for instance preclinical pancreatic cancer can produce diabetes mellitus and thus an association between diabetes and cancer can occur 52 it is also produced when a pharmaceutical agent is prescribed for an early manifestation of a disease that has not been yet diagnosed 53 the sick quitter bias is related to protopathic bias people with risky behaviours such as heavy alcohol consumption quit their habit as a consequence of disease 54 studies analysing current behaviour as a risk factor will labelled them as nonexposed thus underestimating the true association temporal ambiguity when it cannot be established that exposure precedes effect it is common in cross sectional and ecological studies 1will rogers phenomenon named in honour of the philosopher will rogers by feinstein et al 55 the improvement in diagnostic tests refines disease staging in diseases such as cancer this produces a stage migration from early to more advances stages and an apparent higher survival this bias is relevant when comparing cancer survival rates across time or even among centres with different diagnostic capabilities for example tertiary compared with primary care hospitals work up bias verification bias in the assessment of validity of a diagnostic test it is produced when the execution of the gold standard is influenced by the results of the assessed test typically the reference test is less frequently performed when the test result is negative 16 56 this bias is aggravated when the clinical characteristics of a disease influence in the test results 573 confoundingit occurs when a variable is a risk factor for an effect among nonexposed persons and is associated with the exposure of interest in the population from which the effect derives without being affected by the exposure or the disease in particular without being an intermediate step in the causal pathway between the exposure and the effect 1 the counterfactual approach is the current procedure to explain confounding adequately 58 and causal diagrams help to identify it 59 confounding can occur in every epidemiological study susceptibility bias is a synonym when people who are particularly susceptible to development of a outcome are also prone to be exposed for example women with threatened abortion have a high probability of delivering a malformed fetus but also have a high probability of receiving hormone treatment this can yield a spurious association between hormones and congenital malformations 53confounding can be neutralised at the design stage of a research for example by matching or randomisation andor at the analysis given that the confounders have been measured properly misclassification of confounders hinders their control in analysis nondifferential misclassification of a binary confounder reduces the ability of analysis to control for the confounder 60 whereas this in a polytomous confounder can produce estimates biased in either direction 61 particular types of confounding bias are the following confounding by group it is produced in an ecological study when the exposure prevalence of each community group is correlated with the disease risk in nonexposed of the same community it can be a mechanism for producing ecological fallacy 45 for example lets suppose three communities a b c with prevalence exposures of 10 20 and 30 rates of disease in nonexposed of 2 3 and 4 and rates of disease in the exposed of 2 3 4 respectively there is no association between the exposure and the disease as the three relative risks are one although an ecological analysis regressing the rate of disease on the prevalence of exposure does find a positive association confounding by indication this is produced when an intervention treatment is indicated by a perceived high risk poor prognosis or simply some symptoms here the confounder is the indication as it is related to the intervention and is a risk indicator for the disease 62 for example in the study of the association between cimetidine and gastric cancer the indication peptic ulcer is considered the potential confounder 63 this kind of bias occurs in observational studies mainly retrospective analysing interventions sometimes confounding by indication is mistaken for protopathic bias4 specific biases in trialsallocation of intervention bias when intervention is differentially assigned to the population it is more common in nonrandomised trials in randomised trials it is recommended concealment of the allocation sequence of intervention 64 if the sequence is known in advance may produce selection bias it has been shown that trials in which concealment was unclear or inadequate compared with trials with adequate concealment report larger estimates of treatment effects 65compliance bias in trials requiring adherence to intervention the degree of adherence compliance influences efficacy assessment of the intervention for example when high risk patients quit exercise programmes 3contamination bias when interventionlike activities find their way into the control group it biases the estimate of the intervention effect toward the null hypothesis 66 it occurs more frequently in community intervention trials because of the relationships among members of different communities and interference by mass media health professionals etc differential maturing in group randomised trials differential maturing reflects uneven secular trends among the groups in the trial favouring one condition or another 66lack of intention to treat analysis in randomised studies the analysis should be done keeping participants in the group they were assigned to the goals of randomisation are to avoid confounding and selection bias if noncompliant participants or those receiving a wrong intervention are excluded from the analysis the branches of a randomised trial may not be comparable there are exceptions to the rule of intention to treat analysis 67references↵ rothman k greenland s modern epidemiology 2nd ed boston lippiconttraven 1998 google scholar↵ kleinbaum dg kupper ll morgenstern h epidemiologic research belmont ca
