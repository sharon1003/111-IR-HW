los angeles angels milestones records albert pujols will now never reach josh schoch august 19 2013albert pujols is no longer the threetime mvp who took major league baseball by storm and things got even worse on monday it turns out that he is done for the year according to the official twitter feed of the los angeles angels of anaheim injury update albert pujols will be shut down for the remainder of the season due to the tear in the plantar fascia in his left foot— los angeles angels angels august 19 2013things have been getting worse and worse for pujols since he left the st louis cardinals in favor of the angels and now things have hit an alltime low as i wrote last month pujols struggles have been a direct result of his slowing bat speed his career lows in batting average onbase percentage slugging ops home runs and more are because he cant turn on pitches like he used to which is why his days as a slugger are numbered—and its not a large number pujols was once the most feared hitter in baseball and it appeared that he could break record after record those days are now behind us so lets take a look at the records pujols will no longer be able to break records held1 of 6while there are a ton of records pujols can no longer break its worth noting the ones that he currently holds most rbi by an nl rookie 130 2001most extrabase hits by a rookie 83 2001assists first baseman season 185 2009consecutive seasons of 30 or more home runs from start of career 12consecutive seasons of 30 home runs 100 rbi and 300 batting average from start of career 10most home runs in first 3 seasons 114 200103 tied with ralph kinermost home runs in first 9 seasons 366 200109most home runs in first 10 seasons 408 200110most home runs in first 11 seasons 445 200111records courtesy of baseballreference batting average by an angels player2 of 6record 319 vladimir guerreropujols 275what makes pujols so special is that he is not just a power bat but that he is an incredible contact hitter as well however since going to the west coast pujols has struggled with his batting average with the angels being 46 points below his career average of 321 when pujols came to l a it looked like he would have no problem surpassing guerrero but now it would take a superhuman effort to pass him which is too much to ask of an aging declining star most home runs by an angels players3 of 6record 299 tim salmonpujols 47when pujols signed his 10year contract it seemed like a done deal that he would break tim salmons record of 299 home runs as an angel after all he had never hit less than 32 home runs in a season and he even reached 49 in 2006 pujols was the best power hitter in the game and giving him 10 years to hit 300 home runs seemed all too easy even with his eventual decline seeing a progression like this one wouldnt be farfetched at all 40403836353532322925 that comes out to 342 home runs which would blow salmons record away however at just 47 home runs through two seasons pujols decline hit him early and theres no way hell average 30 home runs over his 10 years in l a slugging by an angels player4 of 6record 546 vladimir guerreropujols 485a 546 slugging percentage no problem for the 200110 version of pujols who blew that mark away in each of his first 10 seasons in the big leagues for the 2013 pujols maybe if you shave off about 100 points after slugging 437 this season pujols has been unable to consistently deliver extrabase hits and coupling that with his rapidly decreasing batting average is a recipe for disaster career rbi5 of 6record 2297 hank aaronpujols 1498pujols sits a mere 800 rbi behind the great hank aaron for career rbi and a few years ago it seemed like he would shatter that record after the 2010 season pujols sat at 1230 rbi he was averaging 123 rbi per year and would need just 867 more seasons to break the record even with his eventual decline it seemed that he would shatter the record as he was just 30 years old and had another decade of baseball left in him being joined by mike trout and josh hamilton in l a was supposed to help but hamilton and pujols have both struggled and pujols has knocked in just 268 rbi in the past three years combined because of it thats a far cry from the 369 hed have if he kept up his pace through the first 10 years of his career even if he plays until hes 40 pujols will not be as effective as he once was and his pace over the past three years will leave him behind aaron career home runs6 of 6record 762 barry bondspujols 492we all thought that we might have a home run king who wouldnt have an asterisk next to his name when pujols surpassed barry bonds but instead that wont happen anytime soon pujols hit 408 home runs through his first 10 seasons and it looked like hed only need 355 over the last 10 to 14 years of his career which could have easily been within his grasp unfortunately pujols home run numbers havent just declined but have dropped off of a cliff hes barely even considered a power hitter anymore and if he dips any further it will be interesting to see if he can even reach 600 home runs follow josh schoch comments
