seed moisture testing the seed moisture content mc is the amount of water in the seed it is usually expressed as a percentage on wet weight basis in any seedtesting laboratory the seed moisture content is the most vital parameter which influence the seed quality and storage life of the seed seed moisture content is closely associated with several aspects of physiological seed quality for example it is related to seed maturity optimum harvest time mechanical damage economics of artificial seed drying seed longevity and insect  pathogen infestation objective the objective is to determine the moisture content of seed by methods suitable for routine use definition the moisture content of seed sample is the loss in weight when it is dried in accordance with 1sta rules it is expressed as a percentage of the weight of the original sample principle the methods prescribed are designed to reduce oxidation decomposition or the loss of other volatile substances while ensuring the removal of as much moisture as possible seed ageing and loss of seed germination seed ageing and loss of germination cannot be stopped but can be minimized by proper seed storage conditions the important environmental factors influencing germination loss are relative humidity rh governs the seed moisture and temperature higher are these the more rapid is the seed deterioration the effects of seed moisture and temperatures are summarized succinctly in harringtons rules as under1 for every decrease of 1 percent in seed moisture content the life of seed is doubled2 for every decrease of 5°c in storage temperature the life of the seed is doubled rule 1holds good when the seed moisture content is between14 and 5 percent when these two simple rules are applied the effects are geometric determination of seed moisture content as seed moisture and its management influences so many physiological seed quality parameters essential to seed quality seed moisture measurement appropriate to the purpose is needed in commerce and research the optimum method for moisture testing depends upon1 chemical composition of seed2 seed structure3 moisture content level4 degree of accuracy and precision required5 constraints of time6 technical expertise and cost the ideal could be that is adopted to all seeds measures moisture content from 0 to100 percent reproducible require less training and low in cost it is impossible to combine all these however in order to measure the moisture content of seeds methods can be broadly grouped in two categoriesa direct methodb indirect method direct method under this category the seed moisture content is measured directly by loss or gain in seed weight these are1 desiccation method2 phosphorus pentaoxide method3 ovendrying method4 vacuum drying method5 distillation method6 karl fishers method7 direct weighing balance8 microwave oven method indirect method these are no so accurate estimation is approximate but convenient and quick in use these are frequently used at seed processing plants these measure other physical parameters like electrical conductivity or electrical resistance of the moisture present in the seed values are measured with the help of seed moisture meters and these values are transformed into seed moisture content with the help of calibration charts for each species against standard airoven method or basic reference method above all karlfishers method has been considered as the most accurate and the basic reference method for standardizing other methods of seed moisture determination the constant temperature oven drying method is the only practical method approved by international seed testing association ista and other organization to be used for routine seed moisture determination in a seedtesting laboratory constant temperature oven drying method the constant temperature oven drying method is broadly grouped into two categories1 low constant temperature oven method2 high constant temperature oven method low constant temperature oven method this method has been recommended for seed of the species rich in oil content or volatile substances table i in this method the pre weighed moisture bottles along with seed material are placed in an oven maintaining a temperature of 103°c seeds are dried at this temperature for 171hr the relative humidity of the ambient air in the laboratory must be less than 70 percent when the moisture determination is carried out high constant temperature oven method the procedure is the same as above except that the oven is maintained at a temperature of 130°133°c the sample is dried to a period of four hours for zea mays two hours for other cereals and one hour for other species see also table2 in this method there is no special requirement pertaining to the relative humidity of the ambient air in the laboratory during moisture determination essential equipments and supplies1 constant temperature precision hotair electric

steel brush period of seed drying the prescribed period of seed drying shall be17  1 hrs at 103°c under low constant and 1 to 4 hrs at 130°133°c under high constant temperatures maize seed be dried for 4 hrs cereals andor other millets for 2 hrs and the remaining species for 1 hr seeds rich in oil content or with volatile substances be dried for 17 hrs under low constant temperature see drying period begins from the time oven returns to maintain the desired temperatures sample size the ista rules recommend that two replicates each with 4 gm of seed be used for determination of seed moisture content this seed sample weight may be modified to 02 to 05 gm per replicate with precise weighing for use in seed genebanks to avoid unnecessary depletion of precious biological resources procedure1 seed moisture determination be carried out in duplicate on two independentlydrawn working samples2 weigh each bottle with an accuracy of 1 mg or 01 mg3 first weigh the empty bottlecontainer with its cover4 grind the seed material if need be in seed species listed in table 3 evenlyusing any grindergrinding mill that does not cause heating andor loss ofmoisture content5 mix thoroughly the submitted sample using spoon and transfer small portions 4 to 5 gm of seed samples directly into weighing bottlescontainers by evendistribution on bottom of the containers6 after weighing remove the cover or lid of the weighing bottlescontainers7 place the weighing bottlescontainers in an oven already heated to ormaintaining the desired temperature for the recommended period8 at the end of seed drying period weighing bottlescontainers be closed with itslid  cover9 transfer the weighing bottlescontainers to the desiccators having silica gel selfindicating blue to cool down for 40 to 45 min10 weigh again the cooled weighing bottlescontainers11 calculate the seed moisture content calculation of results the moisture content as a percentage by weight fresh weight basis is calculated toone decimal place by using of the formulae m2m3age seed moisture content mc   x 100m2m1where m1  weight of the weighing bottlecontainer with cover in gm m2  weight of the weighing bottlecontainer with cover and seeds before drying m3  weight of the weighing bottlecontainer with cover and seeds after drying note the seed moisture determination must be done in two replicates with precise weighing ie up to three decimal places using lightweight weighing bottlescontainers if the seed is predried or dried in two steps the seed moisture content is calculated from the results obtained in the first predried and second stages of seed drying using the following formula and expressed as percentages as under s1  s2  si  s2age seed moisture content mc  100where s1 is the moisture loss in the first stage and s2 is the moisture loss in the second stage  use of tolerances result is the arithmetic mean of the duplicate determination of seed moisture contentfor a given seed sample the maximal difference of 02is recommended between two replicates for crop seed species under1sta rules if the difference between two replicates exceeds 02 the seed moisture determination in duplicate be repeated as it is very difficult rather impossible to meet the replicate difference of seed moisture up to 02in tree or shrub species maximal limit of 03to 25is recommended between two replicates for seed moisture in tree or shrub species under ista rules reporting of results seed moisture content be reported to the nearest 01 on1sta analysis certificate if the seed moisture content is determined using any moisture meter the brand name and type of the equipment be mention on the analysis certificate under column of other determinations reporting of range for which the moisture meter is calibrated is the another
