i os 81 on i phone 5s review by travis pope posted on 11102014unlike the huge changes that proceeded it with the i os 8 for i phone 5s update the i os 81 for i phone 5s doesn’t change a lot of things for i phone 5s users to be clear for owners of apple’s two latest i phones the updates changed everything this is the update that included the new apple pay mobile payments system since i phone 5s users will need an upcoming apple watch to use apple pay the i os 81 update is less exciting and less interesting for them read apple pay on i phone 5s not without an apple watch that doesn’t mean it’s any less needed though new features there’s no way around it i os 81 on the i phone 5s is a maintenance release i phone 5s owners won’t find that updating to the i os 81 is crucial for new features – unless they have an apple mac tooi os 81 adds a new camera roll area into the photos app for those that have the i cloud photo libraries enabled i cloud photo libraries are included in the update as an easy way to keep the pictures users care about available on whatever apple device they have things added to the i phone’s passbook app can be shared with other apple devices and there’s an option allowing i phone 5s owners to enable voice dictation for messaging without enabling siri i phone 5s owners can also manually set what type of mobile internet connection they’d like to be on for example 3g or lte are options that can be set directly from cellular network settings in the settings app i mentioned that i os 81 on the i phone 5s was crucial for those who own a mac that’s absolutely true because of continuity and some new messaging features on the same day as it first showed off i os 8 apple revealed mac os x yosemite yosemite is a software update for macs that allow i phone and i pad users to send messages and answer phone calls from across their apple devices continuity allows users to keep editing documents or browsing websites from any apple device i os 81 adds that functionality to the i phone 5s and includes some bug fixes for ensuring that messages are relayed between multiple apple devices correctly chances are that if you’re excited about i os 81 for the i phone 5s this is why bugs  issues chances are that the reasons users who are holding out on updating to i os 81 on the i phone 5s have nothing to do with features again it adds a few but none of them are exciting if you don’t have an apple device other than the i phone 5s those who haven’t upgraded to i os 81 are worried about bugs performance and battery life battery life never have i noticed i os 81 effect the amount of time i had with my i phone 5s typically my days start at 6 am it’s at that point that i first remove my i phone from its charger it doesn’t go back on that charger until late that night the i phone 5s with i os 81 doesn’t force me to change that routine battery life is about the same performance apps load just as fast as they did before on the i phone 5s with i os 81 and one problem that i did have with the lock screen taking a long time to let me in is fixed by this update with i os 8 the i phone 5s took about 5 seconds to let me in after i’d typed in my password or used the touch id fingerprint reader that’s no longer the case here quickly switching between apps is still a breeze and games perform just as well as they did before the update too every motion is fluid and every action in the i phone 5s’ touchscreen registers the way it should another thing i’ve noticed are big changes in the amount of time it takes for the camera app to be photo ready with i os 8 i’d have to wait a few seconds for the app to connect to the rearfacing camera and be ready for photo taking it may be a in my head but the amount of time the i phone 5s with i os 8 takes to setup for a photo feels alot shorter wifi and connectivity i’ve noticed no significant changes in my i phone’s call setup time or wireless internet performance bluetooth works as it always has too as far as i can tell apple seems to have not broken mobile internet connectivity in the same way it did for the i phone 6 and an earlier update to i os 8 is it worth downloading i os 81 on the i phone 5s earlier i mentioned that i os 81 isn’t a very exciting update it isn’t and it’s not intended to be apple wants you to download it because it’s trying to make the experience better based on feedback that being said if you weren’t a fan of i os 8 i os 81 isn’t going to sway you unless you’re anxious to send messages and place phone calls from your mac or i pad one thing i have noticed is that this update closes a loophole that allowed emulators to exist on the i phone if you’re big on playing games you already own through an emulator you’re going to one to hold off on i os 81 for the i phone 5s read i os 81 could kill emulators for goodi os 81 is available free now to all that have i os 8 updating is as simple as checking for any new software in the settings app
