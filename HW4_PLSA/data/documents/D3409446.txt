how to make crap feathers look great posted on may 7 2010 by missa not all feathers are created equal it’s unfortunate but it’s true you go to the craft store looking to feather your cap with some amazing lush plumage and you find yourself confronted with an array of vacuum sealed ostrich plumes straight out of flatland so what can you do here’s a really amazingly crap feather it came from a pound of ostrich drab seconds that i bought from ostriches online years ago a very crap flat feather here’s another feather… it also came from the exact same order of feathers ever ordered a pound of slightly defective feathers there’s a lot of feathers in a pound there’s the occasional gem but mostly what you’ve got is there because it wasn’t prime enough quality to be used as a single standout feather they’re meant to be used in bulk another crap feather but this one has been reworked somewhat so how do you make a really crap feather look like pretty great well… step 1 take off the frizzyuglies when you look at your crap feather you’ll see that the bottommost feathery bits are very short high quality lush feathers have longer feathery bits you can strip these off basically by grabbing and pulling them it really is that simple likewise high quality feathers done have weird stringy bits at the ends they are a nice spadelike shape from top top to bottomthe feather before trimmingand after now this is a much better looking feather i’ve cut off the stringy bits and it’s had the same effect as a god hair cut on a human head – suddenly what’s left looks fuller and oddly more natural the featherybits fronds look full from the spine to the end the shape is nice and the ends aren’t short and frizzy you should be aware that i’m ultimately using these feathers in showgirl headdresses for chicago the original stage musical version not like the movie precisely so they need to be tarted up if you similarly need to tart up a feather start by really accenting the spine…accent the spines with silver sharpies are cheap and work well if you’re really trying to tart them up add some glue on rhinestones… i love that trick now it’s time to really focus on the flatland aspect of the feather curl feathers with a 12 bore curling iron i’ve used a 12″ bore curling iron on this feather this isn’t a fancy specialized piece of equipment – i got at at a walgreens for 799 it’s meant for human hair i use the “high” setting for feathers i tried low but the feathers weren’t impressed the curling iron can also be used to curl the tip of the feather spine back smoothly if you’re working with a feather or two and you don’t want to fuss with a curling iron you can zip the bits of the feather over your thumb nail much as if you were working with curling ribbon if you’re working with a bulk of feathers and i have 6 headdresses with 6 large feathers each the iron is faster also repeated use of the curling ribbon trick tends to thin out the feather as stressed bits fall off bend the the spine into smooth curves without cracking it to make a proper “so heavy with featheryness i’m droopy” feather you need to bend the feather’s spine a bit i normally use both thumb nails for this but that’s very hard to take photos of when you don’t have the official beautiful assistant here’s the important thing to understand the spine or quill of a feather is hollow you’re not trying to break the spine just to compress it slightly if you hear a dry crack you’ve gone too far ideally if you bend the feather backwards over your twi thumb nails back to back and press the spine down with both index fingers you’ll feel it bend and give in an elastic sort of way as if there’s a little “squish” involved you can also use a butter knife if your thumbnails are pretty beaten down even if i gave you a video of this one it’s a completely tactile sensation so the video wouldn’t help trust me if you feel the spine compress stop you’re good and you should stop there if you go farther the spine will snap and you’ll hear a noise the feather will be fine for a while but eventually it will break finished feathers in a headdress here’s several of my crap feathers used in a headdress for the musical i’m working on these have been hair sprayed so they’ll keep their culr still not the perfect lush 12apop feathers that i’d really like don’t get me wrong… but they’re far closer than they started off share this email print facebook twitter pinterest google related knock me over with a feather july 20 2013in bloghow to make a show girl headdress june 7 2010in millinery1580s merchant august 22 1999in costumesthis entry was posted in millinery and tagged embellishment feathers hat making hats millinery bookmark the permalink
