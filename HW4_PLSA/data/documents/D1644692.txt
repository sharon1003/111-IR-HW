multiinstrumentalist in the rolling stones from their formation in 1962 until just a few weeks before his death in mid1969 he did not receive any individual songwriting credits for songs that the rolling stones recorded he did not sing lead vocals on any of their records and he was not a star guitar soloist nevertheless he is more famous than any of the rolling stones except mick jagger and keith richards and for good reasons his attitude and stage presence did a good deal to help define the rolling stones  image in the 1960s and his skills on a variety of instruments lent many of their records a diversity and eclecticism that the group would never match after his departure he also did a couple of littleknown recordings under his own name although those were ones in which he was a composer or a documentarian as opposed to a featured performer jones was already a rebel who embodied the more flamboyant aspects of the rolling stones  lifestyle even before the rolling stones formed as a teenager he got into trouble by fathering illegitimate children and despite his high iq he shunned academic studies in favor of his passions for playing jazz and blues in the early 1960s he was spotted by keith richards and mick jagger playing elmore james styled guitar while sitting in at an alexis korner gig jones moved to london and joined forces with richards and jagger to form a band the rolling stones who played their first shows in 1962 by most accounts jones a bit older than the others and more musically experienced was at this point the bands leader and most important musical force by the time they made their first single in 1963 the stones had settled into the fiveman lineup that would carry them through most of the 1960s in the first year or so of their recording career jones would continue to be the leader if anyone was keith richards was the bands lead guitarist but jones was less a rhythm guitarist than a second guitarist whose chords and riffs were counterpoints as much as support jones was also a good harmonica player who helped teach mick jagger how to play the instrument an excellent slide guitarist best heard on the stones  1964 british charttopper little red rooster and in the very early days a backup vocalist although he would rarely function in that role after the mid60s as the handsomest and most photogenic member of the group he was also important to their image and making the band commercially viable jones was so determined to think of himself as the stones  leader that he arranged to have himself paid five pounds more per week than the others for a while in 1963 which didnt go over well with the rest of the gang brian jones  influence in the rolling stones began to diminish in the mid60s when jagger and richards began to establish themselves as the bands songwriters jones probably contributed to the several early rolling stones originals that were credited to the group pseudonym of nankerphelge but he never did have a song that he wrote or cowrote under his own name recorded by the band as a womanizer and heavy substance sampler he helped set the pace for the stones  badboy persona but he also began to miss some performances and recording dates due to ill health and erratic behavior his truly important contributions to the band lay in his facilities for learning numerous instruments and adding unusual creative touches to stones recordings that gave them a pop appeal in the best sense these included the sitar on paint it black the dulcimer on lady jane the marimba on under my thumb the recorder on ruby tuesday the piano on lets spend the night together and the mellotron on 2000 light years from home jones did a couple of lowprofile solo projects one of which was not released until after his death he composed the soundtrack for the 1967 film a degree of murder starring his thengirlfriend anita pallenberg playing sitar organ dulcimer autoharp and harmonica he also recorded traditional moroccan musicians at the rites of pan festival in morocco in 1968 excerpts of these were released in 1971 as brian jones presents the pipes of pan at joujouka his interest in moroccan music in all probability influenced the stones  their satanic majesties request album which occasionally employed africanstyle percussion and flutes he was one of the first rock musicians to help expose this sort of music to europe and north america although it wouldnt be until the 1980s and 1990s that it gained an appreciable audience there jones also did some scattered guest appearances on other artists records the most famous by far of which is his jazzy saxophone solo near the end of the beatles  you know my name look up the number in the late 60s jones became further estranged from the rest of the band as some personal and physical problems made it more difficult for him to carry his weight onstage and in the studio a hand injury in 1966 affected his guitar playing and although he did not go to jail for drug busts because of his police record it was feared that he and thus the band would be unable to tour the united states he lost his glamorous girlfriend actress anita pallenberg to keith richards it is thought that his general ability to function was so impaired that he did not play on some of the sessions that produced the rolling stones  1968 album beggars banquet although thats probably him on slide guitar on no expectations jones played on a little bit of let it bleed but before that album was finished he left the rolling stones on june 8 it was announced that he had decided to leave for musical reasons although biographers have speculated that he was in fact fired by the rest of the group jones apparently had ambitions to form a band of his own but on july 3 he drowned in his own swimming pool the cloudy circumstances of his death have been the subjects of various theories over the years some feel that he was murdered other evidence indicates that it was an accident that might have been brought on by unwise combinations of substances and medications the rolling stones with mick taylor as jones  replacement went ahead with their planned free concert in londons hyde park on july 5 1969 staging it as a tribute to jones
