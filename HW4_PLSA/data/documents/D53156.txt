what firewall software does prev nexta firewall is simply a program or hardware device that filters the information coming through the internet connection into your private network or computer system if an incoming packet of information is flagged by the filters it is not allowed through if you have read the article how web servers work then you know a good bit about how data moves on the internet and you can easily see how a firewall helps protect computers inside a large company lets say that you work at a company with 500 employees the company will therefore have hundreds of computers that all have network cards connecting them together in addition the company will have one or more connections to the internet through something like t1 or t3 lines without a firewall in place all of those hundreds of computers are directly accessible to anyone on the internet a person who knows what he or she is doing can probe those computers try to make ftp connections to them try to make telnet connections to them and so on if one employee makes a mistake and leaves a security hole hackers can get to the machine and exploit the hole with a firewall in place the landscape is much different a company will place a firewall at every connection to the internet for example at every t1 line coming into the company the firewall can implement security rules for example one of the security rules inside the company might be out of the 500 computers inside this company only one of them is permitted to receive public ftp traffic allow ftp connections only to that one computer and prevent them on all others a company can set up rules like this for ftp servers web servers telnet servers and so on in addition the company can control how employees connect to web sites whether files are allowed to leave the company over the network and so on a firewall gives a company tremendous control over how people use the network firewalls use one or more of three methods to control traffic flowing in and out of the network packet filtering  packets small chunks of data are analyzed against a set of filters packets that make it through the filters are sent to the requesting system and all others are discarded proxy service  information from the internet is retrieved by the firewall and then sent to the requesting system and vice versa stateful inspection  a newer method that doesnt examine the contents of each packet but instead compares certain key parts of the packet to a database of trusted information information traveling from inside the firewall to the outside is monitored for specific defining characteristics then incoming information is compared to these characteristics if the comparison yields a reasonable match the information is allowed through otherwise it is discarded
