taxes and fees view repair cost for a different car get a repair estimate for your car submit what is an alternator all of the electrical components on a vehicle need electrical power to operate and the battery has a finite amount of storage this creates the need for a builtin battery charger called the alternator which works in conjunction with the battery and starter to form the starting and charging system the alternator charges the battery and powers the vehicles electrical system when the engine is running it provides electrical energy to keep the battery fully charged and to power vehicle systems in use eg the starter motor lights and stereo how does the alternator work the alternator is mounted on the engine and creates power much like a windenergy turbine except it is turned by the serpentine belt or accessory drive belt instead of wind as it spins it creates electricity and the builtin voltage regulator and rectifier are responsible for ensuring the current is correct for the vehicle the alternator produces an alternating current ac which is changed to usable direct current dc by the rectifier diodes within the alternator find a certified mechanic find a high quality auto repair shop or dealer near youx what are the symptoms related to a bad alternator alternator failure while driving will cause the battery light to illuminate on the dashboard soon after all electrical components will being to lose power the vehicle will stall and jumpstarting will not be effective the alternator can also fail due to the bearing that holds the internal rotating assembly causing a grinding noise that changes with engine speed more symptoms of a bad alternator can i drive with an alternator problem a vehicle with a weak alternator may be able to drive to a repair facility for diagnosis but a vehicle with a failed alternator will not run after an external charger is removed from the battery how often do alternators need to be replaced alternator failure is seemingly common but in most cases an alternator can last 100000  150000 miles without incident harsh driving conditions and aftermarket electrically powered accessories can decrease the useful

tested to prevent misdiagnosis and unnecessary component replacement repair facilities use professional starting and charging system test equipment that automatically or manually tests every component in the starting and charging system simultaneously and definitively prior to this test being conducted the entire system must be physically inspected for damage or lack of continuity how is an alternator replaced when replacing the alternator the technician must remove the battery cables to prevent electric shock afterwards the accessory drive belts or serpentine belts must be removed from the alternator along with electrical connectors and several bolts once the bolts are removed the alternator is free from the alternator brackets and can be removed replacement is in reverse order and proper torque must be applied to prevent damage the vehicle will then be retested in the same manner to ensure the repair is complete obd codes related to alternator replacement p0560 system voltage p0561 system voltage unstable p0562 system voltage low repair pal recommendations for alternator issues since the alternator requires the removal of the serpentine belt replacing the serpentine belt is recommended if the belt is worn or the service interval has been reached if the battery cables were identified as having physical damage or extensive corrosion they should be replaced as well what to look out for when dealing with alternator issues on most modern vehicles the amount of room to work can be extremely limited and that can play a significant role in repair cost in some cases suspension components drive axles cooling fans and bumpers must be removed to access the alternator the manufacturer supplies an alternator with the vehicle that produces appropriate amperage for the original components if additional electrical components are installed the new alternator should be of a sufficient grade to handle additional power demands to prevent damage to the alternator proper procedures must be followed when jumpstarting the vehicle or when using a battery charger to charge the battery never disconnect the battery from the vehicle when the engine is running the battery absorbs excess voltage from the alternator and without it the higher voltage may destroy the vehicles electrical and electronic components since the alternator is designed to maintain a charged battery charging a dead battery by driving the vehicle places a strain on the alternator charging a dead battery requires a sustained and substantial flow of current which is not what the alternator is designed for repeatedly jumpstarting and then driving a vehicle to charge the battery can lead to alternator failure can i replace the alternator myself as mentioned before the alternator can be placed in a location that is inaccessible without extensive deconstruction in these cases the replacement should be left to a professional technician to prevent damage or improper installation of sensitive components if the location of the alternator is accessible a good understanding of starting and charging system diagnostics and repair can make this job a costsaving diy get it repaired in a
