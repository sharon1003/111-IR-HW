vote1down vote it sounds like youre looking more towards doing periodic mirroring instead of raid but raid 1 is going to be a better solution as both drives will always be in sync no lost data between mirroring and youll increase drive read performance at little to no cost to write performance you also wont have to take your system down to do the mirror most cloning software requires that the drive be unmounted before cloning critical sectors like the boot sector nicks answer has can show you how to set up the raid arrayshare improve this answeredited mar 20 17 at 1017community ♦1answered oct 11

drive commands such as sequencing database log writes with store updates to maintain integrity trim etc unlike raid its perfectly feasible to image an ssd to an hdd also raid requires both drives to be available at all times which might not be possible for a notebook with only one drive bay – ben voigt jan 13 11 at 2219add a commentup vote1down vote you initialize format and apply partitions
