comment4 answers active oldest votesup vote3down vote if you have pkmn leaf grean and pkmn ruby or their counter parts you can use a feature to migrate pkmn up from them all you need to do is choose a starter catch 6 more pkmn then transfer the starter up with 5 of the others because you need 6 at once to transfer then you restart and repeat with the other starters and games because you can get 1 kanto starter by beating all gyms and red then talking to oak and 1 hoenn starter by getting a pkmn from oak then going to the pkmn fan club in kanto then a guy named steven will tell you that latias or latios is roaming the game then you go to silph co and he is there talk to him he asks which stone you want red blue or green and will give you 1 hoenn starter with the respective color you only need to transfer 4 times but based on your main question it is impossible to get all of the hoenn and kanto starters in gameshare improve this answeredited jun 19 13 at 1722answered jun 19 13 at
