coffee shop to chop up the monotony i had to escape the kitchen is where i found my happiness the pace the pressure the creativity all invigorated me but is it right for you here are some tips and information to help you make your decision culinary school or entrylevel pastry job entrylevel pastry job all the way getting paid to learn versus paying 40000 to go to culinary school is a no brainer you can always go to culinary school later if you want a formal education however if you have never experienced working in a restaurant or bakery kitchen get your feet wet and see if you really like it by getting a bit of realworld experience be okay with your social life and sleep schedule changing pastry is what you start and end your day with as the opening pastry chef for a coffee company or the closing pastry chef for a finedining restaurant you will always either be first in at say 3 am or last out at 1 am you will more than likely work weekends if you own your own pastry business during busy season there is no such thing as a day off you get used to going to bed early or getting to check out all the late night places to eat there is something beautiful having a few hours of quiet in the morning and in watching a city wake up on the flip side if you are just finishing up at 1 am the debauchery you see in the wee hours of getting off a shift is truly priceless people watching work with the best and work with different chefs if there is a chef that you admire get in that kitchen it doesnt matter if you are sweeping the floors and washing the dishes someone always no callno shows and you may get a chance to jump in there stay long enough to learn but not too long that you stop growing ive worked everything from fine dining to fast casual and in doing so ive learned so many different things from how to properly cook a steak to sous vide to shucking oysters never say no to learning something even if its outside the pastry department i fully plan to go to some larger metropolitan areas this summer and do some stages in different pastry kitchens there is always more to learn be it new techniques or new tactics to improve how you are currently doing something read everything i constantly read cookbooks magazines and blogs to keep learning and inspire the amazon quick order app on my phone gets a lot of use to the dismay of my husband who usually is the carrier of my boxes of books each time we move my home office has a wall of cookbooks including pastry and savory some of the best ideas and techniques ive learned have come from savory cookbooks or methods if becoming a pastry chef is the path you want to take start reading travel and eat out i really dislike when i hear chefs say that they never eat out because they can cook better at home thats moronic and smallminded you should jump at the opportunity to taste the food of fellow chefs to see what others are doing and to be knowledgable about what is happening in our industry traveling opens up another space for inspiration and education in a kitchen we become so focused on what has to get done sometimes we forget to step back and look at the bigger picture of what we are doing where we are going and what we want to accomplish the bakery from the film its complicated findinggolddustwordpresscom you will probably never attain perfection in the form of a bakery or otherwise the dream is for the perfect bakery mine is the one from the meryl streep movie its complicated however it will more than likely never come to fruition currently im baking in the equivalent to an easy bake oven i mix 10 batches of dough in small mixers because i have yet to find a large hobart that doesnt break the bank i use a commercial kitchen and a borrowed restaurant kitchen space until i can find something to call my own carting in all my equipment and hauling it all out at the end of a long baking session it is tedious and frustrating but it is a start and it is what i can afford for now perfection wont come together in your pastry either the pastry you create will not appeal to everyone either via taste or cost i bake primarily organic which most people say they like but in reality there are only a small group of people who will pay the slightly higher price for organic baked goods be okay with not tickling every persons taste buds or wallets be prepared to work harder than you ever have before working in a kitchen is challenging physically and mentally depending on what you are doing be it operating your own business working on a busy line or cranking out production you body will hurt at some point if not often my husband recently assisted me in doing some production work for my business he had only ever helped me at events the fun part where you talk to people and hand out treats after eight hours on his feet and 1500 balls of cookie dough he had a whole new respect for working in a kitchen there will be moments of what the fuck am i doing but if this is what you truly want to do you will make it through those moments if you like this story consider signing up for our email newsletters show me howim not a robotre captchaprivacy  terms i show
