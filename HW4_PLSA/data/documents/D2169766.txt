maybe later sort wave generation wind drag friction at the water surface small capillary waves restoring forces is surface tension sustained wind increased drag and wind grip greater energy input waves grow restoring force is gravity what determines wave growth and height 1 wind speed 2 wind duration time required for sea state to fully develop 3fetch distance over which the wind blows at a given speed and direction 4 initial sea state sea state creates additional wind drag less time if conditions are already rough crest top of the wavetrough bottom of the wavewavelength crest to crest  trough to troughwave period t  1f time elapsed between 2 consecutive crests or troughswave frequency number of wavelengths that pass a fixed point per unit time deep water waves orbital waves water within waves describes one circular orbit per wave period  at the surface the orbit diameter equals the wave height the orbit diameter decreases with increasing depth speed celerity ltdeep water waves speed determined by wave period water depth  12 x l wave orbits dont reach sea floor no interaction with sea floor shallow water waves speed determined by water depth wave orbits reach sea floor caused by bottom friction water depth  120 x ltransitional waves speed determined by wave period and wave depth deep water waves wave base at depth  12 length does not reach sea floor wave orbits are circular determined by wave periodshallow water waves wave base reaches sea floor wave orbits become vertically compressed into elongated ellipses determined by water depthspeed of deep water waves depends on wave period t and restoring force gravityspeed of shallow water waves depends on wave depth d and restoring force gravitysuperposition principle complex wave patterns can be explained by superposition of individual wave components with distinct wave periods and heightsconstructive interference crest and crest or trough and trough wave height growsdestructive interference crest meets trough or trough meets crest wave height diminuishesdispersion and swell variation of wind speed direction and exposure in fetch area storm centre and interference causes irregular seas wave components sort themselves according to their wave speed  dispersion the longer the wave period or wavelength the higher the speed longer waves leave fetch area ahead of shorter ones breaking waves waves begin to break when they reach their critical steepness if speed greater than 014 then breaking occurs white caps from wave breaking in fetch area of developing seas long deep water waves seldom break wave length in swell too long for winds to force maximum steepnesssurfonshore breaking approaching deep water waves become transitional waves and then shallow water waves wave speed decreases due to bottom friction wave period t remains constant while wave speed decreases  t does not change t is determined by the generating force wavelength decreases clt and therefore wave height is forced to increase breaking occurs when critical steepness is reachedwave refraction refers to a change in direction of the wave travel associated with a change in their speed the speed of waves in shallow water for example depends on water depth a part of a wave crest in shallow water will therefore travel more slowly than a part of the same crest in deeper water this produces a bending of the wave crest and a change in directionwave diffraction huygens principle of elementary wave centres every point within a wave front itself is a source of a wave propagating in all directions  apparent bending of waves around small obstacles and the spreading out of waves past small openings example wave front approaches breakwater with opening in the middle point in the centre of opening acts as elementary wave centre wave fronts spreading out from the centre have orthogonals which are bent toward the breakwaterwave reflection ideal wave reflection without energy loss incoming wave fronts approach boundary on arrival at the boundary every point within the wave front acts as a wave centre consecutive elementary waves from these wave centres form a new wave front outgoing wave fronts mirror incoming wave frontsrogue waves occur where ocean swell encounters opposing currents variations in current speed cause refraction and wave interference wave interference may cause giant rogue

all the waves present in an area of the sea surfaceprogressive waves a wave form that moves across space unlike a standing wave which is fixed in spacedeep water wave a wave traveling in water that is deeper than one half of its wavelength such that the sea bottom does not interfere with its motionintermediate water wave waves moving in water where depths are between 120 and 12 of their wavelength they have properties that are transitional between deep water and shallow water waveswave base the level of the water surface equivalent to one half the wavelength where waveinduced motion is absentshallow water waves a wave that is influenced by the sea bottom usually in water that is shallower than 120 its wave lengthconstructive wave interference the interaction of several waves that dampens one another or that creates higher crests or deeper troughs as waves in phase combine with one anotherrogue waves unusually large breaking waves that are really composed of several large waves that have briefly merged because of constructive wave interferencedestructive wave interference occurs when the crest of one wave coincides with the trough of another wave in such away that cancellation resultsdispersion the process of wave seperation produces a regular swell aware that is free of fetch and has a regular up  down and back and forth motionwave refraction the bending of
