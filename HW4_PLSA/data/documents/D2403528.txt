club for your appropriate situation knowing the technique to spin a golf ball with these clubs will be relatively easy the differences in pitching wedge loft and sand wedge loft some people lump the pitching wedge sand wedge and lob wedges jointly as part of the arsenal of “irons” a standard set of irons usually would include three iron through pitching wedge with your other wedges purchased independently club technology has developed to the point where the loft on the 5 iron just a few years back was around 32 degrees now is lofted at roughly 26 degrees this has led to an increased use of the more lofted golf clubs and they are designed particularly for getting height on the ball accuracy and ball control this group of golf clubs for better scoring plus the total amount of use they receive for the mid to high handicap golfers in the end are a significant part of playing a good round of golf the loft of your pitching wedge the pitching wedge which is a single club down from the nine iron is normally at from 45 to 48 degrees and for an average male golfer is perhaps hit full at 100 to 110 yards if the golfer is confronted with a shorter distance than a full wedge they don’t want to get into those tough half or three quarter wedges so golf expertise has come up with another answer with the gap wedge  at about 50 to 54 degrees this club is designed to strike those inbetween shots using a full swing that can be struck with more comfort and confidence the sand wedge attributed to gene sarazen as his contribution to golf equipment is usually about 56 degrees while i prefer them a bit more lofted and are flanged to different degrees on the heal on your golf club this prevents the sand wedge from digging into the sand under the ball this “club bounce” or area on your club that actually rests at the ground at address has the purpose of stopping the golf club head from digging into the ground or sand previous to golf ball contact and tend to be present to some extent on your gap wedge and especially the lob wedges lastly the club with the maximum quantity of loft will be the lob or flop wedge a somewhat new device to us golfers this is usually lofted at about 60 degrees and sometimes more and is generally rather heavily flanged to provide greater golf club bounce with practice this golf club may be an extremely beneficial tool around the greens since

accurately the nuances in these golf clubs with the loft on the pitching wedge or possibly a sand wedge to how a golf ball reacts when coming off your golf club takes a lot of practice however through some effort any person should have the knowhow to get good with these golf shots overview the individual first taking up golf can become very confused by the different kinds of wedges and what these golf clubs are used for this is because there are four different types of wedges each with a different degree of loft which is the key characteristic that separates one wedge from another the degree of loft on a golf club influences the trajectory of the ball when the club strikes it correctly—the higher the degree of loft the more quickly the golf ball goes into the air pitching wedge virtually every set of golf clubs come with a pitching wedge which is a club with between 44 and 49 degrees of loft to the clubface the pitching wedge is designed to be able to get under a golf ball on contact and these clubs are used to hit shots from distances of between 110 and 125 yards while a professional golfer may hit his pitching wedge some 25 yards further than that both an amateur and a pro are looking to get the ball high into the air as they shoot it toward a putting green and land it near the hole it is important for the new golfer to have an understanding of how far she can hit her pitching wedge with accuracy as this will allow her to be able to choose and hit the other wedges when needed gap wedge the best way to explain the purpose of a gap wedge and its differences from other wedges is to say that it covers the “gap” between the pitching and sand wedge this means that it has a loft somewhere between 50 and 54 degrees putting it in the middle of the pitching and sand wedges in terms of loft the gap wedge is used to hit the ball between 90 and 110 yards which fills the gap between the optimum distances for pitching and sand wedges rather than having to choose between swinging a pitching wedge easy or a sand wedge very hard to make the ball go these distances a golfer can opt for the gap wedge which can accomplish the task with a relaxed and full swing the rule of thumb is that a player should have four degrees of difference between wedges for instance a golfer with a pitching wedge lofted at 46 degrees should have a gap wedge of 50 degrees a sand wedge at 54 degrees and a lob wedge of no less than 58 degrees sand wedge the sand wedge was first made in 1930 for players to utilize to hit a golf ball out of the sand but it has since been popularly employed to hit the ball from high grass or from a fairway the loft on a sand wedge ranges between 54 and 58 degrees and it has a heavy club head golfers will choose a sand wedge when facing a shot of between 80 and 100 yards that needs to get into the air quickly the height a sand wedge can make a golf ball go when it is properly played translates into the ball usually stopping quickly after it descends onto the green some sets of golf clubs come with a sand wedge while others do not lob wedge the lob wedge is a recent addition to the family of wedges golfers with experience will take a lob wedge when close to the green and try to hit it cleanly so that the ball flies into the air and then lands on the green with loads of spin the degree of loft on a lob wedge is between 59 and 65 degrees and the leading edge of the club is thinner this makes this club the best choice for example when a hazard needs to be cleared the golfer can take a full swing and still only hit a lob wedge between 60 and 70 yards with the ball rising very rapidly and coming down onto the putting surface used from the high rough and from the fairway the lob wedge does not come with a set of clubs and must be purchased separately bladed sand iron and toe of putter explained related content go daddy founder gets in equipment biz  golf digestcom blog golf digestcom bloggo daddy founder gets in
