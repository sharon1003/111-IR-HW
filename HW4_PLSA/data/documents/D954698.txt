salvation is gods workby matt slicksalvation belongs to the lord  psalm 38  when someone appeals to god and seeks forgiveness in jesus his sins are removed he is cleansed his relationship with god is restored and he is made a new creature  2 cor 517  all of this is the work of god not man the bible has a phrase that describes the nonchristian it is natural man in 1 cor 214 paul says but a natural man does not accept the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness to him and he cannot understand them because they are spiritually appraised our human condition can be compared to a drop of poison in a glass of water all the water is poisoned but it is not as bad as it could be the water is incapable of being good we too are incapable of really being good when jesus disciples asked him who can be saved he replied with men this is impossible but with god all things are possible  matt 1926  that is why salvation rests in god alone by grace through faith  eph 289  about now you are probably wondering what this has to do with witnessing why do you need to know all this i am glad you asked it is helpful to know because you must realize it is god who saves people specifically it is the holy spirit who convicts the sinner of sin  not you and he the holy spirit when he comes will convict the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment  john 168  remember the gospel is preached after sin is made known because the sinner cannot come to god on his own he must be convicted of his sin and thus be made aware of his need for salvation the conviction of sin is beyond our control it is the work of the holy spirit  john 168  prayer is essential in witnessing it is then vital that you pray and request god to convict as well as save prayer is an essential part of witnessing when you witness you must pray then you are free to spread the gospel as effectively as you want and to trust god to give the increase  1cor 367  ask him to send the holy spirit ask him to convict the world of sin the work of the holy spirit is essential in salvation the holy spirit the holy spirit works in two types of people during witnessing the saved and the unsaved in the saved he dwells within  rom 811  teaches  john 1426  anoints  1 john 227  guides  john 1613  and sanctifies  1 pet 12  without the holy spirit we would be like ships without rudders unable to live as christians and certainly unable to witness effectively in the unsaved he convicts of sin  john 168  sinners come to jesus to have their sins cleansed they do this after they discover their guilt before god this too is the work of the holy spirit since the natural man is separated from god because of his sin  isaiah 592  the holy spirit uses the scriptures that you quote to convict him of his sinfulness convince him of his need for salvation and convert him through the word when a natural man or woman is aware of his sinful condition then the gospel message of deliverance from sin is preached and becomes effectual sin sin does two things it offends god and it kills man how it offends god because it is his law we break it kills us because of the nature of law have you ever heard of a law without a punishment a law without a punishment is only a slogan since god is just and laws have punishments then god must punish the lawbreaker but that is not the end of the story god is also merciful and gracious his justice fell upon himself  on the cross his mercy falls upon us  by grace through faith justice mercy and grace imbedded in the relationship of law and gospel are the concepts of justice mercy and grace one of the best ways you can show the difference between them is to use illustrations that show their differences and relationships for example justice is getting what we deserve mercy is not getting what we deserve grace is getting what we dont deserve lets suppose you have a bicycle and i want it so one night i sneak over to your house and steal it you catch me and i go to jail jail would be where i pay for my crime of breaking the law the penalty is met and that is justice i get what i deserve lets change it a little i sneak over to your house and steal your bike you catch me but you dont send me to jail instead you tell me to forget about it the penalty jail is not met that is mercy i did not get what i deserved one more change i sneak over to your house and steal your bike you catch me you dont send me to jail in fact you give me the bike plus a hundred dollars that is grace the penalty is met by you paying the damages and i was given what i did not deserve the bike and money justice which demands payment does not meet the requirement of mercy which seeks forgiveness mercy does not meet the requirement of justice grace meets both the lamp analogy 1lets say i am at your house or apartment with my wife we are talking about church and in my zeal i accidentally knock over your lamp now this lamp is special a dear friend gave it to you and it has great sentimental value and besides you need a light in your room after a moment or two you realize that the damage is done and decide to forgive you say to me that is alright matt i forgive you for breaking the lamp but give me ten dollars is asking for ten dollars after youve just forgiven me true forgiveness certainly not when god forgives our sins he says he will remember them no more  jer 3134  forgive and forget are similar in spelling and similar in meaning if you forgive me can you demand payment from the one forgiven no because a forgiven debt does not exist lets say that instead of asking me for ten dollars you turn to my wife and say matt broke my lamp you give me ten dollars for it i ask you again is that true forgiveness no you are simply transferring the debt to someone who was not involved in the original offense but we have a problem the lamp needs to be replaced in true forgiveness then who pays for its replacement think about this a bit before you go on to read the answer who pays you do youre the only one left remember if youve forgiven me the debt how can you demand payment now who was my offense against you who forgives you do who pays you do when we sin who do we sin against god who forgives god who pays god did you get that god pays how does he do that simple 2000 years ago on a hill outside the city of jerusalem he bore our sins in his body and died on the cross  1 pet 224  he took our punishment surely our griefs he himself bore and our sorrows he carried he was pierced through for our transgressions he was crushed for our iniquities the chastening for our wellbeing fell upon him  isaiah 5345  god is just god is merciful god is gracious in the justice of god he took our place in the mercy of god we dont get punished in the grace of god he gives us eternal life even though we are unworthy of salvation even though we are unworthy of gods love even though we are unworthy of mercy even though we are worthy of wrath god saved us he did so not because of who we are but because of who he is not because of what we do but because of what he did god is love  1 john 416  god is holy  1 peter 116  god is good  psalm 348  we could never fathom the depths of his purity and kindness  rom 1133  we could never through our own efforts attain him there is only one thing left for us we must worship him love him and serve him he alone is worthy blessed be the name of the lord1 i do not remember where i read the lamp analogy but i have been using it for many years someone contacted me and mentioned that it was used by josh mc dowell if that is the case then he should receive the credit for the analogy tweet about the author matt slick is the president and founder of the christian apologetics and research ministry related articles
