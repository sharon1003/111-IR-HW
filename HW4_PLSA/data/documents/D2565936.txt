then began to produce lots of white flowers in the winter the flowers trun brown and fall off any thoughts regards david18032011 0951  9sskirrrow registered user joined dec 2009total posts 755its the severity of the weather we have had in the last couple of years it happened last year too i have had a lot of leaf drop on my camellia too malky they like quite an acidic soil condition try adding sequestered iron or sulphate of iron camellias also suffer from magnesium deficiency often too where all the leaves go yellow and you can see all the veins in the leaves try spraying the plant with epsom salts18032011 1003  10chez2registered user joined jan 2011total posts 5256which direction does your camelia face its usally the sun on frozen flowers that causes the damage not the frost itself if the morning sun shines on frozen buds it causes the brown damage to flowers put the camelia where it doesnt get the morning sun so the budsflowers have defrosted by the time the sun hits it my mother in law had the same problem years ago and when she re positioned the plant so it didnt catch the morning sun until the budsflowers had defrosted the flowers were fine a lack of water when the buds are forming can also cause problems18032011 1011  11sskirrrow registered user joined dec 2009total posts 755thats a right good idea chez2 thinking about your probably right i re positioned mine
