of borneo forest kingfisher in kakadu national park kingfishers or alcedinidae are a family of small to mediumsized brightly colored birds in the order coraciiformes they have a cosmopolitan distribution with most species found outside the americas the family contains 114 species and is divided into three subfamilies and 19 genera all kingfishers have large heads long sharp pointed bills short legs and stubby tails most species have bright plumage with only small differences between the sexes most species are tropical in distribution and a slight majority are found only in forests they consume a wide range of prey usually caught by swooping down from a perch while kingfishers are usually thought to live near rivers and eat fish many species live away from water and eat small invertebrates like other members of their order they nest in cavities usually tunnels dug into the natural or artificial banks in the ground some kingfishers nest in arboreal termite nests a few species principally insular forms are threatened with extinction in britain the word kingfisher normally refers to the common kingfisher contents  hide 1 taxonomy systematics and evolution2

and evolution  editthe kingfishers family alcedinidae is in the order coraciiformes which also includes the motmots beeeaters todies rollers and groundrollers 2 the name of the family was introduced as alcedia by the french polymath constantine samuel rafinesque in 1815 3 4 it is divided into three subfamilies the tree kingfishers halcyoninae the river kingfishers alcedininae and the water kingfishers cerylinae 2 the name daceloninae is sometimes used for the tree kingfisher subfamily but it was introduced by charles lucien bonaparte in 1841 while halcyoninae introduced by nicholas aylward vigors in 1825 is earlier and has priority 5 a few taxonomists elevate the three subfamilies to family status 6 7 in spite of the word kingfisher in their english vernacular names many of these birds are not specialist fisheaters none of the species in halcyoninae are 8the centre of kingfisher diversity is the australasian region but the group is not thought to have originated there instead they originated in the indomalayan region around 27 million years ago and invaded the australasian region a number of times 9 fossil kingfishers have been described from lower eocene rocks in wyoming and middle eocene rocks in germany around 30–40 million years ago more recent fossil kingfishers have been described in the miocene rocks of australia 5–25 million years old several fossil birds have been erroneously ascribed to the kingfishers including halcyornis from the lower eocene rocks in kent which has also been considered a gull but is now thought to have been a member of an extinct family 10amongst the three subfamilies the alcedininae are basal to the other two subfamilies the few species found in the americas all from the subfamily cerylinae suggest that the sparse representation in the western hemisphere resulted from just two original colonising events the subfamily is a comparatively recent split from the halcyoninae diversifying in the old world as recently as the miocene or pliocene 1description  editthe smallest species of kingfisher is the african dwarf kingfisher  ispidina lecontei  which averages 10 cm 39 in in length and between 9 and 12 g 032 and 042 oz in weight 11 the largest kingfisher in africa is the giant kingfisher  megaceryle maxima  which is 42 to 46 cm 17 to 18 in in length and 255–426 g 90–150 oz in weight 12 the familiar australian kingfisher known as the laughing kookaburra  dacelo novaeguineae is the heaviest species with females reaching nearly 500 grams 18 oz in weight 13the plumage of most kingfishers is bright with green and blue being the most common colours the brightness of the colours is neither the product of iridescence except in the american kingfishers or pigments but is instead caused by the structure of the feathers which causes scattering of blue light the tyndall effect  14 in most species no overt differences between the sexes exist when differences occur they are quite small less than 10 10the kingfishers have long daggerlike bills the bill is usually longer and more compressed in species that hunt fish and shorter and more broad in species that hunt prey off the ground the largest and most atypical bill is that of the shovelbilled kookaburra which is used to dig through the forest floor in search of prey they generally have short legs although species that feed on the ground have longer tarsi most species have four toes three of which are forwardpointing the irises of most species are dark brown the kingfishers have excellent vision they are capable of binocular vision and are thought in particular to have good colour vision they have restricted movement of their eyes within the eye sockets instead using head movements to track prey in addition they are capable of compensating for the refraction of water and reflection when hunting prey underwater and are able to judge depth under water accurately they also have nictitating membranes that cover the eyes to protect them when they hit the water the pied kingfisher has a bony plate which slides across the eye when it hits the water 10distribution and habitat  editsee also list of coraciiformes by population the kingfishers have a cosmopolitan distribution occurring throughout the worlds tropical and temperate regions they are absent from the polar regions and some of the worlds driest deserts a number of species have reached islands groups particularly those in the south and east pacific ocean the old world tropics and australasia are the core areas for this group europe and north america north of mexico are very poorly represented with only one common kingfisher  common kingfisher and belted kingfisher respectively and a couple of uncommon or very local species each  ringed kingfisher and green kingfisher in the southwestern united states pied kingfisher and whitethroated kingfisher in southeastern europe the six species occurring in the americas are four closely related green kingfishers in the genus chloroceryle and two large crested kingfishers in the genus megaceryle even tropical south america has only five species plus the wintering belted kingfisher in comparison the african country of the gambia has eight resident species in its 120by20mile 193 by 32 km area 10individual species may have massive ranges like the common kingfisher which ranges from ireland across europe north africa and asia as far as the solomon islands in australasia or the pied kingfisher which has a widespread distribution across africa and asia other species have much smaller ranges particularly insular species which are endemic to single small islands the kofiau paradise kingfisher is restricted to the island of kofiau off new guinea 10kingfishers occupy a wide range of habitats while they are often associated with rivers and lakes over half the worlds species are found in forests and forested streams they also occupy a wide range of other habitats the redbacked kingfisher of australia lives in the driest deserts although kingfishers are absent from other dry deserts like the sahara other species live high in mountains or in open woodland and a number of species live on tropical coral atolls numerous species have adapted to humanmodified habitats particularly those adapted to woodlands and may be found in cultivated and agricultural areas as well as parks and gardens in towns and cities 10behaviour and ecology  editdiet and feeding  editkingfishers feed on a wide variety of prey they are most famous for hunting and eating fish and some species do specialise in catching fish but other species take crustaceans frogs and other amphibians annelid worms molluscs insects spiders centipedes reptiles including snakes and even birds and mammals individual species may specialise in a few items or take a wide variety of prey and for species with large global distributions different populations may have different diets woodland and forest kingfishers take mainly insects particularly grasshoppers whereas the water kingfishers are more specialised in taking fish the redbacked kingfisher has been observed hammering into the mud nests of fairy martins to feed on their nestlings 15 kingfishers usually hunt from an exposed perch when a prey item is observed the kingfisher swoops down to snatch it then returns to the perch kingfishers of all three families beat larger prey on a perch to kill the prey and to dislodge or break protective spines and bones having beaten the prey it is manipulated and then swallowed 10 the shovelbilled kookaburra uses its massive wide bill as a shovel to dig for worms in soft mud common kingfisher hovering giant kingfisher breaking spine of tilapia fish pied kingfisher killing a fish breeding  editkingfishers are territorial some species defending their territories vigorously they are generally monogamous although cooperative breeding has been observed in some species and is quite common in others 10 for example the laughing kookaburra where helpers aid the dominant breeding pair in raising the young 16like all coraciiformes the kingfishers are cavity nesters with most species nesting in holes dug in the ground these holes are usually in earth banks on the sides of rivers lakes or manmade ditches some species may nest in holes in trees the earth clinging to the roots of an uprooted tree or arboreal nests of termites termitarium these termite nests are common in forest species the nests take the form of a small chamber at the end of a tunnel nestdigging duties are shared between the genders  during the initial excavations the bird may fly at the chosen site with considerable force and birds have injured themselves fatally while doing this the length of the tunnels varies by species and location nests in termitariums are necessarily much shorter than those dug into the earth and nests in harder substrates are shorter than those in soft soil or sand the longest tunnels recorded are those of the giant kingfisher which have been found to be 85 m 28 ft long 10the eggs of kingfishers are invariably white and glossy the typical clutch size varies by species some of the very large and very small species lay as few as two eggs per clutch whereas others may lay 10 eggs the typical is around three to six eggs both sexes incubate the eggs the offspring of the kingfisher usually stay with the parents for 3–4 months 10status and conservation  editthe rufouscollared kingfisher is categorised as nearthreatened due to the rapid loss of its rainforest habitat a number of species are considered threatened by human activities and are in danger of extinction the majority of these are forest species with limited distribution particularly insular species they are threatened by habitat loss caused by forest clearance or degradation and in some cases by introduced species the marquesan kingfisher of french polynesia is listed as critically endangered due to a combination of habitat loss and degradation caused by introduced cattle and possibly due to predation by introduced species 17relationship with humans  editkingfishers are generally shy birds but in spite of this they feature heavily in human culture generally due to the large head supporting its powerful mouth their bright plumage or some species interesting behavior for the dusun people of borneo the oriental dwarf kingfisher is considered a bad omen and warriors who see one on the way to battle should return home another bornean tribe considers the banded kingfisher an omen bird albeit generally a good omen 10the sacred kingfisher along with other pacific kingfishers was venerated by the polynesians who believed it had control over the seas and waves modern taxonomy also refers to the winds and sea in naming kingfishers after a classical greek myth the first pair of the mythicalbird halcyon kingfishers were created from a marriage of alcyone and ceyx as gods they lived the sacrilege of referring to themselves as zeus and hera they died for this but the other gods in an act of compassion made them into birds thus restoring them to their original seaside habitat in addition special  halcyon days  were granted these are the seven days on either side of the winter solstice when storms shall never again occur for them the halcyon birds days were for caring for the winterhatched clutch or brood but the phrase halcyon days also refers specifically to an idyllic time in the past or in general to a peaceful time the kingfishers tribe is called the first one color various kinds of kingfishers and human cultural artifacts are named after the couple in reference to this metamorphosis myth the genus ceyx within the river kingfishers family is named after him the kingfisher family halcyonidae  tree kingfishers is named after his wife as is the genus halcyon the belted kingfishers specific name  megaceryle alcyon also references her name not all the kingfishers are named in this way the etymology of kingfisher  alcedo atthis is obscure the term comes from kings fisher but why that name was applied is not known 18references  edit a b moyle robert g 2006 a molecular phylogeny
