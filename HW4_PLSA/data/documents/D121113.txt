characteristicstransverse section of stolon more or less rounded phellem severeal layered with tabular cells outer layers filled with reddish brown contents inner colourless phellogen indistinct phelloderm three to five layered collenchymatous some of the cells contain calcium oxalate and minute starch grains secondary phloem with numerous concentrically arranged bundles of phloem fibres and surrounded by a parenchymatous sheath containing prisms of calcium oxalate medullary rays distinct bito multiseriate parenchymatous in continuation with those of xylem the rays are narrower in xylem and wider in phloem region xylem consists of vessels fibres and lignified wood parenchyma the unpeeled drug shows the presence of polyhedral tubular brownish cork cells in case of stolons the pith is present and is parenchymatous the root is characterized by the presence of tetrarch xylem and absence of pith powder it shows plenty of starch grains hexagonal crystals vessel elements are with reticulate wall pitting source natural remedies pvt ltd 13the powder is identified by 1 the character and location of starchgrains and crystals 2 the very numerous bastfibers of peculiar appearance and the almost identical woodfibers 3 the peculiar sievetissue the starchgrains are irregularly spheroidal mostly solitary and range from 15 ore 2 to 20 microns in diameter they are contained in medullaryray and parenchymacells and are often associated in the same cell with the monoclinic prismatic crystals of calcium oxalate sometimes also with oilgobules the bast and woodfibers are yellow thickwalled and doubly pointed part of the sievetubes have their cavities nearly or quite obliterated by cellwall thickening source hare caspari rusby national standard dispensatory 1905 14transverse

hplc with online nearir analysis li et al 2015online nearinfrared analysis coupled with mwpls and si pls models for the multiingredient and multiphase extraction of licorice  gancao abstract this study aims to analyze the active pharmaceutical ingredients apis of licorice  radix glycyrrhizae gancao  including glycyrrhizic acid liquiritin isoliquiritin and total flavonoids in multiingredient and multiphase extraction by online nearinfrared technology with fiber optic probes and chemometric analysis highperformance liquid chromatography and ultraviolet spectrophotometry determined the apis content in different extraction phases by online nearinfrared analysis which included sample set selection by the kennard–stone algorithm optimization of spectral pretreatment methods ie orthogonal signal correction and wavelet denoising spectral correction and model calibration by the partial leastsquares algorithm movingwindow partial leastsquares algorithm and synergy interval partial leastsquares si pls algorithm the relative errors and f values were used to assess the models in different extraction phases the rootmeansquare error of correction rootmeansquare error of crossvalidation and rootmeansquare error of prediction of apis in the si pls model was less than 007 the f values of glycyrrhizic acid liquiritin isoliquiritin and total flavonoids were 10765 32431 649 and 6080 respectively which were larger than 690 p  001 the study demonstrated the feasibility of online nir analysis in the multiingredient and multiphase extraction of apis from licorice
