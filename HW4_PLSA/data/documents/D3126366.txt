why women have fewer heart attacks oestrogen protects against blocked arteries the sex hormone helps stop blood cells sticking to artery walls and forming blockages one in five men in britain die from a heart attack compared to just one in seven women by sophie borland for the daily mail updated 0639 edt 12 august 20118view comments around one in five men in britain die from a heart attack compared to just one in seven women the sex hormone oestrogen protects women from heart attacks and may explain why they are far less likely to be struck down than men claim scientists they have discovered that this naturallyoccurring chemical helps stop blood cells sticking to the walls of arteries and forming potentially fatal blockages researchers from queen mary at the university of london think their findings may explain why women are far more likely to suffer heart attacks after the menopause when their oestrogen levels decline around one in five men in britain die from a heart attack compared to just one in seven women but while very few women suffer heart attacks before their 50s the risk suddenly increases after the menopause when they are just as likely to be struck down than men until recently experts have struggled to explain why younger women are less likely to develop heart disease and suffer heart attacks now research published in the journal arteriosclerosis

know that women’s health is partly protected by oestrogen after menopause – when oestrogen levels drop dramatically – coronary heart disease rates rise steeply it’s not yet clear quite how this
