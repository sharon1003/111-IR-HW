black lines are the previous solar midnight sunrise solar noon sunset and the next solar midnight the day twilights civil nautical and astronomical and night are indicated by the color bands from yellow to gray humidity we base the humidity comfort level on the dew point as it determines whether perspiration will evaporate from the skin thereby cooling the body lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid unlike temperature which typically varies significantly between night and day dew point tends to change more slowly so while the temperature may drop at night a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night the chance that a given day will be muggy in são paulo is rapidly increasing during january rising from 50 to 62 over the course of the month for reference on february 13 the muggiest day of the year there are muggy conditions 65 of the time while on june 29 the least muggy day of the year there are muggy conditions 0 of the time humidity comfort levels

section discusses the widearea hourly average wind vector speed and direction at 10 meters above the ground the wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages the average hourly wind speed in são paulo is essentially constant during january remaining within 02 miles per hour of 73 miles per hour throughout for reference on september 26 the windiest day of the year the daily average wind speed is 87 miles per hour while on february 24 the calmest day of the year the daily average wind speed is 66 miles per hour average wind speed in january the average of mean hourly wind speeds dark gray line with 25th to 75th and 10th to 90th percentile bands the hourly average wind direction in são paulo throughout january is predominantly from the east with a peak proportion of 35 on january 18 wind direction in january the percentage of hours in which the mean wind direction is from each of the four cardinal wind directions north east south and west excluding hours in which the mean wind speed is less than 1 mph the lightly tinted areas at the boundaries are the percentage of hours spent in the implied intermediate directions northeast southeast southwest and northwest water temperature são paulo is located near a large body of water eg ocean sea or large lake this section reports on the widearea average surface temperature of that water the average surface water temperature in são paulo is essentially constant during january remaining within 1°f of 79°f throughout average water temperature in january the daily average water temperature purple line with 25th to 75th and 10th to 90th percentile bands growing season definitions of the growing season vary throughout the world but for the purposes of this report we define it as the longest continuous period of nonfreezing temperatures ≥ 32°f in the year the calendar year in the northern hemisphere or from july 1 until june 30 in the southern hemisphere temperatures in são paulo are sufficiently warm year round that it is not entirely meaningful to discuss the growing season in these terms we nevertheless include the chart below as an illustration of the distribution of temperatures experienced throughout the year time spent in various temperature bands and the growing season in january the percentage of time spent in various temperature bands frigid  15°f  freezing  32°f  very cold  45°f  cold  55°f  cool  65°f  comfortable  75°f  warm  85°f  hot  95°f  sweltering the black line is the percentage chance that a given day is within the growing season growing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature discarding any excess above a maximum temperature in this report we use a base of 50°f and a cap of 86°f the average accumulated growing degree days in são paulo are rapidly increasing during january increasing by 720°f from 3247°f to 3967°f over the course of the month growing degree days in january the average growing degree days accumulated over the course of january with 25th to 75th and 10th to 90th percentile bands solar energy this section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day the elevation of the sun above the horizon and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation the average daily incident shortwave solar energy in são paulo is essentially constant during january remaining within 02 k wh of 59 k wh throughout average daily incident shortwave solar energy in january the average daily shortwave solar energy reaching the ground per square meter orange line with 25th to 75th and 10th to 90th percentile bands topography for the purposes of this report the geographical coordinates of são paulo are 23548 deg latitude 46636 deg longitude and 2457 ft elevation the topography within 2 miles of são paulo contains only modest variations in elevation with a maximum elevation change of 427 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 2497 feet within 10 miles contains only modest variations in elevation  1657 feet  within 50 miles contains very significant variations in elevation  5630 feet  the area within 2 miles of são paulo is covered by artificial surfaces  99  within 10 miles by artificial surfaces  86  and within 50 miles by trees  46 and water  15  data sources this report illustrates the typical weather in são paulo year round based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from january 1 1980 to december 31 2016 temperature and dew point there are 2 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in são paulo for each station the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and são paulo according to the international standard atmosphere and by the relative change present in the merra2 satelliteera reanalysis between the two locations the estimated value at são paulo is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between são paulo and a given station the stations contributing to this reconstruction are campo de marte airport 74 43 kilometers north and congonhassão paulo airport 26 9 kilometers south other data all data relating to the suns position eg sunrise and sunset are computed using astronomical formulas from the book astronomical tables of the sun moon and planets by jean meeus all other weather data including cloud cover precipitation wind speed and direction and solar flux come from nasas merra2 modernera retrospective analysis this reanalysis combines a variety of widearea measurements in a stateoftheart global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50kilometer grid land use data comes from the global land cover share database published by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations elevation data comes from the shuttle radar topography

made on the basis of the content presented on this site we draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the merra2 modelbased reconstructions for a number of important data series while having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness these reconstructions 1 are based on computer models that may have modelbased errors 2 are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates and 3 have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas especially small islands we further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable and that the definition of the scores reflects a
