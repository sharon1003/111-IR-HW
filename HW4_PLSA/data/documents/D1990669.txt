3 years agoi have had a mild sore throat on one side for almost a month and they have ruled out any infectioni read just recently that this could be a possible side effect of the prednisone has anyone ever experienced this and if so was there a remedy thanks audrey report this ❤ 014 replies sort by★ 6 lodger uk ne audrey805373 years ago for the odd sore throat i used buttercup lemon and honey syrup i did not have it constantly report this ❤ 0★ 4 audrey80537 lodger uk ne3 years ago i will try it because as far as im concerned it is odd and sometimes i hardly notice it have been to gp and ent and going back again wednesday in the meantime ill get myself some its either that or monks juice report this ❤ 0★ 6 margaret22251 audrey805373 years ago i too used to suffer with sore throats and i did fresh lemon juice honey manuka and glycerine after 2 weeks it went and touch wood i have not had it sine so i dont know if pred caused it but its worth a try mags report this ❤ 0★ 5 layne tx audrey805373 years ago how did they rule out infection my throat sore happened to just have blood tests done for my pmr and white blood counts ok i wondered if i had a sinus infection i have white marks in my throat and tongue and red throat so we think its thrush taking anti fungal meds now and apparently or possibly going to gi doctor in two weeks acid reflux which might also be causing my sore throat thats from pred and not being on probiotics darn it i never had stomach pains so i didnt know if i was having acid reflux but pred can cause that even though doctor wont admit that to megargle with warm salt water helps it for a little while im confused about you having soreness on one side is it just red on one side maybe a dental or gum issue i just thought id share that incase it fits for your experience report this ❤ 0★ 6 margaret22251 layne tx3 years agoyou could have silent reflux this means you have no symptoms so the doctor told me report this ❤ 0★ 4 audrey80537 layne tx3 years ago i also had white marks on one side of mouth so am on an anti fungal med but it has done nothing for my throat also just started taking something for acid reflux  but like you i have no stomach problems i can also feel the discomfort a little bit in my ear on the same side ive had this for a month now at one point it started to subside but not for long go back to ent dr on wednesday i use warm salt water when i think of it probably a couple of times a dayi am also on probiotics 2 a day as recommended and eat yogurt report this ❤ 0★ 5 layne tx audrey805373 years agosilent reflux lovely i did a test i read about to check if i have enough acid in my stomach on empty stomach drank tsp baking soda in water on empty stomach this morning if you burp within 23 minutes then you have enough acid otherwise i never burped what would cause us to not have enough acid i read thyroid meds can do this im now scared that i took the prilosec i really hope we can get word out to pmr people to be sure to take care of their tummyreport this ❤ 0★ 6 eileen h layne tx3 years ago not entirely sure of the accuracy of that particular testi think you need to stop trying to analyse everything  and find a reliable doctor to discuss this with a great deal of what you find on the internet has not medical or scientific basis the drugs for acid reflux make it worse statement is not entirely true if you have acid reflux then often the antacid medications are required to avoid damage to the oesophagus gullet used short term they dont make things worse  but if they are used long term and then stopped suddenly you can suffer something called rebound  your body makes more acid in response to the previous lack as long as you are taking the pills there should be no acid present but for some people they dont work but taking some baking soda and seeing if you burp isnt a test  you need more scientific evidence report this ❤ 0★ 5 layne tx eileen h3 years ago agree eileen except isnt it interesting how some say its too much acid and some say its not enough i find it sad so many people i know take otc antacids and now i wonder if they are making things worse for themthen yes reading about that rebound as you put it wow seems finding out if too much acid or not enough is very important but they assumetoo much im frustrated with doctors they just arent telling me enough they just want to push drugs and go on and then when you come back complaining about worse condition they send me to another doctor or give another drug ive never had to take drugs except thyroid and now i wonder about that i shouldnt be be having this issue and then they tell me i have moderate copd when i dont smoke on top of this all this in 7 months oh and now with my extremely painful thoracic spine in two places they say i have some osteoarthritis did i draw the bad karma card i did mention i have gi doctor appt in two weeks would be sooner but hes on vacation bless you for your comments i used to be a software engineer so yes im a bit of a thinker and researcher i want facts verses just trusting doctors who cant know everything my favorite doctor admitted that but hes retired i think its too late for my esophagus i think its already having some damage this probably could have been prevented with more knowledge on my part but i know thats hind site now i just wish someone could honestly say how long it takes to heal and go away or does it report this ❤ 0★ 6 eileen h layne tx3 years ago it isnt always the amount of acif present  the stomach contents must be acid to digest your food properly and absorb certain subatances it is when something causes regurgitation of the stomach contents into the gulet you have problems  it isnt lined with the same sort of acidresistant cells as the stomach so they get damaged there are various ways of dealing with reflux sometimes it can mean surgery depending on the reason for the regurgitation  hiatus hernia or the closure of the stomach may be weakened but the easy way is to write a prescription for a substance to reduce the acid production so what is regurgitated is not so acid but often lifestyle changes would improve things a lot without medication  weight loss eating habits sleeping position and so on but especially in the us we do see that people want the easy and instant answer  not prepared to change things take a pill and carry on as before how long it takes to heal is another question that is as long as a piece of string  if you stop the recurring damage it will heal faster copd has various causes not just smoking if you have thyroid problems maybe that is also a factor  you may be a person with a few autoimmune issues have one and you are more likely to have another yes you have drawn a short straw  but believe me a couple of hours on a vasculitis forum would make you feel quite healthyreport this ❤ 0★ 5 silver49 eileen h3 years ago yeseileen h it puts everything in perspective when i see what some people are coping with i am trying to look for the nonmedication method where possible when i hit a snag to date i have found solutions i realise that for some people that is not always possible i have been fortunate or stubborn and this is the first time i have had to take medication no aspirin or paracetamol in fact if it wasnt for my husband there would only be plasters and bandages in our house im a bit accident prone this forum is so helpful i hope you have a lovely holiday the rain is back but thats why we have such lush countryside report this ❤ 0★ 5 layne tx eileen h3 years ago thank you eileen i missed this post i have lost 10 lbs down to 130 lbs dont know what that in in metric but 55 tall so in pretty good shape i admit some nights i drank 2 glasses of wine so perhaps that was my downfall and the no probiotics and i do eat beef 12 times a week otherwise no unhealthy fats no dairy no grains no starches occassional sweet potatoes no processed foods for last 7 months but i knowcould take a while for body to adjust will do breathing test friday for copd then i read about interesting alpha 1 genetic protein i think hope i can get that testjust knowing whats up helps to deal and of course talking with folks here appreciate your knowledge and experience hardest thing not getting stressed i have an 88 year old father too smart for own good and too prideful to let us care for him so he gets involved with young women who try to scam him much more to story my shoulders and whole body tenses up when i think of it and i feel my adrenaline going crazy now more than before pmr trying to breath but takes a bit to untightened body fear this is what caused pmr breathe diaphragm breathe thanks report this ❤ 0★ 5 layne tx audrey805373 years ago oh my goodness im reading more and more now on this acid reflux stuff finding out its lack of acid and those drugs for acid reflux make it worse dang and that thyroid hypo might be related to lack of acid and rheumatoid arthritis which some say pmr is related can lower acid in stomach wow now im wondering if all this led up to my pmr my gi visit in two weeks perhaps you and i can get some answers ha if we ask the right questions that is ugh funny doctors frown on us researching on internet but if we are not educated enough to ask right questions then how can we help doctors help us im also trying apple cider vinegar through straw please report what your ent says i had a good ent prior to pmr but his wife made him move away   report this ❤ 0★ 6 lodger uk ne layne tx3 years ago yes and
