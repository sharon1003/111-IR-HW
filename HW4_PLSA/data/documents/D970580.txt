saturday december 21what is the winter solstice the word solstice comes from latin sol “sun” and sistere “to stand still” in the northern hemisphere as summer advances to winter the points on the horizon where the sun rises and sets advance southward each day the high point in the sun’s daily path across the sky which occurs at local noon also moves southward each day at the winter solstice the sun’s path has reached its southernmost position the next day the path will advance northward however a few days before and after the winter solstice the change is so slight that the sun’s path seems to stay the same or stand still the sun is directly overhead at “highnoon” on winter solstice at the latitude called the tropic of capricorn observe the changing day length in your area with our sunrise and sunset times calculator winter faq s question why is there such a time lag between the shortest day of the year shortest amount of daylight hours and the lowest average daily temperature of the year answer the day of the winter solstice is the shortest day of the year meaning the one in which we experience the least amount of daylight in 24 hours it is also the time when the sun reaches its southernmost point in the sky although this part of earth is cooling its great thermal mass still retains some heat from the summer and fall as the gradual cooling process continues over the next two months temperatures will continue to fall and the coldest temperatures will be recorded the same pattern holds true for the summer solstice in june as the year’s highest temperatures are recorded later in july and august in the northern hemisphere question was stonehenge built to celebrate the winter solstice answer that’s one theory stonehenge was constructed in several phases over a period of many centuries due to the alignment of the stones experts acknowledge that the design appears to correspond with the use of the solstices and possibly other solar and lunar astronomical events in some fashion there are several theories as to why the structure was built including that the area was used as a temple to worship the sun as a royal burial ground andor as a type of astronomical observatory however because none of these theories has been proven correct as yet the true reason or reasons for stonehenge’s existence remains a mystery read more about ancient sites aligned with the solstice and equinox question is the solstice the start of winter or the midpoint of winter answer there is not a blackandwhite answer—it depends we follow what the astronomical calendar tells us the solstice is the beginning of astronomical winter an almanac is defined as a “calendar of the heavens” so we use the astronomical definition as well astronomical seasons are based on the position of the earth in relation to the sun however meteorological seasons are based on the annual temperature cycle it is important for meteorologists to be able to compare climatological statistics for a particular season from one year to the next for agriculture commerce and a variety of other purposes thus meteorologists break the seasons down into groupings of three months winter includes december january and february did you know for the ancient celts the calendar was based around the solstices and equinoxes marking the quarter days with the midpoints called crossquarter days

and dealing with all of that ive spent the past 21 years living in a relatively warm part of japan as a teacher and most recently a farmer the only problem with winter here is the lack of central heating and insulation in the buildings it is literally as cold inside the schools as it is outside which makes both teaching an interesting english class and learning how to effectively layer clothing vitally important i dont miss the cold of an upstate winter but i do miss the holidays stay safe and warm everyonewinter in japanreply submitted by cat on december 21 2016  418amgene you say

november 27 2012  524pm the orbit of the moon around earth and of earth around the sun are independent of one another so there is no direct correlation between moon phase and the seasons however greek astronomer meton observed that 19 solar tropical years approximately equals 235 synodic lunar months that means that every 19 years the moon phases usually recur on the same dates of the solar calendar year for example in 2012 the full moon on nov 28 the last quarter on dec 6 etc would also occur on those dates in 2031 or very close to itits not a perfect formula called the metonic cycle it was used in calculations for ancient lunar and lunisolar calendars such as the hebrew calendar as well as in calculations for the date of easter in the julian calendar for lunisolar calendars often an extra month would be added about every 3 years to keep it in sync with the seasons callippus refined the metonic cycle later and hipparchus refined it even more hope this helpshow bad will the winter

the builders left no written record and not even the most intimately involved researchers debate as to who began construction one would be wise to recognize that it is not as straight forward as all that construction was done over a 1700 year period with additions and changes made along the way furthermore the druids as opposed to modern day neodruids association with stonehenge has been thoroughly dispelled in t d kendrick the druids a study in keltic prehistory while most of what you say regarding the stones positioning is more or less true the purpose has never been ascertained
