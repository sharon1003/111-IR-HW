convention center looks to untangle seaport shuttle service leaders hope to consolidate 20 private bus routes into just two in order to ease rushhour traffic jams aram boghosian for the boston globe a few private shuttles waited for riders on summer street in boston the massachusetts convention center authority has a plan for shuttles by jon chesto globe staff july 24 2015dozens of companysponsored shuttles circulate through the trafficclogged seaport every rush hour adding to the snarls as they bring workers back and forth between the jammed waterfront and north and south stations to help solve the problem the massachusetts convention center authority wants to consolidate most of the 20 private shuttle routes on the south boston waterfront into two routes that it would manage as soon as jan 1 the goal is to increase efficiency and reduce the number buses contributing to the sometimes apocalyptic lines that cripple key roads out of the seaport every weekday afternoon the seaport bus logjam is relatively new a decade ago only fidelity investments had shuttles circulating after the mutual fund manager built its seaport complex an outpost at the time in the midst of parking lots and warehouses advertisement as more offices opened along the waterfront — wiping out parking and later crowding the mbta’s silver line service — more employers and landlords added their own shuttles to the mix get talking points in your inbox an afternoon recap of the day’s most important business news delivered weekdays sign up the numbers added up as of last july as many as 34 buses circulated across the area at a given time for a total of 74 shuttles a day funded by 10 employers or property managers collectively they spend nearly 6 million a year to shepherd 1100 to 1300 workers to their destinations at peak times“they’re all going one behind each other and they’re all lining up curbside to pick people up and then lining up one behind the other to get back to the waterfront” said lauren grymek executive director of the nonprofit seaport transportation management association grymek’s group is working with the convention center authority on consolidating the shuttles their biggest challenge getting a critical mass of employers on board they are talking with companies that sponsor shuttles to persuade them to join forces and help pay for the new service some are employers — vertex pharmaceuticals fidelity john hancock — while others are property owners or managers the goal is to secure a halfdozen companies willing to drop their existing buses and instead climb on board the agency’s new service by the end of september advertisement so far no one has committed but fred peterson the convention agency’s interim executive director remains hopeful“they’ve been asking a lot of great questions” peterson said “it’s a little bit of a leap of faith because they already have these shuttles up and running”the project represents two initiatives dovetailing into one consolidating the shuttles was a key piece in a farreaching plan funded by waterfront players to address the gridlock the report made public in january offered a long list of fixes big and small from repairing and reopening the old northern avenue bridge for vehicular traffic to adding more hubway bikesharing stations in the area the convention center authority is also diversifying its revenue streams the agency is trying everything from branching into event development to selling ads for its prominent digital billboard to hosting concerts by the likes of passion pit and edward sharpe and the magnetic zeros advertisement overseeing the new shuttle routes isn’t much of a stretch for the agency peterson said it already has its own transportation department that manages shuttles for many of its events helping convention attendees get to and from their hotels and outlying locations convention center authority officials expect to shave a halfdozen companies’ total shuttle costs by 30 percent from 43 million to 3 million once those routes are consolidated one route would be focused on buildings along seaport boulevard while the other would traverse summer street both would loop in north station and the blue line while the summer street route would also go to south station the job would be put out to bid to a private shuttle service ideally later this fall workers would show an id to hop on board for free just as they do now members of the public wouldn’t typically be allowed though peterson said shuttle drivers may wave them through on bad weather days eventually other companies would be invited to join and trips to the back bay and other locations could be considered there are already several successful models in the boston area the hospitals in the longwood medical area fund their own shuttle service as do businesses in and around cambridge’s kendall square aram boghosian for the boston globe a single rider sat inside a private shuttle parked along summer street near the federal reserve building in boston afarreaching plan funded by key waterfront firms would consolidate 20 private shuttle routes into two bus routes to address traffic congestion in the area the 128 business council started its first shuttle in 1987 — a 12passenger van connecting the offices in waltham’s route 128 stretch with the red line’s terminus at the alewife station the group now runs nine shuttles each day serving a broad area from needham to bedford patrick sullivan the business council’s policy director said 45 employers and landlords contribute to the costs some workers pay and some don’t depending on their employer and the route the public can ride these shuttles for a fee“we find that by pooling the resources for our members it allows us to offer more service in the way of more departure times for commuters as well as the benefit of being able to offer rides to the public” sullivan said “one company operating a shuttle alone could find that could be an expensive venture”even if peterson can line up the six corporate sponsors he needs by the end of september it’s unclear just how much of a dent this consolidation will make in the seaport traffic tieups convention center spokeswoman katie hauser said the plan would be to run 15 to 20 vehicles along the two routes in the morning and evening rush hours reducing the total number of peakhour seaport shuttle trips from 130 to the 90115 range the convention center shuttles would probably carry more people too hauser said her agency is considering 55passenger buses compared with existing shuttles that accommodate between 14 and 34 people“it’s certainly not going to solve traffic congestion overnight” grymek said “but it’s one piece of the pie”jon chesto can be
