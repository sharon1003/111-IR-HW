poc comparison weight size and oxygen flow settings november 1 2013 by allison waters 19 comments i’ve talked quite a bit about choosing the best portable oxygen concentrator the most important factor is liter flow followed by the size and weight to assist you will making the best choice for your oxygen and mobility needs here’s a handy chart for the most popular models on the market today these portable oxygen concentrators are listed from lightest to heaviest you’ll notice that increased weight allows for increased oxygen capacity poc weight size continuous flow settings pulse flow settings

of all things oxygen sharing news and information about home and portable oxygen concentrators i am passionate about helping others learn about oxygen concentrators so they can make the best decisions for their respiratory needs commentscarole benson says november 9 2013 at 419 pm i found this chart helpful and would have appreciated adding 5 columns listing the length of time at each level 15 or at least 13 the same for the additional batteries also time to rechargereply kelly amrein says november 28 2013 at 437 pm can you tell me if the weight of these machines includes the battery reply allison waters says december 2 2013 at 236 pm yes the weight provides includes the battery for models that have an internal battery the weight includes only the internal battery and not supplemental batteries for the inogen one g2 and g3 the weight given is with the smaller of the two batteries inogen offers for other models the weight includes one standard battery two in the case of the oxlife reply emily says december 3 2013 at 1135 pmi see that in the above chart comparison the o2 delivery on pulse flow at 20 breaths per minute for maximum output in the ones i am interested in range from 84 to 192 how important is having a greater number as in 192 for the sequal eclipse 5 as compared to the invacare solo2 with 90 what is the real difference and or necessity for the greater number reply allison waters says december 4 2013 at 1219 pm the greater oxygen capacity of the se qual eclipse 5 is significant and necessary for people who have high oxygen needs for people using up to setting 6 there is not much noticeable difference from one unit to another however for people who need even higher oxygen settings the eclipse offers output settings that are roughly equivalent to 7 8 and 9 reply beely martinez says may 21 2014 at 713 pm hi is there a portable oxygen concentrator that i can use for traveling on the plane that can give me a continuous flow of 6l reply allison waters says may 22 2014 at 921 am unfortunately no the highest amount of oxygen any portable concentrator will produce on continuous flow is 3 lpm if you are able to use a pulse flow setting i would recommend the se qual eclipse 5 which has pulse settings up to 9 replymary myers says september 15 2014 at 235 pm hello is there a poc that i can use while traveling by train i intend to have a bedroom on board for my husband and myself i am currently using an invacare with a continuous setting of 35 lpm while at home when i am traveling by auto i have the pulse flow setting at 4 on a poc reply allison waters says september 15 2014 at 312 pm it is my understanding that trains have electrical outlets in the sleepers if you are able to use pulse flow then you should be able to use your poc if you need continuous flow then you may like the new inogen at home concentrator due on the market this fall it provides up 5 lpm continuous and will be only 18 pounds reply bettye kline says december 25 2014 at 244 pm i need to travel by car from ms to duke um i need 4 to 6l what do you suggest o2 wise bettye reply allison waters says december 26 2014 at 1018 am do you need continuous flow or can you use pulse if continuous flow is needed then unfortunately there is not portable concentrator on the market that will provide continuous flow settings that high the maximum flow a poc will provide on continuous flow is 3 lpm if pulse can be used then the inogen one g2 might work or for a more powerful unit more oxygen per breath at the same pulse settings i would recommend a se qual eclipse 5 or se qual e quinox reply dave mc lane says april 14 2015 at 231 pm what is your understanding about how poc settings are calculated  i know that the inbreath is generally much shorter than the outbreath so i’m guessing the setting ought to suggest an equivalency in o2 taken in more or less equal to continuous flow liters per minute but nothing i’ve heard points one way or the other are there even common standards among manufacturers i just bought the inogen g3 because even though the capacity isn’t quite up to what i’d like i think the effort to lug around a g2 might raise my requirements a setting or two do you think there might be some validity to my take on that reply allison waters says april 14 2015 at 244 pm most people can use the same pulse flow setting as continuous however there is no common standard among manufacturers a setting 2 is not the same for a life choice activox an inogen one g3 or a se qual eclipse 15 m l 21 m l and 32 m l per breath respectively at 20 breaths per minute for an indepth look at pulse settings i recommend my article to you a guide to understanding pulse flow settings on portable oxygen concentrators unfortunately i am unable to answer your last question only you and your doctor can determine whether the heavier weight of the g2 would cause increased effort on your part and result in the need for a higher oxygen setting reply laurie schecter says march 4 2016 at 1216 pm what is the lightest weight and most quiet poc with continuous flow of 1 liter per minute  reply allison waters says march 4 2016 at 1227 pm unfortunately the lightest and quietest will not be found in the same machine the lightest unit is the philips simply go the quietest is the se qual e quinox reply shelly says june 3 2016 at 440 pm i can’t seem to find an oxygo poc on any comparison lists yet it seems very similar to the inogen one g3 do you know how they compare reply allison waters says june 3 2016 at 502 pm the oxy go is an inogen one g3 that has been privately labeled for the dealer as far as i know it has not been modified and it will have the same specifications as the inogen one g3 reply carol says july 10 2016 at 349 pm do any of the portable continuous flow units start at 12 of a liter i am on this 247 i use with a bipap at night i am also interested in something light weight thank you reply allison waters says july 11 2016 at 945 am the philips respironics simply go is the smallest unit available that has a continuous flow option it has a 12 liter setting that would provide the oxygen you need and it weighs 10 pounds reply leave a reply your email address will not be published required fields are marked comment name email website
