pigs tend to produce large litters in a relatively short period of time a sow stays pregnant an average of 114 days although its not uncommon for pigs to lose their babies before they are born or have one or more stillborn piglets she might not look pregnant until about three weeks before she delivers but that doesnt mean theres a problem with the piglets gestation length an easy way to remember the length of gestation in swine is the rule of threes three months three weeks and three days for a total of 114 days this is an average length pigs born a couple of days early or late should be healthy the gestation lengths can vary with each pregnancy so dont worry if your sow delivers at exactly 114 days for one pregnancy and 116 days for the next pregnancy skeletal development the 30day mark is an important one during swine pregnancy thats about the time the piglets bones are beginning to develop if theres a problem with the pregnancy before 30 days that causes the piglets to die the mothers body will reabsorb the babies and she should resume her normal heat cycles after 35 days the babies cant be reabsorbed completely because their bones have begun to calcify instead the sow will deliver mummified bodies of her babies how to determine pregnancy keeping track of your sows cycle is the easiest way to determine whether shes pregnant when shes in heat and is not bred by a boar her next heat cycle will occur within 21 days in most cases note the date shes bred and if she doesnt start another heat cycle in about three weeks its likely shes pregnant she wont look pregnant until much farther along in the pregnancy if you think shes pregnant but she goes into heat ask you vet whether your sow needs an ultrasound to confirm shes miscarried time to deliver because you cant predict the exact day your sow will deliver watch her for signs shes ready shell start nesting or scooting around the straw or other bedding in her area to make a warm and soft place to deliver her belly might drop so that it appears almost to touch the ground and her vulva will swell you also might notice dark discharge which is a sign delivery is imminent references 4photo credits jupiterimagesphotoscomgetty images cite this article choose citation style mlaapachicago bharris rob the length of the gestation period in swine animals  momme httpanimalsmommelengthgestationperiodswine3417html accessed 08 april 2018 harris rob nd the length of the gestation period in swine animals  momme retrieved from httpanimalsmommelengthgestationperiodswine3417html harris rob the length of the gestation period in swine accessed april 08 2018 httpanimalsmommelengthgestationperiodswine3417html copy citation note depending on which text editor youre pasting into you might have to add the italics to the site name see more animals how to detect if a goat is pregnant the life expectancy of a vietnamese potbellied pig what are the signs of a pregnant sow
