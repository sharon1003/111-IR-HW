hey judeby john t marck hey jude when john and yoko began living together in 1968 divorce proceedings began between john and his wife cynthia paul mc cartney who was very close to john and cynthias son julian was concerned over johns marriage breaking up and in support of cynthia and julian wrote this song originally titled hey julian it later developed to hey jules then finally hey jude because it was thought jude was a stronger sounding name the song is merely a message to julian then five years old of encouragement while his parents went thru their separation and divorce although julian at this young age knew what the song was about he did not learn the facts first hand from paul until 1987 when the two happened to run into each other at a new york hotel this had been the first time in years that the two had an opportunity to sit down and talk with each other paul and julian had a wonderful friendship and closeness as julian grew up and julian recalled that there went lots of pictures of he and paul more so than there were on him with his father john hey jude turned out to be the most successful song the beatles ever released it was recorded in two days at trident studios london on july 31 and august 1 1968 using a 36piece orchestra and by the end of that year had sold more than five million copies why was hey jude so important and popular one of the reasons was at that time it was the longest song ever released as a single at seven minutes and eleven seconds the other reason is that its lyrics were easy and developed into a community type anthem with its singalong chorus john lennon added a fourletter word hidden deep in the song around the threeminute mark and the intro in green below was spoken by john and paul in a jestful manner john spoke of the black country which was the name of the old smokestack industrial region in the middle of england and paul answered with his mention of boston place which is a small london street where the beatles company apple had just installed an electronics laboratory in a more familiar scene boston street was that street in which the beatles ran for the title sequence of their film a hard days night this introduction can be here on the version included on the beatles anthology 3 from the heart of the black country when i was a robber in boston place you gathered round me with your fine embrace hey judedont make it badtake a sad song and make it better remember to let her into your heart then you can start to make it better hey judedont be afraidyou were made to go out and get her the minute you let her under your skin the you begin to make it better and anytime you feel the painhey jude refrain dont carry the world upon your shoulders for now you know that its a fool who plays it cool by marking his world a little colder da da da da da da da da da hey judedont let me down you have found hernow go and get her remember to let get into your heart then you can start to make it better so let it out and let it inhey jude begin youre waiting for someone to perform with and dont you know that its just you hey judeyoull do the movement you need is on your shoulder da da da da dada da da dayeah hey jude hey judedont make it bad take a sad song and make it better remember to let her under your skin then you can begin to make it betterbetterbetterbetterbetterbetter oh da da da da da da dada da da da hey jude da da da da da da dada da da da hey jude da da da da da da dada da da da hey jude note all lyrics contained herein are ©copyright northern songs all rights reserved international copyright secured the lyrics contained herein are for the sole use of educational reference for the readers of this article all other uses are in violation of international copyright laws this use for educational reference falls under the fair use sections of u s copyright law copyright © john t marck all rights reserved this article and their accompanying pictures photographs and line art may not be resold reprinted or redistributed for compensation of any kind without prior written permission from the author or the registered copyright holders except as otherwise stated above all information contained in this article except song titles lyrics and photographs © john t marck
