lifestyles  german the amazing technology of the inca and preinca cultures of the andes in peru always shocks and awes modernday travelers the incas and preincas understood and mastered the science behind brain surgery genetically altered food incredible engineering marvels sophisticated astronomical wisdom and colossal geoglyphs visible only from the sky how did these “primitive” peoples develop such futuristic capabilities the answer can be found in their advanced spiritual wisdom which has not yet been deciphered or decoded by western scholars and archaeologists this advanced spiritual wisdom accelerated their cultural growth to a height completely unimaginable by 21st century thinkers and scholars 1 artificially straightened rivers it’s a little known and unexplainable fact that the incas straightened entire sections of streams and rivers including a twomile span of the meandering and often turbulent urubamba river above two photos showing two separate spans of the artificiallystraightened urubamba river 2 massive endless  incredibly straight superhighways the incas also built massive endless superhighways along much of south america’s west coast—roads that go on and on for endless miles and that appear so eerily straight they seem scribed by the hand of a giant architect above preinca roads transformed into a modernday peruvian highway the line runs eerily straight for miles almost to the horizon 3 advanced brain surgery by the 1300s the incas has become experts at brain surgery and were performing operations on the skull at a much higher success rate — better than 85 percent — than later surgeons in europe who were lucky to save 25 percent of their patients above inca and preinca examples of successful brain surgeries 4 ingenious stone terraces the incas were also exceptional horticulturalists their ingenious stone terraces tamed the steep andean slopes transforming precipitous terrain into fertile farmland in many cases entire mountains were terraced including 13000 ft high peruvian slopes above left and right terraces at machu picchu right llama decorations created by stones in the terraces at choquequirao terracing technology along with a permanent system of irrigation the selection of seeds and the invention of a calendar for planting and harvesting provided ideal conditions for the genetic manipulation of food—another enigma by some estimates more than half of the foods the world eats today were developed on the terraces of andean farmers including 20 varieties of maize 5 impossible architecture another amazing accomplishment can be seen in the hundreds of architectural stone masterpieces the incas created one example is the legendary sacsayhuaman a breathtaking archaeological site made with megalithic stones precisely cut and placed in ominous jigsawlike patterns called “polygonal” above left the gigantic stones of sacsayhuaman one stone block is 28 ft high and weighs 300 tons same weight as 300 cars right the stone of twelve angles more than a ‘structural’ purpose what ‘symbolic’ meaning does this artwork hold spanish chronicler garcilaso de la vega was so amazed he said sacsayhuaman seems to have been “made by some form of magic — built by demons rather than men” conquistador francisco pizarro’s secretary pedro sancho remarked that anyone seeing the site’s massive stones and ominous geometric patterns “would say that they cannot have been placed there by human hands” 6 mysterious nazca lines another mystery is the strange “nazca lines” massive geoglyphs etched as if by giants onto the arid moonscape of peru’s southern desert more than 15000 geometric and animallike patterns crisscross the pampas like a vast puzzle incredibly their forms can only be discerned from high in the air leaving scholars mystified as to how—and why—such precision was completed long before the documented invention of human flight above nazca shapes etched into the pampa include a monkey bird and spider 7 enigmatic carved effigies yet another mystery lies in the unique and nowfamous mountain plateau called markawasi 80 km northeast of lima geologically unlike any of the surrounding andes markawasi is home to a mysterious stone forest comprised of a series of enigmatic and massive carved effigies including mindboggling winged sphinxes elephants camels and other animals many of which never existed on the continent one example is shown below damaged by time above the socalled “face of time” ie the “monument of humanity” a 60foot tall sphinxlike stone sculpture of a young man whose visage slowly ages as the sun transits the sky the image draws a symbolic parallel to the day “aging” from the sun’s rise to the sun’s evening death 8 architecture with seemingly magical properties another enigma exists in how the incas and preincas captured natural forces in their buildings and landmarks giving the appearance of magic in the 2 minute video shown below taped by the present writer at ollantaytambo peru in 2002 we catch a glimpse of this apparent magic which marks evidence of a high technology as you can see the mere touch of a finger inexplicably displaces the water’s flow like we would do with a modern water tap an oddity that awes and perplexes modern visitors amazing hydraulic prowess of the incas in ollantaytambo your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available click here to visit our frequently asked questions about html5 video000  247 above the magic fountain at ollantaytambo the water was filtered naturally and was purified and enhanced with aloe vera the incas had no written language no iron tools no wheeled vehicles no cranes or lifting devices but somehow between the years 1000 and 1532 ad they created a metropolitan and agricultural empire that encompassed more than half the west coast of south america at its peak tawaintisuyu or land of the four quarters as the incas called their kingdom was the largest on earth who were these mysterious master stonemasons and builders and why does their bizarre technology look like something from the distant future rather than the primitive past inheritors of an advanced legacy the answer is the incas were the inheritors of a rich ancestral tradition that stretched back many generations and even thousands of years the incas and the preincas before them possessed a high spiritual wisdom the depth and power of which is unknown to modern western cultures their advanced spirituality endowed the incas with what we might today describe as “superhuman” skills and abilities including psychic power clairvoyance mind of matter selfhealing and an understanding of the laws of gravity nature and astronomy that has not yet been uncovered in our “modern” civilization for more
