relevance rating newest oldest best answer sorry to hear that you have a sick puppy this pup needs a visit to get healthy for worms you can go to the farm store and get safeguard goat dewormer in a 50ml bottle give 1 cc per 5 pounds of puppy weight for 35 days up to 10 to make sure there is no giardia is fine make sure to weight he puppy before dosing this is the same stuff that they sell for dogs but in a liquid and cheaper fleas bath now any soap leave on for 510 minutes and it kill sthe fleas next call the vet for a couple of capstar pills to give every 24 hours for a couple of days until you can deflea the house and yard for the house you can buy a bomb or put plates of soapy water out under a desk lamp on the floor in the living spaces flea collar pieces in the vacuum and make sure to put in the trash after every vacuuming or the fleas will jump ship and be back in the house mange has to be tested for by the vet as there are two kinds my guess is going to be the stress kind and will be easier to treat than the other which gets into the body and harder to kill be very careful you can get either mange yourself if it is mange vaccinations run anywhere from 1030 bucks plus an office call and wellness exam you will have to go at least twice more like 6 times if your dealing with mange no vaccinations until healthy or it can compromise the pets system it isnt cheap to get a puppy healthy and sadly there are no income based vets out there could try the local shelter for a vet there if they have onside vet care for personal pets some big cities do this otherwise

on what medication you will need to buy the dog i live in a city and the prices are a little higher than the suburbs for a check up and one shot it was 75 puppies need 3 sets of booster shots and then a rabies vaccine the vet may insist that you get all shots at once however i do not believe this is fair to the animal and they should be spaced out it also allows the vet to examine the puppys progress each visit the puppy is usually given a deworming medication as well if money if a problem you should be honest with the vet and a reputable vet should not push things on you that the dog does not need i would not recommend calling around to get the cheapest price i would search online reviews if possible for the best service some places are cheaper than others for a reason and most likely you would not seek the cheapest medical assistance you can find for yourself puppies are expensive initially and including their check ups shots and spayneuter 300500 in the first year expect to pay about 5001000 total youre also looking at other expenses as well such as food i recommend researching a good quality food rather than picking up the cheapest thing you can find at the grocery store crate for training leash bowls bed toys etc sounds expensive but you should not get an animal if you are not able to support it and provide a happy healthy environment for it after the spayneuter you only have to take the dog to the vet once a year for an annual checkup unless the dog gets sick or has an emergency source s i am in canada and with a 6 month old fur baby who just had

websites they charge about 75 aimee · 2 years ago0 0 comment fees for vet visits are set by whatever vet you see they are businesses just as your family doctor charges a fee he feels will cover his cost of doing business and making a decent living so individual vets also set their fees also as son as your vet feels the puppy is healthy enough get it desexed spayed or neutered too you can buy otc
