february 15 1856 from thomas county with the exception of a small area which was crated out of lowndes so the early history of this section is the history of thomas county we are indebted to mr irwin mc intyre who gives an interesting account of the early days of this section in his history of thomas county according to jones history of georgia desoto spent the winter of illegible and guessing

florida and the words pine barrens are written over the area now known as southwest georgia the only inhabitants of this vast section continued on page 4at this time were roving bands of indians and we are indebted to the tifton gazette for the following information on the historical spots of colquitt county 6 the earliest inhabitants of colquitt county during the revolutionary period were indians and white settlers chiefly indians therefore the historical spots were centered around indian mounds trading posts relics and wars an old indian trading post where the indian traded their beads skins and valuable trinkets among the settlers was located upon the site which is now murphys bridge three miles southwest of moultrie the county site of colquitt county a famous indian mound is still in evidence on the farm of mr  j marchant a few miles from crossland ga in colquitt county the indian arrows were removed from this mound on the bank where warrior creek and little river join a few miles east of ellenton in colquitt county a great battle was waged between creek indians and the white settlers july 15th 1836 the indians were almost annihilated the most famous of all these historical spots is the well known thigpen trail this trail is located in the western part of colquitt county one mile this side of hartsfield the moultrie and camilla road crosses this trail near the farm of mr darling gay this road was built by james thigpen of north carolina who was appointed overseer of highways in 1704 the road passed through four states north carolina south carolina georgia and florida it is the oldest road in colquitt county having been built two hundred and twenty one years ago this trail made a direct route from north carolina to pensacola florida and was used for the following purposes1st  military purposes troops marched from north carolina to georgia during the revolutionary war 2nd to bring provisions from tallahassee florida especially salt to different places in south georgia although this road passes through the thickly settled portion of colquitt county it has never been put in first class condition to the late mr john norman who was county surveyor and who knew more of the county perhaps than any man in it as he had a remarkable memory and had made an interesting collection of facts dating from its early settlement we are indebted for a good deal of

james a newton chapter iithe vast pine forests of which the county consisted were mainly the property of the state but for five dollars 500 one could secure a lot of land containing 490 acres some acquired theirs by squatters rights that is after they had occupied the land twenty years they secured a title the area of the county is 5475 square miles the few inhabitants in early days engaged in stock raising for a livelihood marketing their products in thomasville albany and other places in the 60s 70s and 80s there was little growth in population there were some excellent families that increased rapidly among them being the normans newtons monks weeks tillmans crofts murphys sobers tuckers gays and many others of whom there are hundreds in the county at the present time from 1840 to 1860 we have no knowledge of any unusual events transpiring except the formation of the county in 1856 it was named for united states senator walter t colquitt ma a b butts of macon deeded the county fifty 50 acres of land and moultrie was laid out and became the county site the first superior court was held at winchester four miles north of moultrie judge peter f love of thomasville was the first judge he was succeeded by judge a h hansell who resided for fifty four years and mr hansell merrill and robert mitchell both of thomasville judge w e thomas of valdosta is he present judge of this circuit the late captain john triplett editor of the thomasville times enterprise attended court in this county it is said for thirty years or more never missing a session and it was largely due to articles in his paper that colquitt county and moultrie became known to the world the next interesting period in the county was the declaration of the civil war in the 60s there were only a very few owners of slaves in the county 27 with 110 slaves among them and as its citizens had little intercourse with the outside world they were not concerned very much about the war and the issues at stake when they were called to vote for secession at moultrie only three men cast their votes in favor of it and they were south carolinians john d dalton and allen and darling creed brothers colquitt countys representatives to the secession convention were h c tucker and john g coleman the citizens of the county were patriotic however and the following company was mustered from this county of this number only one man survives so far as we can learn the venerable uncle joel norman eight even years of age and from him we secured this roster muster roll of company h 50th georgia regiment c s a

richard j lewis hoyt h whelchel chapter iiithe first settlers of the county were for the greater part primitive baptists they were good people honest unselfish pious and punctual in the payment of debts and meeting all contracts so far as we can learn the first church in the county was sardis a primitive church located a few miles east of moultrie on indian creek the next historical church and first brick building in the county is the old brick church greenfield near autreyville built by mr eli graves a northern man who settled in this county during the period of the 40s it was a presbyterian church as mr graves was of that faith but not for years after this church was built is there any record of any presbyterians in the county with the exception of his family there was also a factory nearby for making buckets which went by the name of the bucket shop following the primitives the missionary baptists and methodists came into the county the presbyterians being the last to enter the county had the misfortune to lose its first court house by fire in 1881 and valuable records wee lost and much confusion ensued on account of land titles in 1880 the census gave the population and taxable property as follows population taxable property1880 25271890 4794 1890  811842261900 13636 1900 1787940001910 19786 1910 4582949001920 29332 1920 943874400professional men of
