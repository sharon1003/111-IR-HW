motor neuron also found in dictionary thesaurus acronyms encyclopedia wikipedia related to motor neuron motor neuron disease interneuron sensory neuron lower motor neuronneuron  noor´on a highly specialized cell of the nervous system having two characteristic properties irritability ability to be stimulated and conductivity ability to conduct impulses they are composed of a cellbody called also neurosome or perikaryon  containing the nucleus and its surroundingcytoplasm and one or more processes  nerve fibers extending from the body called also nervecell adj adj neuro´nal the nerve fibers are actually extensions of the cytoplasm surrounding the nucleus of the neuron a nerve cell may have only one such slender fiber extending from its body in which case it is classified as unipolar a neuron having two processes is bipolar and one with three or moreprocesses is multipolar most neurons are multipolar this type is widely distributed throughout thecentral nervous system and autonomic ganglia the multipolar neurons have a single process called an axon and several branched extensions called dendrites the dendrites receive stimuli from othernerves or from a receptor organ such as the skin or ear and transmit them through the neuron to the axon the axon conducts the impulses to the dendrite of another neuron or to an effector organthat is thereby stimulated to action many processes are covered with a layer of lipid material calledthe myelin sheath peripheral nerve fibers have a thin outer covering called neurilemma types of neurons neurons that receive stimuli from the outside environment and transmit themtoward the brain are called afferent or sensory neurons those that carry impulses in theopposite direction away from the brain and other nerve centers to muscles are called efferentneurons motor neurons or motoneurons another type the interneuron found in the brain andspinal cord conducts impulses from afferent to efferent neurons synapses the point at which an impulse is transmitted from one neuron to another is called a synapse the transmission is chemical in nature that is there is no direct contact between theaxon of one neuron and the dendrites of another the cholinergic nerves  parasympathetic nervous system liberate at their axon endings a substance called acetylcholine which acts as a stimulant to the dendrites of adjacent neurons in a similar manner the adrenergic nerves  sympathetic nervous system liberate epinephrine or related substances the synapse may involveone neuron in chemical contact with many adjacent neurons or it may involve the axon terminals of one neuron and the dendrites of a succeeding neuron in a nerve pathway there are manydifferent patterns of synapses receptor endorgans the dendrites of the sensory neurons are designed to receive stimuli fromvarious parts of the body these dendrites are called receptor endorgans and are of threegeneral types exteroceptors interoceptors and proprioceptors the exteroceptors are locatednear the external surface of the body receive impulses from the skin and transmit informationabout the senses of touch heat cold and other factors in the external environment theinteroceptors are located in the internal organs and receive information from the viscera egpressure tension and pain the proprioceptors are found in muscles tendons and joints andtransmit “muscle sense” by which one is aware of the position of ones body in space neurons and effectors the axons of motor neurons form synapses with skeletal fibers to produce motion these junctions are called motor endplates or myoneural junctions the axon of a motor neuron divides just before it enters the muscle fibers and forms synapses near the nuclei of muscle fibers these motor neurons are called
