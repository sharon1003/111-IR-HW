persons behaviorattachments selective bonds that develop between infants and their caregivers usually their parents and a re theorized to be related to later development analogous to the process of imprinting which has been observed in many animalsattribution perceived causes peoples beliefs about causeeffect relationsautonomic nervous system the division of the peripheral nervous system that regulates the functions of various bodily organs such as the heart and stomach the actions of the autonomic nervous system are largely involuntary and it has two branches the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systemsbiopsychological model a view of the etiology of mental disorders that assumes that disorders can best be understood in terms of the interaction of biological psychological and social systemsbehavior genetics the study of broad genetic influences on individual differences in normal and abnormal behavior usually by studying twins or other family members who differ in terms of shared genes andor experience behavior genetic studies also provide information on environmental influences on behaviorcase study a careful description and analysis of the problems experienced by one personcerebral hemispheres the two major structures of the forebrain and the site of most sensory emotional and cognitive processes the functions of the cerebral hemispheres are lateralized in general the left cerebral hemisphere is involved in language and related functions and the right side is involved in spatial organization and analysischromosomes chainlike structures found in the nucleus of cells that carry genes and information about heredity humans normally have 23 pairs of chromosomesclinical psychology the profession and academic discipline that is concerned with the application of psychological science to the assessment and treatment of mental disorderscomorbidity the simultaneous manifestation of more than one disorderculturebound syndrome patterns of erratic or unusual thinking and behavior that have been identified in diverse societies around the world and do not fit easily into the other diagnostic categories that are listed in the main body of dsmivtrclassical conditioning pavlovs form of learning through association a conditioned response eventually is elicited by a conditioned stimulus after repeated pairings with an unconditioned stimulus which produces an unconditioned responseconcordance rate the rate often a percentage at which two related individuals are found to both have a disorder or problem or neither has a disorder or problem ie they are concordant in discordant pairs only one individual is disordered concordance rates often are computed for twin pairscorrelational study a scientific research method in which the relation between two factors their corelation is studied in a systematic fashion had the advantage of practicality as correlations between many variables can be studied in the real world but also has the disadvantage that correlation does not mean causationcorrelation coefficient a number that always ranges between 100 and 100 and indicates the strength and direction of the relation between two variables a higher absolute value indicates a stronger relation while a correlation coefficient of 0 indicates no relation the sign indicates the direction of the correlationclassification system a system for grouping together objects or organisms that share certain properties in common in psychopathology the set of categories in dsmiv that describes mental disordersculture the shared way of life of a group of people a complex system of accumulated knowledge that helps the people in a particular society adapt to their environmentcategorical approach to classification a view of classification based on the assumption that there are qualitative differences between normal and abnormal behavior as well as between one form of abnormal behavior and other forms of abnormal behaviorcognitive behavior therapy the expansion of the scope of behavior therapy to include cognition and research on human information processing includes various general techniques such as becks cognitive therapy and ellis retcontrol group the group of participants in an experiment that receives no treatment or perhaps a placebo treatment participants in the control group are compared with participants in the experimental group who are given an active treatmentcouple therapy partners who are involved in an intimate relationship are seen together in psychotherapy sometimes called marital therapy or marriage counseling improving communication and negotiation are common goalscerebral cortex the uneven surface of the brain that lies just underneath the skull and controls and integrates sophisticated memory sensory and motor functionsdualism the philosophical view that the mind and body are separate dates to the writings of the philosopher rene descartes who attempted to balance the dominant religious views of his times with emerging scientific reasoning descartes argued that many human functions have biological explanations but some human experiences have no somatic representation thus he argued for a distinction  a dualism  between mind and bodydependent variable the outcome that is hypothesized to vary according to manipulations in the independent variable in an experimentdiagnosis the process of determining the nature of a persons disorder in the case of psychopathology deciding that a person fits into a particular diagnostic category such as schizophrenia or major depressive disorderdimensional approach to classification a view of classification based on the assumption that behavior is distributed on a continuum from normal to abnormal also includes the assumption that differences between one type of behavior and another are quantitative rather than qualitative in naturedominance the hierarchical ordering of a social group into more and less powerful members dominance rankings are indexed by the availability of uncontested privilegesdizygotic dz twins fraternal twins produced from separate fertilized eggs like all siblings dz twins share an average of 50 of their genesdiathesis a predisposition to disorder also known as vulnerability a diathesis only causes abnormal behavior when it is combined with stress or a challenging experiencedevelopmental stage a distinct period of development focused on certain central tasks and marked by boundaries defined by changing age or social expectationsdevelopmental psychopathology an approach to abnormal psychology that emphasizes the importance of normal development to understanding abnormal behaviordefense mechanisms unconscious processes that service the ego and reduce conscious anxiety by distorting anxietyproducing memories emotions and impulses  for example projection displacement or rationalizationepidemiology the scientific study of the frequency and distribution of disorder within a populationexperimental method the powerful scientific method that allows researchers to determine cause and effect by randomly assigning participants to experimental and control groups in an experiment researchers systematically manipulate independent variables and observe their effects on dependent variablesextinction the gradual elimination of a response when learning condition change in classical conditioning extinction occurs when a conditioned stimulus no longer is paired with an unconditioned stimulus in operant conditioning extinction occurs when the contingent is removed between and its consequencesevolutionary psychology the application of the principles of evolution to understanding the mind and behavior and identifying speciestypical characteristics that is genetically influenced traits that people or animals share as a part of their nature evolutionary psychologists assume that animal and human psychology like animal and human anatomy have evolved and share similaritiesexperimental group the group of participants in an experiment that receives a treatment that is hypothesized to cause some measured effect participants in the experimental group are compared with untreated participants in a control groupempathy emotional understanding empathy involves understanding others unique feelings and perspectives highlighted by rogers but basic to most forms of psychotherapyego one of freuds three central personality structures in freudian theory the ego must deal with reality as it attempts to fulfill id impulses as well as superego demands the ego operates on the reality principle and much of the ego resides in conscious awarenessemotion a state of arousal that is defined by subjective feeling states such as sadness anger and disgust emotions are often accompanied by physiological changes such as in heart rate and respiration rateendocrine system a collection of glands found at various locations throughout the body including the ovaries or testes and the pituitary thyroid and adrenal glands releases hormones that sometimes act as neuromodulators and affect responses to stress also important in physical growth and developmentelectroconvulsive therapy ect a treatment that involves the deliberate induction of a convulsion by passing electricity through one or both hemispheres of the brain modern ect uses restraints medication and carefully controlled electrical stimulation to minimize adverse consequences can be an effective treatment for severe depression especially following the failure of other approachesfamily therapy treatment that might include two or more family members in the psychotherapy sessions improving communication and negotiation are common goals although family therapy also may be used to help well members adjust to a family members illnessgender roles roles associated with social expectations about gendered behavior for example masculine or feminine activitiesgeneenvironment correlation the empirical and theoretical observation that experience often perhaps always is correlated with genetic makeup genes influence personality and other characteristics and these traits affect the environment parents provide children and the environments people seek or responses they elicit from others therefore experience is associated with genes and studies of environments are confounded by this correlationgeneenvironment interaction genetic risk and an environmental experience work together to produce a given outcome many psychological disorders are assumed to be caused by such combinations of genetic risk and difficult experiencegenes ultramicroscopic units of dna that carry information about heredity located on the chromosomesgenotype an individuals actual genetic structure usually with reference to a particular characteristicgroup therapy the treatment of three or more people in a group setting often using group relationships as a central part of therapyharmful dysfunction a concept used in one approach to the definition of mental disorder a condition can be considered a disorder if it causes some harm to the person and if the condition results from the inability of some mental mechanism to perform its natural functionhormones chemical substances that are released into the bloodstream by glands in the endocrine system hormones affect the functioning of distant body systems and sometimes act as neurotransmittershumanistic psychotherapy an approach that assumes that the most essential human quality is the ability to make choices and freely act on them free will promoted as a third force to counteract the deterministic views of psychodynamic and the behavioral approaches to psychotherapyhypothalamus a part of the limbic system that plays a role in sensation but more importantly that it controls basic biological urges such as eating drinking and activity as well as much of the functioning of the autonomic nervous systemhypothesis a prediction about the expected findings in a scientific studyid one of freuds three central personality structures in freudian theory the id is present at birth and is the

carry signals from the terminal button of one neuron to the receptors to the receptors of anothernonshared environment the component of a siblings environment inside or outside the family that is unique to that sibling for example being a favorite child or ones best friend contrasts with the shared environment family experiences that are common across siblingsnull hypothesis the prediction that an experimental hypothesis is not true scientists must assume that the null hypothesis holds until research contradicts itoperant conditioning a learning theory asserting that behavior is a function of its consequences specifically behavior increases if it is rewarded and it decreases if it is punishedparadigm a set of assumptions both about the substance of a theory and about how scientists should collect data and test theoretical propositions the term was applied to the progress of science by thomas kuhn an influential historian and philosopherpersonality inventory sometimes

disorderspsychoanalysis freuds orthodox form of psychotherapy that is practiced rarely today because of its time expense and questionable effectiveness in treating mental disorders freud viewed the task of psychoanalysis as promoting insight by uncovering the unconscious conflicts and motivations that cause psychological difficultiespsychoanalytic theory a paradigm for conceptualizing abnormal behavior based on the concepts and writings of sigmund freud highlights unconscious processes and conflicts as causing abnormal behavior and emphasizes psychoanalysis as the treatment of

componentsreliability the consistency of measurements including diagnostic decisions one index of reliability is agreement among cliniciansreuptake the process of recapturing some neurotransmitters in the synapse before they reach the receptors of another cell and returning the chemical substances to the terminal button the neurotransmitter then is reused in subsequent neural transmissionreverse causality indicates that causation could be operating in the opposite direction y could be causing x instead of x causing y a threat of interpretation in correlational studies and a basic reason why correlation does not mean causationrisk factor a variable that is associated with a higher probability of developing a disorderselfcontrol appropriate behavior guided by internal rather than external rulesshared environment the component of the family environment that offers the same or highly similar experiences for all siblings for example socioeconomic status stands in contrast to the nonshared
