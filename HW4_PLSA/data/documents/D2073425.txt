part of the path toward becoming a personal trainer included a step i found possibly more daunting than the training itself picking the right certification organization let me just admit right up front that the names and acronyms of the most credible organizations are confusingly similar ace nasm ascm — oh myluckily i’m familiar with those and a few others from my work here and probably have gleaned a little more than your average jane about their reputations when i did a little poking around online those same few reputable organizations kept popping up solidifying my opinion that i had four possible choices american council on exercise acenational academy of sports medicine nasmamerican college of sports medicine acsminternational sports sciences association issai spent some significant time toying around with this nifty comparison tool from the ace it allows users to compare up to three organizations at a time on metrics such as eligibility requirements exam format and price then i got into some pretty serious cyberstalking sorry and examined the email signatures linked in pages and other credentials of a handful of personal trainers i know finding a pretty even split between ace and nasm finally i talked to a few of those fitness fans about what they liked and didn’t like about their respective programs of course the real conundrum in making this decision — and it’s a tricky one — is that everyone is inherently biased no one gets certified by more than one of these organizations and i don’t think anyone’s going to think that’d be a fun experiment to try so it’s virtually impossible to compare each experience almost everything i read or heard from other trainers was that it comes down to a personal preference but that platitude is hardly helpful if you don’t know what to base that preference on i found this blog post a helpful place to start thanks to the indepth list of questions to ask yourself about what you’re really looking for my choice is by no means the right choice for everyone but i decided to go with the nasm i heard only wonderful things about the highlyscientific basis and this money back guarantee certainly doesn’t hurt i was swayed in the end by the onetime recertification fee which will allow me to pay my dues up front for my continuing fitness education until the end of time or at least until the end of my ability to squat
