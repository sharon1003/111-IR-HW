live science history reference who were the ancient goths by owen jarus live science contributor  march 18 2016 0520pm etmorea depiction of alaric i king of the visigoths in athens by german painter ludwig thiersch credit public domain the goths were a people who flourished in europe throughout ancient times and into the middle ages referred to at times as “ barbarians ” they are famous for sacking the city of rome in a d 410 ironically however they are often credited with helping preserve roman culture after the sacking of rome a group of goths moved to gaul in modernday france and iberia and formed the visigothic kingdom this kingdom would eventually incorporate catholic christianity roman artistic traditions and other aspects of roman culture the last gothic kingdom fell to the moors in a d 711 today the meaning of the word goth has evolved beyond any direct relationship to the ancient goths in the late middle ages a style of architecture arose characterized by large imposing cathedrals and castles the term gothic was applied to the style as a critique the word even at that time being a synonym for barbaric during the 18th and 19th centuries a genre of dark romantic literature called gothic fiction flourished characterized by novels such as bram stokers dracula mary shelleys frankenstein and the works of edgar allen poe the genre got its name from the gothic locations in which the stories took place — for example draculas dark foreboding castle in modern times goth has been used for a subculture with its own style of music aesthetic and fashion the dark often gloomy goth imagery was influenced by gothic fiction particularly horror movies from an island in the north where exactly the ancient goths came from is a mystery in the sixth century a d the writer jordanes who was likely gothic himself wrote a history of the goths he claimed that the goths came from a cold island called “scandza” possibly modernday scandinavia when they would have lived there is unknown“now from the island of scandza as from a hive of races or a womb of nations the goths are said to have come forth long ago under their king berig by name” he wrote translation by charles mierow after a series of migrations south they found themselves living close to the borders of the roman empire our knowledge about the goths before they interacted extensively with the romans is limited they had a written language of sorts that made use of runic inscriptions however few of these inscriptions have been found and those that survive are quite short their religion may have made use of shamans people who could have acted as intermediaries between themselves and the gods goths vs greeks during the third century the goths launched a series of invasions against romancontrolled greece fragments of a text discussing these attacks written by a thirdcentury athens writer named dexippus were recently discovered in the austrian national library and detailed in the journal of roman studies  dexippus said that the roman emperor decius who reigned a d 249–251 led the roman army against the goths but suffered a series of defeats losing both territory and men the text also tells of a battle between the goths and greeks that took place at the pass of thermopylae the goth army was trying to reach athens while a greek force had fortified the pass in an attempt to stop them the fragment ends before the outcome of the battle is known contact with rome also in the third century a d the goths launched a series of raids into the roman empire “the first known attack came in 238 when goths sacked the city of histria at the mouth of the river danube a series of much more substantial land incursions followed a decade later” writes peter heather a professor at king’s college london in his book “the goths” blackwell publishers 1996 he notes that in a d 268 a massive expedition of goths along with other groups also called barbarians broke into the aegean sea wreaking havoc they attacked a number of settlements including ephesus a city in anatolia inhabited by greeks where they destroyed a temple dedicated to the goddess diana“the destruction wrought by this combined assault on land and sea were severe and prompted a fierce roman response not only were the individual groups defeated but no major raid ever again broke through the dardanelles” writes heather the goths tumultuous relationship with rome would continue into the fourth century while goths served as roman soldiers and trade took place across the danube river there was plenty of conflict heather notes that a gothic group called the tervingi intervened in roman imperial politics supporting two unsuccessful claimants to the emperorship in a d 321 they supported licinius against constantine and in a d 365 they supported procopius against valens in both instances this backfired with constantine and valens launching attacks against the tervingi after becoming emperor as contact with rome intensified a form of christianity known as arianism spread among the goths“in the 340s the arian gothic bishop ulfilas or wulfila d 383 translated the bible into the gothic language in a script based chiefly upon the uncial greek alphabet and said to have been invented by ulfilas for the purpose” writes robin sowerby a lecturer at the university of stirling in an article in the book “a new companion to the gothic” wiley 2012 in time the goths would adopt the catholic form of christianity that came to be used in rome pushed out by the huns this complicated relationship would be forever altered with the appearance north of the danube of a new group called the huns around a d 375 the huns pushed the goths into roman territory the goths seeking refuge among the romans were treated poorly lacking food they were forced to sell their children into slavery at humiliating prices“when the barbarians after their crossing were harassed by lack of food those most hateful roman generals devised a disgraceful traffic they exchanged every dog that their insatiability could gather from far and wide for one slave each and among these were carried off also sons of the chieftains” wrote ammianus marcellinus who lived in the fourth century a d translation by john c rolfe after being refused entry to the city of marcianople the goths revolted roaming across the balkans plundering roman towns emperor valens who ruled the eastern half of the roman empire personally led an army into the balkans to subdue the goths on august 9 a d 378 this army engaged the goths near the city of adrianople also called hadrianopolis valens underestimated the size of the gothic force as a result his army was outflanked by the goths and annihilated the emperor himself killed“just when it first became dark the emperor being among a crowd of common soldiers as it was believed — for no one said either that he had seen him or been near him — was mortally wounded with an arrow and very shortly after died though his body was never found” wrote marcellinus translation by c d yonge valens successor theodosius made a treaty with the goths that lasted up until his death in a d 395 rise of alaric after a d 395 the treaty with rome fell apart a gothic leader named alaric rose to preeminence leading the goths into battle against both the eastern and western halves of the roman empire the conflict that followed was complicated alaric wanted to make a deal that would result in the goths under his command getting good farmland and monetary rewards he undertook raids to pressure the romans heather writes that by a d 403 alaric was in the balkans finding himself an “outlaw rejected by both halves of the empire” an attempt by alaric to move the goths into italy had failed and there had been a massacre of the gothic inhabitants of constantinople in a d 400 fortunes changed for alaric and the goths when the western roman empire began to crumble the emperor honorius faced rebellion among his army and a usurper named constantine iii amassed territory in britain and gaul in the wake of these problems honorius had his general stilicho killed in a d 408 seeing weakness alaric advanced into italy a second time finding support from stilicho’s former supporters as well as runaway slaves he was camped outside of rome by a d 410 using the city as a bargaining chip in an effort to get concessions from honorius’ government after a series of unsuccessful negotiations alaric sacked the city on aug 24 two kingdoms alaric would die a few months after the sacking of rome during the fifth century a d as the western roman empire faded two gothic kingdoms would rise up in iberia and southwest gaul the visigothic kingdom would be formed this kingdom would last until a d 711 when it fell to an invasion by the moors however they slowly regained control and in 718 founded the kingdom of asturias which evolved into modern portugal and spain meanwhile in italy the kingdom of the ostrogoths came into existence by the end of the fifth century a d eventually dominating the entire peninsula this kingdom was shortlived falling to justinian i emperor of the byzantine empire within a few decades as europe entered the dark ages the visigothic kingdom would help preserve many aspects of roman culture including its religion and artistic traditions it’s ironic that the goths the people who had sacked rome in a d 410 helped carry roman culture into the time to come youd also like who were the vandals live science history of the byzantine empire byzantiumlive science goths vs
