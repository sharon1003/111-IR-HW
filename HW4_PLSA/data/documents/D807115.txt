by ben wojdyla apr 18 2014my engine has developed a strange ticking sound its whisperquiet before an oil change and then makes a loud tapping after a new filter and fresh oil this cycle has been going on for about 20000 miles even more strange the engine is muffled when its cold but noisy when its warm whats going on here whenever loud ticking is involved the most likely source is the valvetrain but the reason for that ticking isnt always clear most cars use hydraulic valve lifters that rely on oil pressure to maintain a tight clearance between the camshaft and rocker arm if the pressure isnt right there is play between the lifters and the rest of the valvetrain which causes a noticeable tap its possible that cold oil at startup may help pump up the lifters but at normal temperatures the viscosity drops and may be too thin to correctly work the lifters as the oil breaks down after a few thousand miles it thickens which eliminates the noise mechanical issues may also be the cause doublecheck that youre using the correct filter and if youre not consider switching to the manufacturersupplied part the flow rate through a generic filter could be incorrect creating insufficient engine oil pressure the worstcase scenario is that your oil pump is slowly dying and you need a replacement i hate to say it but driving the vehicle this way for 20000 miles hasnt done the engine any favors get thee to a mechanic as soon as possible for proper diagnosis and remediation
