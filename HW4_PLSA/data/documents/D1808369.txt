family  relationships weddings how many people at a wedding actually eat the cake what percent would you say ive noticed at weddings that some people just pass on having a piece of the wedding cake what im getting at is if i had a wedding for about 200 people how many servings of cake should i get follow 13 answers answers relevance rating newest oldest best answer if you have 200 people then you need 200 servings of cake you have to assume everyone is going to eat a piece if you have leftover cake no big deal freeze it or give it to a homeless shelter you do not under any circumstances want to risk running out and not having enough for every guest if you want to save money save it in some other way such as fewer flowers or a less expensive brides dress or grooms tux that does not involved being stingy and cheap with the guests ms x · 1 decade ago4 0 comment askers rating hi frank i used to be a wedding coordinator the usual reason that people dont eat the cake is because they have already had dessert i am not sure what your menu is but if it includes dessert i would suggest using the cake as the favors most venues charge per person for the serving of the cake but this could be negotiated if you say u are happy for the venue supervisor on the night to simply cut it and put it into bonbonniere boxes as oposed to keeping a chef back an extra hour this is where the cost comes from slab cake is a good idea because you can pre cut and box yourself if you are deadset on serving the cake and the venue is negotiable pehaps ask them to serve it on a platter so that it doesnt go to waste if people dont eat it and people can help themselves start with a 50 serving suggestion because usually the guys arent much into the sweets and only eat it because they feel obligated hope that helps bride2be · 1 decade ago1 0 comment200 regardless of who may or may not eat its bad planning to not include a serving for each person and rude to assume what happens when everybody does want cake sorry guys but weve seen people pass and wanted to be cheap save as suggested by having the smaller wedding cake with a sheet cake in the back for serving also try places like the grocery store and samsthey are made fresh daily so sometimes better than bakery cakes delicious and they dont put made at sams so nobody knows the diff also try scaling back your design so it can be done in buttercream instead of fondant which is cheaper and imo tastes tons better if you have two desserts like cake and cookies or whatever you need to buy enough for each guest to have a piece of cake and a cookieso in your case you need 200 of each the only time you can buy less than the number of guests is with things like appitizers if you are doing a fruit plate and a veggie plate you will be ok buying like 125 servings of each as long as you are following it with a full meal otherwise you will need 200 of each ive planned many a wedding and there has very rarely been leftover cake for every one person who says no there is plenty of those who get secondspspoptart · 1 decade ago0 0 comment weve definitely been going to very different weddings at pretty much every wedding ive been to you get one or two diabetics or dieters who pass on cake but everyone else has a slice if i were getting a cake for a wedding with 200 people including the wedding party then i would assume roughly 200 slices would be needed any leftovers can easily find a good home with someone involved with the party source sthree times a bridesmaid once a bride been attending weddings for over forty years and has yet to see a lot of cake left overgileswench · 1 decade ago2 0 comment if its good cake 100 eat it if it tastes like sawdust then hardly anyone touches it i have been to countless weddings and only twice seen leftover cake the first even though the cake was outstanding the couple ordered enough so that everyone could have 4 huge birthday cake size slices they served 4 different flavors of sheet cakes that were cut in front of guests which the guests loved and werent offended by in the least so there was a ton leftover that they and their families and coworkers were still eating for days after at the second the bride ordered terrible cake it was pretty but it was not edible by any means unfortunately that was all that was served and family who drove out of state werent allowed by her since they were staying at her house to eat anything all weekend victoria · 2 years ago0 0 comment its always safe to have enough pieces for the number of guests some people will even just take the cake and have a bite out of it and thats ok too i dont think there is any need to have the cake too big like suggested 2x the amount you need thats just silly you can even have your pretty cake for show and have a slab cake that they cut up for people if needed very inexpensive no worries kass · 1 decade ago0 0 comment i would go with about 200 cause some people eat two peices and you dont want to be short you will always have more then enough cake but who cares or you can get a cake for 175 and a grooms cake to feed the rest if you need toheller · 1 decade ago1 1 comment you will be in it deep if you dont buy enough cake for 200 if you are trying to cut costs on the cake then the best way to do it is to get a smaller tiered cake for the photos and get a sheet cake to serve your guestsbeckini · 1 decade ago4 0 comment i never remembered the cake for any wedding except my own my friend helped me with the cake and everyone said how delicious it tasted i guess my point is if you get pineapple ring cake most folks may not eat it so find something that most people will enjoy maybe chocolate we had white chocolate mousse cake if your concerned of costs get a fake tier cake and a sheey cake for serving talk to your cake decorator lyla · 1 decade ago1 1 comment many people love wedding cake i had a cake that fed 125 people but only had 70 guests many people had up to 4 pieces
