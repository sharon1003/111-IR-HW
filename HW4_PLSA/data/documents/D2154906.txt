ethan wolffmann april 11 2013facebook twitter email theres a broiler in almost every kitchen—though it probably doesn’t get used much its as much a part of a typical range as an oven and a stovetop but often goes neglected its actually understandable why some novice cooks find the broiler intimidating—the blue jets of flame look terrifying but if you give broiling a try you might find that its one of the most satisfying ways to cook heres a primer gas broilers are a bit intimidating what does a broiler do broilers use intense radiant heat to cook food just like a grill an overhead heating element produces temperatures upwards of 600°f which elicits the delicious maillard reaction imparting that browned unmistakable taste of grilled foods where is my broiler in older ovens broilers are usually found in a compartment below the main oven cavity in this location the broiler doubles as the heating element for the oven itself this configuration does have a downside though—the broiler is just inches off the floor so its inconvenient to reach it fortunately most manufacturers today have moved the broiler into the oven cavity itself installing a dedicated broil element on the oven’s ceiling aside from easy access this design allows the cook to adjust the distance between the food and the broiler—some broilers only have one temperature setting so moving the rack up or down is the only way to control the heat there are a few secondary upsides to having the broiler in the main oven it can cut down on preheating times and be used for compound heating options such as convectionbroil which can work well for cooking foods that are difficult to flip such as fish are there different types of broilers some broilers allow for temperature adjustment like gas grills youll sometimes find lowhigh settings or lowmediumhigh settings but many broilers are simply either on or off they work just fine—you can’t turn down a charcoal grill either infrared broilers provide even temperature coverage adjustability aside each kind of broiler design distributes heat in its own way gas broilers shoot flames out from a center rod providing varied amounts of coverage—usually with a hot spot toward the oven’s center electric broiling elements are distinguished by how many times the heating element passes over the oven a “u” shape would be a 2pass broiler and an “m” shape would be a 4pass broiler weve seen up to 10 passes on electric boilers infrared broilers emit heat evenly from a rectangular surface a design that prevents or at least greatly reduces the incidence of hot spots how do we test broilers to test a broiler we put temperature sensors under the broiler and see how long it takes to hit 600°f in actual use you don’t need to preheat a broiler more than five minutes but our approach gives us good insight into a broiler’s power if a broiler isn’t powerful it’s not the end of the world—theyll all basically get the job done but those that can cook entirely with radiant heat rather than relying on hot air as a backup should produce the tastiest dishes this 8pass electric burner is turned on high when and how should i use my broiler you can use a broiler anytime you’d use a grill—for burgers chicken steak fish and much more it has an elegance over other maillard cooking methods—grilling baking and pan frying—as it can be done quickly inside without contaminating food with smoke it’s upside down and smoke rises or excess oil in fact it’s generally a good idea to go easy on the oil in marinades since flare ups aren’t unusual at such high temperatures broiler pans make sure that fats and juices drain when you’re broiling meat use a broiler pan broil pans can deal with the draining fat helping to prevent all sorts of bad stuff from heart disease to home fires vegetables don’t have marbled fat to burn off so we recommend using a lightly oiled oven tray to roast potatoes carrots onions peppers kale or other veggies since broiler heat is extremely directional it is important to flip your food so it cooks evenly think of it just like your gas grill and watch your food like a hawk at high temperatures the line between browned and burned can be easy to miss consult your manual for broiler specifics this is from the lg lre3023sts owners manual follow us get our newsletter real advice from real experts sign up for our
