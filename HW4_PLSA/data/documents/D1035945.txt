hindenburg class the longest class of flying machine and the largest airship by envelope volume 3 it was designed and built by the zeppelin company  luftschiffbau zeppelin gmb h on the shores of lake constance in friedrichshafen and was operated by the german zeppelin airline company  deutsche zeppelinreederei  the airship flew from march 1936 until it was destroyed by fire 14 months later on may

the zeppelin company had proposed lz 128 in 1929 after the world flight of the lz 127 graf zeppelin this ship was to be approximately 776 ft 237 m long and carry 5000000 cu ft 140000 m 3 of hydrogen ten maybach engines were to power five tandem engine cars a plan from 1930 only showed four the disaster of the british airship r 101 prompted the zeppelin company to reconsider the use of hydrogen therefore scrapping the lz 128 in favour of a new airship designed for helium the lz 129 initial plans projected the lz 129 to have a length of 81367 feet 24801 m but 10 feet was dropped from its tail in order to allow the ship to fit in lakehurst hangar no 1 4hindenburg under construction manufacturing of components began in 1931 but construction of the hindenburg did not commence until march 1932 the delay was largely due to daimlerbenz designing and refining the lof6 diesel engines to reduce weight while fulfilling the output requirements set by the zeppelin company 4hindenburg had a duralumin structure incorporating 15 ferris wheel like main ring bulkheads along its length with 16 cotton gas bags fitted between them the bulkheads were braced to each other by longitudinal girders placed around their circumferences the airships outer skin was of cotton doped with a mixture of reflective materials intended to protect the gas bags within from radiation both ultraviolet which would damage them and infrared which might cause them to overheat the gas cells were made by a new method pioneered by goodyear using multiple layers of gelatinized latex rather than the previous goldbeaters skins in 1931 the zeppelin company purchased 5000 kg 11000 lb of duralumin salvaged from the wreckage of the october 1930 crash of the british airship r101 which might have been recast and used in the construction of hindenburg 5dining room lounge with the world map painted on the wall hindenburg  s interior furnishings were designed by fritz august breuhaus whose design experience included pullman coaches ocean liners and warships of the german navy 6 the upper a deck contained small passenger quarters in the middle flanked by large public rooms a dining room to port and a lounge and writing room to starboard paintings on the dining room walls portrayed the graf zeppelin  s trips to south america a stylized world map covered the wall of the lounge long slanted windows ran the length of both decks the passengers were expected to spend most of their time in the public areas rather than their cramped cabins 7the lower b deck contained washrooms a mess hall for the crew and a smoking lounge harold g dick an american representative from the goodyear zeppelin company 8 recalled the only entrance to the smoking room which was pressurized to prevent the admission of any leaking hydrogen was via the bar which had a swiveling air lock door and all departing passengers were scrutinized by the bar steward to make sure they were not carrying out a lit cigarette or pipe 9 10use of hydrogen instead of helium  edithelium was initially selected for the lifting gas because it was the safest to use in airships as it is not flammable 11 one proposed measure to save helium was to make doublegas cells for 14 of the 16 gas cells an inner hydrogen cell would be protected by an outer cell filled with helium 11 12 with vertical ducting to the dorsal area of the envelope to permit separate filling and venting of the inner hydrogen cells at the time however helium was also relatively rare and extremely expensive as the gas was only available in industrial quantities from distillation plants at certain oil fields in the united states hydrogen by comparison could be cheaply produced by any industrialized nation and being lighter than helium also provided more lift because of its expense and rarity american rigid airships using helium were forced to conserve the gas at all costs and this hampered their operation 13despite a u s ban on the export of helium under the helium control act of 1927 14 the germans designed the airship to use the far safer gas in the belief that they could convince the us government to license its export when the designers learned that the national munitions control board would refuse to lift the export ban they were forced to reengineer hindenburg to use hydrogen for lift 11 despite the danger of using flammable hydrogen no alternative lighterthanair gases could provide sufficient lift one beneficial side effect of employing hydrogen was that more passenger cabins could be added the germans long history of flying hydrogenfilled passenger airships without a single injury or fatality engendered a widely held belief they had mastered the safe use of hydrogen hindenburg  s first season performance appeared to demonstrate this  citation neededoperational history  editlaunching and trial flights  edithindenburg on its first flight on march 4 1936 the name of the airship was not yet painted on the hull five years after construction began in 1931 hindenburg made its maiden test flight from the zeppelin dockyards at friedrichshafen on march 4 1936 with 87 passengers and crew aboard these included the zeppelin company chairman dr hugo eckener as commander former world war i zeppelin commander lt col joachim breithaupt representing the german air ministry the zeppelin companys eight airship captains 47 other crew members and 30 dockyard employees who flew as passengers 15 harold g dick was the only nonluftschiffbau representative aboard although the name hindenburg had been quietly selected by eckener over a year earlier 16 only the airships formal registration number dlz129 and the five olympic rings promoting the 1936 summer olympics to be held in berlin that august were displayed on the hull during its trial flights as the airship passed over munich on its second trial flight the next afternoon the citys lord mayor karl fiehler asked eckener by radio the lz129s name to which he replied  hindenburg  on march 23 hindenburg made its first passenger and mail flight carrying 80 reporters from friedrichshafen to löwenthal the ship flew over lake constance with graf zeppelin 17hindenburg  s logotype modern recreationthe name hindenburg lettered in 6foothigh 18 m red fraktur script designed by berlin advertiser georg wagner was added to its hull three weeks later before the deutslandfahrt on march 26 no formal naming ceremony for the airship was ever held 18flag of the deutsche zeppelinreederei gmb hthe airship was operated commercially by the deutsche zeppelin reederei gmb h dzr which had been established by hermann göring in march 1935 to increase nazi influence over airship operations 19 the dzr was jointly owned by the luftschiffbau zeppelin the airships builder the reichsluftfahrtministerium german air ministry and deutsche lufthansa a g germanys national airline at that time and also operated the lz 127 graf zeppelin during its last two years of commercial service to south america from 1935 to 1937 hindenburg and its sister ship the lz 130 graf zeppelin ii launched in september 1938 were the only two airships ever purposebuilt for regular commercial transatlantic passenger operations although the latter never entered passenger service before being scrapped in 1940 after a total of six flights made over a threeweek period from the zeppelin dockyards where the airship had been built hindenburg was ready for its formal public debut with a 4100mile 6598 km propaganda flight around germany  die deutschlandfahrt made jointly with the graf zeppelin from march 26 to 29 20 this was to be followed by its first commercial passenger flight a fourday transatlantic voyage to rio de janeiro that departed from the friedrichshafen airport in nearby löwenthal on march 31 21 after again departing from löwenthal on may 6 on its first of ten round trips to north america made in 1936 22 all hindenburg  s subsequent transatlantic flights to both north and south america originated at the airport at frankfurt am main 23 24die deutschlandfahrt  editpropaganda leaflet dropped from hindenburg during the deutschlandfahrt quoting adolf hitlers march 7th rhineland speech in the reichstag march 29 1936 plebiscite ballot although designed and built for commercial transatlantic passenger air freight and mail service at the behest of the reich ministry for public enlightenment and propaganda  reichsministerium für volksaufklärung und propaganda or propagandaministerium hindenburg was first pressed into use by the air ministry its dlz cooperator as a vehicle for the delivery of nazi propaganda 25 on march 7 1936 ground forces of the german reich had entered and occupied the rhineland a region bordering the netherlands luxembourg belgium and france which had been designated in the 1920 treaty of versailles as a demilitarized zone established to provide a buffer between germany and those neighboring countries in order to justify its remilitarization —which was also a violation of the 1925 locarno pact 26 —a post hoc plebiscite or referendum was quickly called by hitler for march 29 to ask the german people to both ratify the rhineland’s occupation by the german army and to approve a single party list composed exclusively of nazi candidates to sit in the new reichstag the hindenburg and the graf zeppelin were designated by the government as a key part of the process 27as a public relations ploy propaganda minister goebbels demanded that the zeppelin company make the two airships available to fly in tandem around germany over the fourday period prior to the voting with a joint departure from löwenthal on the morning of march 26 28 while gusty wind conditions that morning would prove to make the process of safely launching the new airship a difficult one hindenburg  s commander captain ernst lehmann was determined to impress the politicians nazi party officials and press present at the airfield with an on time departure and thus proceeded with its launch despite the adverse conditions as the massive airship began to rise under full engine power it was caught by a 35degree crosswind gust causing its lower vertical tail fin to strike and be dragged across the ground resulting in significant damage to the bottom portion of the airfoil and its attached rudder 29 30zeppelin company chairman eckener who had opposed the joint flight both because it politicized the airships and had forced the cancellation of an essential final endurance test for hindenburg was furious and rebuked lehmann 31graf zeppelin which had been hovering above the airfield waiting for hindenburg to join it had to start off on the propaganda mission alone while lz 129 returned to its hangar there temporary repairs were quickly made to its empennage before joining up with the smaller airship several hours later 32 as millions of germans watched from below the two giants of the sky sailed over

accident at die deutschlandfahrt with the completion of voting on the referendum which the german government claimed had been approved by a 9879 yes vote 34 35  hindenburg returned to löwenthal on march 29 to prepare for its first commercial passenger flight a transatlantic passage to rio de janeiro scheduled to depart from there on march 31 36 hugo eckener was not to be the commander of the flight however but was instead relegated to being a supervisor with no operational control over hindenburg while ernst lehmann had command of the airship 37 to add insult to injury eckener learned from an associated press reporter upon hindenburgs arrival in rio that goebbels had also followed through on his monthold threat to decree that eckeners name would no longer be mentioned in german newspapers and periodicals and no pictures nor articles about him shall be printed 38 this action was taken because of eckeners opposition to using hindenburg and graf zeppelin for political purposes during the deutschlandfahrt and his refusal to give a special appeal during the reichstag election campaign endorsing chancellor adolf hitler and his policies 39 the existence of the ban was never publicly acknowledged by goebbels and it was quietly lifted a month later 40while at rio the crew noticed one of the engines had noticeable carbon buildup from being run at low speed during the propaganda flight days earlier 41 on the return flight from south america the automatic valve for gas cell 3 stuck open 42 gas was transferred from other cells through an inflation line it was never understood why the valve stuck open and subsequently the crew only used the handoperated maneuvering valves for cells 2 and 3 38 hours after departure one of the airships four daimlerbenz 16cylinder diesel engines engine car no 4 the forward port engine suffered a wrist pin breakage damaging the piston and cylinder repairs were started immediately and the engine functioned on fifteen cylinders for the remainder of the flight four hours after engine 4 failed engine no 2 aft port was shut down as one of two bearing cap bolts for the engine failed and the cap fell into the crank case the cap was removed and the engine was run again but when the ship was off cape juby the second cap broke and the engine was shut down again the engine was not run again to prevent further damage with three engines operating at a speed of 626 miles per hour 1007 kmh and headwinds reported over the english channel the crew raised the airship in search of counter trade winds usually found above 5000 feet 1500 m well beyond the airships pressure altitude unexpectedly the crew found such a wind at the lower altitude of 3600 feet 1100 m which permitted them to guide the airship safely back to germany after getting emergency permission from france to fly a more direct route over the rhone valley the nineday flight covered 12756 miles 20529 km in 203 hours and 32 minutes of flight time 43 all four engines were later overhauled and no further problems were encountered on later flights 44 for the rest of april hindenburg remained at its hangar where the engines were overhauled and the lower fin and rudder received a final repair the ground clearance of the lower rudder was increased from 8 to 14 degrees1936 transatlantic season  editlz 129 arrival at nas lakehurst may 9 1936 uss los angeles zr3 is moored upper right hindenburg made 17 round trips across the atlantic in 1936—its first and only full year of service—with ten trips to the united states and seven to brazil the flights were

of the season back to frankfurt 56during 1936 hindenburg had a blüthner aluminium grand piano placed on board in the music salon though the instrument was removed after the first year to save weight 57 over the winter of 1936–37 several alterations were made to the airships structures the greater lift capacity allowed ten passenger cabins to be added nine with two beds and one with four increasing passenger capacity to 72 these windowed cabins were along the starboard side aft of the previously installed accommodations and it was anticipated for the lz 130 to also have these cabins 58 additionally the olympic rings painted on the hull were removed for the 1937 season hindenburg also had experimental aircraft hookon trapeze similar to the one on the u s navy goodyearzeppelin built airships akron and macon this was intended to allow customs officials to be flown out to hindenburg to process passengers before landing and to retrieve mail from the ship for early delivery experimental hookons and takeoffs piloted by ernst udet were attempted on march 11 and april 27 1937 but were not very successful owing to turbulence around the hookup trapeze the loss of the ship

site the exact location of the initial fire its source of ignition and the source of fuel remain subjects of debate the cause of the accident has never been determined conclusively although many hypotheses have been proposed sabotage theories notwithstanding one hypothesis often put forth involves a combination of gas leakage and atmospheric static conditions escaping hydrogen gas in this specific case from incomplete or damaged vents along the top of the vessel and especially near the rear upper tail fin will typically burn after mixing with air and will explode when mixed with air in the right proportions this along with the high static collected from flying within stormy conditions could have combined to ignite the leaking gas and down the airship in addition a certain amount of gas may have been inexplicably lost out the top of the vessel for at the same time water ballast was noticeably released to slow the rate of descent the initial explosion would therefore have been the result of the quickening fire reaching the gas bags themselves via the compromised aftmost vent at the vessels stern another more recent theory involves the airships outer covering the silvery cloth covering contained material including cellulose nitrate which is highly flammable 66 this theory is controversial and has been rejected by other researchers 67 because the outer skin burns too slowly to account for the rapid flame propagation 60 and gaps in the fire correspond with internal gas cell divisions which wouldnt be visible if the fire spread across the skin first 67 hydrogen fires had previously destroyed many other airships 68the duralumin framework of hindenburg was salvaged and shipped back to germany there the scrap was recycled and used in the construction of military aircraft
