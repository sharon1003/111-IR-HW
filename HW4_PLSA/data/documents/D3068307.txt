flooding traffic on voters minds at district g candidate forum briar forest super neighborhoodkim jackson chronicle correspondentpublished 530 am tuesday october 20 2009at a district g election forum on oct 13 outgoing houston city councilmember pam holm encouraged voters to listen closely to the words of the five candidates running for the seat she will vacate on the council at the end of this year dexter handy george foulard oliver pennington richard sedita and mills worsham are the candidates in that race“you are here tonight to see the candidates — one of which you will elect to serve you for the next two years and hopefully six years” holm said “as i look back at this time six years ago i was in the same position i encourage you to ask your questions and if you don’t get the answers contact the candidates or go to their web sites and find out where they stand on the issues”the new briar forest midwest and eldridgewest oaks super neighborhoods banded together to host the forum so that residents could hear where the candidates stand on issues important to district g said colin eddington briar forest super neighborhood vice president district g is known for having a high rate of voter turnout so in addition to the district g candidates several mayoral and council atlarge position candidates were on hand to campaign before and after the forum eddington said below are two questions posed during the district g candidates forum each candidate had one minute to state a response q what specifically will you do to coordinate activities of city and county agencies that are responsible for drainage infrastructure and flood reductionmaintenance projects oliver pennington we must get these agencies to talk to each other we have a situation in the gessner roadinterstate 10 area where several agencies and some private entities may be responsible we need to get them talking to each other we also need to get agencies to recognize each other as partners and work together for the benefit of our citizens mills worsham we must sit down and deal with all parties responsible for various flood control operations we must work with all agencies – the county city flood control district and memorial city tirz tax increment reinvestment zone – and make sure we are holding their feet to the fire we need to get these problems solved any way we can dexter handy i have seen a lot of fingerpointing over the years and a lot of frustrated neighbors i want to make sure all agencies are on the same page i think we need to work with the harris county flood control district in a more comprehensive manner the city and county need to set priorities and to come up with a comprehensive flood management plan george foulard i think it is largely an issue of communication i talked with the harris county flood control director and let him know that district g flood projects are a priority and that maintenance is important and also a very high priority richard sedita the city and county have to work together to get the flooding problem solved we need to identify major problem areas and set priorities the district g drainage systems were put in many years ago and are in great need of updating i believe we should take advantage of the current lower contractor prices to get projects funded q houston mayor bill white has said that one way the city of houston can reduce financial obligations is to reduce waste that enters the landfills how would you encourage recycling in district g dexter handy in addition to encouraging residents to recycle i would encourage businesses to be more “green” we need recycling in every neighborhood not just a few we need industry and businesses to participate george foulard in july i had the opportunity to meet with the city of houston’s solid waste department director harry hayes and learned that we have been granted money to purchase recycling bins this coupled with a robust public relations program in the district g office will give us the opportunity to expand our recycling program richard sedita i would like to see more availability of recycling centers around town that would make it convenient and costeffective for people rather than having to pay an additional charge every month oliver pennington we need to do several large and small things the city of san antonio is employing a recycling firm where they can collect all recyclables in one bin – that is a great idea we need more places to recycle when we need to bring it to the schools and educate our children about recycling mills worsham we need a change in our mindset we can place centers all around town and distribute bins to our neighborhoods but the first thing we have to do is make up our minds to take the first step and recycle it is for the good of our city q millions of dollars are spent by residential neighborhoods in district g to hire supplemental security and accordingly the houston police department has shifted their resources our residents are essentially doubletaxed and receive less attention than others from hpd what will you do to help residents shoulder the cost richard sedita our law enforcement agencies needs to coordinate so there is no duplication of services and there is coverage for all residents right now they do not have the ability to communicate by radio with each other so it is difficult to work together oliver pennington i don’t think the city can make the argument that we don’t need hpd protection in district g our residents feel left out and badly treated when they have to hire security service we have a political argument to make to increase hpd protection first we need to work with city hall if after that we do not get the same level of protection from hpd then we need to be compensated mills worsham we all need to feel safe and that when we need an officer they will be there whether it is hpd or other law enforcement agencies they need to coordinate to cover all areas and they need to do some streamlining one of first moves mayor bill white made was to take officers off the street to man the city jail we need to reverse that right away dexter handy we need to have the 58 law enforcement agencies in our area on the same radio frequency we have a realtime crime center and we need to utilize that we need to get that information on our web site and take advantage of the internet twitter email and all other methods to get realtime information out to our residents george foulard given the challenges we have in the city budget we need to allow overtime to get more officers on the streets in the city of bellaire each officer has to cover very block of his beat at least once during a shift we need to implement those – and other – standards q how will you assist neighborhoods suffering form cutthrough traffic speeders and noise to improve their quality of life this is related to a situation in which the city of houston closed the east and west rivercrest streets at westheimer road thus eliminating two of three streets that connect briar forest drive to westheimer between beltway 8 and gessner road this question related to a situation in district g in which the city of houston closed the east and west rivercrest streets at westheimer road thus eliminating two of three streets that connect briar forest drive to westheimer between beltway 8 and gessner road as a result briargrove park residents say seagler road is bearing the brunt of traffic that once traversed all three streets and more than 1400 briargrove park residents have signed a petition asking the city of houston to reverse the closure they say the city of houston did not follow due process and allow residents in nearby communities to comment on the closure before it was implemented mills worsham we have to give city residents due process this situation is a travesty and due process was not followed the city took a problem from one area and shifted it to another that will not happen on my watch dexter handy we have to make sure due process is followed in all areas and there must be transparency we must make sure we do not have another rivercrest george foulard no area should suffer at the expense of another when a situation like this arises we must make sure that the proper process is followed we need to make sure this does not happen again i will make sure i am aware of these issues richard sedita i should be able to drive any street maintained by city tax dollars i am against closing streets i live on a cutthrough street and am aware of the problems that come with that but we can deal with those through increased law enforcement presence street closings should not be done unless people take over maintenance of those streets and they are taken off the tax rolls oliver pennington i oppose rivercrest – it was bad city planning we do not have a thoroughfare plan where we do not allow residences on main streets we need to try to overcome bad planning in the past to reduce cutthrough traffic problems in many areas q in district g there are apartment complexes that are rundown plagued with crime and do not comply with city codes what are your plans to make improvements in this area george foulard i met with the houston police chief and he said these apartment complexes are the driving force behind crime we need to put police officers in there and make them part of their beat we need to drive away the crime at the root we need to assign specific crime prevention measures to these apartment complexes richard sedita the city should meet with property owners to make sure they are keeping their properties maintained and they should be held accountable for safety of their residents there should be additional police officer patrols in apartment complex areas oliver pennington briar forest and wilcrest is one of those areas with problem apartment complexes the briar forest super neighborhood is working on an effort that i believe will be successful and information about that could be spread throughout district g mills worsham kudos to the briar forest super neighborhood for their ideas and efforts the problem complexes should correct those issues or the city should close them down we should encourage higherend development in areas where that happens we need to get rid of those who do not want to be assets to our community dexter handy hpd’s “blue star” program should be implemented in apartment complexes and then they should be required to be recertified every year or every six months let’s go back to neighborhood policing and again we need to use the realtime crime center and get this information out to each and every citizen then we will all be on the lookout and that helps in crime
