9 trans fatladen foods to avoid when it comes to foods that cause high cholesterol saturated fats used to be seen as public enemy number one we now know that trans fats — fats formed by adding hydrogen to liquid unsaturated fatty acids and resulting in a particular chemical arrangement of hydrogen which makes the fats solid and prevents spoiling — can be just as dangerous if not more so trans fats raise bad or lowdensity lipoprotein ldl cholesterol levels and lower beneficial highdensity lipoprotein hdl cholesterol levels increasing heart disease risk these dangers have led to transfat legislation first at restaurants in new york city where they are limited to less than 05 grams per serving and then in the entire state of california “both coasts have joined the movement including cities in new york pennsylvania maryland massachusetts washington and connecticut” says maria haisley rd a clinical dietitian at elkhart general hospital in indiana to make it easier to maintain a hearthealthy diet at home in 2006 the u s food and drug administration required all foods and beverages to list trans fats on the nutrition facts label says haisley however a food with less than 05 grams per serving can still be labeled as transfat free “it’s important to not only read the nutrition facts panel on a package of food but also the ingredient list” says lisa sheehansmith ed d rd associate professor of nutrition and food science at middle tennessee state university in murfreesboro “if partially hydrogenated vegetable oils are in the food and in particular near the beginning of the list then that food contains trans fat — and more than you may realize those 03 and 04 grams do add up when you consume a processed food diet” here are 10 redflag foods to avoid steer clear of fried foods french fries fried chicken and other traditional fried dishes can be notorious transfat and highcholesterol foods “instead of deep frying try pan frying or sautéing says kim kircherr rd a dietitian for jewelosco supermarkets in illinois this is a nice step in the right direction and eases the transition for people who are used to eating fried foods” for a hearthealthy diet be sure to use liquid oils like olive or canola as a heartsmarter fat and in a measured amount to keep total fat and calories in check forgo fast foods fast food gets a lot of blame these days for problems with the highcholesterol american diet but the reality is that many restaurant chains now offer hearthealthy diet options that you can order instead of those laden with trans fats “on a menu scan for foods that are fresh and steer clear of the fried foods and things loaded with cheese sauce and condiments” haisley suggests “look for salads grilled fish or chicken baked chips baked potato fruit and ask for condiments to be on the side so you are in control also skip the fried desserts cookies and pies and look for a fresh fruit or yogurt treat”nix the nondairy creamer many people choose nondairy creamer as a simple inexpensive way to add flavor to their morning coffee what they dont realize is that it contains trans fats that can contribute to high cholesterol “try 1percent milk instead” says kircherr “it’s a richertasting choice than fatfree milk but still acceptable on a hearthealthy diet want something thicker try evaporated skim milk ditch the dessert mixes storebought cake mixes and frostings may be convenient but many have high amounts of trans fats which makes their empty calories even less desirable for a hearthealthy diet “try baking a cake from scratch the good oldfashioned way” suggests haisley “incorporate healthy fats from oil and sprinkle powdered sugar on top instead of frosting” that’s a great alternative to highcholesterol butter cream too choose frozen foods carefully you don’t have to skip the frozen food aisle when you’re shopping for a hearthealthy diet you just need to discern between the nutritious choices and those transfat and highcholesterol containing foods by reading labels and choosing foods nearest to their natural form “stock up on frozen veggies and fruits without sauces to add to casseroles soups stews and smoothies and look for lean or extralean protein sources” says kircherr “choose fish that’s not breaded and remember that how you cook and serve it at home matters too”dump the doughnuts when it comes to doughy treats the best way to avoid trans fats is to avoid these highcholesterol foods entirely “doughnuts usually only come one way and that way is fried” says haisley “if you want to maintain your hearthealthy diet choose something else good options are wholegrain toast english muffins a bran muffin or a fruit and yogurt treat”stick it to stick margarine for years people believed that stick margarine was a better choice than butter as far as highcholesterol foods go then we learned that it’s absolutely loaded with trans fats for your hearthealthy diet “choose a soft tub margarine with the least amount of transsaturated fat or try one of the sprays for flavor without all that fat or calories” suggests kircherr dont rely on refrigerated dough they seem so easy and convenient but many of those tubes of refrigeratorcase dough — the kind precut for biscuits cinnamon rolls cookies and the like — are loaded with trans fats for a hearthealthy diet “go for wholegrain rolls or bread instead as an addition to your meal” says haisley or as with cakes make your own with wholesome ingredients and unsaturated omega3 rich oil part ways with microwave popcorn popcorn can be part of a hearthealthy diet but not when it’s loaded with salt highcholesterol butter and other unhealthy ingredients and with many brands of microwave popcorn you’ll often find unwanted trans fats as well “airpop your own kernels and add your own flavors and spices” says haisley “try it sweet too with a small amount of honey and cinnamon”
