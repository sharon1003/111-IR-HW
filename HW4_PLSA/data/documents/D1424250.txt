please hover over any star to get more information orion the hunter is a constellation lying on the celestial equator it is one of the brightest and best known constellations in the sky it is also one of the few constellations known since ancient times early greek writers such as homer and hesiod made references to orion in their works in greek mythology orion was a hunter son of the sea god poseidon and the cretan princess euryale it was said that poseidon had given orion the ability to walk on water the constellation orion is depicted as a man raising his club and shield facing the charge of a bull represented by the neighbouring constellation taurus and standing next to the river eridanus the tale that corresponds to this representation is not found in greek mythology however but sumerian one the sumerians believed that the constellation which they called uru anna light of heaven represented their hero gilgamesh fighting the bull of heaven gud anna which corresponds to the constellation taurus even though the greek equivalent for gilgamesh is heracles who was once given the task to catch the cretan bull and ptolemy described the constellation known as orion as a man with a club and lions pelt not unlike heracles there is no solid evidence of a connection between the constellation orion and heracles in the sky orion and his two dogs represented by the constellations canis major and canis minor are seen pursuing a hare lepus in another tale orion fell in love with the pleiades a star cluster in taurus  the seven daughters of atlas and pleione and kept pursuing them until zeus took them away and placed them among the stars where orion can still be seen following them across the sky the myth of orions death is linked to the constellation scorpius which lies on the opposite side of the sky orion was said to have boasted to the goddess artemis and her mother leto that he could defeat any animal on earth the earth heard this and sent a scorpion which stung orion and killed him for this reason when the constellation scorpius rises in the east orion disappears below the horizon in the west the constellation orion carries great

air shaft in the kings chamber in the great pyramid was aligned with the star alnitak providing the king with the path to the heavens the constellation orion occupies an area of 594 square degrees and contains three stars with known planets it can be seen at latitudes between 85° and 75° and is best visible at 9 pm during the month of january the constellation currently lies south of the ecliptic and will keep moving further south as a result of precession orion contains some of the brightest stars in the sky 5971 beta orionis or rigel the foot the brightest star in orion is the sixth brightest star in the sky it is a blue supergiant located at orion’s left foot it is a very old star that will soon either become a supernova or shed its outer layers and turn into a white dwarf it is approximately 800 lightyears distant 5972 alpha orionis or betelgeuse the hand of the central one the second brightest star in the constellation is also the twelfth brightest star in the sky it is a massive red supergiant another very old star that will soon explode into a supernova betelgeuse marks the right shoulder of orion and is approximately 640 lightyears distant it is a variable star and occasionally appears brighter than 5971 rigel 5973 gamma orionis or bellatrix the female warrior is the 21st brightest star in the sky it is a blue giant an eruptive variable star marking the hunter’s left shoulder it is sometimes also known as the amazon star the three stars forming orion’s belt are 5977 delta 5974 epsilon and 5975 zeta orionis 5977 delta orionis or mintaka region is an eclipsing binary variable star system that consists of a large blue giant and an otype white star it is approximately 900 lightyears distant 5974 epsilon orionis or alnilam the string of pearls is a bluewhite supergiant about four million years old it is the central star of orion’s belt and the 30th brightest star in the sky 5975 zeta orionis or alnitak the girdle is a triple star with a hot blue supergiant the brightest class o star in the sky for a primary component it is approximately 800 lightyears distant 5976 kappa orionis or saiph the sword marks orions right foot it is a blue supergiant about 720 lightyears distant 5978 iota orionis also known as hatsya or na’ir al saif the bright one o the sword marks the tip of orion’s sword it is a quadruple star system with a hot blue giant for a primary component 5985 sigma orionis is another interesting multiple star system the primary component is composed of a blue dwarf one of the most luminous stars known and a btype dwarf the other component is also composed of two dwarfs both btype the last component is an atype dwarf sigma orionis is approximately 1150 lightyears distant 5981 lambda orionis also known as meissa the shining one and heka a white spot is a binary star composed of a blue giant and a hot bluewhite dwarf together with 5993 phi1 and 5987 phi2 orionis it forms a triangle that marks orion’s head the most notable deep sky object in the constellation is the orion nebula messier 42 located under orions belt it is a starforming region with clouds of dust and gas the orion trapezium cluster or simply the trapezium is located in the centre of the orion nebula it is an open cluster marked by an asterism of four stars the brightest one of which is 6023 theta1 orionis c the stars represent orion’s sword seen hanging from his belt ic 434 or the horsehead nebula appears as a dark cloud of thick dust in the shape of a horse’s head the nebula is located near 5975 zeta orionis messier 43 or ngc 1982 is also known as de mairan’s nebula it is one of the starforming regions in the orion nebula separated from the larger nebula by a large turbulent black lane messier 78 or ngc 2068 is a reflection nebula originally catalogued as a cometlike object it is the brightest diffuse reflection nebula in the orion complex barnard’s loop is an emission nebula in the shape of a loop that covers most of the constellation and appears to centre on the orion nebula the loop is believed to have been created in a supernova explosion about two million years ago the flame nebula ngc 2024 is another emission nebula 5975 zeta orionis shines ultraviolet light into the nebula’s clouds of hydrogen gas and the glow is the result of the recombined electrons and ionized hydrogen the nebulae in orion are all part of the orion molecular cloud complex one of the most active starforming regions in the sky the cloud is hundreds of lightyears across in size and lies between 1500 and 1600 lightyears away from earth it appears very bright in infrared wavelengths orion belongs to the orion family of constellations along with canis major canis minor monoceros and lepus constellations directly bordering orion are gemini eridanus taurus lepus and monoceros
