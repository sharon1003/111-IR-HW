productive or dry cough chest pain fever and trouble breathing 2 severity is variable 2pneumonia is usually caused by infection with viruses or bacteria and less commonly by other microorganisms certain medications and conditions such as autoimmune diseases 4 5 risk factors include other lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis copd and asthma diabetes heart failure a history of smoking a poor ability to cough such as following a stroke or a weak immune system 6 diagnosis is often based on the symptoms and physical examination 7 chest xray blood tests and culture of the sputum may help confirm the diagnosis 7 the disease may be classified by where it was acquired with community hospital or health care associated pneumonia 14vaccines to prevent certain types of pneumonia are available 9 other methods of prevention include handwashing and not smoking 9 treatment depends on the underlying cause 15 pneumonia believed to be due to bacteria is treated with antibiotics 10 if the pneumonia is severe the affected person is generally hospitalized 15 oxygen therapy may be used if oxygen levels are low 10pneumonia affects approximately 450 million people globally 7 of the population and results in about 4 million deaths per year 11 12 pneumonia was regarded by william osler in the 19th century as the captain of the men of death 16 with the introduction of antibiotics and vaccines in the 20th century survival improved 11 nevertheless in developing countries and among the very old the very young and the chronically ill pneumonia remains a leading cause of death 11 17 pneumonia often shortens suffering among those already close to death and has thus been called the old mans friend 18contents  hide 1 signs and symptoms2 cause21 bacteria22 viruses23 fungi24

67–75sputum 60–65chest pain 39–49main symptoms of infectious pneumonia people with infectious pneumonia often have a productive cough fever accompanied by shaking chills shortness of breath sharp or stabbing chest pain during deep breaths and an increased rate of breathing 8 in the elderly confusion may be the most prominent sign 8the typical signs and symptoms in children under five are fever cough and fast or difficult breathing 20 fever is not very specific as it occurs in many other common illnesses may be absent in those with severe disease malnutrition or in the elderly in addition a cough is frequently absent in children less than 2 months old 20 more severe signs and symptoms in children may include bluetinged skin unwillingness to drink convulsions ongoing vomiting extremes of temperature or a decreased level of consciousness 20 21bacterial and viral cases of pneumonia usually present with similar symptoms 22 some causes are associated with classic but nonspecific clinical characteristics pneumonia caused by legionella may occur with abdominal pain diarrhea or confusion 23 while pneumonia caused by streptococcus pneumoniae is associated with rusty colored sputum 24 and pneumonia caused by klebsiella may have bloody sputum often described as currant jelly 19 bloody sputum known as hemoptysis may also occur with tuberculosis gramnegative pneumonia and lung abscesses as well as more commonly with acute bronchitis 21 mycoplasma pneumonia may occur in association with swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck joint pain or a middle ear infection 21 viral pneumonia presents more commonly with wheezing than does bacterial pneumonia 22 pneumonia was historically divided into typical and atypical based on the belief that the presentation predicted the underlying cause 25 however evidence has not supported this distinction thus it is no longer emphasized 25cause the bacterium streptococcus pneumoniae a common cause of pneumonia imaged by an electron microscope pneumonia is due to infections caused primarily by bacteria or viruses and less commonly by fungi and parasites although there are more than 100 strains of infectious agents identified only a few are responsible for the majority of the cases mixed infections with both viruses and bacteria may occur in up to 45 of infections in children and 15 of infections in adults 11 a causative agent may not be isolated in approximately half of cases despite careful testing 18the term pneumonia is sometimes more broadly applied to any condition resulting in inflammation of the lungs caused for example by autoimmune diseases chemical burns or drug reactions however this inflammation is more accurately referred to as pneumonitis 26 27conditions and risk factors that predispose to pneumonia include smoking immunodeficiency alcoholism chronic obstructive pulmonary disease asthma chronic kidney disease liver disease and old age 21 28 the use of acidsuppressing medications—such as protonpump inhibitors or h2 blockers —is associated with an increased risk of pneumonia 29 approximately 10 of people who require mechanical ventilation develop ventilator associated pneumonia 30 and people with gastric feeding tube have an increased risk of developing of aspiration pneumonia 31bacteria main article bacterial pneumonia cavitating pneumonia as seen on ct pneumonia due to mrsa bacteria are the most common cause of communityacquired pneumonia cap with streptococcus pneumoniae isolated in nearly 50 of cases 32 33 other commonly isolated bacteria include haemophilus influenzae in 20 chlamydophila pneumoniae in 13 and mycoplasma pneumoniae in 3 of cases 32staphylococcus aureus moraxella catarrhalis legionella pneumophila and gramnegative bacilli 18 a number of drugresistant versions of the above infections are becoming more common including drugresistant streptococcus pneumoniae drsp and methicillinresistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa 21the spreading of organisms is facilitated when risk factors are present 18alcoholism is associated with streptococcus pneumoniae anaerobic organisms and mycobacterium tuberculosis smoking facilitates the effects of streptococcus pneumoniae haemophilus influenzae moraxella catarrhalis and legionella pneumophila exposure to birds is associated with chlamydia psittaci farm animals with coxiella burnetti aspiration of stomach contents with anaerobic organisms and cystic fibrosis with pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus 18 streptococcus pneumoniae is more common in the winter 18 and should be suspected in persons aspirating a large amount of anaerobic organisms 21viruses main article viral pneumonia in adults viruses account for approximately a third 11 and in children for about 15 of pneumonia cases 34 commonly implicated agents include rhinoviruses coronaviruses influenza virus respiratory syncytial virus rsv adenovirus and parainfluenza 11 35 herpes simplex virus rarely causes pneumonia except in groups such as newborns persons with cancer transplant recipients and people with significant burns 36 people following organ transplantation or those otherwise immunocompromised present high rates of cytomegalovirus pneumonia 34 36 those with viral infections may be secondarily infected with the bacteria streptococcus pneumoniae staphylococcus aureus or haemophilus influenzae particularly when other health problems are present 21 34 different viruses predominate at different periods of the year during influenza season for example influenza may account for over half of all viral cases 34 outbreaks of other viruses also occasionally occur including hantaviruses and coronavirus 34fungi main article fungal pneumonia fungal pneumonia is uncommon but occurs more commonly in individuals with weakened immune systems due to aids immunosuppressive drugs or other medical problems 18 37 it is most often caused by histoplasma capsulatum blastomyces cryptococcus neoformans pneumocystis jiroveci  pneumocystis pneumonia or pcp and coccidioides immitis histoplasmosis is most common in the mississippi river basin and coccidioidomycosis is most common in the southwestern united states 18 the number of cases has been increasing in the later half of the 20th century due to increasing travel and rates of immunosuppression in the population 37 for people infected with hivaids pcp is a common opportunistic infection 38parasites main article parasitic pneumonia a variety of parasites can affect the lungs including toxoplasma gondii strongyloides stercoralis ascaris lumbricoides and plasmodium malariae 39 these organisms typically enter the body through direct contact with the skin ingestion or via an insect vector 39 except for paragonimus westermani most parasites do not affect specifically the lungs but involve the lungs secondarily to other sites 39 some parasites in particular those belonging to the ascaris and strongyloides genera stimulate a strong eosinophilic reaction which may result in eosinophilic pneumonia 39 in other infections such as malaria lung involvement is due primarily to cytokineinduced systemic inflammation 39 in the developed world these infections are most common in people returning from travel or in immigrants 39 around the world these infections are most common in the immunodeficient 40noninfectious main article idiopathic interstitial pneumonia idiopathic interstitial pneumonia or noninfectious pneumonia 41 is a class of diffuse lung diseases they include diffuse alveolar damage organizing pneumonia nonspecific interstitial pneumonia lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia desquamative interstitial pneumonia respiratory bronchiolitis interstitial lung disease and usual interstitial pneumonia 42mechanisms pneumonia fills the lungs alveoli with fluid hindering oxygenation the alveolus on the left is normal whereas the one on the right is full of fluid from pneumonia pneumonia frequently starts as an upper respiratory tract infection that moves into the lower respiratory tract 43 it is a type of pneumonitis lung inflammation 44viral viruses may reach the lung by a number of different routes respiratory syncytial virus is typically contracted when people touch contaminated objects and then they touch their eyes or nose 34 other viral infections occur when contaminated airborne droplets are inhaled through the mouth or nose 21 once in the upper airway the viruses may make their way in the lungs where they invade the cells lining the airways alveoli or lung parenchyma 34 some viruses such as measles and herpes simplex may reach the lungs via the blood 45 the invasion of the lungs may lead to varying degrees of cell death 34 when the immune system responds to the infection even more lung damage may occur 34 primarily white blood cells mainly mononuclear cells generate the inflammation 45 as well as damaging the lungs many viruses simultaneously affect other organs and thus disrupt other body functions viruses also make the body more susceptible to bacterial infections in this way bacterial pneumonia can occur at the same time as viral pneumonia 35bacterial most bacteria enter the lungs via small aspirations of organisms residing in the throat or nose 21 half of normal people have these small aspirations during sleep 25 while the throat always contains bacteria potentially infectious ones reside there only at certain times and under certain conditions 25 a minority of types of bacteria such as mycobacterium tuberculosis and legionella pneumophila reach the lungs via contaminated airborne droplets 21 bacteria can spread also via the blood 22 once in the lungs bacteria may invade the spaces between cells and between alveoli where the macrophages and neutrophils defensive white blood cells attempt to inactivate the bacteria 46 the neutrophils also release cytokines causing a general activation of the immune system 47 this leads to the fever chills and fatigue common in bacterial pneumonia 47 the neutrophils bacteria and fluid from surrounding blood vessels fill the alveoli resulting in the consolidation seen on chest xray 48diagnosis crackles crackles heard in the lungs of a person with pneumonia using a stethoscope problems playing this file see media help pneumonia is typically diagnosed based on a combination of physical signs and a chest xray 49 however the underlying cause can be difficult to confirm as there is no definitive test able to distinguish between bacterial and nonbacterial origin 11 49the world health organization has defined pneumonia in children clinically based on either a cough or difficulty breathing and a rapid respiratory rate chest indrawing or a decreased level of consciousness 50 a rapid respiratory rate is defined as greater than 60 breaths per minute in children under 2 months old greater than 50 breaths per minute in children 2 months to 1 year old or greater than 40 breaths per minute in children 1 to 5 years old 50 in children low oxygen levels and lower chest indrawing are more sensitive than hearing chest crackles with a stethoscope or increased respiratory rate 51 grunting and nasal flaring may be other useful signs in children less than five years old 52in general in adults investigations are not needed in mild cases 53 there is a very low risk of pneumonia if all vital signs and auscultation are normal 54 in persons requiring hospitalization pulse oximetry chest radiography and blood tests —including a complete blood count serum electrolytes creactive protein level and possibly liver function tests —are recommended 53 procalcitonin may help determine the cause and support who should receive antibiotics 55the diagnosis of influenzalike illness can be made based on the signs and symptoms however confirmation of an influenza infection requires testing 56 thus treatment is frequently based on the presence of influenza in the community or a rapid influenza test 56physical exam physical examination may sometimes reveal low blood pressure high heart rate or low oxygen saturation 21 the respiratory rate may be faster than normal and this may occur a day or two before other signs 21 25 examination of the chest may be normal but it may show decreased chest expansion on the affected side harsh breath sounds from the larger airways that are transmitted through the inflamed lung are termed bronchial breathing and are heard on auscultation with a stethoscope 21 crackles rales may be heard over the affected area during inspiration 21 percussion may be dulled over the affected lung and increased rather than decreased vocal resonance distinguishes pneumonia from a pleural effusion 8imaging a chest xray showing a very prominent wedgeshape area of airspace consolidation in the right lung characteristic of acute bacterial lobar pneumonia ct of the chest demonstrating rightside pneumonia left side of the imagea chest radiograph is frequently used in diagnosis 20 in people with mild disease imaging is needed only in those with potential complications those not having improved with treatment or those in which the cause is uncertain 20 53 if a person is sufficiently sick to require hospitalization a chest radiograph is recommended 53 findings do not always match the severity of disease and do not reliably separate between bacterial infection and viral infection 20xray presentations of pneumonia may be classified as lobar pneumonia bronchopneumonia also known as lobular pneumonia and interstitial pneumonia 57 bacterial communityacquired pneumonia classically show lung consolidation of one lung segmental lobe which is known as lobar pneumonia 32 however findings may vary and other patterns are common in other types of pneumonia 32 aspiration pneumonia may present with bilateral opacities primarily in the bases of the lungs and on the right side 32 radiographs of viral pneumonia may appear normal appear hyperinflated have bilateral patchy areas or present similar to bacterial pneumonia with lobar consolidation 32 radiologic findings may not be present in the early stages of the disease especially in the presence of dehydration or may be difficult to be interpreted in the obese or those with a history of lung disease 21 a ct scan can give additional information in indeterminate cases 32lung ultrasound may also be useful in helping to make the diagnosis 58pneumonia seen by ultrasound 59pneumonia seen by ultrasound 59pneumonia seen by ultrasound 59right middle lobe pneumonia in a child as seen on plain x ray microbiology in patients managed in the community determining the causative agent is not costeffective and typically does not alter management 20 for people who do not respond to treatment sputum culture should be considered and culture for mycobacterium tuberculosis should be carried out in persons with a chronic productive cough 53 testing for other specific organisms may be recommended during outbreaks for public health reasons 53 in those hospitalized for severe disease both sputum and blood cultures are recommended 53 as well as testing the urine for antigens to legionella and streptococcus 60 viral infections can be confirmed via detection of either the virus or its antigens with culture or polymerase chain reaction pcr among other techniques 11 the causative agent is determined in only 15 of cases with routine microbiological tests 8classification main article classification of pneumonia pneumonitis refers to lung inflammation pneumonia refers to pneumonitis usually due to infection but sometimes noninfectious that has the additional feature of pulmonary consolidation 61 pneumonia is most commonly classified by where or how it was acquired communityacquired aspiration healthcareassociated hospitalacquired and ventilatorassociated pneumonia 32 it may also be classified by the area of lung affected lobar pneumonia bronchial pneumonia and acute interstitial pneumonia 32 or by the causative organism 62 pneumonia in children may additionally be classified based on signs and symptoms as nonsevere severe or very severe 63the setting in which pneumonia develops is important to treatment 64 65 as it correlates to which pathogens are likely suspects 64 which mechanisms are likely which antibiotics are likely to work or fail 64 and which complications can be expected based on the persons health status community main article communityacquired pneumonia communityacquired pneumonia cap is acquired in the community 64 65 outside of health care facilities compared with health care–associated pneumonia it is less likely to involve multidrugresistant bacteria although the latter are no longer rare in cap 64 they are still less likely healthcare health care–associated pneumonia hcap is an infection associated with recent exposure to the health care system 64 including hospital outpatient clinic nursing home dialysis center chemotherapy treatment or home care 65 hcap is sometimes called mcap medical care–associated pneumonia hospital hospitalacquired pneumonia is acquired in a hospital specifically pneumonia that occurs 48 hours or more after admission which was not incubating at the time of admission 65 64 it is likely to involve hospitalacquired infections with higher risk of multidrugresistant pathogens also because hospital patients are often ill which is why they are present in the hospital accompanying disorders are an issue ventilator ventilatorassociated pneumonia occurs in people breathing with the help of mechanical ventilation 64 30 ventilatorassociated pneumonia is specifically defined as pneumonia that arises more than 48 to 72 hours after endotracheal intubation 65differential diagnosis several diseases can present with similar signs and symptoms to pneumonia such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd asthma pulmonary edema bronchiectasis lung cancer and pulmonary emboli 8 unlike pneumonia asthma and copd typically present with wheezing pulmonary edema presents with an abnormal electrocardiogram cancer and bronchiectasis present with a cough of longer duration and pulmonary emboli presents with acute onset sharp chest pain and shortness of breath 8prevention prevention includes vaccination environmental measures and appropriate treatment of other health problems 20 it is believed that if appropriate preventive measures were instituted globally mortality among children could be reduced by 400000 and if proper treatment were universally available childhood deaths could be decreased by another 600000 22vaccination vaccination prevents against certain bacterial and viral pneumonias both in children and adults influenza vaccines are modestly effective at preventing symptoms of influenza 11 66 the center for disease control and prevention cdc recommends yearly influenza vaccination for every person 6 months and older 67 immunizing health care workers decreases the risk of viral pneumonia among their patients 60vaccinations against haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae have good evidence to support their use 43 there is strong evidence for vaccinating children under the age of 2 against streptococcus pneumoniae  pneumococcal conjugate vaccine  68 69 70 vaccinating children against streptococcus pneumoniae has led to a decreased rate of these infections in adults because many adults acquire infections from children a streptococcus pneumoniae vaccine is available for adults and has been found to decrease the risk of invasive pneumococcal disease but there is insufficient evidence to suggest using the pneumococcal vaccine to prevent pneumonia or mortality in the general adult population 71 the cdc recommends that young children and adults over the age of 65 receive the pneumococcal vaccine as well as older children or younger adults who have an increased risk of getting pneumococcal disease 70 the pneumococcal vaccine has been shown to reduce the risk of community acquired pneumonia in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd but does not reduce mortality or the risk of hospitalization for people with this condition 72 people with copd are suggested to have a pneumococcal vaccination 72 other vaccines for which there is support for a protective effect against pneumonia include pertussis varicella and measles 73medications when influenza outbreaks occur medications such as amantadine or rimantadine may help prevent the condition however are associated with side effects 74 zanamivir or oseltamivir decrease the chance that those exposed will develop symptoms however it is recommended that potential side effects are taken into account 75other smoking cessation 53 and reducing indoor air pollution such as that from cooking indoors with wood or dung are both recommended 20 22 smoking appears to be the single biggest risk factor for pneumococcal pneumonia in otherwisehealthy adults 60 hand hygiene and coughing into ones sleeve may also be effective preventative measures 73 wearing surgical masks by the sick may also prevent illness 60appropriately treating underlying illnesses such as hivaids diabetes mellitus and malnutrition can decrease the risk of pneumonia 22 73 76 in children less than 6 months of age exclusive breast feeding reduces both the risk and severity of disease 22 in those with hivaids and a cd4 count of less than 200 cellsu l the antibiotic trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole decreases the risk of pneumocystis pneumonia 77 and is also useful for prevention in those that are immunocomprised but do not have hiv 78testing pregnant women for group b streptococcus and chlamydia trachomatis and administering antibiotic treatment if needed reduces rates of pneumonia in infants 79 80 preventive measures for hiv transmission from mother to child may also be efficient 81 suctioning the mouth and throat of infants with meconium stained amniotic fluid has not been found to reduce the rate of aspiration pneumonia and may cause potential harm 82 thus this practice is not recommended in the majority of situations 82 in the frail elderly good oral health care may lower the risk of aspiration pneumonia 83 zinc supplementation in children 2 months to five years old appears to reduce rates of pneumonia 84for people with low levels of vitamin c in their diet or blood taking vitamin c supplements may be suggested to decrease the risk of pneumonia although there is no strong evidence of benefit 85 there is insufficient evidence to recommend that the general population take vitamin c to prevent pneumonia 85management curb65symptom points c onfusion 1u rea7 mmoll 1r espiratory rate30 1s b p 90mm hg d b p60mm hg 1age 65 1oral antibiotics rest simple analgesics and fluids usually suffice for complete resolution 53 however those with other medical conditions the elderly or those with significant trouble breathing may require more advanced care if the symptoms worsen the pneumonia does not improve with home treatment or complications occur hospitalization may be required 53 worldwide approximately 7–13 of cases in children result in hospitalization 20 whereas in the developed world between 22 and 42 of adults with communityacquired pneumonia are admitted 53 the curb65 score is useful for determining the need for admission in adults 53 if the score is 0 or 1 people can typically be managed at home if it is 2 a short hospital stay or close followup is needed if it is 3–5 hospitalization is recommended 53 in children those with respiratory distress or oxygen saturations of less than 90 should be hospitalized 86 the utility of chest physiotherapy in pneumonia has not yet been determined 87 88 noninvasive ventilation may be beneficial in those admitted to the intensive care unit 89 overthecounter cough medicine has not been found to be effective 90 nor has the use of zinc in children 91 there is insufficient evidence for mucolytics 90 there is no strong evidence to recommend that children who have nonmeasles related pneumonia take vitamin a supplements 92bacterial antibiotics improve outcomes in those with bacterial pneumonia 12 increased use of antibiotics however may lead to the development of antimicrobial resistant strains of bacteria 93 antibiotic choice depends initially on the characteristics of the person affected such as age underlying health and the location the infection was acquired antibiotic use is also associated with side effects such as nausea diarrhea dizziness taste distortion or headaches 93 in the uk treatment before culture results with amoxicillin is recommended as the first line for communityacquired pneumonia with doxycycline or clarithromycin as alternatives 53 in north america where the atypical forms of communityacquired pneumonia are more common macrolides such as azithromycin or erythromycin  and doxycycline have displaced amoxicillin as firstline outpatient treatment in adults 33 94 in children with mild or moderate symptoms amoxicillin taken by mouth remains the first line 86 95 96 the use of fluoroquinolones in uncomplicated cases is discouraged due to concerns about sideeffects and generating resistance in light of there being no greater clinical benefit 33 97for those who require hospitalization and caught their pneumonia in the community the use of a βlactam such as cephazolin plus macrolide such as azithromycin or a fluoroquinolones is recommended 98the duration of treatment has traditionally been seven to ten days but increasing evidence suggests that shorter courses 3–5 days may be effective for certain types of pneumonia and may reduce the risk of antibiotic resistance 99 100 101 for pneumonia that is associated with a ventilator caused by nonfermenting gramnegative bacilli nfgnb a shorter course of antibiotics increases the risk of that pneumonia will return 100 recommendations for hospitalacquired pneumonia include third and fourthgeneration cephalosporins carbapenems fluoroquinolones aminoglycosides and vancomycin 65 these antibiotics are often given intravenously and used in combination 65 in those treated in hospital more than 90 improve with the initial antibiotics 25 for people with ventilatoracquired pneumonia the choice of antibiotic therapy will depend on the persons risk of being infected with a strain of bacteria that is multidrug resistant 30the addition of corticosteroids to standard antibiotic treatment appears to improve outcomes 102 103 reducing the rate of mortality and morbidity for adults with severe community acquired pneumonia and reducing morbidity for adults and children with nonsevere community acquired pneumonia 104 there are adverse effects associated with the use of corticosteroids such as high blood sugar 104 there is some evidence that adding corticosteroids to the standard pcp pneumonia treatment may be beneficial for people who are infected with hiv 38the use of granulocyte colony stimulating factor gcsf along with antibiotics does not appear to reduce mortality and routine use for treating pneumonia is not supported by evidence 105viral neuraminidase inhibitors may be used to treat viral pneumonia caused by influenza viruses  influenza a and influenza b  11 no specific antiviral medications are recommended for other types of community acquired viral pneumonias including sars coronavirus adenovirus hantavirus and parainfluenza virus 11 influenza a may be treated with rimantadine or amantadine while influenza a or b may be treated with oseltamivir zanamivir or peramivir 11 these are of most benefit if they are started within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms 11 many strains of h5n1 influenza a also known as avian influenza or bird flu have shown resistance to rimantadine and amantadine 11 the use of antibiotics in viral pneumonia is recommended by some experts as it is impossible to rule out a complicating bacterial infection 11 the british thoracic society recommends that antibiotics be withheld in those with mild disease 11 the use of corticosteroids is controversial 11aspiration in general aspiration pneumonitis is treated conservatively with antibiotics indicated only for aspiration pneumonia 106 the choice of antibiotic will depend on several factors including the suspected causative organism and whether pneumonia was acquired in the community or developed in a hospital setting common options include clindamycin a combination of a betalactam antibiotic and metronidazole or an aminoglycoside 107 corticosteroids are sometimes used in aspiration pneumonia but there is limited evidence to support their effectiveness 106prognosis with treatment most types of bacterial pneumonia will stabilize in 3–6 days 3 it often takes a few weeks before most symptoms resolve 3 xray finding typically clear within four weeks and mortality is low less than 1 21 108 in the elderly or people with other lung problems recovery may take more than 12 weeks in persons requiring hospitalization mortality may be as high as 10 and in those requiring intensive care it may reach 30–50 21 pneumonia is the most common hospitalacquired infection that causes death 25 before the advent of antibiotics mortality was typically 30 in those that were hospitalized 18complications may occur in particular in the elderly and those with underlying health problems 108 this may include among others empyema lung abscess bronchiolitis obliterans acute respiratory distress syndrome sepsis and worsening of underlying health problems 108clinical prediction rules clinical prediction rules have been developed to more objectively predict outcomes of pneumonia 25 these rules are often used in deciding whether or not to hospitalize the person 25pneumonia severity index or psi score 25curb65 score which takes into account the severity of symptoms any underlying diseases and age 109pleural effusion empyema and abscess a pleural effusion as seen on chest xray the a arrow indicates fluid layering in the right chest the b arrow indicates the width of the right lung the volume of the lung is reduced because of the collection of fluid around the lung in pneumonia a collection of fluid may form in the space that surrounds the lung 110 occasionally microorganisms will infect this fluid causing an empyema 110 to distinguish an empyema from the more common simple parapneumonic effusion the fluid may be collected with a needle  thoracentesis  and examined 110 if this shows evidence of empyema complete drainage of the fluid is necessary often requiring a drainage catheter 110 in severe cases of empyema surgery may be needed 110 if the infected fluid is not drained the infection may persist because antibiotics do not penetrate well into the pleural cavity if the fluid is sterile it must be drained only if it is causing symptoms or remains unresolved 110in rare circumstances bacteria in the lung will form a pocket of infected fluid called a lung abscess 110 lung abscesses can usually be seen with a chest xray but frequently require a chest ct scan to confirm the diagnosis 110 abscesses typically occur in aspiration pneumonia and often contain several types of bacteria longterm antibiotics are usually adequate to treat a lung abscess but sometimes the abscess must be drained by a surgeon or radiologist 110respiratory and circulatory failure pneumonia can cause respiratory failure by triggering acute respiratory distress syndrome ards which results from a combination of infection and inflammatory response the lungs quickly fill with fluid and become stiff this stiffness combined with severe difficulties extracting oxygen due to the alveolar fluid may require long periods of mechanical ventilation for survival 34sepsis is a potential complication of pneumonia but occurs usually in people with poor immunity or hyposplenism the organisms most commonly involved are streptococcus pneumoniae haemophilus influenzae and klebsiella pneumoniae other causes of the symptoms should be considered such as a myocardial infarction or a pulmonary embolism 111epidemiology main article

common illness affecting approximately 450 million people a year and occurring in all parts of the world 11 it is a major cause of death among all age groups resulting in 4 million deaths 7 of the worlds total death yearly 11 12 rates are greatest in children less than five and adults older than 75 years 11 it occurs about five times more frequently in the developing world than in the developed world 11 viral pneumonia accounts for about 200 million cases 11 in the united states as of 2009 pneumonia is the 8th leading cause of death 21children in 2008 pneumonia occurred in approximately 156 million children 151 million in the developing world and 5 million in the developed world 11 in 2010 it resulted in 13 million deaths or 18 of all deaths in those under five years of which 95 occurred in the developing world 11 20 113 countries with the greatest burden of disease include india 43 million china 21 million and pakistan 10 million 114 it is the leading cause of death among children in low income countries 11 12 many of these deaths occur in the newborn period the world health organization estimates that one in three newborn infant deaths is due to pneumonia 115 approximately half of these deaths can be prevented as they are caused by the bacteria for which an effective vaccine is available 116 in 2011 pneumonia was the most common reason for admission to the hospital after an emergency department visit in the u s for infants and children 117history wpa poster 19361937pneumonia has been a common disease throughout human history 118 the word is from greek πνεύμων pneúmōn meaning lung 119 the symptoms were described by hippocrates c 460 bc – 370 bc 118 peripneumonia and pleuritic affections are to be thus observed if the fever be acute and if there be pains on either side or in both and if expiration be if cough be present and the sputa expectorated be of a blond or livid color or likewise thin frothy and florid or having any other character different from the common when pneumonia is at its height the case is beyond remedy if he is not purged and it is bad if he has dyspnoea and urine that is thin and acrid and if sweats come out about the neck and head for such sweats are bad as proceeding from the suffocation rales and the violence of the disease which is obtaining the upper hand 120 however hippocrates referred to pneumonia as a disease named by the ancients he also reported the results of surgical drainage of empyemas maimonides 1135–1204 ad observed the basic symptoms that occur in pneumonia and that are never lacking are as follows acute fever sticking pleuritic pain in the side short rapid breaths serrated pulse and cough 121 this clinical description is quite similar to those found in modern textbooks and it reflected the extent of medical knowledge through the middle ages into the 19th century edwin klebs was the first to observe bacteria in the airways of persons having died of pneumonia in 1875 122 initial work identifying the two common bacterial causes streptococcus pneumoniae and klebsiella pneumoniae was performed by carl friedländer 123 and albert fraenkel 124 in 1882 and 1884 respectively friedländers initial work introduced the gram stain a fundamental laboratory test still used today to identify and categorize bacteria christian gram s paper describing the procedure in 1884 helped to differentiate the two bacteria and showed that pneumonia could be caused by more than one microorganism 125sir william osler known as the father of modern medicine appreciated the death and disability caused by pneumonia describing it as the captain of the men of death in 1918 as it had overtaken tuberculosis as one of the leading causes of death in this time this phrase was originally coined by john bunyan in reference to consumption tuberculosis 126 127 osler also described pneumonia as the old mans friend as death was often quick and painless when there were much slower and more painful ways to die 18several developments in the 1900s improved the outcome for those with pneumonia with the advent of penicillin and other antibiotics modern surgical techniques and intensive care in the 20th century mortality from pneumonia which had approached 30 dropped precipitously in the developed world vaccination of infants against haemophilus influenzae type b began in 1988 and led to a dramatic decline in cases shortly thereafter 128 vaccination against streptococcus pneumoniae in adults began in 1977 and in children in 2000 resulting in a similar decline 129society and culture see also list of
