 image credit faith durandopen cooking lesson i can still remember the first time i made a pot of homecooked beans up until then my only experience of beans was straight from a can cooking dried beans felt exotic and oldfashioned fancy and cowboy all at once i took my first bite of a simple batch of good mother stallard beans from rancho gordo and almost yelled out loud — they surprised me so much deeply rich and meaty swimming in a broth that came just from the beans — no garlic and onions — it seemed like kitchen witchery that transformed dry beans and water into such flavor beans have become a regular staple in my kitchen since then no less magical for their familiarity but i did discover an even more magical way to cook them in the oven let me explain why this is my favorite method of all image credit faith durandwhats the best way to cook beans there are plenty of good ways to cook beans on the stove in the slow cooker and in the pressure cooker how to cook beans on the stove how to cook beans in the slow cooker how to cook beans in a pressure cooker all have their advantages and disadvantages but i was prompted to choose my favorite when a reader jeff emailed a few years ago and said he was ready to take the plunge into cooking dried beans heres the gist of his question — maybe youve wondered something similar youve finally convinced me to make the switch to dried beans and im excited to say that i picked up some garbanzo and black beans at the north market this weekend i chose those beans so i could start with something i know and incorporate them into successful recipes ive made with canned beans but im not sure what to do next how do i turn a bag of dried beans into a yummier equivalent of a can of beans soak or cook or both just parboil what about salt and aromatics while cooking to soak not to soak does salt make the beans tough how long do i cook for such a simple homey food beans can feel a little complicated so i decided to share the most handsoff troublefree way to cook beans that i know image credit faith durandwhy i cook beans in the oven after cooking quite a few pots of beans on the stove i came across a great article from the great russ parsons at the los angeles times he bakes his dried beans in a covered pot at a low temperature and he swears that you dont need to soak when using this method i gave it a try and was blown away it gave soft creamy beans that werent split apart or turned into mush it also cooked the beans in less than 2 hours without a presoak amazingi love the oven method because i find it the quickest after the pressure cooker and also the least likely to crack the beans they cook evenly and without any handson time when cooking on the stove it can be tricky to keep a low simmer and i often find that i have to top up the pot with water not so in the oven just leave them be while you eat dinner and watch your favorite tv show or while youre lazing about the house on a saturday last but not least i find the flavor best when cooked in the oven the spices and seasonings really permeate the beans and i find their flavor blooms better than on the stove choosing beans and a potthe best results will be from great heirloom beans like the ones from rancho gordo and other growers who are preserving terrific heirloom varieties with tons of flavor also the traditional clay pot like these wonderful pots from la chamba will help your beans cook nicely and give them an earthy smoky flavor but you can also use any ovensafe pot with a lid just make sure you give the beans plenty of space to expand theyll grow as they cook to about three times their original volume image credit faith durandto soak or not to soak when i first shared this method i was pretty hooked on the idea of not soaking beans i often want beans just an hour or two before dinner and completely forget about the soaking step however these days i still soak when i remember to do it because i find that the beans do cook a bit faster and more evenly here are some of the pros and cons of soaking your beans before cooking them pros they cook faster and more evenly especially when youre dealing with larger beans or beans that have been in the cupboard for a long time certain beans like chickpeas really must be soaked or theyll never soften also soaking — its not that hard just dump them in a bowl with some water and go to bed easier said than done for me but still cons you have to dump them in a bowl and cover them with water before going to bed most beans will cook just fine without soaking again large beans old beans and chickpeas are an exception here also some cooks argue that the soaking leaches out some of the flavor and makes the beans flabby ive cooked plenty of beans with soaking not soaking and with the quicksoak method but as long as theyre cooked in the gentle even heat of the oven theyve always turned out beautifully so this is the method i use it takes a lot longer to explain than to actually do itusing beans in recipes substituting freshlycooked beans for canned beans substitute based on volume a 15ounce can of beans will give you slightly less than 2 cups of beans so substitute 1 34 cups of freshly cooked beans for 1 can how much 1 pound of beans makes one pound of dried beans will yield roughly the amount of 3 15ounce cans of beans or about 5 cups using beans in soups cook the beans slightly less leaving them a little al dente in the center before adding them to a soup that will be simmered soak the beans eight hours or the night before you want to cook the beans pour them into a bowl and cover them with an ample quantity of water stir in 1 heaping tablespoon salt let the beans sit all night at room temperature then pour off the water in the morning and proceed to cooking note on soaking as i discuss above this method works really well even if you dont soak your beans i do try to remember to soak as i find they cook faster and more evenly — especially when dealing with enormous beans like these chestnut beauties but you can also skip soaking or do a fast soak as detailed in the recipe notes how to cook beans in the oven makes 4 to 6 cups cooked beans what you need ingredients 1 pound dried beans salt and freshly ground black pepper garlic cloves optional bay leaf optional other herbs dried or fresh optional equipment 3quart or larger ovensafe pot with a lid such as a dutch oven instructions soak the beans eight hours or the night before you want to cook the beans pour them into a bowl and cover them with an ample quantity of water stir in 1 heaping tablespoon salt let the beans sit all night at room temperature then pour off the water in the morning and proceed to cooking note on soaking as i discuss above this method still works really well even if you dont soak your beans i do try to remember to soak as i find they cook faster and more evenly — especially when dealing with enormous beans like these chestnut beauties but you can also skip soaking or do a fast soak as detailed in the recipe notes heat the oven to 325°f and put beans in an ovensafe pot heat the oven to 325°f drain the beans and put them in an ovensafe pot that holds at least 3 quarts i like using this dutch oven but a clay pot is also very good stir in salt and pepper add 1 teaspoon salt and a generous quantity of black pepper to the beans add smashed garlic cloves a bay leaf and other herbs if desired these aromatics are optional good beans have plenty of flavor on their own but i often like to add a few smashed cloves of garlic and some red pepper flakes or a sprig of rosemary cover with water cover the beans with water there should be at least 1 inch of water above the beans bring the pot to a boil on the stove  note if cooking red kidney beans or white cannellini beans boil for a full 15 minutes both contain levels of a toxin present when eaten raw or undercooked and if you want to be on the safe side boil them before putting them in the oven to ensure this is completely gone bake for 75 minutes then check cover the beans put in the oven and cook for 75 minutes taste the beans to see if they are soft and cooked through small beans such as little pintos will often be done at this point especially if they soaked all night if they are still mealy or crunchy inside put them back in the oven and continue checking in 15 to 20 minute intervals until done this will usually take no more than 90 minutes but allow more time if your beans are large or if they werent soaked taste and season with additional salt if desired note smaller beans will cook faster very large beans like the ones i show here can take significantly longer these were not soaked and took about 3 hours to cook completely beans often also soften more in the refrigerator overnight on soaking salting  digestion fastsoaking beans if you dont soak overnight you can do a quicksoak by bringing the beans to a boil covered with water then taking them off the heat let soak for 1 hour then pour off the water proceed as directed above read more on this method how to quicksoak dried beans in just one hour salting beans many cooks believe that salting beans at the beginning of cooking makes them tough weve seen through some good work by cooks illustrated that this isnt the case and actually its beneficial to soak your beans in briny salted water which helps season the beans and also starts the process of softening them we usually soak in salted water overnight then add a little more salt while cooking the beans read more about this think salt is the enemy of perfect beans think again digestion most people have a little well digestive trouble after eating beans weve tried a lot of different ways to minimize this soaking no soaking salt herbs and
