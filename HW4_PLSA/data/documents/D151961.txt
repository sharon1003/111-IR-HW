cfcs chlorofluorocarbons cfcsthe chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs for short have recently received a great deal of attention and notoriety as a result of being implicated in the destruction of the ozone layer cfcs also known as freons are a family of chemicals based upon hydrocarbon skeletons most often methane where some or all of the hydrogens have been replaced with chlorine andor fluorine atoms these compounds are nonflammable tasteless and odourless and chemically stable their other important property is their volatility having boiling points close to zero degrees centigrade these physical properties make them ideal for use as refrigerant gases in air conditioners freezers and refrigerators their low boiling points also make them ideal for blowing agents for foam plastics allowing the foam to expand as the liquid cfc boils cfc11 cfc12 carbon tetrachloride 111trichloroethane an example of a refrigerant cfc is dichlorodifluoromethane cf 2 cl 2 also known as cfc12 which boils at 30°c another oncecommon cfc is trichlorofluoromethane cfcl 3 cfc11 which boils at 24°c and was once the propellant in around half of all the aerosol cans used in the world these and other cfcs and the chemically similar chlorocarbons such as methylene chloride ch 2 cl 2 and carbon tetrachloride ccl 4 were often used as solvents for cleaning computer parts printed circuit boards and as dry cleaning agents for clothes carbon tetrachloride itself was once used as a fluid in certain fire extinguishers another wellknown chlorocarbon solvent is 111trichloroethane which was once used in typing correction fluid under the name tippex ozone holes it is ironic that one of the properties that make cfcs so suitable for use in household items such as refrigerators their chemical stability should be the cause of their undoing most chemicals when released into the atmosphere get rapidly broken down into smaller harmless components by reactions in the lower atmosphere the cfcs however are so stable and unreactive that they survive to reach the highest levels of the atmosphere and become globally distributed in the stratosphere at these high altitudes the intensity of ultraviolet radiation is so great that even the stable cfcs are split apart to release a chlorine atom it is the atomic chlorine that does the damage since it can react with ozone o 3 to form oxygen the cl atom is regenerated in this reaction and so the breakup of only one cfc molecule can initiate the subsequent removal of thousands of ozone molecules this has recently become a major cause for concern since the ozone forms a vital protective layer in the upper atmosphere shielding the earth and all its plants and animals from the harmful effect of the suns uv radiation damage to the ozone layer would let more uv through to reach the planets surface leading to an increase in skin cancers in animals and humans and damage to vegetation the discovery of the hole in the ozone layer above the antarctic in the 1980s led to a united nations protocol to reduce the use of cfcs and other chlorocarbons as solvents refrigerants and aerosols by 50 by 1999 and a total ban soon after cfcs are now banned from aerosols and replacements for their use in refrigeration based on ammonia or the less dangerous hydrofluorocarbons hfcs are now being introduced however cfcs are so tenacious that it will take many years before they are all removed from the atmosphere some estimates say that the ozone layer may not reestablish itself properly for a century or more
