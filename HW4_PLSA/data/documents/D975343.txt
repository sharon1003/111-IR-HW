twodollar words but when it comes time to getting things done they know how to act they use their smarts to get it done what area of expertise do you know here are just a few areas you might consider

speech pterodactyls and pterorhynchus and a 99 suit and a 6000 suit cars men flock to cars for the same reason they flock to women theyre beautiful intriguing complex no wonder men refer to cars in feminine terms maybe youre the kind of man whose buddies bring their car to when they need a clutch replaced or the oil changed history increasingly rare the man whos a student of history gives himself the benefit of a very wide lens when contemplating problems he can draw on roman artillery strategy cold war negotiating tactics and obscure french economic policy among others he knows that history isnt just about preventing the mistakes of the past from happening in the future women some men turn the opposite sex into a field of study if you want to be knowledgeable about women be prepared to make mistakes and learn from them theres nothing worse than a man who thinks hes gods gift to women but whos stubbornly insulting cavalier and clueless note that this does not apply to all men and that such stereotypes like being a ladysman are not only outdated but also presumptuous3 know when youve made a mistake and know when to say im sorry  theres nothing wrong with making a mistake only the insecure man thinks that making a mistake is bad because hes not comfortable with who he is in the first place confident men know when theyre wrong and arent afraid to admit it learn to say im sorry in different ways men know that saying sorry doesnt always have to be verbal a ticket to a baseball game breakfast in bed and a camping trip are all ways to say im sorry without moving the old vocal chords back and forth men know that these are often more effective ways of communicating regret than two measly words4 know the mancode what is the mancode the mancode is an unwritten set of rules that some men live by often evolving but rarely changing if it means something to you take the mancode seriously it might tell other men that you respect them as much as you respect yourself remember that this is all to be taken with a pinch of salt every man is different you are different and if this list doesnt resonate with you or mean anything to you do not feel as though you have to go out of your way to achieve these things here are a few items on the list dating nonos you may never date another friends sister or sibling unless you actually intend on marrying them you may never date another friends ex unless you have his explicit permission explicit permission means actually asking him share your possessions when possible if a friend asks for a pair of work boots a drill or a crockpot a day in advance you should be kind enough to loan it to him cars lucky items or partners are not necessarily applicable birthday presents for other men are always optional if pressed for information you may always lie and tell them your significant other ordered you to act never initiate conversation with other men at a urinal station it is never acceptable to choose a urinal immediately adjacent to another man if an open furtherremoved urinal is available no smileyfaces or emoticons are necessary when texting another guy although acceptable not preferable to use when texting loveinterests keep use to a bare minimum5 let go of selfdestructive thoughts or customs understand that all men in all cultures may have to some extent been socialized in ways that may be psychologically and culturally damaging and may bring unhappiness the first step in creating a sense of self in manhood is to examine the environment in which you were raised as objectively as you can did you grow up in a culture where it was acceptable to abuse someone whether physically or verbally who was out of line or insubordinate violence is more often the result of cowardice than a genuine impulse to solve a problem using violence or threats against friends or family to show your authority is unhealthy and damaging were you taught that being tough means suppressing emotion holding in tears and never exposing vulnerability the drawback here is that you also learn to internalize and suppress these emotions which then fester and get worse focus on being a different kind of tough be a reliable strong figure who can handle adversity were you taught to hatefear anyone whos homosexual understand that only one thing makes you gay having a romantic and sexual preference for people of the same gender the kind of music you like the clothes you wear whether you cry at sad movies buying your wife flowers being sensitive or nice to others — none of that makes you gay outward displays of homophobia point to a mans own sexual insecurity not his prowess and is not cool in any way shape or form part 2 body1 clean yourself even if you are living out in the woods a man knows that cleaning ones body is necessary every animal does it but dont fall into the trap of grooming yourself as part of some modernist social trend grooming has become a business and corporations and companies never tire of convincing you that you need endless amounts of unnecessary products the modern grooming and manscaping business is all done in order to make money not because its noble healthy or moral you dont have to shave every day especially not if you are growing a beard some men can not grow a proper beard and thats okay maybe then its better to stay clean shaven other men have very good beard growth which is natures call to them to grow a full beard men tend to be afraid of what potential partners think of facial hair no one should dominate you into shaving you beard when you dont want to be yourself as nature created you be your own self you dont have to shave your chest or body hair in general you dont have to live up to any nonsensical and superficial image of smooth chiseled plastic man created by modern fashion advertising and movie industry again in order to make money be proud of what makes you a man and the physical attributes nature has created to give you your male identity shower and bathe when necessary a man benefits from showering when he is dirty or smelly — not necessarily every day some may choose to stay dirty or smelly for a good reason working on a car or about to work out you can cut your hair and finger nails regularly most men like nononsense haircuts although some men prefer hair that is a little longer or style and that is fine also2 exercise being a man doesnt mean you need to be ripped it does mean you need to take care of your body for some men that does mean lifting weights adjust to the responsibility of being a by keeping fit do cardio yoga or pilates not only for women strength training or sports combined with a healthy diet at the very least walk about 30 minutes a day to burn fat and build some muscle3 wear clothes that fit you your clothes dont need to be designer or cost an arm and a leg they do however need to fit you not all men are muscular and stocky and therefore dont look great in baggy loosefitting clothes all men will need great jeans one pair of casual jeans one pair of work jeans and one pair of formal jeans should round out your wardrobe build around the basics some buttondown shirts again a couple casual item a couple for work and a couple formal buttondowns should be enough for the average man decent shoes men probably want between three and five different kinds of shoes at any given time formal shoes for work andor big occasions tennis shoes work boots casual shoes chukkas laceups sneakers etc  or slightlylessthanformal shoes oxfords topsiders loafers etc mix and match depending on your needs and habits4 dont use drugs as a crutch men are born adventurers making the lure of drugs very real men who are comfortable with themselves tend not to rely on the crutch of drugs for support even with bills weighing them down work staring them in the face and personal projects not to mention football looming men find a way to appreciate the beauty of life without sedating themselves part 3 spirit1 develop your own principles a man isnt always comfortable being judge jury and executioner but he knows right from wrong and expects others to play by the same rules look inside yourself and ask would i want someone else doing that to me this should help you develop principles to live by a man never steals even if he is desperate a desperate man learns to ask others to help him instead of helping himself to something he is not entitled to a man helps others in need he knows when others are down on their luck and need a helping hand even if the utility lies in the gesture itself a man trusts his friends significant others and family he follows through with what he says hell do and expects others to do the same a man never lies — to himself or others he develops a conscience that gives him good feedback and allows him to be comfortable with the truth even if it hurts2 be ambitious in your own way men are naturally ambitious we want to be breadwinners and have the admiration and respect of our peers not all men choose the same career paths however so ambition doesnt always amount to the same thing whatever career or profession you choose you may have many set goals for yourself live up to or exceed them and reinvent yourself whenever you need to define your own idea of success3 seek responsibility and take responsibility for your actions the main difference between a man and a boy and adult and a child is that men are responsible men honor their commitments accept their duties and are accountable for their actions men clean up after themselves figuratively and literally men know that anyone can father a baby but only a man who understands and accepts responsibility can be a good father men refuse to make anyone do anything they themselves are unwilling to do as a result they appreciate the difficulty and risk other people take on their behalf4 learn to make sacrifices for the people you love and care about making sacrifices is part of growing up whether you like it or not the difference between a man and a boy is that a man steps up to the plate while a boy hesitates or complains especially for the people in his life that he loves a man looks at sacrifice — whether it means devoting time money or other resources to people aside from himself — as his duty5 be a good man integrity is doing the right thing for the right reason even when no one is watching it can be tempting to think that by meeting your selfdefined responsibilities as a man your job is done but that doesnt always make you a good person never stop trying to do the right thing and reevaluating your character and integrity if youre going to be a man be a good man or else its no better than remaining a boy part 4 love1 use your inner gentleman your inner gentleman tells you the things to do that you know you should — but sometimes are too lazy — to do paying for dates unless the loveinterest in question views the act as some barbaric throwback to a more misogynistic time treat with caution opening doors helping into chairs and saying please and thank you generally putting the lover in question ahead of yourself out of respect doing domestic duties some men who are already in longterm relationships shirk their domestic duties forgetting to take out the trash do the dishes change the diapers real men know that they must share in domestic duties as unpleasant as they may be being a gracious loser man are naturally competitive making this a tough one for some accept defeat with the same grace that you accept victory easier said than done2 dont kiss and tell men love the chase of romance but too often get lured into bragging about the conquest dont fall victim to the notion that if you dont brag about it it didnt happen success in love speaks loud enough for itself a quiet confidence will perhaps even suggest to your friends that youre a regular lothario even if youre not3 always treat your significant other with respect a simple list of dos and donts do  listen to what they have to say forgive them when they make a simple mistake follow through on what you say youll do treat them the same way youd like to be treated dont  hold them to unrealistic expectations manipulate them to get whatever you want treat them as an object instead of a person assume that you know how theyll feel or react4 dont rush a relationship lots of guys rush people into uncomfortable situations by doing this they not only alienate the lover but also keep themselves from getting what they want straight men know that when it comes to dating the lady sets the pace if she wants to rush into a whirlwind romance hes usually game if she wants to take things slower hell reassure her that hes there for the longhaul by letting her set the pace the man sets the relationship up for success and usually ends up richer in the bargain this can apply to nonheterosexual relationships also but remember for all the best thing in a relationship is the communication talk to your partner5 keep a little mystery in the tank being intriguingly puzzling can be very alluring and seductive to some being mysterious does not mean being the strong silent type it just means holding back a little for a later time surprising with an unexpected skill trait or gesture youre helping people by reading wiki howwiki hows
