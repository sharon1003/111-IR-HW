water for example is strongly cohesive as each molecule may make four hydrogen bonds to other water molecules in a tetrahedral configuration this results in a relatively strong coulomb force between molecules in simple terms the polarity state of which a molecule is oppositely charged on its poles of water molecules allows them to be attracted towards each other the polarity is due to the electronegativity of the atom of oxygen oxygen is more electronegative than the atoms of hydrogen so the electrons they share through the covalent bonds are more often close to oxygen rather than hydrogen these are called polar covalent bonds covalent bonds between atoms that thus become oppositely charged 1 in the case of a water molecule the hydrogen atoms carry positive charges while the oxygen atom has a negative charge this charge polarization within the molecule allows it to align with adjacent molecules through strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding rendering the bulk liquid cohesive van der waals gases such as methane however have weak cohesion due only to van der waals forces that operate by induced polarity in nonpolar molecules
