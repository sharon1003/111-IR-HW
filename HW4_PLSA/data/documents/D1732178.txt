take advantage of passpoint wifi and smart network switching public wifi networks are very useful and it is great to be able to get on the network and access the web email online video music and more the only snag is that establishing a connection isn’t as easy as it could be passpoint changes all that normally when you visit a place that has wifi such as a cafe airport shopping centre and so on you have to turn on the phone go into settings find the wifi settings look through the list of wifi networks select the one to use and log in perhaps by manually entering your username and password what a major pain wifi certified passpoint aims to streamline the process and it enables your phone to connect to local hotspots automatically it just connects without you having to do anything it short it cuts out all the hassle and your phone just works that’s fine but is your phone capable of using wifi certified passpoint your phone may well be capable of using it but the feature is simply turned off best check the settings on a samsung galaxy s4 or s5 for example go to settings select the connections tab at the top tap wifi press the menu button and select advanced turn on passpoint you can tap passpoint to see a list of passpoint wifi hotspots around you but you don’t need to and you just need to switch the feature on if you are sat at home or work and are reading this you probably won’t see any passppoint networks around you because it is designed for public wifi hotspots check it next to you are out if you are curious to see if there are passpoint hotspots around you the whole point of passpoint though is that you never need to fiddle around with wifi again except that those places that don’t offer it another feature that might improve internet access on your phone is smart network switching not all devices have this or they may implement it automatically but you should find it on the better samsung models go to settings and tap wifi there is a smart network switch option and it can be either on or off the idea is that if the internet connection is unstable the phone will switch to the mobile network 3g for example so that apps can continue to access the internet there are pros and cons with this and there isn’t a best setting when switched on apps should have a more reliable internet connection but you may find that your data allowance is used up faster you might also find that a poor wifi connection is actually better than a mobile data connection wifi can be fast even when it isn’t perfect the best setting for this may depend on whether you regularly connect to poor wifi and whether it is a problem try the setting both ways for a few days and see which works the best for you but keep an eye on the data usage when it is switched on facebook twitter google pinterest share details written by roland waddilove created 02 september 2014comments0 chuck kollars 20170519 2049as to many of the features you mentioned variable speed playback streaming rather than downloading and podcast search facilities podcast addict appears to have all these too problem is the podcast addict ui is sufficiently confusing those features may appear to not exist at all but they do reply reply with quote quote report to administrator2 roland 20170520 0813this podcast article was written a long time ago i think it is time for a new look at podcast apps im still using podcast republic but apps change so much over time i need to check the competition reply reply with quote quote report to administrator refresh comments list rss feed for comments to this post add comment jcomments
