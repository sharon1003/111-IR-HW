reaction of the cells in the branches of the lungs secreting too much mucousa and the muscles contracting report danjodeainteresting i note most of the alternative therapies have to do with reducing stress everyone should note there has been extensive research into ibs therapy using hookworm yes the hookworm parasite turns out many cases of ibs are actually allergic reactions when people with diverticulae or ibs symptoms are given worm eggs their symptoms completely resolve the theory is our bodies evolved in conjunction with the parasite and since modern sanitation facilities have essentially removed hookworm from the population peoples immune system has nothing to react to and thus starts to attack the lining of the bowel much like some asthma is an allergic reaction the hookworm poses its own problems so hookworm therapy is not a cure but it is interesting report mirrorballmooni struggled with ibs for more than a year during that time i tried a selfhypnosis recording
