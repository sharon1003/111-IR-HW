environment 10132013 1009 am et updated oct 15 2013electric car charger company ecotality goes bankrupt stranding 13000 docking stations getty from mother nature network’s jim motavalli now here’s a fine mess as laurel and hardy used to say one of the biggest electric vehicle charging companies arizonabased ecotality a nissan leaf partner went bankrupt stranding about 13000 commercial and residential stations we all have a stake in this because american tax dollars supported these installations through the socalled ev project in the early rounds only one bidder emerged an unknown company called tellus power which proposed acquiring ecotality’s assets for just 3 million consider that the federal grants totaled almost 115 million of which almost 100 million was spent and you begin to see the issue here there are clear parallels to what happened to the u s investment in fisker automotive which went bankrupt after spending 192 million of a 529 million loan the feds then seized 21 million in assets but just as i was writing this the floridabased car charging group said that it had won the prize price unspecified “we believe this will solidify our position as the leader in the electric vehicle charging industry” said michael farkas the ceo ccg has been aggressively expansionist and owns paytocharge stations in such places as the parking garages of new york city he’s right this makes the company a big player one of the issues with ecotality’s bankruptcy was making sure its network remains active so users can swipe cards and get billed for the electricity the worst possible outcome would have been to have ecotality’s 3300 public chargers the rest are residential inoperable because nobody could turn on their billing and operating systems nissan was so concerned about the network that it lent ecotality 125 million to get through the auction spokesman brian brockman confirmed come to think of it if those home units didn’t work that would have been horrible too if you see parallels to the big and stillevolving government shutdown you’re paying attention it’s not quite veterans unable to get into war memorials but it’s along the same lines brett hauser president of greenlots which develops openstandard solutions and a board member of the open charge alliance was watching the ecotality debacle he thinks it’s a clear argument applying opensource standards to all new installed chargers that would prevent the embarrassing situation in hawaii where proprietary chargers installed by the bankrupt better place became “orphaned” because its new owners op connect couldn’t find the rfid cards to run them california on national plugin day enacted a law requiring all new chargers to be accessible to credit cards — you shouldn’t have to join a network to use them forrest north chief operating officer of recargo which runs very popular station locator apps recargo and plug share points out “we’re used to buying things from places like amazon with just a credit card these private networks and membership cards have led to nightmarish problems for people who couldn’t get a charge when they needed one”recargo actually has its own solution to this the newly launched pay with plugshare above which lets you use the i phone and android later this year app and your credit card to pay for a charge at any participating public station so far it has sema connect one of the larger providers on board “our focus is on the driver trying to make it as easy and seamless as possible” said north the open charge alliance meanwhile is recruiting internationally including in holland which is very evfriendly to get all the ev players give up the idea of proprietary networks back to ecotality i think car charging group should be a good steward for the company’s assets internationally there are much worse scenarios the aforementioned better place left a lot of stranded assets and so far no credible buyer has emerged for it though iceland’s northern lights energy is interested tellus power is a big question mark the company is based in california but very low profile there—it’s a subsidiary of a chinese company called tusai holding a division asola made solar modules for the fisker karma but that didn’t work out so well tellus has a website here but it’s contentfree so far the u s government closely scrutinized some potential sales of fisker also to chinese interests but i didn’t see any similar uproar here hauser says his greenlots company has “taken a look at the ecotality operation we want to make sure those stations stay up and are used” he added “our perspective is that whoever wins they should continue to have connected stations and make them open source it’s the only way for the electric car adoption to thrive and prosper”here’s some prebankruptcy video that gives you a fuller ecotality picture ecotality your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available click
