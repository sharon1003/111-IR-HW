work and energy conservation mechanical energy describes the ability of an object to do work the work done on an object arises from a force applied over a distance wf d d which either accelerates the object thus changing its motional energy  kinetic energy  or stores energy by changing its position  potential energy  for instance when a moving car is brought to rest the work done by the frictional force on the tires is equal to the kinetic energy of the car ke12 mv 2  in addition forces which are provided by the cars engine can do work in climbing up a hill which is stored as gravitational potential energy pemgh the mechanical energy of an object is equal to the sum of the potential plus kinetic energies ie e  pe  ke and is a direct measure of the total energy available to an object as its speed and position changes from one point to another in special cases where energy is not lost to the environment due to nonconservative forces such as friction the mechanical energy of a system of masses remains constant as the object or objects move in space in other words the energy of the system stays the same for all times in the life of the objects since there is no energy created or destroyed as the objects travel along on their paths the forces which do work exchange energy between potential and kinetic according to the energy initially provided to the system this is the basis for the law of conservation of energy which can be written as e  pe  ke  constant as an example consider an apple of mass m which is initially a height h above the ground when the apple is hanging from the tree it stores an amount of gravitational potential energy as it is held motionless so that the initial mechanical energy is e top  pe top  mgh if the apple is cut from the tree forces due to gravity do work which cause it to fall and speed up at the same time just before it hits the ground the potential energy is zero such that the mechanical energy arises solely due to the kinetic energy e bot  ke bot  12 mv 2  using the conservation of energy for this frictionless problem we can equate the mechanical energy at the top and bottom of the tree or more specifically e top e top pe top  ke botmgh  12 mv 2 it is clear from the equations above that the mechanical energy allows you to relate the position of the apple to its velocity as it falls from the tree as potential energy is lost from the decrease in height above the ground kinetic energy is gained while the object speeds up of course if we include all types of system energy including the internal heating of the object and light or sound given off as it moves we can apply the conservation of energy to cases involving friction or even collisional events in such situations we must be able to compute the work done by the nonconservative forces which tend to reduce the initial mechanical energy provided to the system however if the total energy of the system and environment are taken into consideration we again see that energy is neither created nor destroyed the details of problems involving frictional work will be left for a more advanced course in the subject another case to consider involves an object traveling on a level ground which is brought to rest by an external force since the force is applied over a finite distance then work is done on the mass which decelerates it to a stop the total work required to bring the system to a halt is simply given by the initial kinetic energy there is no change in potential energy if it travels at the same height on the ground so that the kinetic energy is removed from the object by the external forces alternatively if a force is used to speed up a mass the work is equal to the kinetic energy gained by the objectw  ke  12 mv 2 in order to reinforce the concepts noted above consider the following examples which explore the motion of everyday objects as they move in the presence of forces which change either the position or velocity of the masses ex 1 a helicopter drops a 20 kg package from rest at a height of 120 m from the grounda how much initial potential energy is stored by the packageb what is the kinetic energy of the package just before it hits the groundc what is the speed of the package just before it hits the ground solutiona the distance of the package from the ground is given as 120m this provides a reference potential energy at the ground of zero since h0 when the object hits the ground below the helicopter if the zero of gravitational potential energy is defined this way then the potential energy of the package can be written as pe grav mgh  20 kg 10 ms2 120 m  24000 jb by ignoring any energy lost due to friction we can use the conservation of energy to solve for the energy after the package hits the ground since the package is held motionless above the ground we see that the initial mechanical energy is simply the potential energy it has while in the helicopter no ke e top  pe top  ke top  24000 jas the object falls and hits the ground at the bottom it loses all of the potential energy reaches the point where h0 which is transformed into kinetic e bot  pe bot  ke bot  ke bot now applying the concept of energy conservation we equate the energy at the top to the energy at the bottom to get the final answer e bot  e top ke bot  24000 jnotice that this simply says that all of the stored potential energy the package had while in the helicopter is transformed into kinetic just before it hits the groundc since we know the definition of the kinetic energy ke12 mv 2  we just need to solve for the speed of the package by setting the answer above equal to the ke formula ke12 mv 2 12 20 kg v 2  24000 jv 2  2400 m 2 s 2 v  4899 ms ex 2 a 5 kg cannonball is fired from the ground straight up into the air such that it rises to a height of 50 ma what is the potential energy of the cannonball when it gets to its maximum heightb what is the speed of the cannonball just before it falls back to the ground note that if we ignore air friction this is the same as the initial speed of the cannonball when it was fired from the cannon solutiona again we define the zero of potential energy to be the lowest point in the problem where the cannonball is initially fired then we can use the height of the cannonball above the ground to determine the potential energy from the formula pe  mgh  5 kg 10 ms2 50 m  2500 jas in the problem above when the cannonball hits the ground all of the potential energy it had at the maximum height is transformed into kinetic energy using the same idea of energy conservation we relate the potential energy lost by the cannonball to the kinetic gained pe top  ke bot pe lost  ke gained  12 mv 2½ 5 kg v 2  2500 jv 2  1000 m 2 s 2 v 3162 ms ex 3 a 25 kg bowling ball rolls into a wall traveling at 6 ms it crashes into the wall and is brought to rest by the forces acting from the walla how much work was done by the wall in bringing the object to restb if the ball comes to rest in 04 seconds then calculate the power used in stopping the ball solutiona since the bowling ball stops after hitting the wall all of the kinetic energy it had initially is removed by the work due to forces by the wall in this case the work done is equal to the change in kinetic energy of the ball wke w ke  12mv 2w  ½ 25 kg 6 ms 2  45 jb the power is defined as the rate of change in work or energy p  work energytime the energy used to stop the ball was found above from the change in kinetic energy or work done by the wall in bringing the bowling ball to rest using the time to stop the ball in addition to the power formula the power can be calculated as p  work energytime  45 j04 s  1125 w
