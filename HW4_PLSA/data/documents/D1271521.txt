rain water mean for fish keepers is it a benefit or a hazard that depends upon how you look at it rain water can be a benefit by providing a free water supply particularly beneficial if tap water is metered and charged accordingly by the water supply company being free of chlorine and chloramine being soft the above contents could send fish keepers out on a fast buying spree to get large rain water barrels so they can start collecting rain water for their fish as fast as possible but before doing so think carefully about the hazards ‘free’ is a word we all like but on the basis that ‘there is no such thing as a free lunch’ – could there be a price to pay or more importantly a price for your fish to pay let’s explore rain water to find out it is incorrect to suppose that rain water is just pure water h2o as water is evaporated from the earth and drawn up to form rain clouds other dissolved substances may also be taken up with the water research has shown that falling rain can dissolve carry and be impaired by gaseous pollutants in the atmosphere which were created by industrial and human activities “industrial contamination” seip and toll 1985 “degradation by human activities” ayoade 1988  pickering and owen 1994 the nigerian government set a 2008 deadline to end all gas flaring by oil companies after research showed among other things that lead levels were above the maximum allowable in potable water by the who world health organization and higher values of lead were found in the rain water than the ground water the quality of rain water can vary from area to area for instance it is felt that heavily industrialized areas are more likely to receive polluted rain than lightly industrialized areas we need to throw into that discussion arena the effects of major motorways traffic fumes airports airplane fuel emissions petrolchemical plants and farming it has been proposed that particles can also be carried in rain clouds this is supported by a dependent on the wind direction some heavy rainfalls around brentwood england uk deposit sand anecdotally ‘the sand’ had been carried from the saharan desert in north africa across europe to eastern england b the chernobyl nuclear reactor accident in russia was seen by the uk government as being directly responsible for polluting some of the uk’s welsh hills – for some years governmental restrictions were placed on allowing lambs produced in these areas to enter the food chain research undertaken at the university of north carolina usa also showed that the components of rain water at a coastal site in north carolina varied according to the time of day or night samples were collected g brooks avery jr joan d willey robert j kieber 2000 if you live in an area which has very little industrial activity and the prevailing wind does not come from industrialized areas then the rain water may be perfectly acceptable for fish use the u s epa recommends that in some situations rain water collected for drinking may need further treatment to disinfect the water or to filter out other impurities from the rain water supply this water would probably not need disinfecting for fish but having experienced tremendous damage done to koi by heavily polluted rain fall it is a fallacy to think that rain water is always fish safe the main contaminants can be roughly grouped into organic inorganic radioactive and acidbase substances in collecting and storage materials can also contaminate rain for instance roofing materials experiments in paris showed the leaching of zinc cadmium and lead in wet weather chebbo et al 2001 additional research has shown that zinc dissolved from roofing materials is mainly in the form which is damaging to both fish and aquatic plants heijerick et al 2002 for human safety the nsf rain water catching system testing programme reviews products used to catch and store rain water further information should be sought from manufacturers re fish safety there are two interrelated factors to consider before deciding to use rain water for fishp h values affect fish health considerably the typical p h of rain water is about 5 – 6 however industrially produced sulphuric oxides and carbon monoxide in the atmosphere can reduce the rain’s p h to 4 or below whereas such a low p h could be beneficial to fish such as breeding discus it could be extremely harmful to fish needing alkaline waters such as koi which require a p h of 7 alkalinity is missing from rain water it is required in various fish waters to buffer and stabilize p h some fish require far harder water conclusion for some fish species and in some areas dependent upon how the rain water is collected and stored rain water can be very useful to fish keepers however for other fish species andor in contaminated rain areas it may be advisable not only to avoid using rain water but also to erect covers over outside ponds to prevent the rain water from entering the fish water water feature contractor for 2010 how to keep koi alive in your customers’ pond5 responses to rain water benefit or hazard for ponds patsy august 27 2015 at 313 am we have a small pond approx 2300 liters it is only 3 weeks old and the water was very clear it was filled using tap water and we have 12 small gold the water was staying very clear until it rained for 34 days non stop and now has a tinge to it and is cloudy can rain water do this to a pond  your kind attention is appreciated patsy reply lora lee gelles august 29 2015 at 1110 am hi patsy the tinge is probably overflow from the rainwater either spilling into the pond or if it was a heavy rain then the rainwater would splash into the pond the dirt will give it a slight color remember that ponds do go through cycles and they are not swimming pools while they should not be swamps by any means they will have some growth i suggest getting involved with a group on facebook such as watergardening and koigoldfish pondshttpswwwfacebookcomgroups32097216087reply cathleen kennedy june 2 2016 at 1058 am i have three ponds each one empties into the other and within the last two weeks i found two of my fancy goldfish blown up and dead and the rest of them seem to be staying in one corner on the bottom reply lora lee gelles june 2 2016 at 1006 pm here’s an answer for you cathleen from richard heimberger of healthy ponds i do not encourage anyone to harvest rain water for fish keeping unless they understand water chemistry in most cases rain water is acidic ph 6 has very little kh  gh and contains high amounts of co2 carbonation we can “cook” water with baking soda calcium chloride and or magnesium chloride to make it fish safe in your case if these fish deaths occurred after a rain event i’d test my water immediately the isolating behavior and lack of forward mobility on the rest of these fish make me think ph is crashing or swinging again test your water robust aeration in your ponds would be of help to your fish sodium chloride at 15 would be helpful for stress reply meyer jordan june 4 2016 at 257 pm since a properly constructed pond is not subject to runoff it would take a tremendous amount of rainfall to effect a major p h change reply leave a reply name requiredemail will not be published requiredwebsite
