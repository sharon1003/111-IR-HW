finding the formula of hydrated copper ii sulfate class practical in this experiment a known mass of hydrated copper ii sulfate is heated to remove the water of crystallisation the mass of water is found by weighing before and after heating this information is used to find x in the formula cu so 4 x h 2 o using mole calculations lesson organisation this is a class experiment suitable for students who already have a reasonable understanding of the mole concept the degree to which the mole calculations need to be structured will depend on the ability and mathematical competence of the class the outline structure given in the procedure above is intended for students with reasonable mathematical competence and experience of mole calculations given adequate access to toppan balances and skill in their use students should be able to complete the experimental work in 3040 minutes apparatus chemicals eye protection each working group will require crucible note 1crucible tongs note 2tripod pipeclay triangle bunsen burner heat resistant mat toppan balance ± 001 ghydrated copper ii sulfate harmful dangerous for the environment 2  3 g refer to health  safety and technical notes section below for additional information health  safety and technical notes read our standard health  safety guidance hydrated copper ii sulfate cu so 4 5h 2 o s harmful dangerous for environment  see cleapss hazcard the copper ii sulfate should be provided as fine crystals if large crystals are used these should be ground down before use by students1 crucibles may be of porcelain stainless steel or nickel of capacity about 15 cm 3 and should sit safely in the pipeclay triangles provided2 crucible tongs should have a bow in the jaws of the right size to pick up the hot crucibles safely procedurea weigh the empty crucible and then weigh into it between 2 g and 3 g of hydrated copper ii sulphate record all weighings accurate to the nearest 001 gb support the crucible securely in the pipeclay triangle on the tripod over the bunsen burnerc heat the crucible and contents gently at first over a medium bunsen flame so that the water of crystallisation is driven off steadily the blue colour of the hydrated compound should gradually fade to the greyishwhite of anhydrous copper ii sulfate avoid overheating which may cause further decomposition and stop heating immediately if the colour starts to blacken if overheated toxic or corrosive fumes may be evolved a total heating time of about 10 minutes should be enoughd allow the crucible and contents to cool the tongs may be used to move the hot crucible from the hot pipeclay triangle onto the heat resistant mat where it should cool more rapidlye reweigh the crucible and contents once coldf calculation calculate the molar masses of h 2 o and cu so 4 relative atomic masses h1 o16 s32 cu64calculate the mass of water driven off and the mass of anhydrous copper ii sulfate formed in your experiment calculate the number of moles of anhydrous copper ii sulfate formed calculate the number of moles of water driven off calculate how many moles of water would have been driven off if 1 mole of anhydrous copper ii sulfate had been formed write down the formula for hydrated copper ii sulfate teaching notes remind students to zero tare the balance before each weighing students will probably also have to be reminded about the need to allow the crucible and contents to cool thoroughly before weighing metal crucibles stainless steel or nickel are much less vulnerable than porcelain crucibles health  safety checked 2016credits this practical chemistry resource was developed by the nuffield foundation and the royal society of chemistry© nuffield foundation and the royal society of chemistry page last updated october 2015in this experiment the water of crystallisation is removed from hydrated copper ii sulfate the mass of water is found by weighing before and after heating this information is used to find x in the formula cu so4x h2o
