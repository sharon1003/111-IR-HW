cast from genuine arizona meteor crater canyon diablo iron meteorites very limited mintage comes with signed certificate of authenticity the halleys comet meteorite medallion 2 diameter silver dollarsized 1 full ounce 28 gm of odessa  meteorite this was produced by a entrepreneur in tucson who bit off more than he could chew the front side was designed by kim poor the back shows the orbits of halley and the planets but when it came to actually minting the coins they found the unearthly crystalline metal took over 4000 degrees heat to melt hotter than the surface of the sun fortunately a new induction furnace was being developed in arizona which did the trick but then oxygen impurities made the medallions brittle that problem was overcome but by this time the comet had come and gone
