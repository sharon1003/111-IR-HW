sort by  previous next aabbbfor older kids with phones i found that i had to reread the directions for this product a couple times to understand what it was all about it was a bit complicated this product has to be used with a phone and you must download an app this app asked for use of your camera and microphone which from a safety issue concerned me a bit im not sure what the notebook was for it seems my daughter was able to do most the playing on the app my 9 year old enjoyed the detective game however i did not enjoy the fact that she was off playing on my phone i would not recommend this for 6 like the box says it seems to be geared towards maybe 89 and upview more suzie  dallas texas fri oct 27 2017 via projectmc2com was this helpful yes noreport issue aaaaaa product that takes

expensive for what it is it comes with a hard plastic journal that is opened by a nerdy bracelet then it pops open when you wave the bracelet on a specific spot and starts talking to you the a i voice has a very valley girl type of speaking its a bit much after a while it comes with an invisible magic marker that can only be read by the uv light that is provided there is also a booklet with decoding clues for the app that you are supposed to download and stickers the detective app was fun my 9 year old son enjoyed finding clues and catching suspects it was very interactive but you really dont need the journal to play it except when the decoder clues are needed that is why i dont think it is worth more than 10 finally when you close the journal the a i voice sounds like it is dying it is creepyfunnyview morecarlysam  houston tx  fri oct 27 2017 via projectmc2com was this helpful yes noreport issue aabbbneat idea but does not specify iphone neededits a neat concept overall but the lock i believe is a little flimsy and will not hold up over time also it is not compatible with all smart phones only iphones and apple products and i could not access the app for my child to
