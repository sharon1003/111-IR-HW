and voila happy travelshowever there are some big blunders you could be making when it comes to hotel reservations from booking on the wrong sites to forgetting to check some vital information these mistakes could easily make or break your trip read on to find out what you must avoid when booking that hotel room always expecting the best room i was recently chatting with a frontdesk agent about how her hotel chain distributes rooms at checkin curious i asked what method her staff uses to determine who gets the bestlocated rooms she revealed this surprising tidbit those who book through the hotel website or are hotel loyalty members usually get first dibs on room assignments with the better views and quieter locations travelers who book through online travel agencies otas like priceline often receive run of the house rooms what she called icemachine rooms or basically whatever is left the agent couldnt tell me just how many hotel chains do this but she said it was a fairly common practice and that it sweetens the deal for travelers who book at regular rates the fix joining hotel loyalty programs is often free and being a member can guarantee better room placement free nights or helpful amenities like complimentary breakfast or wifi if having the best possible room is key to happy travel then book directly through the hotels website but when those low low ota prices cant be beat—we know the feeling—you can always make a request for a certain type of room or location also online hilton lets guests pick rooms use smartphones as keys also online ready for the hotel industrys first robotic butler expecting requests to be guaranteed king bed or two doubles high floor or low nonsmoking water views three single red mms when reserving your hotel most booking engines will allow you to make requests or add comments regarding your stay however in the teenytiny fine print most hotels also say that your requests arent guaranteed the fix the old adage expect nothing and youll never be disappointed holds true here but its cold comfort when you really wanted a certain amenity first know that hotels will generally try to honor your requests if at checkin you find your double beds have become one or you were placed in a smoking room speak to the frontdesk agent and request a change—politely also its well worth calling the hotel before you arrive to confirm your requests especially if any were made for medical reasons using incorrect arrival and departure dates of this travel sin i am guilty as charged on an overseas trip several years ago i noted that my flight left on may 14th so i booked my destination hotel starting the night of may 14th rookie mistake i completely neglected to check that my flight was a redeye that landed early in the morning of the 15th this means i paid for an expensive and nonrefundable room that i didnt need the fix unlike your hapless writer make sure you have your flight itinerary on hand when booking and doublecheck the dates of your arrival and departure also consider time zones if youre crossing the international date line in transit yes your checkin dates could be different than you expect its also not a bad idea to have someone look over your booking before you hit confirm or pay just to ensure that the dates you have selected are correct not using a credit card when booking a hotel credit cards are king not only do credit cards offer rewards like airline miles free night stays or cashback bonuses but they also offer certain guarantees that debit cards and cash do not such as fraud protection or immediate refunds for mischarges another tip that many travelers dont know most hotels will require an incidental deposit if you use a debit card to protect themselves against overdraft fees if your account has insufficient funds these additional deposits can add up i once paid a 100 deposit in las vegas that wasnt refunded to my account for two weeks the fix if you are wise with money management and choose the right type of credit card you could see plenty of benefits when booking accommodations nerd wallet rounds up the top credit cards with travel benefits also make sure to scope out tim

location description could lead you to book an airport hotel when you think youre getting centrally located accommodations you would be surprised how often travelers see the name of the hotel and reserve it quickly without checking to see if its located in the right place after all some hotels may call themselves located near the heart of downtown but a quick search could reveal that its located at the airport … two hours away the fix check the mailing address and find the hotels exact location on google maps always enter the hotels address and see how far it is from popular attractions and restaurants by foot by car or by public transport try entering the addresses of some attractions youd like to see while in your destination and map the route you may also want to explore the neighborhood with google maps street view and if there are multiple hotels by the same chain in that city make sure you have booked yourself at the property in the correct neighborhood—the hyatt times square and the hyatt flushing are very different indeed not accounting for taxes and resort fees back in march contributing editor ed perkins reported one of the most outrageous resort fees wed seen yet at a hotel in colorado the decent 170 room rate was artificially inflated with a 35 cleaning fee a 40 resort fee a 10 poolandspa fee and a 510 processing fee ouch the fix you may be able to fight some fees such as housekeeping or newspaper delivery if you dont wish to avail yourself of such services others like resort fees are mandatory so you need to account for the additional cost when you book that hotel hotels are expected to display resort fees clearly but otas may not and instead include vague language like additional fees may apply so call the resort and ask pointblank about additional resort fees before you book as for taxes much like security lines you arent getting out of those not checking reviews if youve ever taken a spin on oysters photo fakeout feature you know that hotels go to great lengths to make their properties seem perfect but upon arrival that infinity pool could really be the size of a postage stamp and those sumptuous linens could feel like sandpaper take anything a hotel says about itself with a grain of salt or sand the fix do your research reading user reviews is a tricky balancing act you want to read as many reviews as you

have dire consequences for your credit card balance hotel rates can soar in the days leading up to a particular date and you could be left without a room if everything books up or if nothing left is within your budget on the other hand being an advanced planner can have its own disadvantages sure you may want to have all of your travel ducks in a row as soon as possible but it can actually cost you money to book your hotel room too early the fix there are no easy answers as to when exactly is the best time to book a hotel room rates depend on many factors location seasonality convention crowds even weather as a general rule of thumb booking more than 21 days ahead of your arrival date is a nono for the most popular destinations youll be putting yourself at risk for jackedup prices

multiple prices from multiple booking sites in one window compare the rates on the propertys website to the rates you find on priceline on expedia on groupon getaways or in travel brochures also look into the types of booking discounts that are available and which ones can save you the most money for example you may get 10 off with a hotel chains summer sale but your aaa discount could be larger as a general rule of thumb you should check at least three different sites for each hotel booking booking nonrefundable rates every wondered why nonrefundable rates are cheaper than the regular rack
