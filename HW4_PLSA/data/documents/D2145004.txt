wouldn’t it be wonderful if it were as easy to check your a1c level at home as it is to check your blood glucose it is the a1c of course that best measures the control we have over our diabetes testing a1c 19 times it actually can be that easy you may know that recently several home a1c test kits and meters have become available you may however wonder how accurate they are that was my concern therefore i offered up 19 drops of blood for a1c testing during a recent threemonth period these 19 a1c tests compared an a1c meter an a1c test kit and one of the country’s largest laboratories my meters web page at “a1c meters and kits” describes and links three meters and three test kits however only one of the meters metrika inc’s a1c now is currently marketed for home use two of the test kits—the accubase hemoglobin a1c sample collection kit marketed by diabetes technologies inc dti and the simple choice a1c which at that time marketed by spect rx—are the same spect rx licensed the dti kit the two other test kits—bio safe collection kit marketed by bio safe laboratories inc and the a1c at home collection kit marketed by flex site diagnostics inc—use a filter paper process i did not evaluate these two kits because their laboratories didnt pass the rigorous requirements of the national glycohemoglobin standardization program ngsp”neither flex site nor bio safe are currently ngsp certified” writes randie little network coordinator of the national glycohemoglobin standardization program “i would only recommend a lab that is either using a certified method or is a certified lab however most certified labs are clinical trial laboratories ”the national glycohemoglobin standardization program located at the university of missouri columbia has standardized glycohemoglobin a1c test results so that clinical laboratory results are comparable to those reported in the diabetes control and complications trial dcct the ngsp acts as a reference laboratory for manufacturers of a1c methods to help in standardizing methods and providing comparison data for certification of traceability to the dcct the use of a test method traceable to the dcct is one part of it but “there is one other thing that each laboratory needs to do” says dr david goldstein who just stepped down as ngsp steering committee chair “every laboratory needs to establish its own normal range” that’s because the different assays that the laboratories can use have “a little bias”the reference normal range for the high performance liquid chromatography hplc assay used to test simple choice and dti samples is 42 percent to 58 percent for the a1c now system the expected normal range is 39 percent to 65 percent reports from unilab define less than 60 percent as nondiabetic a1c now does not of course use an ngsp certified laboratory because you do the test at home and don’t send it anywhere the a1c now kit uses an immunoassay method but they did not it compare to an ngsp immunoassay for certification the difference between standardized methods and ngsp certified laboratories is one of the most misunderstood aspects of a1c testing“a certified laboratory is different than a laboratory that uses a certified method” writes dr goldstein “certified labs are labs that go one step further and these are usually large reference labs”the way that dr little puts it is “as far as saying that the lab or method is ‘standardized’ vs ‘certified’ any lab can say that their method is standardized but the proof of standardization is certification’dr little adds that 98 percent of the labs in this country use certified methods but only nine laboratories in the u s are certified at level i and three more are level ii certified according to the ngsp list of certified laboratories these laboratories have documented a certain level of precision and accuracy i lived in california at the time of my testing and only one lab in my state is level i certified it is the quest diagnostics lab in van nuys but it will accept samples only from people in clinical trials the quest lab in san jose is the one that analyzes a1c tests that my endocrinologist in santa cruz prescribes for testing in a local clinic robert sobel vice president bay area technical operations for quest says that while they use a certified method roche integra the lab isn’t certified he also told me that they could not send my blood samples to their lab in van nuys we had tried to have my samples sent to quest tested in their van nuys facility we hatched the plan in a conference call among arthur g williams president and chief scientific officer of diabetes technologies inc dti keith d ignotz president and chief operating officer of spect rx inc and myself we wanted the most accurate possible comparison between the results that i could get from my lab and those from the simple choice a1c test kit which that company licensed at that time from dti subsequently spect rx discontinued the simple choice a level i certified laboratory premier laboratories in kansas city missouri tests blood samples sent to dti spect rx paid for me to have 10 a1c tests on the same day i went to unilab for five of them and sent in five simple choice kits the unilab test results—all of which were taken from the same large vial of my blood but analyzed separately—were 58 percent 59 percent 59 percent 59 percent and 59 percent the spread of the simple choice tests was a bit wider 64 percent 66 percent 67 percent 67 percent and 67 percent which averaged about 66 percent the difference was remarkable that difference—variation—between the two laboratories is unacceptable according to my local endocrinologist dr jeffrey f williams he adds that the precision or interassay results are good but which is more accurate as much as i would like to believe that my a1c was at the 59 percent level of the unilab tests i have reluctantly come to the conclusion that my a1c was the mean of that reported by simple choice 66 percent there is no arguing with the fact that the simple choice and dti tests are the only a1c results i could get that are tested in level i certified labs while the spread of the simple choice results was wider than those from unilab i believe that is because all the tests came from the same drop of blood my guess is that five separate blood draws would not have been as close since unilab is not an ngsp certified lab it seems to me that their results were the inaccurate ones the tests do show that you can confidently track your a1c trend you can do that however only if you use the same lab every time i did not make a headtohead comparison between the metrika a1c now meter and my usual lab or with simple choice i did run five a1c now tests in a 15minute period the results were 64 percent 64 percent 65 percent 65 percent and 67 percent the range was exactly the same as that of the simple choice test then you might think that the a1c now meter is just as accurate as the simple choicedti kit but simple choicedti use a level i certified laboratory while the a1c now meter uses the immunoassay method which does not have as high a standard of accuracy as the hplc method used in the laboratory where simple choicedti samples are tested at about the same time i got one a1c test each from dti a1c now simple choice and unilab the results varied from 57 percent to 70 percent obviously this business is not as accurate as it needs to be in addition ease of use is a factor that impinges on accuracy every time i used an a1c now meter i felt it was easily subject to operator error a sample that is either too large or too small will cause an error it is also highly sensitive to temperature and light the meter must be at room temperature 64° f to 82° f for at least one hour before opening it you also have to test within 15 minutes of opening the pouch containing the meter then you can’t disturb the meter while waiting for the test results on the other hand the dtisimple choice kit seems to me to be a model of thoughtful intelligent design the instructions are straightforward the kit is simple to use and is subject to only the most gross operator error accuracy is the most important factor but it isn’t everything as with blood glucose testing time sample size and cost are three more important factors how fast you can get your results is of great importance if you have to make changes in your diet and treatment here the a1c now test is the clear leader you get your result in eight minutes the dtisimple choice test results should come back to you in a week a local lab test will take much longer since you normally have to have an appointment with your physician to get the prescription and then wait for the results to get back to you dtisimple choice requires the smallest sample size 5 microliters of blood or 51000th of a milliliter the a1c now requires twice as much unilab requires one tube of blood about 4 milliliter your cost will depend largely on whether you have health insurance or not insurance will normally cover the cost of lab testing few if any insurance plans will reimburse the costs of the alternatives diabetes technologies inc offers the accubase hemoglobin a1c sample collection kit for 2195 plus 385 shipping retailers set the price of the simple choice a1c test kit but it is generally about 25 metrika sells an a1c now meter for 2295 if you don’t have health insurance a lab test will be much more expensive than the alternatives quest charges individuals 9925 for an a1c blood draw and test whether to continue to have your a1c checked at a local lab or to use an a1c meter or test kit depends a lot on your particular circumstances you need to weigh the pros and cons however don’t think so much about it that you forget to get tested one way or another what does the a1c measure when you get an a1c test you are of course checking your blood that is the simplistic answer it is however a lot more than that the a1c is the new standard name for blood level tests that have variously been called glycated hemoglobin glycohemoglobin glycosylated hemoglobin hb a 1c it describes a series of stable minor hemoglobin components formed slowly and nonenzymatically from hemoglobin and glucose the rate of formation of these hemoglobin components is directly proportional to the glucose level your a1c level provides you with your glycemic history of the previous 120 days since that is the average life span of your red blood cells the a1c “most accurately reflects the previous 23 months of glycemic control” according to the american diabetes associations position statement on tests of glycemia in diabetes  that’s the establishment position but even this careful statement is subject to some caveats the a1c reflects the last four months says dr david goldstein a pediatric endocrinologist practicing in columbia missouri and the previous chair of the national glycohemoglobin standardization program “but it reflects the last month much stronger than four months ago it is a weighted average about half of what goes into the glycohemoglobin is the past month or so”ron sebol a retired electronics engineer living near columbia maryland says however that the a1c measures an even shorter period a standard text ellenberg  rifkin’s diabetes mellitus bases the chapter on the kinetics of glycation on differential equations that were computer modeled and presented a graph of a square wave response ron emphasizes that the equations and the computer model were validated in a test conducted in a hospital setting and are therefore beyond mere conjecture“that is how a1c reflects a stepwise abrupt change in average blood glucose” he writes me “to an electronics engineer but not the doctors who wrote the paper the graph was instantly recognizable as an exponential of the same sort as describes charging a capacitor via a series resistor”this means he says that in only one week the a1c has changed more than 50 percent by the 47th day it has changed 99 percent there is less dispute over how often we should get our a1c checked if you are meeting your treatment goals and have stable control you should be tested twice a year the ada says when you are not meeting your goals or you change your therapy you should test four times a year your goal should be an a1c of less than 70 percent the ada says many people believe that this level is too high the diabetes control and complications trial dcct showed that near normalization of glycemic levels prevent complications that trial set an a1c level of 40 percent to 60 percent as normal the united kingdom prospective diabetes study ukpds the other major diabetes study set the normal level as less than 62 percent dr richard k bernstein an endocrinologist in practice in mamaroneck new york and author of dr bernstein’s diabetes solution is perhaps the sharpest critic of the ada’s treatment goals“i feel diabetics are entitled to the same blood sugars as nondiabetics” he wrote me recently “this means that an appropriate a1c would be in the vicinity of 45…this numbers happens to be the value for blood sugar that i’ve seen over and over on the nondiabetic meter salesmen that visit my office it also happens to be the value of my own a1c since an a1c of 6 corresponds to an average blood sugar that is more than 50 above normal it certainly does not meet the guidelines for good health and longevity”many people question dr bernstein’s goals that includes two contributors to this article ron sebol and dr little“the dcct data stand as a contradiction” ron writes “i posted some calculations based on the dcct and in them found that a person with an a1c of 6 had a 985 chance of being complication free over a 15 year term the dramatic shift in eating life style that bernstein requires has virtually no payoff in risk reduction since going from 18 risk to zero is not worth the price in life style add to that with strategic use of supplements known to be able to reverse glycation damage and you have essentially a zero risk of complications with a diet much more mainstream than bernstein insists is needed alpha lipoic acid acetyllcarnitine benfotiamine and pycnogenol can i am convinced make an a1c of six or even 65 entirely safe what cures also prevents it is the difference between having to limit to bernstein’s 12 grams of carb per meal vs limiting to 50 that is at issue”there is too much risk for hypoglycemia with the level that dr bernstein recommends dr little believes “certainly a normal range goal would be appropriate for some people with diabetes but not all one has to weigh the risks and benefits and there are certainly risks of a person with diabetes having too low an a1c a person without diabetes and one with diabetes may have the same a1c but their blood glucose swings would be different the person with diabetes would be a much higher risk of hypoglycemia”the period that the a1c measures and how low it should be remain in dispute what remains clear however is that it is the key test in our arsenal of weapons in our fight for control of diabetes update robert ray ph d the ceo of flex site diagnostics just sent me this thoughtful message that i need to include here to update and clarify this article“we have recently had some unfavorable response to your article” he begins “i would like to point out some inaccuracies and i am sure you will want to correct them“on the second page of the article you say ‘i did not evaluate these two kits bio safe collection kit and flex site a1c athome r because their laboratories didn’t pass the rigorous requirments of the national glycohemoglobin standardization program ngsp’“i can’t speak for bio safe of course but as for flex site this is not true it is true that we have not recently applied for ngsp certification of our lab it is not true that we ‘didn’t pass’ for several years in the past we successfully went through the ngsp certification process and certified our laboratory however since the technology we use roche unimate immunoassay is routinely certified by ngsp by roche we felt that certifiying our lab as well was redundant so we elected to rely on the roche certification of the methodinstrument as randie little points out in your reference to her comments in your article ‘98 per cent of the labs in this country use certified methods’ ie their labs are not certified the fact that of the thousands of labs in the country only nine are level i certified tells us that it is not practical for all labs to be certified“we supplement roche’s certification with participation in routine proficiency testing as do all licensed labs in the u s we use the cap college of american pathologists proficiency survey samples which the ngsp lab analyzes for a1c the survey is conducted twice a year and over 2800 labs in the country participate using one or more of the 20 methodsinstruments currently in use in the latest survey of three unknown samples the results from our lab are sample ngsp flex site flex site type value liquid sample dried sample gh1 54 55 54 gh2 116 115 111 gh3 76 78 74“these results for flex site both on the liquid survey sample and the dried sample are well within the accepted limits of accuracy practiced by labs around the u s and speak to the accuracy of our lab“in addition we occasionally test ourselves against ngsp samples not long ago we purchased about 40 samples from the ngsp lab with their results and ran them through our lab both as wet and dried samples the results correlated to better than 99 percent accuracy as a result we are confident that our lab is accurate within the expected limits for this test we do it this way because it is much more economical and it gives us the same results however we don’t show up on the ngsp website because of this approach“on the overall question of accuracy of the various methods i would advise you to use considerable caution when trying to conclude which methods are accurate and which might not be a1c analysis is a very challenging analytical chemical problem and the chemists who have worked out the 20 commercial methods reported in the cap survey have all worked hard to achieve the best accuracy possible for their method every method has its strengths and weaknesses its accuracies and inaccuracies anyone who says a particular method is the most accurate method is likely to be selecting facts to suit hisher agenda the comment from your endo that the differences between the methods you tested are unacceptable is understandable but do not reflect the realities of a1c testing on the other hand the ngsp has done a commendable job of trying to bring the various methods into the best possible agreement they have made considerable progress their ongoing collaboration with the ifcc international federation of clinical chemists to develop a ‘reference’ method is making good progress and will help bring the various methods that much closer together“in the mean time you make the points that it is the trend from a given method that is valuable and that a1c testing is the key test we couldn’t agree more”this article originally appeared on mendosacom october 28 2003 go back to home page go back to diabetes directory
