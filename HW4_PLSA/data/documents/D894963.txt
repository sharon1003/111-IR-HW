florida conceals equipment for tmobile cdma cell site antenna cable cell site placed atop an existing building a cell site or cell tower is a cellular telephone site where antennae and electronic communications equipment are placed — typically on a radio mast tower or other raised structure — to create a cell or adjacent cells in a cellular network the raised structure typically supports antennae and one or more sets of transmitterreceivers transceivers digital signal processors control electronics a gps receiver for timing for cdma2000  is95 or gsm systems primary and backup electrical power sources and sheltering 1  thirdparty source neededin global system for mobile communications gsm networks the correct term is base transceiver station bts and colloquial synonyms are mobile phone mast or  base station  the term base station site might better reflect the increasing colocation of multiple mobile operators and therefore multiple base stations at a single site depending on an operators technology even a site hosting just a single mobile operator may house multiple base stations each to serve a different air interface technology  cdma2000 or gsm for example some cities require that cell sites be inconspicuous they can be blended with the surrounding area 2 or mounted on buildings 3 or advertising towers  citation needed preserved treescapes can often

operation  editrange  editthe working range of a cell site the range which mobile devices connects reliably to the cell site is not a fixed figure it will depend on a number of factors including but not limited to height of antenna over surrounding terrain  lineofsight propagation  the frequency of signal in use the transmitters rated power the required uplinkdownlink data rate of the subscribers device 4the directional characteristics of the site antenna array reflection and absorption of radio energy by buildings or vegetation it may also be limited by local geographical or regulatory factors and weather conditions in addition there are timing limitations in some technologies eg even in free space gsm would be limited to 35 km with 70 km being possible with special equipmentgenerally in areas where there are enough cell sites to cover a wide area the range of each one will be set to ensure there is enough overlap for  handover  tofrom other sites moving the signal for a mobile device from one cell site to another for those technologies that can handle it  eg making a gsm phone call while in a car or train ensure that the overlap area is not too large to minimize interference problems with other sites in practice cell sites are grouped in areas of high population density with the most potential users cell phone traffic through a single site is limited by the base stations capacity there is a finite number of calls or data traffic that a base station can handle at once this capacity limitation is commonly the factor that determines the spacing of cell mast sites in suburban areas masts are commonly spaced 1–2 miles 2–3 km apart and in dense urban areas masts may be as close as ¼½ mile 400–800 m apart 5the maximum range of a mast where it is not limited by interference with other masts nearby depends on the same considerations in any case the limiting factor is the ability of a lowpowered personal cell phone to transmit back to the mast as a rough guide based on a tall mast and flat terrain it may be possible to get between 50 and 70 km 30–45 miles when the terrain is hilly the maximum distance can vary from as little as 5 kilometres 31 mi to 8 kilometres 50 mi due to encroachment of intermediate objects into the wide center fresnel zone of the signal 6 depending on terrain and other circumstances a gsm tower can replace between 2 and 50 miles 80 km of cabling for fixed wireless networks 7 in addition some technologies such as gsm have an additional absolute maximum range of 35 kilometres 22 mi which is imposed by technical limitations cdma and iden have no such limit defined by timing channel reuse  editthe concept of maximum range is misleading however in a cellular network cellular networks are designed to support many conversations with a limited number of radio channels slices of radio frequency spectrum necessary to make one conversation that are licensed to an operator of a cellular service to overcome this limitation it is necessary to repeat and reuse the same channels at different locations just as a car radio changes from one local station to a completely different local station with the same frequency when you travel to another city the same radio channel gets reused on a cell mast only a few miles away to do this the signal of a cell mast is intentionally kept at low power and in many cases tilted downward to limit its reach this allows covering an area small enough not to have to support more conversations than the available channels can carry due to the sectorized arrangement of antennas on a tower it is possible to vary the strength and angle for each sector depending on the coverage from other towers in the area signal limiting factor  edita cellphone may not work at times because it is too far from a mast or because the phone is in a location where cell phone signals are attenuated by thick building walls hills or other structures the signals do not need a clear line of sight but greater radio interference will degrade or eliminate reception when many people try to use the cell mast at the same time eg during a traffic jam or a sports event then there will be a signal on the phone display but it is blocked from starting a new connection the other limiting factor for cell phones is the ability to send a signal from its low powered battery to the cell site some cellphones perform better than others under low power or low battery typically due to the ability to send a good signal from the phone to the mast the base station controller a central computer that specializes in making phone connections and the intelligence of the cellphone keeps track of and allows the phone to switch from one mast to the next during conversation as the user moves towards a mast it picks the strongest signal and releases the mast from which the signal has become weaker that channel on that mast becomes available to another user further information frequency reuse geolocation  editcellular geolocation is less precise than by gps but it is available to devices that do not have gps receivers and where the gps is not available the precision of this system varies and is highest where advanced forward link methods are possible and is lowest where only a single cell site can be reached in which case the location is only known to be within the coverage of that site an advanced forward link is where a device is within range of at least three cell sites and where the carrier has implemented timing system use another method is using angle of arrival ao a and it occurs when the device is in range of at least two cell sites produces intermediate precision assisted gps uses both satellite and cell phone signals in the united states for emergency calling service using location data locally called  enhanced 911  it was required that at least 95 of cellular phones in use on 31 december 2005 support such service many carriers missed this deadline and were fined by the federal communications commission 8radio power and health  editthe u s government agency the fcc saysfor example measurement data obtained from various sources have consistently indicated that worstcase groundlevel power densities near typical cellular towers are on the order of 1 µwcm2 or less usually significantly less 9further information mobile phone radiation and health § health hazards of base stations cell phones cell towers wifi smart meters dect phones cordless phones baby monitors and other wireless devices all emit non ionizing radio frequencies which the world health organization who has just classified as a potential carcinogen it should be noted however that this is classified as limited evidence available for carcinogenicity which by definition states chance bias or confounding could not be ruled out with reasonable confidence 10cindy sage coeditor of the bioinitiative report writes  the who international agency for research on cancer has just issued its decision that nonionizing radiofrequency radiation is classified as a 2b possible carcinogen this is the same category as ddt lead and engine exhaust this mirrors the 2001 iarc finding that extremely low frequency elfemf that classified as a 2b possible carcinogen this pertained to power frequency power line and appliance nonionizing radiation these two findings confirm that nonionizing radiation should be considered as a possible risk factor for cancers and that new biologicallybased public safety standards are urgently needed  dr louis slesin has been reporting on this issue for decades 11temporary sites  editcamouflaged monopole called monopalm in tucson arizona colored to blend in with host building in sopot poland although cell antennas are normally attached to permanent structures carriers also maintain fleets of vehicles called cellsonwheels cows that serve as temporary cell sites a generator may be included for use where network electrical power is not available and the system may have a wireless backhaul link allowing use where a wired link is not available cows are also used at permanent cell sites—as temporary replacements for damaged equipment during planned outages and to augment capacity such as during conventions employment  editcell site workers are called tower climbers or transmission tower workers transmission tower workers often work at heights of up to 1500 feet 450 m performing maintenance and repair work for cellular phone and other wireless communications companies spy agency setup  editaccording to documents leaked to der spiegel the nsa sells a 40000 active gsm base station to be used as a tool to mimic a mobile phone tower and thus monitor cell phones 12in november 2014 the wall street journal reported that the technical operations group of the u s marshals utilizes spy devices known as dirtboxes to mimic powerful cell tower signals such devices are designed to cause mobile phones to switch over to the tower as it is the strongest signal within reach the devices are placed on airplanes to effectively create a dragnet gathering data about phones as the planes travel above populated areas 13 14offgrid

cells electrical energy from intermittent sources is stored in secondary batteries which are usually designed to have an average of 5 days of selfsufficiency to allow time for maintenance personnel to arrive at site when a repair is needed the renewable energy systems supply electrical power when available the fuel cells are activated only when the natural sources are not enough to supply the energy the system needs the emergency power supply the fuel cells is designed to last an average of 10 days in this way the structure is completely selfsufficient this enables the maintenance team to

tower in gainesville virginia there is often local opposition to new masts for reasons of safety and appearance the latter is sometimes tackled by disguising the mast as something else such as a flag pole street lamp or a tree eg palm trees pine trees cypress or rooftop structures or urban features such as chimneys or panels these concealed cell sites can distinguish themselves by foliage shape and bark type the foliage of all these antennas is composed of leaves made of plastic material accurately designed taking into consideration quantity shape and array suitable to completely conceal the antennas and all accessory parts in a natural manner the materials used guarantee absolute radioelectric transparency and resistance to uva rays nicknames include  monopalm  for a monopole disguised as a palm tree or pseudopinus telephoneyensis for a mast disguised as a pine tree 18 in monopoles the directional antennas are sometimes hidden in a plastic housing near the top of the pole so that
