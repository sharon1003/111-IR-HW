solar system why are planets round article written 12 jul  2017 updated 12 jul  2017 by matt williams video the solar system is a beautiful thing to behold between its four terrestrial planets four gas giants multiple minor planets composed of ice and rock and countless moons and smaller objects there is simply no shortage of things to study and be captivated by add to that our sun an asteroid belt the kuiper belt and many comets and you’ve got enough to keep your busy for the rest of your life but why exactly is it that the larger bodies in the solar system are round whether we are talking about moon like titan or the largest planet in the solar system jupiter large astronomical bodies seem to favor the shape of a sphere though not a perfect one the answer to this question has to do with how gravity works not to mention how the solar system came to be formation according to the most widelyaccepted model of star and planet formation – aka nebular hypothesis – our solar system began as a cloud of swirling dust and gas ie a nebula according to this theory about 457 billion years ago something happened that caused the cloud to collapse this could have been the result of a passing star or shock waves from a supernova but the end result was a gravitational collapse at the center of the cloud how do stars form your browser does not currently recognize any of the video

pulled in more matter conservation of momentum caused them to begin rotating while increasing pressure caused them to heat up most of the material ended up in a ball at the center to form the sun while the rest of the matter flattened out into disk that circled around it – ie a protoplanetary disc the planets formed by accretion from this disc in which dust and gas gravitated together and coalesced to form ever larger bodies due to their higher boiling points only metals and silicates could exist in solid form closer to the sun and these would eventually form the terrestrial planets of mercury venus earth and mars because metallic elements only comprised a very small fraction of the solar nebula the terrestrial planets could not grow very large in contrast the giant planets  jupiter saturn uranus and neptune formed beyond the point between the orbits of mars and jupiter where material is cool enough for volatile icy compounds to remain solid ie the frost line  the ices that formed these planets were more plentiful than the metals and silicates that formed the terrestrial inner planets allowing them to grow massive enough to capture large atmospheres of hydrogen and helium the leftover debris that never became planets congregated in regions such as the asteroid belt the kuiper belt and the oort cloud so this is how and why the solar system formed in the first place why is it that the larger objects formed as spheres instead of say squares the answer to this has to do with a concept known as hydrostatic equilibrium why is everything spherical your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available click here to visit our frequently asked questions about html5 video000  430hydrostatic equilibrium in astrophysical terms hydrostatic equilibrium refers to the state where there is a balance between the outward thermal pressure from inside a planet and the weight of the material pressing inward this state occurs once an object a star planet or planetoid becomes so massive that the force of gravity they exert causes them to collapse into the most efficient shape – a sphere typically objects reach this point once they exceed a diameter of 1000 km 621 mi though this depends on their density as well this concept has also become an important factor in determining whether an astronomical object will be designated as a planet this was based on the resolution adopted in 2006 by the 26th general assembly for the international astronomical union in accordance with resolution 5a the definition of a planet is a “planet” is a celestial body that a is in orbit around the sun b has sufficient mass for its selfgravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium nearly round shape and c has cleared the neighborhood around its orbit a “dwarf planet” is a celestial body that a is in orbit around the sun b has sufficient mass for its selfgravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium nearly round shape 2 c has not cleared the neighborhood around its orbit and d is not a satellite all other objects except satellites orbiting the sun shall be referred to collectively as “small solarsystem bodies” montage of every round object in the solar system under 10000 kilometers in diameter to scale credit emily lakdawalladata from nasa jpljhuaplsw rissiuclampsdlridagordan ugarkovicted stryk bjorn jonssonroman tkachenko so why are planets round well part of it is because when objects get particularly massive nature favors that they assume the most efficient shape on the other hand we could say that planets are round because that is how we choose to define the word “planet” but then again “a rose by any other name” right we have written many articles about the solar planets for universe today here’s why is the earth round why is everything spherical how was the solar system formed and here’s some interesting facts about the planets if you’d like more info on the planets check out nasa’s solar system exploration page and here’s a link to nasa’s solar system simulator we’ve also recorded a series of episodes of astronomy cast about every planet in the solar system start here episode 49 mercury sources nasa solar system exploration – our solar system wikipedia – nebular hypothesis cosmos – hydrostatic equilibrium wikipedia

nice try to explain the universe but i would advise you to not overestimate your own views and read some science books on why ether is no longer part of science for about a century log in to replyfantazas says july 14 2017 at 1047 amcan we be so sure they all are that nice and round so far we have only solid observations of their shape from this solar system so astronomers could still find some of odd shape out somewhere log in to replykalopin says july 24 2017 at 243 am…is it not true that explosions and impacts produce spin …when a meteor impacts does it not produce spherules …when an explosion occurs does it not emit matter in rotation …would a super or hypernova produce the same outcome on larger scale …for every explosion is there not an implosion …for the amount of pressure release is there not a comparable vacuum …would a large enough explosion send out millions or even billions of stars on a rotating plane…this then causing these stars to release molten matter forming planets spinning in retrograde to the just formed galaxy forming new solar systems… with all sorts of smaller asteroids planetoids moons… spinning along… and comets coming in from outside each solar system causing many more smaller impacts …producing spherules……just on different scale log in to reply leave a reply you must be logged in to post a comment
