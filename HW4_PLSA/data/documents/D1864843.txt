rate gfr that are based on serum creatinine are routinely used however they are imprecise potentially leading to the overdiagnosis of chronic kidney disease cystatin c is an alternative filtration marker for estimating gfr methods using crosssectional analyses we developed estimating equations based on cystatin c alone and in combination with creatinine in diverse populations totaling 5352 participants from 13 studies these equations were then validated in 1119 participants from 5 different studies in which gfr had been measured cystatin and creatinine assays were traceable to primary reference materials results mean measured gfrs were 68 and 70 ml per minute per 173 m 2 of bodysurface area in the development and validation data sets respectively in the validation data set the creatinine–cystatin c equation performed better than equations that used creatinine or cystatin c alone bias was similar among the three equations with a median difference between measured and estimated gfr of 39 ml per minute per 173 m 2 with the combined equation as compared with 37 and 34 ml per minute per 173 m 2 with the creatinine equation and the cystatin c equation p007 and p005 respectively precision was improved with the combined equation interquartile range of the difference 134 vs 154 and 164 ml per minute per 173 m 2 respectively p0001 and p0001 and the results were more accurate percentage of estimates that were 30 of measured gfr 85 vs 128 and 141 respectively p0001 for both comparisons in participants whose estimated gfr based on creatinine was 45 to 74 ml per minute per 173 m 2 the combined equation improved the classification of measured gfr as either less than 60 ml per minute per 173 m 2 or greater than or equal to 60 ml per minute per 173 m 2 net reclassification index 194 p0001 and correctly reclassified 169 of those with an estimated gfr of 45 to 59 ml per minute per 173 m 2 as having a gfr of 60 ml or higher per minute per 173 m 2 conclusions the combined creatinine–cystatin c equation performed better than equations based on either of these markers alone and may be useful as a confirmatory test for chronic kidney disease funded by the national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases clinical assessment of kidney function is part of routine medical care for adults 1 more than 80 of clinical laboratories now report an estimated glomerular filtration rate gfr when serum creatinine is measured 2 despite standardization of serum creatinine assays gfr estimates remain relatively imprecise 3 owing to variation in nongfr determinants of serum creatinine which may be affected in both acute and chronic illness 1 such imprecision can potentially result in the misclassification of patients whose estimated gfr is less than 60 ml per minute per 173 m 2 of bodysurface area as having chronic kidney disease leading to unnecessary diagnostic and therapeutic interventions cystatin c is considered to be a potential alternative to serum creatinine for estimating gfr 45 in studies of prognosis it has been consistently shown to be a better marker than creatinine 6 and estimated gfr based on cystatin c could be used as a confirmatory test for an adverse prognosis in patients with chronic kidney disease 7 the validity and accessibility of cystatin c testing have been greatly improved by the release of a certified reference material for calibrating laboratory assays 89 and by the development of new less expensive methods for automated analyzers here we report the development and validation of two new equations for estimating gfr — one using standardized cystatin c alone and the other using cystatin c combined with standardized creatinine — in diverse populations we evaluated their performance as compared with existing equations 31011 and tested their usefulness in improving the classification of patients with chronic kidney disease methods study design and data sources the chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration ckdepi conducted the study under a cooperative agreement with the national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases niddk ckdepi collaborators provided data from clinical research studies and clinical populations 3 gfr measurements were based on urinary or plasma clearance of exogenous filtration markers data from studies of urinary clearance of iothalamate were used for development and internal validation and data from studies of other filtration markers were used for external validation we included 13 studies with 5352 participants who were randomly divided into separate data sets for development 3522 and internal validation 1830 see table s1a in the supplementary appendix available with the full text of this article at nejmorg we included 5 other studies with 1119 participants for external validation table s1b in the supplementary appendix  we excluded studies involving transplant recipients because our preliminary analyses showed large variations among these studies in the relationship between serum cystatin c levels and measured gfr the institutional review boards of all participating institutions approved the study the niddk was substantially involved in the design of the study and in the collection analysis and interpretation of the data the niddk was not required to approve the final manuscript before submission for publication the first author had full access to all the data in the study vouches for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis for the ckdepi database and wrote the first draft of the manuscript for a list of collaborators who provided data see the supplementary appendix laboratory methods we calibrated serum creatinine assays or measured serum creatinine with the use of the roche enzymatic method rochehitachi pmodule instrument with roche creatininase plus assay hoffmann–la roche traceable to national institute of standards and technology creatinine standard reference material srm 967 12 we calibrated serum cystatin c assays or measured serum cystatin c on the siemens dade behring nephelometer table s2 in the supplementary appendix  traceable to the international federation of clinical chemistry working group for standardization of serum cystatin c and the institute for reference materials and measurements certified reference materials 89development and validation of equations our goal was to develop two equations for estimating gfr one using serum cystatin c hereafter referred to as the cystatin c equation and another using both serum cystatin c and serum creatinine hereafter referred to as the creatinine–cystatin c equation as in our previous work we prespecified a process for developing and validating equations described in the methods section in the supplementary appendix  in brief we used leastsquares linear regression to relate logarithmtransformed measured gfr to log serum creatinine log serum cystatin c age and sex we also used nonparametric smoothing splines to characterize the shape of the relationship of log measured gfr with log creatinine and log cystatin c and then approximated the smoothing splines by means of piecewise linear splines to represent observed nonlinearity other candidate variables included the other filtration marker black race diabetes status and weight the significance threshold for inclusion was p001 for these additional variables and p0001 for pairwise interactions among variables models that showed improved performance with the use of prespecified criteria were evaluated in the internal validation data set for verification of the statistical significance of predictor variables and interactions development and internalvalidation data sets were combined into one data set hereafter referred to as the development data set to derive final coefficients in the externalvalidation data set we compared the new equations with each other with our previous creatinine equation 3 and with our prior equations involving cystatin c that were developed in populations of patients with chronic kidney disease and reexpressed for standardized cystatin c values 1011 table s3 in the supplementary appendix  as well as with the average of the ckdepi creatinine equation and the new cystatin c equation we compared the performance of equations in the overall data set and in the subgroups and final models were selected according to the ranking of the rootmeansquare error overall and within subgroups clinically significant differences and ease of application in clinical practice metrics for equation performance bias was assessed as the median of the difference between measured gfr and estimated gfr and precision was assessed as the interquartile range for the difference 313 accuracy was assessed as the rootmeansquare error and as the percentage of estimates that differed by more than 30 from the measured gfr 1–p 30 or by more than 20 1–p 20  confidence intervals were calculated by means of bootstrap methods 2000 bootstraps 14 the significance of the differences among equations was determined with the use of the signedrank test for bias the bootstrap method for the interquartile range and rootmeansquare error from the 2000 bootstrap samples and mc nemars test for 1–p 30 and 1–p 20 we evaluated the use of the new equations for the classification of chronic kidney disease in the externalvalidation population by means of the net reclassification index statistic 15 we compared the proportion of participants who were reclassified as having a measured gfr that was less than 60 ml per minute per 173 m 2 or greater than or equal to 60 ml per minute per 173 m 2 on the basis of the new equations versus the ckdepi creatinine equation for the overall population and for subgroups according to age sex diabetes status bodymass index and a creatininebased estimated gfr of 30 to 89 45 to 74 60 to 74 and 45 to 59 ml per minute per 173 m 2 we performed similar analyses for reclassification based on a measured gfr of 90 75 45 30 and 15 ml per minute per 173 m 2 analyses were performed with the use of r version 292

of the participants in each data set are shown in table 1 in the development data set the mean ±sd measured gfr was 68±39 ml per minute per 173 m 2 and ranged between 5 and 198 ml per minute per 173 m 2 the mean measured gfr was similar in the externalvalidation data set 70±41 ml per minute per 173 m 2  but the mean body weight and mean bodymass index were lower larger proportions of the patients were older and had diabetes and a smaller proportion of the patients were black formulation of equations and their performance in the development data set table 2 creatinine equation ckdepi 2009

formulas for the two new equations in the development data set — the cystatin c equation and the creatinine–cystatin c equation — as well as our earlier creatinine equation 3 for further details see table s4 in the supplementary appendix  the addition of race as a variable did not improve the performance of the cystatin c equation overall or in subgroups defined by race but it did improve the performance of the creatinine–cystatin c equation table s6 in the supplementary appendix  a more detailed explanation of the performance of these and other new equations is included in tables s5

creatinine–cystatin c equations 2012 in the externalvalidation data set comprising 1119 participants figure 1 performance of three equations for estimating glomerular filtration rate gfr in the externalvalidation data set the new equations based on cystatin c had less bias than the equations based on cystatin c that had previously been developed in populations of patients with chronic kidney disease especially at an estimated gfr of 60 to 89 ml per minute per 173 m 2 table s10 in the supplementary appendix  overall the new creatinine–cystatin c equation performed better than the equations that used either creatinine alone or cystatin c alone although bias was similar for all three equations median difference 39 ml per minute per 173 m 2 for the combined equation vs 37 and 34 ml per minute per 173 m 2 for the creatininealone and cystatin c–alone equations p007 and p005 respectively precision was improved with use of the creatinine–cystatin c equation interquartile range for the difference 134 ml per minute per 173 m 2  as compared with the creatinine equation and with the cystatin c equation interquartile range for the difference 154 and 164 ml per minute per 173 m 2 p0001 and p0001 as was accuracy 1–p 30 85 vs 128 for the creatinine equation and 141 for the cystatin c equation p0001 for both comparisons relative reductions 34 and 40 respectively 1–p 20 228 vs 329 and

2 the cystatin c equation and the creatinine equation were similar in terms of both bias and accuracy  figure 1  the mean of the estimated gfrs derived from the creatinine and cystatin c equations did not differ significantly from that of the creatinine–cystatin c equation results were generally consistent across studies and across subgroups defined by age sex and diabetes status table s11 and fig s2 in the supplementary appendix  table 4 reclassification of participants in the externalvalidation data set with the use of the creatinine–cystatin c equation versus the creatinine equation for estimated gfr using an estimated gfr threshold of less than 60 ml per minute per 173 m 2 we found that the combined equation as compared with the creatinine equation reclassified 55 of participants

with correct reclassification of 28 of 166 patients 169 with a creatininebased estimated gfr of 45 to 59 ml per minute per 173 m 2 to 60 ml per minute per 173 m 2 or higher in this subgroup results were similar when the cystatin c equation was used results were consistent across most of the subgroups defined by age sex diabetes status bodymass index and other measured gfr thresholds tables s12 and s13 in the supplementary appendix  discussion accurate assessment of gfr is essential for interpreting the symptoms signs and laboratory abnormalities that may indicate kidney disease for drug dosing and for detecting and managing chronic kidney disease and assessing the prognosis a reduction in gfr to less than 60 ml per minute per 173 m 2 for 3 months or longer is a diagnostic criterion for chronic kidney disease and is associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes including death 1619 bias with the new combined creatinine–cystatin c equation and with the average of the new cystatin c equation and the creatinine equation was similar to that with the individual creatinine and cystatin c equations but they had greater precision and accuracy and resulted in more accurate classification of measured gfr as less than 60 ml per minute per 173 m 2 — the threshold for the diagnosis of chronic kidney disease since cystatin c is less affected by muscle mass and diet than is creatinine 4520 it has been widely anticipated that cystatin c would provide a more accurate estimate of gfr than would creatinine nevertheless gfr estimates based on equations that use cystatin c as the sole filtration marker are not more accurate than creatininebased estimates suggesting that unmeasured and largely unknown nongfr determinants of cystatin c are similar in magnitude to those of creatinine the advantage of the cystatin c–based equation over the creatinine–based equation is that it is less subject to the effects of age sex and race indeed we found that in the development and internalvalidation data sets the addition of race as a variable did not improve the performance of the cystatin c–based equation in the black subgroup given the difficulties in assigning race and the lack of information about race in laboratory and administrative databases a gfr estimating equation that does not require race may be more generalizable across populations and could greatly facilitate the use of estimated gfr in clinical practice research and public health programs the equation that combines creatinine and cystatin c provides the most precise and accurate estimate of gfr across the range of gfrs and in subgroups based on demographic and clinical characteristics this improvement holds true even among participants with a bodymass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters of less than 20 — a subgroup in which creatininebased gfr estimates are known to be less accurate to explain this improved precision we hypothesize that errors due to the nongfr determinants of creatinine and cystatin c are independent and smaller in an equation that uses both markers than in an equation that uses only one marker possible reasons for the continued imprecision are the residual contribution of nongfr determinants of each marker as well as physiologic variation in gfr and error in measurement of gfr 21 the former limitation can be addressed by including additional markers the latter reflects imprecision in our reference standards rather than errors in estimating equations it may be useful to consider more widespread use of gfr estimates based on cystatin c either alone or in combination with creatinine our data suggest that cystatin c should not replace creatinine in general practice however the combination of creatinine and cystatin c provides more precise gfr estimates which may be useful for specific purposes for example the addition of cystatin c could be used as a confirmatory test for the diagnosis of chronic kidney disease in patients with a decreased gfr as estimated from creatinine peralta and colleagues found that cystatin c can be used to confirm a high risk of a poor prognosis for persons whose estimated gfr is decreased according to the creatinine equation 722 data from the national health and nutrition examination surveys 23 suggest that 36 of u s adults would be classified as having chronic kidney disease solely on the basis of a creatininebased gfr estimate of 45 to 59 ml per minute per 173 m 2 our data suggest that a strategy of measuring cystatin c when the creatininebased estimate is in this range and then reestimating gfr with the use of both these markers could correctly reclassify a substantial proportion of such patients as not having chronic kidney disease and not being at high risk this more accurate classification would result in more selective use of resources such as tests for complications of chronic kidney disease adjustment of medication doses and referrals to nephrologists 722cystatin c could also be used to screen for chronic kidney disease among persons who have a creatininebased gfr estimate of 60 to 74 ml per minute per 173 m 2 without albuminuria 109 of u s adults or to obtain a more accurate estimation of gfr in patients with muscle wasting or chronic illness 24 the addition of cystatin c testing could increase laboratory costs therefore clinical and laboratory practice guidelines need to be developed that specify indications and preferred diagnostic strategies for such testing and laboratory reporting taking into consideration local public health priorities clinical practice patterns and costs and benefits the strengths of this study include the use of large databases for the development and validation of the new equation and a prespecified rigorous analytic plan for testing all variables in the development data set the pooled development and validation databases included participants with diverse clinical characteristics resulting in greater general applicability than was provided by our previously developed cystatin c equations by comparing the various equations in a separate validation data set we were able to overcome limitations due to interstudy differences in participant characteristics and in methods for measuring gfr and serum creatinine and cystatin c finally the equations are expressed for standardized creatinine and cystatin c values our study has limitations first our findings may reflect the specific characteristics of the studies included in our database it is possible that within more homogeneous subgroups greater precision would be observed second participants with a higher gfr may not be representative of the general population and none of the data sets came from populations of patients with markedly reduced muscle mass or malnutrition in whom cystatin c testing might be expected to offer a substantial improvement over creatinine testing third there were essentially no racial or ethnic minorities other than blacks in the development data set and there were very few blacks in the validation data set we suggest that other investigators test our new equations in other racial and ethnic groups fourth we had incomplete data on measures of muscle mass and other clinical conditions and medications that might affect serum creatinine or cystatin c levels independently of gfr fifth errors in the measured gfr may account for some of the observed imprecision thus limiting interpretation of the analyses when participants were categorized according to measured gfr finally our equations may not perform well in transplant recipients such patients were not included in this analysis since we noted differences between transplant recipients and other patients with chronic kidney disease as have others 25in conclusion the combination of serum creatinine and serum cystatin c is more accurate than either marker alone for estimating gfr the new equations represent an advance over currently available equations across the range of gfr and in relevant subgroups reporting estimated gfr as determined by means of these equations when serum cystatin c is measured should greatly facilitate the clinical interpretation of cystatin c measurements our data suggest that estimated gfr based on serum cystatin c could be used as a confirmatory test for chronic kidney disease
