herehttpsmileyonegreatguynetindexhtml nypdwife sep 18 2008 12mudman dis veteran joined may 7 2003messages 1157the best way to get the novocaine to wear off is to get the blood circulating in that area novocaine most often contains a vascoconstrictor which constrics blood vessels this is helpful to control bleeding during procedures i would drink warm not hot liquids warm enough to get to blood circulating but not too hot to burn yourself remember youre still numb and can burn without feeling pain you could also try warm compressesmudman sep 18 2008 13nypdwife dis veteran joined jan 10

11150keep yawning well not a full yawn just move your jaw up and down as far as you can to help move the blood around maybe some warm soup to help in the same manner and you wouldn have to chew hehehehehe oh my dentist also has a quick wearingoff version of novacaine i am sure that is not the technical name mikeeee jr6ooo4 sep 18 2008 15cantw8dis veteran joined jun 25 2002messages 17138oh i
