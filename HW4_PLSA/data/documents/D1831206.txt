rights and content abstract the qinling mountains provide a natural boundary between the north and south parts in china and support a huge variety of plants and wildlife however the research on the vegetation history of qinling forests has remained a blank in order to choose the most suitable tree species to restore the qinling forests it is necessary to carry out studies on the history of forest vegetation in the area swamp sediments of mountain basins can store pollen from different historical periods in various levels through research on the deposition age of particular sediments in different levels and the characteristics of the pollen assemblage we can understand the history of the forest vegetation in the area and further provide the scientific basis for the proper management of forests in this paper we have divided the vegetation history and climatic variations in the qinling mountains into four stages based on the pollen analysis and 14 c age determination of a swamp sediment profile of mountain basins at an altitude of 2200 m as well as the pollen analysis on surface soil in stage 1 18715–7629 cal bp the vegetation was composed of abies and picea the climate was cold and humid in stage 2 7629–3131 cal bp the vegetation was dominantly abies picea betula quercus and alnus the climate was warm and humid during stage 3 3131–50 cal bp the vegetation was dominantly abies the climate was cold and humid during stage 4 0–50 cal bp the vegetation was dominantly betula quercus corylus alnus and tsuga with fewer pinus as well as groups of abies the climate was warm and dry there is a noticeable decrease of abies and picea in accordance with a climate change from cold and humid to warm and dry we also noticed an increase of betula quercus corylus alnus and tsuga which prefer warm and dry environments previous article next article1 introduction the qinling mountains are the water divide between the yellow river and the yangtze river located in the transitional region from the subtropical zone to the warm temperate zone of central china they are generally considered as the physical geographical dividing line between south china and north china because of the qinling mountains unique geographical location the vegetation and environmental change has been of interest in academia for a long time research of vegetation history is an important basis for forest management eg li et al 2004 neumann et al 2008 brunschön and behling 2009 ager et al 2010 markgraf and huber 2010 zhao et al 2010 anderson et al 2011 andreev et al 2011 whitlock et al 2011  many studies about the vegetation and climate change in qinling regions have been conducted by pollen analysis for almost half a century however many studies were concentrated in the northern slope of the qinling mountains for example the chinese academy of science expedition found the fruits branches and leaf fossils of picea in a soil profile of 29580 ± 757 cal bp at beizhuang village in weinan city of weihe plain in the 1960s pollen analysis showed that picea was 34 and abies was 20 of the total pollen in the soil profile they inferred from the pollen composition that the vegetation of the study areas was picea – abies forest  sun 1989  and this result showed that dark coniferous forest dropped to the plain this conclusion drew great attention in academic circles sun 1989 analyzed the pollen sediments from 35305 to 21458 cal bp in the beizhuang village of weihe plain and came to the conclusion that picea – abies and other dark coniferous might not have been distributed over large areas of forest only around the water bodies to form a mosaiclike assemblage with regional grassland dark coniferous forest appeared and disappeared twice there was no tree pollen after 23894 cal bp to 21458 cal bp which meant that the vegetation had become desert grassland chen and lin 1982 analyzed the pollen obtained from a borehole in the northern slope of the qinling mountains they inferred that there were five dark coniferous forest pollen assemblage zones mainly composed of picea and abies since early pleistocene with five alternating grasslands or savanna pollen zones the dark coniferous forest stratum which could be compared with picea fossilbearing beds in beizhuang village of weinan city finally appeared at the late period of late pleistocene in the weihe river valley due to lack of dating the comparison study was not a precise comparison the vegetation change in the qinling mountains region was an important issue for nearly half a century however pollen analysis at high altitudes was rare fan et al 1997 demonstrated the environmental changes during the close of the pleistocene in the taibai basin in the qinling mountains there was no study of vegetation and climatic variations after the last glacial in this study pollen was collected from surface samples underlying different types of vegetation at different altitudes the pollen assemblage characteristics in a mountain basin deposition profile were studied for the purpose of deducing the vegetation and climatic variations in qinling mountains since 18715 cal bp2 study area the qinling mountains are located at 32°30′–35° n 103°–113° e average annual temperature is 1139–1333 °c average annual precipitation is between 59043 and 76494 mm potential evapotranspiration is between 96812 and 98295 mm and moisture index is between 061 and 094 the mountains in shaanxi province is the backbone of the qinling mountains with an altitude of 1500–3000 m in this area the vegetation displays a vertical zonation with increasing altitude  fig 1  fang and gao 1963 zhu 1991 lei 2011  the vertical vegetation zones in fig 1 show the general model for taibai mountain the highest peak in qinling mountains with a summit altitude of 3767 m the vertical vegetation zones vary locally for example although the abies forests were mainly distributed at the altitude of 2800 m there was abies forest at 2250 m in the sampling plot download fullsize image fig 1 the vertical vegetation zones in qinling mountains the sampling plot with an altitude between 1000 and 3000 m was located on the southern slope of the qinling mountains  fig 2  there is a mountain marsh basin in the study area the area is about 8000 m 2 and its elevation is about 2200 m two cores 33°43′38″ n 108°13′38″ e were taken at a marsh basin near shijiaping village ningshan country shaanxi province download fullsize image fig 2 the sampling plot of the qinling mountains3 methods the relationship between modern pollen assemblages and vegetation provides the theoretical basis to explain fossil quaternary pollen spectra because of the differences in pollen production transport distribution and preservation combined with differences in geographic location terrain and other environmental factors the relationship between vegetation and pollen assemblages is very complex pollen in surface samples represents the average pollen rain in recent years and therefore it can reflect the relationship objectively eg li and yao 1990 tong et al 1996 stutz and prieto 2003  in order to interpret pollen diagrams in the qinling mountains and research its vegetation history the pollen of surface samples obtained under each type of vegetation of the study were analyzed different type vegetation sample sites of 20 m × 20 m were chosen to investigate the composition of the community  fig 2  several sample sites of pollen in surface moss at nine different altitudes in seven types of vegetation in the qinling mountains were selected in the laboratory the moss samples were rinsed with distilled water after boiling the sediment was washed with 5 sodium hydroxide samples were floated twice in heavy liquid with a specific gravity of 22 and hydrofluoric acid added if impurities were significant the floated organic matter and pollen were decomposed in acetic anhydride more than 300 pollen grains were counted in each moss sample wang et al 1995 was used for pollen identification due to the fact that the proportion of pollen amount is usually inconsistent with the proportion of each plant in a vegetation assemblage sometimes significantly it is difficult to infer the composition of paleovegetation by the pollen percentages davis 1963 regarded the issue as a theoretical problem in pollen analysis and adopted a correction coefficient  r to deal with the dilemma r is the correction coefficient of a plant v is the proportion of the plant in vegetation calculation by coverage p is the proportion of the plants pollen if r  1 the percentage of pollen equals that of its mother plant coverage in community r is representative and the pollen can be directly used to infer the paleovegetation if r  1 the percentage of the pollen is greater than the proportion of parent plant coverage in the community if r  1 it means the percentage of the pollen is less than the proportion of parent plants coverage in the community with low representation the depth of core 1 and core 2 is 150 cm and 90 cm respectively the analysis was done based on the data obtained in core 1 with core 2 as an auxiliary several pollen samples were collected with an interval of 5–10 cm in the two cores many of the samples have more than 200 pollen grains except for a few samples that have few pollen grains based on the pollen percentages in the core the sediment profile can be divided into several pollen zones the pollen diagram was obtained by using tilia software the geological age of four stratigraphic layers was dated with accelerator mass spectrometry ams by 14 c laboratory of archaeology department of peking university the samples for 14 c dating were taken from different subclay layers in core 1 the depth of the four samplings was at 85–86 cm 114–115 cm 129–130 cm and 149–150 cm radiocarbon ages have been converted to calibrated ages approximate calendar ages as determined from the calib v60 calibration program and intcal09 dataset  reimer et al 2009  the dating results were 3131 ± 81 cal bp 7629 ± 80 cal bp 12319 ± 79 cal bp 18715 ± 174 cal bp respectively a relict of logging was found in core 1 33–35 cm depth from the logging history in this region taking 2010 as the base year the age of the logging relict is about 50 cal bp calibrated ages were used to establish the age–depth models of core 1  fig 3  folks classification of sediments was used in the lithology of two cores  folk et al 1970  download fullsize image fig 3 the age–depth models of core 14 results41 results of pollen analysis in surface samples the pollen percentages in surface samples from seven vegetation assemblages at nine different altitudes are illustrated in fig 4 pollen assemblages reflect the plant composition in corresponding vegetation larix pollen under larix forest accounted for 288 and the r is 05 betula pollen under betula forest accounted for 368 and the r is 07 abies pollen under abies forest accounted for 217 and the r is 03 the mountain swamp basin assemblage was composed of herbs and tree pollen the herbaceous component was mainly composed of artemisia compositaea and cyperaceae the assemblage of tree pollen represented the vegetation characteristics on hillsides the assemblage under pinus and betula forest is dominated by pinus and betula pollen the pollen under pinus and quercus forest is dominated by pinus castanea and quercus the r of pinus castanea and quercus was 15–106 11 and 03–09 respectively download fullsize image fig 4 the diagram of surface tree pollen percentage from qinling mountains vegetation 1 mixed pinus and quercus forest 2 mixed pinus and betula and quercus forest 3 mixed conifer and hardwood forest 4 bog 5 abies forest 6 betula forest 7 larix forest there is a lack of correlation between the pinus pollen percentage in surface samples and pinus in communities pinus pollen can be found in surface samples of each type of vegetation and its percentages are high this is inconsistent with the actual distribution of pinus armandii pinus tabulaeformis and pinus massoniana pinus armandii is found at altitudes of 1400–2300 m pinus tabulaeformi at 1000–2200 m and pinus massoniana below 1000 m on south slopes pinus armandii and pinus tabulaeformi are mainly found below 2000 m pinus is rare in the needle and broadleaved mixed forest at an altitude of 2050 m but appears frequently at 1500 m however this altitude is marked by betula and quercus mixed forest pinus pollen in the two investigated samples at 2050 m and 1500 m accounted for 532 and 422 respectively even in the larix forest at an altitude of 2800 m pinus pollen accounts for 207 although there is not even one pinus in or around the sample li and yao 1990 argued that pinus pollen accounted for about 90 in pure pinus forest and pinus pollen was usually below 30 if there was not one pinus in a forest in the natural deciduous broadleaved forest in shennongjia area in which there was no pinus the pinus pollen represented 555 of the assemblage although the nearest pinus were 200 m distant  li and yao 1990  tong et al 1996 also found that pinus pollen accounted for 122–213 in surface samples of hulunbeier grassland where no pinus was present the r value of pinus pollen is high and fluctuated between 15 and 16 pinus has high pollen productivity and pollen could spread over a considerable distance there is a lack of correlation between pollen percentage in surface samples and the coverage of pinus in a community even in the forest where abies is predominant abies pollen only accounted for 217 and the r is 03 this is consistent with the majority of scholars opinion that if the abies and picea pollen amount is between 20 and 40 the existence of abies and picea can be assumed  chen and lin 1982 li 1991  although abies pollen has two air sacs its transport scope is very small in this study the abies forest is adjacent to a mountain marsh basin the distance of the abies forest to the mountain marsh basin is about 100 m and the elevation difference no more than 50 m however abies pollen in samples obtained in the mountain marsh basin accounts for only 07 abies has low pollen productivity and low preservation ability in addition its landing speed is fast and dispersal ability is weak42 results of pollen analysis in deposit profile the sediment profile was divided into four pollen zones  figs 5 and 6  download fullsize image fig 5 the pollen diagram from core 1 download fullsize image fig 6 the pollen diagram in core 2421 pollen zone ithis pollen zone was found at a depth of 150–115 cm in core 1 arboreal pollen accounted for 912–966 and herbaceous pollen accounted for only 31–93 among arboreal pollen abies pollen is dominant accounting for 3965–622 picea accounted for 75–239 tsuga accounted for 09–65 pinus accounted for 87–122 betula accounted for 0–75 quercus accounted for 07–25 and ulmus accounted for 12–38 herbaceous pollen is dominated by artemisia and asteraceae pollen zone i can be divided into two subzones ia 18715–12319 cal bp and ib 12319–7629 cal bp pollen amounts of betula and quercus in ib were much greater than that in ia422 pollen zone iithis pollen zone was found at a depth of 115–85 cm in core 1 and 90–65 cm in core 2 arboreal pollen dominated with abeis picea betula and quercus abundant tropophilous alnus pollen began to appear in core 1 arboreal pollen accounted for 100 abies accounted for 0–884 picea accounted for 0–5116 pinus accounted for 0–20 tsuga accounted for 0–505 larix accounted for 1009–50 betula accounted for 0–4495 quercus accounted for 0–50 alnus accounted for 0–505 salix juglans and pterocarya accounted for 0–596 respectively and ulmus accounted for 0–1009 in core 2 arboreal pollen accounted for 9807–8709 and herbaceous pollen accounted for 193–1391 in arboreal pollen abies accounted for 4398–5813 picea accounted for 113–483 pinus accounted for 691–2802 tsuga accounted for 0–414 larix accounted for 0–193 betula accounted for 193–1316 quercus accounted for 188–918 alnus accounted for 0–113 corylus accounted for 366–489 and carpinus accounted for 0–203 ericaceae accounted for 0–338 herbaceous pollen was dominated by artemisia and gramineae accounting for 193–1391 and 0–338 respectively423 pollen zone iiithis pollen zone was found at a depth of 85–35 cm in core 1 and 65–15 cm in core 2 it was dominated by arboreal pollen in which abies pollen was predominant pinus pollen and betula pollen increased more compared with pollen zone ii there were quercus pollen and corylus pollen and the quantities of picea pollen and tsuga pollen were low pollen of artemisia was more abundant than in pollen zone ii in core 1 arboreal pollen represented 818–83 in which abies accounted for 25–57 pinus accounted for 47–35 betula accounted for 3–216 picea and tsuga accounted for 2 quercus accounted for 07 and corylus accounted for 03–73 herbaceous pollen accounted for 17–182 predominately by artemisia 07–142 compositae 03–27 and chenopodiaceae in core 2 arboreal pollen accounted for 771–905 in which abies accounted for 42–624 picea accounted for 21–9 picea accounted for 21–9 tsuga accounted for 53–165 pinus accounted for 53–121 betula accounted for 49–89 and quercus accounted for 06–28 in herbaceous pollen artemisia 7–186 asteraceae and umbelliferae were the major components424 pollen zone ivthis pollen zone was found at a depth of 35–0 cm in core 1 and 15–0 cm in core 2 the main characteristic of this pollen zone was that the pollen of pinus betula and quercus increased the pollen of abies and picea were greatly reduced in core 1 pollen was abundant in the surface layer of 0 cm but it was scarce at 5–35 cm in surface of 0 cm arboreal pollen accounted for 698 in which pinus and betula predominated the proportion of pinus was 229 betula was 196 quercus was 85 corylus was 39 and alnus was 31 abies tsuga and picea pollen each accounted for less than 1 herbaceous pollen accounted for 302 in which artemisia accounted for 16 compositae accounted for 7 and cyperaceae accounted for 52 the percentage of herbaceous pollen in this zone was the highest in the profile according to the changes of pollen in core 1 the pollen zone could be divided into two subzones iva 35–15 cm and ivb 15–0 cm the main characteristics of ivb were that the pollen of abies and picea decreased and the pollen of pinus betula quercus corylus and alnus increased significantly in addition herbaceous pollen such as artemisia asteraceae and cyperaceae increased significantly pollen in core 2 was more abundant than in core 1 arboreal pollen accounted for 584–701 of which pinus accounted for 107–239 and betula accounted for 46–283 quercus accounted for 18–85 tsuga accounted for 08–61 corylus accounted for 0–48 and alnus accounted for 0–31 the proportion of herbaceous pollen was 299–416 in which artemisia was predominant accounted for 16–225 accompanied by asteraceae gramineae and cyperaceae pollen43 major stages of vegetation the boreholes location of marsh basin is within in the dark coniferous forest zone therefore the results of pollen analysis can reflect the changes in the dark coniferous forest in the qinling mountains according to the results of pollen analysis in the deposit profile and the relationships between modern vegetation and pollen in surface samples the history of vegetation and climate at 2000–2800 m elevation in the qinling mountains since 18715 cal bp could be divided into four stages431 stage 1 about 18715–7629 cal bpthis stage corresponded with pollen zone i arboreal pollen was abundant abies pollen accounted for 396–622 and picea pollen accounted for 75–239 in addition there was little pollen of tsuga pinus betula quercus and ulmus although there was a certain amount of p inus 87–122 there is no pinus in the area the pinus pollen of sediments perhaps came from lower altitudes as abies pollen is usually underrepresentative many researchers argued that if the percentage of pollen of abies and picea accounted for more than 20–40 this could indicate the presence of abies forest in addition although abies pollen has air sacs its transport is limited and differs greatly in different conditions li 1991 found in shennongjia area that the percentage of abies pollen under pure abies stands could be up to 50 but it decreased below 10 1 km away and below 1 3 km away the study in the qinliing mountains showed that the abies pollen in surface samples was less than 1 100 m away from abies trees which indicated that the spread was very small therefore it could be inferred that the paleovegetation around the swamp might be dense abies – picea forest accompanied by a small number of tsuga betula quercus and ulmus the climate was cold and wet stage 1 was the time from the last glacial to the early holocene during the period many events occurred including the deglacial from 17000 to 12800 cal bp and later younger dryas abrupt event however the pollen diagram of the study area does not show corresponding changes this pattern has been found outside of europe some scholars suggested that the temperatures became only slightly cooler in these regions or that the period was short thus failing to produce significant vegetation change  liu 1989  whatever the reason the issue needs to be further studied the pollen percentages of betula and quercus increased in subzone ib during the period of about 12319 cal bp–7629 cal bp at the transition period from the last glacial to early holocene the change of vegetation composition reflected climate warming this was consistent with data that the climate had become warm since 12100 cal bp  liu 1989 432 stage 2 about 7629–3131 cal bpthis stage corresponded with pollen zone ii the vegetation was dominated by abies picea betula and quercus alnus a warm climate tree began to appear the holocene optimum had a warm and wet climate433 stage 3 about 3131–50 cal bpthis stage corresponded with pollen zone iii at this stage pollen was dominated by arboreals with 771–983 in which abies represents about 25–624 the quantity of pinus pollen and betula pollen increased there were quercus and corylus pollen and the quantities of picea and tsuga pollen were low the pollen of pinus increased to 35 the vegetation mainly was abies forest with betula quercus and corylus appearing occasionally the climate was cold and wet434 stage 4 about 0–50 cal bpthis stage corresponded with pollen zone iv the main characteristics of the stage are that pinus and betula pollen increased greatly while abies pollen was reduced greatly and herbaceous pollen increased substantially it could be inferred from the evidence of logging found in the sediment profile that due to the interference of modern human activities a large number of trees were felled and the abies pollen reduced significantly the pollen of pinus and betula could be spread over a large distance and therefore the pollen amounts of pinus and betula increased herbaceous pollen mainly was disseminated from nearby therefore the vegetation of this stage was composed mainly by betula quercus corylus alnus tsuga and a very small amount of pinus with abies in mosaiclike locations climate changed to warmdry during the last period of stage 4 inferred from the two subzones iva and ivb in core 1 dark coniferous forest decreased substantially because of serious deforestation and secondary forest composed of betula quercus corylus and alnus increased significantly during the same period herbs such as artemisia compositaea and cyperaceae increased greatly the warming and drying trend of climate influenced vegetation5 discussion the weihe plain is mostly covered by loess so it is an unsuitable place for pollen analysis previous research often was done in incomplete stratigraphic sections the profile of beizhuang village in the weihe plain represents 35300–21400 cal bp  chen and lin 1982  but dating is only approximate for this reason the results of pollen analysis in this study cannot be directly compared with that in the weihe plain they can be combined to infer the relationship of vegetation and climate in the qinling mountains after the last glacial from the pollen analysis of sediment profile in weihe river valley  chen and lin 1982 sun 1989  dark coniferous forests descended to 500 m piedmont belts in qinling mountains 35300–21400 cal bp although they are found only at altitudes of 2600–3000 m at present calculated from the lapse rate of air temperature the temperature of piedmont belts of the northern slope and piedmont basin in the qinling mountains during the period of 35300–21400 cal bp was lower by 10–12 c° than at present from this assumption and the pollen record the vegetation 35300–21400 cal bp might have been distributed as follows •altitude of 500–1000 m dark coniferous forest•1000–1500 m deciduous needleleaf forest•1500–2000 m shrub meadow•2000–2400 m alpine desert after the last glacial stage the plant species adapted to cold and wet climate moved to higher altitude the vegetation in the northern slope of the foothills and piedmont basin changed into forest steppe or grassland as temperature rose vertical zones of natural plants on the northern slope of the qinling mountains might have been as follows •500–1000 m foreststeppe or grassland•1000–2200 m broadleaved forest•2200–2800 m dark coniferous forest•2800–3300 m deciduous coniferous forest•above 3300 m shrub meadow vegetation on the southern slope of the qinling mountains was similar to the northern slope and the only difference was that the lower elevations supported deciduous broadleaved forest the dark coniferous forest in the last glacial retreated to 2600–3000 m since 18715 cal bp except for the large scale logging and deforestation during the last 50 years the dark coniferous forest belt has undergone no significant change with some small fluctuations previous research  chen and lin 1982 sun 1989 noted evidence of dark coniferous distribution change from low to high elevations since the last glacial li 1991 analyzed the pollen in a sediment profile in shennogjia area and considered that modern abies fargesii forest replaced quercus and betula from 390 to 470 cal bp the succession of dark coniferous forest is different from the abies fargesii forest at present forest vegetation in the qinling mountains has been damaged severely and the climate is becoming warm and dry meteorological data showed that annual rainfall was reduced by 116 mm on the northern slope of the qinling mountains and the annual mean temperature increased by 069 c° therefore ecological restoration and revegetation is an urgent and arduous task according to the results of this study vegetation restoration of qinling mountains should be based on the primary tree species6 conclusions pollen assemblages in surface samples can reflect the corresponding vegetation pinus pollen was abundant and could spread over considerable distances so there is a lack of correlation between the high pollen contents in surface samples and pinus in the vegetation assemblages a large amount of tree pollen fell near the originating vegetation including carstanea larix and abies abies pollen was underrepresented and could be transported only short distances under abies forest the pollen made up only 195 per cent of the total pollen and 217 per cent of arboreal plants therefore if abies and picea pollen amount accounted for 20–40 the existence of abies and picea can be established the vegetation history of the qinling mountains can be divided into four stages in stage 1 18715–7629 cal bp the vegetation was composed of abies and picea the climate was cold and humid in stage 2 7629–3131 cal bp the vegetation was dominantly abies picea betula quercus and alnus the climate was warm and humid in stage 3 3131–50 cal bp the vegetation was dominantly abies the climate was cold and humid during stage 4 0–50 cal bp the vegetation was dominantly betula quercus corylus alnus and tsuga with fewer pinus as well as groups of abies the climate was warm and dry acknowledgements this work was supported by the foundation of state key laboratory of soil erosion and dryland farming on the loess plateau no 105011214  the
