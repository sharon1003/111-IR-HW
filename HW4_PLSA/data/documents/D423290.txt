headache after eatingcaptainheadache i get intense throbbing headaches 2 hours after eating food the more sugar content the more intense the headache and the longer the headache lasts if i eat something like a snickers bar or a piece of cake the intensity is debilitating and the pain can last for days just about anything with more than a few grams of sugar gives me a headache ive dealt with this since i can remember and ive been physically and mentally drained for most of my life ie if i can go 2 or 3 days a month without having some kind of head pain id be ecstatic heres some extra information im very underweight i am about 5 10 and i weigh 120  125lbs the most ive ever weighed was 135 and i had to work very hard lifting weights at the gym for months to reach that weight i have about 5 body fat my mom is diabetic type ii and her parents were diabetic needed insulin shots so type i my halfsister has graves disease ive been to the emergency room a few times because of headaches but my blood sugar is always normal mris have shown nothing abnormal i yawn incessantly after eating  especially during the afternoon i can yawn 20 times a minute for over an hour depending on how much i eat after the yawning stops the headache usually starts to kick in i wake up and have to go pee at least 1 to 3 times a night ive wasted lots of time and money seeing internists and specialists no doctor has ever run a test outside of standard blood work which shows my blood sugar as being normal every doctor is eager to treat the symptom but the best cause ive heard is that headaches just happen to some people the diagnosis is always given about 5 minutes after i say that i have headaches and then im sent off to the pharmacy to pick up the latest prescription migraine medication im very frustrated by this any recommendations read more feb 17 2009follow  14 upvote  0 62 answers next question62 answers page 4 of 4tomsant about honey see that your application includes

problem i get my thyroid levels tested every few months and i have to take a medication called synthroid to get my thyroid levels checked i go to my family doctor my gp or to the walkin clinic if i cant get a convenient appointment with my gp in order to get a req form for a blood test if it is a clinic doctor i tell them that i have a thyroid condition and ask them to give me a req form for a thyroid test then i go to a blood lab and get the blood drawn and ask them to send the results to my family doctor as well as the doctor who wrote the req i ask the clinic doctor to put this on the req form as well but i always mention it to the lab tech doing the blood work as well just to make sure that my family doctor gets the results too in your case if you went to a clinic just explain that you have concerns about your thyroid because of your headaches and energy level that will usually be enough to get a req form if youre in america youll be paying out of pocket for the blood work anyway so its not like theyll really care if youre in canada they might ask you a lot more questions before giving you the req but thats okay you might actually find something out if they ask you questions maybe youll happen upon a clinic doctor wholl figure out whats wrong with you if its your family doctor then just explain why you want the blood tests and i am sure that hell give you a req form then just go to a blood lab and if you are in america i guess you pay out of pocket for the blood work or if you are in canada you just give them the req form and they draw the blood and then you wait for the doctor to call you to come in and discuss your results no need for a specialist or anything  pretty simplefeb 26 2009upvote  0marileew p s the addresses of all the labs in your local area where you can get blood work done will be on the back of the req form usually so once you get the req form it is pretty selfexplanatory and there is no prep for a thyroid test either like there is for a diabetes test you dont have to fast or anything so you can go in when ever it is convenient for you to get the blood work done and they only have to take one vial to run the tests although the doctor will always run a complete blood panel but still this will only be another one or two vials and it will all be drawn at the same time so you dont have to wait around for them to draw multiple samples from different sites or anything like that it is pretty much the simplest blood work youll get done feb 26 2009upvote  0captainheadache thank you all for the helpful information also im a software developer and so i spend a lot of time coming up with experiments to test ideas so i just remembered some stuff that might be useful information ive had two experiences in my life where my headaches have magically disappeared once while driving with a throbbing headache i had to make a sudden stop to avoid a wreck immediately the pain went away and i felt normal for the rest of the day the other time i was jogging strenuously with a very painful headache and when the pain was just about unbearable i heard a tiny popping noise in my head and the headache went away i think both times i had a surge of adrenaline of further note i stumbled upon the idea that dhea could prevent migraines taking this naive assumption ive been taking 25 to 50mg of the supplement per day for about a week surprisingly ive yet to have a headache and ive been eating anything and everything the only headacherelated symptom ive felt in the last week is that i feel worn out in the morning however i used to feel far more worn out when i was just dealing with the head pain without medication feb 27 2009upvote  0tomsant so your problem is settled at least for the time being but you dont know how about dhea hope it is dehydro epiandrosterone i am unable to comment about the two occasions when there was a jolt associated with a snap when the headache left it might have been a cervicogenic headache where the cervical vertebra malalignment might have been the problem next time just in case you get such a headache alert your neuro about this story of yours still wondering about what could

into this you may be suprised dec 31 2009upvote  0enas yunis i have similar issues  if i do not sleep within two hours of a cereal only breakfast i go into headaches nausea fatigue and the like my doctor decided to perform a blood sugar drop test even if the numbers are all normal the change in the blood sugar drop can be so high to cause these side effects so i show up fasting and take a reading blood sugar on the hour next i eat horrible amounts of sweet foods and drinks for half an hour then on the hour for the next five hours the reading is taken my results were 901171261079762 the nurse said all is normal the great doctor on the other hand told me that the 62 is a major drop below the fasting reading and that is when my symptoms show the worst he said these numbers and the symptoms i deal with are all related to a disease called reactive hypoglycemia there are lots of helpful documentation on this disease  i know the post is old but i hope this helps jan 09 2010upvote  0chantal cthis is actually for all i love sweet potato casserole and just recently noticed a correlation between eating it and getting headaches even though ive had headaches for a long time now thats why i was prompted to find these posts i would like to point out that alcohol and sugar have the same effect on the body  dehydration if you ingest too much and dont drink enough water and add diuretics to your diet like coffee or tea you can basically trigger a hangover this is what ive been told so someone please correct me if im wrong jun 23 2010upvote  0captainheadache well its been a while since i posted on here and i have some good news and bad news i finally found a doctor who was willing to administer more than just the standard blood work the doctor suggested we could try a glucose tolerance test and i oblidged during the test i dropped to 49 at around the 2 hour mark which is a very low number and also happened to be the point when i started getting a headache within an hour my blood sugar was back to normal but the symptoms still persisted for quite some time afterwards the doctor labeled this reactive hypoglycemia which was nice since it finally put a name on something i was experiencing on the other hand the cause is unknown and the treatment is to eat 6 or so small meals a day with a heavy restriction on what i can eat so that wasnt good news as far as what i can eat i basically stick to everything thats 50 or below on the glycemic index and i occasionally ingest guar gum supplements to slow down absorption this has been by far the most effective means of avoiding headaches assuming i always eat the recommended serving size or less in a 2 hour period and stick to the right foods im generally alright in terms of how i feel i get maybe 1 headache every month because i try eating something new and ive only had 1 headache that has caused me to miss a day of work so im reasonably satisfied with regard to how i lived previously the same doctor that diagnosed reactive hypoglycemia gave me a migraine medication that was seemingly effective but it caused me to have nightmares and feel extremely sleepy i wasnt getting a good night sleep so i took myself off the medication i developed some serious vertigo for about a week and missed 3 days of work and thats really the last time i tried to take migraine meds i dont remember the name of the medication but i think the brand name started with an e oh and one last thing that i didnt mention because i really only notice it after no longer getting regular headaches after eating a large meal i would always get very heavy brain fog its very apparent to me now since it doesnt happen anymore but after eating i would have a very hard time comprehending what was going on around me its hard to believe i existed in this lull for so long but now im finally out of itjul 09 2010upvote  0jenart24yawning is the way the body takes in large amounts of oxygen may or may not be related to food issues probably need to drink large amounts of water and this will stop the yawning botox injections in the forehead and between the eyes will relieve tension headaches it works if you are in

migraine headaches usually present with throbbing headaches with nausea vomiting and sensitivity to light and sound attacks can be due to exposure to triggers such as food temperature weather and and many others it is good that you can identify the cause  in this case the hot food try to avoid such trigger rest ice packs and pain medication may also help provide relief take care and regards jan 14 2011upvote  0carbo headache any updates in the last year may 25 2011upvote  0captainheadache wow kind of neat how this became one of the top google search results for headache after eating anyway i can give an update my diet is now extremely restricted here is a great list for the glycemic effect of certain foods httpwwwmontignaccomenigtableauphp i have to eat 30 or below and in small quantities i cant seem to eat rice though which this chart suggests i should be able to over time the condition seems to be getting worse im having to eat less and less and lower on the glycemic scale in fact im only posting this because i had a bad headache yesterday and had to miss work this morning i cant do my job with the kind of head pain i experience taking 6 advil after every meal is not an option any amount of eggs steak or high protein content in general will trigger a bad headache the only meats i seem to be able to eat are pork chicken and turkey ive been thinking lately that the yawning might indicate something i feel like im not getting enough oxygen even after a really big yawn im not exaggerating when i say i yawn nonstop for almost 2 hours sometimes this only ever happens after lunch time what could cause a sudden drop in blood pressure after eating sometimes the end of a headache corresponds with a series of heart palpitations or a slight burning like an adrenaline rush in the chest however most of the time my head stops hurting while im asleep on a related note ive been woken up by extreme rushes of adrenaline in the middle of the night on occasion i wasnt having a nightmare or anything  but i just would get what felt like a huge surge of adrenaline one other thing doing yoga or exercising regularly seems to help do not attempt to do yoga with a headache you will get extremely nauseated think of it as a preventative jun 03 2011upvote  0jessbpeck i and my husband had similiar syptoms always yawning and intense headaches and getting up to urinate several times a night we both have sleep apnea and i have thyroid problems hypothyroidism but with your weight being light you are probably hyperthyroidism do a sleep test i did not realize how much your body suffers if you think you are going to sleep every night but you are really not reaching rem with sleep apnea you stop breathing several times at night which cuts off oxygen to the brain causing you to wake with sevier headaches any doctor can do a thryroid test but you have to go to sleep center for a sleep test hope this helps jun 15 2011upvote  0captainheadache here i am again with another update i saw a cardiologist and my heart is in good health so no pfo or abnormal rhythm detected in a 24 hour period of time he also checked my thyroid hormones and everything looked normal my doctor noticed that my heart beat was hypodynamic which is normally caused by an adrenaline response prior to a headache this hypodynamic beat increases dramatically my palms also become oilysweaty my vision a little blurry and of course i get head pain i have to wait until november to see an endocrinologist but in the mean time my doctor suggested i try an antianxiety med since anxiety can cause headaches i was prescribed effexor and took it for about a week but that just made me tired nauseated and unusually depressed about my situation i also tried over the counter gaba and ltheanine in large quantities these two seem to limit my symptoms im having to take about 2000mg of gaba and 800mg of ltheanine for any kind of effect i get a fiery sensation in the back of my head and spine when i take these supplements id like to understand whats going on there during my doctor visit the nurse measured my vitals and i was 10060 this was about 20 minutes after i ate lunch over the next hour i started getting a headache as per usual the doctor came in and measured my vitals again and this time i was 12090 he thought maybe the nurse measured when i was in a valley but i think it was because my head pain started to kick in also ive lost about 6 lbs because i can hardly eat anything and so im now 119lbs standing at 5 9 aug 13 2011upvote  0lisajlou i found this site today by yes googling headache after eating read your posts and happy to see a recent one as i started with the 2009 this is to you and all others it will help here i am 45 i have had severe headaches for several years with no doctor being able to tell me why i have been diagnosed with tmj fibromyalgia tension and migraine headaches i have a tall willowy build and thus told my headaches are also due to poor posture i knew that was not true i know by how i feel and when they come on that it was not this i also wake up in the wee hours with them constantly my husband is currently studying to be a nurse to make a long story short we both figured out that i may be hypoglycemic i have cut out almost all sugar which is helping a lot he also suggested i eat a shortbread cookie when i wake up in the early morning about 130 am prior to a headache i normally have to go to the bathroom he said this should be the right amount of carbssugar to get me through the night with no headache since august 1 this has been working like a gem almost all nights a couple of nights however it has not and i have wondered why when i found this site today i realized i have more trigger foods i had potatoes for supper last night and bam headache now i know i need to also watch for more trigger foods i am also a very tired personlow energy and always have been by chance how many on here have had mono just curious i have blood tested for it twice in my life the first time i was five im not sure that means anything but i was just wondering for my headaches i take 100 mg of topamax a day but id like to get off that because i dont really think it helps and i also take generic imitrex when i get a headache that gets extremely severe i have cut down having to take those by a lot since i cut out sugar i wish all the

link to postprandial hypotension httpwwwhealthharvardedupressreleaseseatingcancauselowbloodpressure came here because of a headache a larger than normal lunch i know most of the headaches the i have

this was a bit different i could feel my shoulders tensing up as i drove back to the office hope everything is going well for you oct 05 2011upvote  0foodpain thank you for you comments you sound like a doctor i never got headaches but about two months ago i started getting them real bad when i get a headache in the past i would work it thru to avoid taking advil etc now i am popping 3 advil each time i get a bad headache about twice a day trying to figure out what it might be i told my doctor that maybe i have an ear infection he called in antibiotic 5 day pak so see how thats going to play out i been having pain from center on my head down to my temples and sometimes to my jar or gums i get really tired then a get a bad headache if the antibiotic does work i will start eliminating certain foods completely like white bread brown surgar cookies homemade etc example this morning i had bran flakes with banana and half tsp of brown surgar and afterwards i felt very tired then for lucnch i had half of turkey sub and a cooky got very tired again and very bad headache also let me know what you think of additives i normally eat organic but like with certain things like turkey and white bread on the sub could have additives etc oct 14 2011upvote  0headachegrl hi everyone this was an interesting post and the comments were pretty interesting also i know the constant headache thing is terrible and only those who go through it can really understand how debilitating it can be now i notice others have mentioned an elimination diet which i think is a great idea but you should also consider having an allergy test done you may be allergic to alot of things and its showing in this way i would also request to be tested for a glutencasein sensitivity or celiacs disease your inability to gain weight and difficulty digesting some proteins suggests some serious gi problems some doctors are reluctant to look at food allergies as triggers as they always want to treat the symptoms but what does it hurt to do the test you might find that something you never suspected is an issue for you also have you looked the paleoprimal way of eating its not a solution for everyone but some people have found some success and finally it sounds like you really should eat foods with a little bit more fat more extra virgin olive oil organic butter coconut oil things like that fats and proteins combined keep you full longer at least that has been my experience and that may help keep your blood sugar more stable remember the organs need a decent amount of fat to function properly i noticed personally when i cut out coffee and flour i reduced the number and severity of migraines and when i added them back the sluggishness and headaches returned with a vengeance ive decided that the biscuits and spaghetti are not worth the headaches back to the diet for me oct 24 2011upvote  0captainheadache why hello again everyone it turns out i get extreme anxiety after eating and have just been in a constant state if anxiety for most of my life i take about 2mg of klonopin per day and i can eat whatever i want i am up to 140lbs now and feel amazing i take gingko to help with the memory problemside effects but otherwise it is a good temporary solution apr 02 2012upvote  0krasi0hey its great that you have finally found a prognosis me having the same headache symptoms its been a while since i started trying to get rid of those anyways are you sure that anxiety is the primary reason for the headaches and is not just another symptom to go along with them itll be interesting to know how you got the diagnosis apr 05 2012upvote  0holisticpsychotherapist get tested for celiac disease anxiety is a symptom klonipin is a bandaid most meds stop working over time so keep looking for the root problem while youre feeling better apr 11 2012upvote  0edithdell hello i took klonopin for two years and it almost made me kill myself you should never take that medicine for more than two weeks i developed a tolerance to it and went through withdrawal even though i was still taking the medicine it drove me crazy i put myself in the hospital and when i got out i stopped the medicine i started a severe withdrawal and went to no less than 12 doctors and none of them diagnosed withdrawal from the klonopin it has been the worst nightmare of my life if you go to org website you will read about the many people suffering relentlessly from benzo withdrawal klonopin is a benzodiazepine i am 9 months from taking my last klonopin and i am suffering from the same symptoms you mentioned i know it is from the klonopin and am hoping that once my brain heals from the klonopin i will get better and be back to normal withdrawal can take up to 3 years taking klonopin was the biggest mistake of my life please be sure to do tons of research before you take that medicine for more than a few weeks good luck apr 12 2012upvote  0edithdell i also wanted to tell you that i went to a nutritionist and she said that my problem is that my digestive system and my liver are sick and that it why this is happening she said that since they are the guards of the brain castle and that what i am eating is not being processed properly and too much glutamate is getting to my brain i was told to eat a fat protein and carb with each meal and snack and given digestive enzymes and probiotics to take this is to build up my intestinal wall so it is healthy again the headaches were worse so i am going to have to move slower and going to see a accupressure doctor who can get my liver on the right track as well it seems my liver and digestive system are so compromised they are why i am so sick it is also from allergies i tested allergic to everything food wise and it is from my compromised digestive system i am sure it is from the klonopin i took and i hope and pray that my brain heals soon and takes in all the gaba it needs to counteract the glutamate i eat with foods the lower the glutamate level i eat the less the headaches if you look up benzo support sites you will see many people that have diet issues like ours apr 12 2012upvote  0edithdell hello i have the same symptoms but have read a book called body ecology diet by donna gates and believe i have found the problem candida and leaky gut from all the medicines and antibiotics i have taken in the past as well as my diet being so bad as i struggle with withdrawal i started the diet 5 days ago and i have less and less headaches and my sleep and improved amazingly i really think i may have found the answer it

0fmr1969my guessyeast infection overgrowth or a bacterial overgrowth read the webpage by karen tripp on candida she eliminated carbssugars as much as possible and used undecylenic acid from castor oil  she used a product called thorne formula sf722 acid and caprylic acid from coconut oil acid to kill the fungus and then a probiotic to have beneficial bacteria compete for food with the fungus i would say that the headaches are dehydration andor toxins yeast are used to make alcohol and everyone gets headaches when they have too much alcohol so if you are feeding yeast inside you maybe they are dumping toxins in you that add to the headaches you also said you get regular diarrhea which is dehydrating you stated that headaches were less freq when you were a wrestlermaybe you burned off a lot of the carbs used to feed the fungus less fungal growth  less headaches yawningskipping meals and being low on carbs results in air hungerif the fungus is using up your carbs along with your body dumping carbs through urination and diarrhea possibly as a defense to starve the fungus tired after meals if you are starving again bc of diarrhea and the fungus competing for the sugar as soon as you eat you will be very tiredsleepy your doctors seem to be chasing symptoms and forgetting about looking for a cause stomach ulcers were stressruns in familyspicy foodturns out it is h pylori bacterium arthritisagain was runs in familycold work environments etcnow bacteria heart diseasewas poor genetics ie runs in familiesnow caused by viruses look for a cause and the cure is in foods along with your own immune system on the karen tripp diet she avoided and premade foods bc they contain a lot of cabssugars yo have to go back to eating real foodsfor example for beakfast bacon is manufactured food so substitute a slice of pork for breakfast along with a couple of eggs and no toast or cereals and no oj which has a lot of sugar replace the calories from sugar with calories from oils like olive oil lunch for example can be a large salad with low carbs veggies like bell peppers celery cucumbers cabbage drenched with spices and olive oil and eaten with a protein source like roast chicken but not with luncheon meats bc they contain a lot of sugar if the karen tripp candida diet works for you i want the nobel prize okay aug 21 2012upvote  0johnnyjamz i too found this forum after searching headache after eating i am a 36 year old male these symptoms began happening to me two months ago and was first triggered after having a bit of alcohol i got a pretty intense pain at my left temple and behind my left eye i did not connect this as cause and effect at the time a week later after once again having some alcohol the same thing happened so i swore off alcohol but i began to discover that seemingly randomly after meals i would get the same migraine always in my left templeeye i started to pay attention to what i was eating and when i would get these migraines although i havent nailed down all the triggers so far i suspect rice potatoes and fish i also get slightly anxious and i even experience some flank pain kidney pain although i am not convinced this is related to the migraines captain headache you have mentioned that the cause of your condition could be hypoglycemia or fibromalgya if you could elaborate on these diagnosis i would much appreciate it have your doctors come to a more solid conclusion on what is causing you to endure this terrible ordeal unfortunately i am uninsured and if i pay for a doctors visit id like to go in with as much information

adrenaline rushes could be related to cortisol levels you may want to see if your md can check into that oct 11 2012upvote  0centuryhousedw i have had the same symptoms as you for the last 6 years it does appear that sugars too many carbs will trigger this for me i was diagnosed with reactive hypoglycemia the root cause appears to be a hereditary high triglycerides which serves to shut down function of the pancreas since the pancreas controls insulin production  release the explanation given me was that when i eat sugarcarbs it puts glucose into my system instead of a correct amount of insulin being released a huge amount gets dumped which knocks my blood sugar low the body then releases epinephrine  norepinephrine to halt the insulin production  release this causes some blood vessel restriction etc and the headache since epinephrine is adrenaline it causes elevated heart rate  blood pressure as well  which is consistant with what you reported all of that said  there was a commentor above smh1969 who mentioned a systemic yeast problem possibly causing this in addition to my confirmed triglyceride  pancreas problem i have begun to suspect that yeast may be the main culprit instead  but i havent confirmed this yet it is worth checking into oct 23 2012upvote  0solsonmedhelp check out fructose malabsorption and fodmaps the best research is from australia sue

sometimes i cant that is why i started looking for headache info jan 20 2013upvote  0astich this is all very interesting i dont necessarily get headaches just after eating i pretty much always have a headache or did until i had botox and now have a reduction it seems so far however as someone who is in recovery from an eating disorder as well i put 2 and 2 together and realized that i didnt really suffer migraines when i was actively restricting calories i did some research on the matter after i started hearing about ketogenic diets for children with epilepsy which i also have but its controlled with meds and theres a lot of notsoscientific anecdotal information about it online httpwwwhcopcomz1080 i bought keto strips and tried to maintain on it it does help me moreso than anything else but its really hard for me to maintain without spiraling out of control so  it might be a better option for some than others jan 24 2013upvote  0armymom0388i thought i was the only one this happens to when i tell people sugar andor carbs make me sick they look at me and say oh i suffered with migraines for years i noticed that before it rained they were really bad it wasnt until my husband and i were on a cruise and i got a migraine everyday by the third day my husband suggested i see about the acupuncturist on board he was the one who told me to cut out all sugars and carbs i did and never had a headache that was 5 years ago now i am at a different job and it is very difficult there are cakes soft pretzels etc almost 2x a week so we are back to square one i was curious if anyone ever experienced drainage from the ear when they are sleeping i experience this when i eat rice potatoes or any sugar thank you everyone for all the wonderful tips and info mar 12 2013upvote  0corinne fyour experiences are consistent with migraines that are rooted in metabolic syndrome the leg cramps are a clue that you might respond well to magnesium therapy  since low magnesium this is a factor in both issues magnesium of about 400mg extra a day above and beyond what you would normally need to balance your calacium intake if you take this therapy it goes better if you have a well rounded multivitamin other vitams that do very well include b2 at about 200mg extra per day 200mg of q10 helps the b2 metabolic syndrome involves an insensitivity to insulin which might be why your situation is so easily triggered by sugar metabolic syndrome is often linked to migraines in which case unchecked the symptoms only get worse until it develops into full blown diabetes if that is the case its very important to avoid refined sugars and refined grains vigorous exercise for at least 15 minutes a day is also crucial if you have metabolic syndrome but you need to be sure to follow that with some kind of protein snack like a glass of milk ive found that if i do this exercise prebed it further helps the leg cramping i hope that helps jul 28 2013upvote  0corinne fps the yawning and the frequent peeing are also symptoms common in migraine sufferers most doctors dont know that jul 28 2013upvote  0angela alexander i also had severe headaches whenever i ate chocolate it turns out that i have a problem with the casein in milk which is a protein ill get a migraine that lasts for a while if i eat products that contain milk also my throat constricts i get congested and i just feel bad benedryl is the only thing that works not tylenol advil aleeve or any other over the counterproducts for headaches for the longest i thought that if i took dairy ease and used lactosefree milk that would be the end to my problems however i didnt have an issue with lactose but the casein i tried to eat soy cheese and drink silk but i was still getting congested although not nearly as bad as i get with milk ill take that congestion because i like to bake i was still having abnormal lab tests so i got tested for celiacs i have it and was told to eliminate all gluten which has been very difficult as many things contain it when i first went gluten free i noticed a change in the first few weeks my joints didnt ache my head didnt hurt i wasnt congested i thought more clearly and my food didnt get stuck in my throat before i had been diagnosed with gerd gastroesophogeal reflux disease my food wasnt digesting properly and i would basically regurgitate my food in the back of my esophagus it got so bad that i actually got a yeast infection in my esophagus yuck and had to have a procedure to open it back up because it had constricted hence the feeling that my food was stuck i had a set back recently after eating some fries from a local fish restaurant apparently they fried the fries in the same grease they use to cook their fish also i dont do well with the fried foods due my gerd anywho

0ddt12303check out candida forums and youtube candida stay away from breads pasta and sugar eat low fat foots mostly fruit and vegetables low fat meat such as turkey and chicken breast read how fat coats the blood cells and prevents the blood cells from absorbing glucose sugar to deliver energy to the brain muscles and the rest of the body when the carbs cant be absorbed into the blood and be used as energy candida blooms out of control absorbing the sugar and preventing any serious damage to the body as a result of the fat coated blood cell not being able to utilize the sugar the candida will release its emission after eating carbs in the form of ethanol and ammonia these two by products are what make you feel foggy headed and give you migranes jan 04 2015upvote  0jacmtsounds like a form of irritable bowel the reactioninflammation from the sugar activates the nerves governing the intestines which fire excitedly and irritate the connective tissue surrounding the spine and vagus nerve this irritation continues up the spine to the head resulting in a headache and probably neckspinal pain neuromuscular massage holding tender spots on the body especially the trunk and cranium will relaxnormalize the tissue and remove the pressures on all the nerves that govern the organs including the intestines this is a timeconsuming process two hours two to three times a week for a few weeks a break then start again you can do some of it yourself on the areas you can reach docs have no clue what causes headachesjan 20 2015upvote  0ch pr i am suffering from very similar problem for the past 20 years it started with drowsiness often progressing to headache around 2 hrs after lunch other prominent symptoms were intense thirst frequent urination constipation belching better always with sleep no problem if i dont eat two years back i was diagnosed with sibo  methane i have significantly improved with ayurvedic medicines maintain a very restrictive diet but still one error and everything goes bad and takes a lot of time to recover an important correlation i have noticed of late is a connection between unformedloose stools and headache i began to take a laxative everyday which helped with better hunger and diet management also when ever there is an aggravation i get reflux i have done all kinds of tests pancreas liver thyroid hemogram almost everything is normal acc to the blood test i am so healthy that doctors refuse to take the problem seriously they refuse to make a connection between headache and gi issues though every single alternative medicine recognizes it if only they could acknowledge they could use their excellent techniques of diagnosis more intelligently a few ayurvedic principles have helped me a lot 1 eating only when hungry 2 eating little less than full 3 eating before 630 pm 45 hrs before sleeping 4 keeping 45 hrs of gap between meals other things ive done keeping a list of problem foods not eating spicy foods the sibo recommendation coincides much with my issues but i have no problem with carbs the errors that usually lead to problem 1 overeating 2 not maintaining gap between meals 3 eating later than 7 pm 4 eating problem foods  in my case very spicy food fruits fructos or polyols feed si bacteria egg whites sometimes mucliagenous veggies like ladies finger feeds si bacteria all legumes except bengal grams mung beans and black beans  soaked overnight water thrown and all processed foods if i strictly follow diet and take ayurvedic medicines episodically i am alright symptoms reduce thirst and frequent urination goes away the only time headache vanishes is when i have well formed stools and that is very rare because i keep making mistakes i still believe if i follow all the rules i would be much better trying to not give up hope i wonder if anyone who has written above has found a better solution especially captainheadache whose symptoms very closely resemble mine wonder if anyone else has belching loose
