science  mathematics chemistry what is true of nonane that has a density of 079 gm l melts at 51 c and boils at 157 c is nonane soluble in water is nonane a gas at room temperature does nonane not undergo combustion does nonane float on the surface of water is nonane solid at room temperature follow 2 answers answers best answer is nonane soluble in water no like dissolves like nonane is nonpolar is nonane a gas at room temperature no it is a liquid does nonane not undergo combustion no nonane does undergo combustion does nonane float on the surface of water yes it is less dense that h2o is nonane solid at room temperature no it is a liquid dr w · 9 years ago1 0 comment no no no it does undergo combusiton yes no from the info that youve provided we know that nonane will float on water since its density is less than water density of water  10 gm l the hydrophobic nature of nonane a hydrocarbon means that it will not mix with water its 157 degree bp is much hotter than room temperature therefore it is not a gas at rt nonane is a hydrocarbon therefore it will undergo combustion and its 51 degree mp means that it will be melted at room tempertature hope this helps david m · 9 years ago0 0 comment maybe you would like to learn more about one of these hard drive full cloud storage find moving container services online education an option best home security system
