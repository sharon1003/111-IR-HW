what was a pound worth this entry was posted in statistics on 2nd march 2004 by brian easton the reserve bank of new zealand inflation calculator and earlier keywords statisticsas a part of its statutory responsibility for price stability the reserve bank of new zealand has provided a web based ‘inflation calculator’ historians will find it useful to convert an earlier price into a current one thus giving readers a better sense of the significance of a historical value the site is well documented and there is no difficulty using the simple procedures entering 200 in the top left box setting the right boxes to 1919 in quarter 1 and setting the next line of right boxes to 2003 in quarter 3 will show that £20000 in early 1919 would purchase the same as 1525588 in 2003 the following remarks are designed to elaborates some points of particular importance to historians a consumer price index is based on the valuation of a standard ‘basket’ of goods and service the items in the basket reflecting the purchases of a typical average consumer if the basket costs say 100 in one year and 200 a decade later then prices are said to double in practice the cpi basket gets changes over the years year on year changes do not much matter but over the long run there will be considerable changes to the composition of and weights in the basket the current one includes the family computer the 1919 one may have included an abacus thus there is a bit of convention in the comparison but the calculation gives a sense of historical values in current terms however the calculator does not tell you the price of a particular product in today’s terms that your grandparent’s land cost £20000 in early 1919 does not mean the land cost 1525588 at the end of 2003 what the calculator tells you is that the £20000 in 1919 would purchase a basket of goods and services which would have cost 1525588 in 2003 land is not even in the basket it is not a consumer item the calculator may also be misleading in regard to incomes suppose your grandfather earned £317s0d a week or £20000 a year the calculator shows the £20000 was the equivalent of 1525588 29338 a week at the end of 2003 which is a low rate of remuneration in today’s terms the calculation tells us what the wage would buy but what you really want to know is that £317s0d a week was a little above the average manufacturing male wage for those days see new zealand official yearbook 1920 p372 in the long run earnings rise faster than prices because of rising productivity alas there is no ‘earnings calculator’ the inflation calculator only goes back to 1919 as far as the quarterly data allows tabulated below is a simple but not as robust calculator going back to 1862 the tables give the value of a pound in a pre1919 year in march quarter 1919 consumer prices second column and september quarter consumer prices third column it can be used in conjunction with the reserve bank inflation calculator by putting the second column figure into the rbnz inflation calculator for 19191 if the requested time is 20033 the default setting the answer should be the the third column figure what a pound could purchase 18621918calendar year value in 19191 pounds value in 20033 dollars£ 19191  200331862 1013 77251863 1041 79411864 1060 80831865 1040 79311866 1078 82201867 1038 79191868 1011 77111869 0881 67231870 0821 62601871 0849 64751872 0880 67141873 0856 65271874 0855 65231875 0839 63971876 0817 62291877 0816 62281878 0826 62991879 0729 55641880 0718 54751881 0723 55151882 0735 56031883 0735 56031884 0717 54691885 0684 52141886 0668 50941887 0629 47961888 0622 47461889 0609 46441890 0593 45221891 0605 46121892 0583 44471893 0573 43691894 0563 42971895 0555 42361896 0569 43371897 0572 43611898 0575 43841899 0561 42801900 0566 43141901 0595 45381902 0614 46841903 0615 46931904 0614 46841905 0625 47691906 0634 48361907 0643 49041908 0647 49321909 0648 49391910 0654 48891911 0660 50321912 0675 51521913 0694 52951914 0707 53931915 0734 55961916 0783 59711917 0848 64681918 0940 7171notes the table is based upon margaret galt’s consumer prices series published in m a arnold consumer prices 18701919 discussion paper no 12 wellington department of economics victoria university of wellington may 1982 and subsequently updated in m a arnold a long run consumer price index for new zealand for march years 18621983 publication in possession of brian easton the published series is for march years december years have been interpolated go to top
