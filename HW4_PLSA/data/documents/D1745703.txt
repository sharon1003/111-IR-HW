vsepr and bond angles the vsepr model does a remarkably good job of predicting molecular geometries in a general way based on symmetry arguments and the allimportant idea of electron pair repulsions we have stated see page 82 in the text that lone pairs tend to occupy more space than bonding pairs but with one more idea we can be quantitative about the effect of lone pairs on the final geometry we will discuss this idea—called ligand closepacking—in the context of simple triatomics with a central o atom bonded to two other atoms either h f or cl we start with the symmetric possibilities h 2 o of 2 and ocl 2 the bond angles and bond lengths of these three molecules are shown below note that the bond lengths increase in a way we can understand easily h is smaller than f which is smaller than cl but look at the bond angles we have claimed that the two lone pairs on the o atom not shown should push the bonding pairs of electrons down lowering the bond angle from the perfect tetrahedral angle of 10947° indeed the first two molecules have smaller bond angles as expected but the bond angle in ocl 2 is 1109° more than a degree larger than the tetrahedral angle whats going on the ligand closepacking concept says that the atoms bonded to the central atom ie the ligands have a fixed radius and the bond angle adjusts until these ligands are just touching closepacked in other words the bond length is determined by parameters such as atomic radius but the angle is determined by lone pair electrons repelling the bonding pairs until the ligands just touch it is easy given the bond angles and lengths shown above to use a little trigonometry to calculate how far apart the ligands themselves are this distance should equal the diameter of the ligand or half that distance is the ligand radius this calculation is shown below in pictures that represent the h f and cl ligands as spheres that just touch from this figure we see that the radius of h bound to o should be about 1514 å2  0757 å the f radius should be about 2201 å2  110 å and the cl radius should be about 2793 å2  140 å armed with these values we can make a prediction about the structures of the hof and hocl molecules for hof we would predict the h and f atoms to be about 0757 å  110 å  186 å apart and for hocl we predict a h – cl distance of 0757 å  140 å  216 å moreover we can accurately locate the o atom if we assume the h–o bond length is always close to what it is in water the f–o bond length is always close to what it is in of 2 and the cl–o bond length is always close to what it is in ocl 2 the figure below shows how well we do the experimental ligandtoligand distances are both quite close to our predictions shown in parentheses based on these radii moreover the experimental bond lengths to the o atom are quite close to our expectations from the original three molecular structures what have we learned first the vsepr idea that lone pairs repel bonding pairs distorting bond angles away from usually to values smaller than the ideal angles is valid but second when we add the concept of ligand closepacking we can predict these angles with remarkable accuracy we can see why apparent violations of the bond angle is less than ideal rule occur as in the ocl 2 case sometimes the ligands are so big that at their ideal bond length they have to form a bond angle larger than ideal because the ligand repulsion is greater than the lone pair–bonding pair repulsion and ligand repulsion determines the final geometry you can now take the various bond lengths and ligand radii quoted above and with a little trigonometry predict the structure of the final triatomic of this family focl give it a try9 section home related linkschem lab chemistry department kresge library dartmouth college
