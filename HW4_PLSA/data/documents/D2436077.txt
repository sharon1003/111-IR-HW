home ailments interstitial cystitis remedies apr 04 2018what is interstitial cystitis also called painful bladder syndrome interstitial cystitis is a chronic condition characterized by bladder pressure bladder pain and periodically pelvic pain a hollow organ the bladder is responsible for storing and processing urine as the bladder fills with urine it expands and when it is full it signals to the brain the brain then transmits the information to the pelvic nerves which creates the urge to urinate for most people in individuals with interstitial cystitis however these signals are not communicated effectively so an individual experiences the need to urinate more frequently even with less volume of urine than most people the common signs and symptoms of interstitial cystitis vary from person to person and may vary over time as interstitial cystitis is a condition that involves periodic “flaring” in response to triggers common interstitial cystitis signs and symptoms include pain in the pelvis chronic or recurring pelvic pain a persistent or urgent need to urinate frequent urination in small volumes pain or discomfort in the bladder as it fills excessive relief after urinating and pain during sexual intercourse symptoms of interstitial cystitis may resemble those symptoms typical of a urinary tract infection however urine cultures are typically free of bacteria in an individual with interstitial cystitis while the specific cause of interstitial cystitis is not known research suggests that several factors are involved a defect in the protective lining of the bladder which allows toxic substances to leak out of the bladder an autoimmune reaction heredity infection and allergy are accepted possible causes of interstitial cystitis natural interstitial cystitis remedies essentially interstitial cystitis is an inflammatory condition as such many natural remedies that treat inflammation offer relief of interstitial cystitis an antiinflammatory diet avoiding “trigger” foods is an effective way for most to manage interstitial cystitis additional options include managing the alkalinity of the urine using borax baking soda and apple cider vinegar diluted in water other supplements that may be helpful include aloe vera vitamin c marshmallow root and barley milk alkaline p h5 star 1 504 star 1 50share your thoughts with our readers write a

would like to give something back i only found out i had ic by trial and error and a lot of research the pain was so bad a couple of years ago that i went to the emergency room you know how they have you in those curtained partitions right so this older dr comes in with a learning the ropes young intern and they are just not taking me seriously about how bad the pain is and saying i didnt have kidney stones and didnt have this or that and i got enough of that and yelled  look my vagina is killing me  you shouldve seen their faces lol i had no infection of course and they were clueless my regular dr told me i would need to see 3 different specialists to rule out different things and after we pay over 600 a month for insurance theres no money for 1 office visit let alone 3 specialist ones anyway i am still on a journey to find what will work best but i do have some experience with cleaning out parasites andor candida and since 80 to 90 of your health starts in your gut and has to do with your immune system i thought you all might benefit from this diatomaceous earth food grade is totally organic and natural there is even a test you can do in the morning first thing to see if you have candida and i promise you most of us do it is a powder with no taste and are actually very tiny little fossilized skeletons that have edges that will clean out and kill parasites and also clean out the sludge that has been building in your colon for years poor john waynes autopsy showed he had over 25 lbs of well poo in his intestines it does not give you diarrhea at all i promise but you must start off small and build very slowly to 2 full tablespoons you will not believe the stuff that will come out of you try to stay away from anything with sugar as that just feeds the little sh1ts do kefir to restore your good gut bacteria but not dairy kefir very simple to do your own from coconut milk or even water it is good for your pets too as unless you feed them raw they have candida too as a bonus you can sprinkle some on them to keep fleas off natural if you let them out in the yard remember only food grade and i got mine on amazon really cheap best to you all and i was so heartened to see so many of you spurning main stream medicine and their treating of symptoms rather than fixing the problem in todays world we have to take our health and our loved ones into our own hands stay away from cymbalta thought i would die from the withdrawal no liver tests for 6 years very bad reply 2replied by frances cabarlah qld 05222015vicki would diatomaceous earth work when

little jagged edges will hurt my bladder even more i am in constant flare reply replied by toni tayb memphis tn 12172015i used diatomaceous earth for 3 months i just started off with 2 tablespoons it did kill parasites after a week i followed with senna tea to flush out my intestines i thought the same as you the earth is wet so it cant be effective but it is it even removed swelling from around my knees which i didnt even know existed reply 1replied by cind kansas city 12252015hi vickiei am also in kc and am wondering if there is ic support group in the kc area i am interested in learning more about what you are doing in your ic healing journey reply replied by lisa yucca valley 11182016hello my friendyou have vulvodynia a chronic pain syndrome that affects the vulvar tissue i suffered with this for 3 yrs in the late 1990s it is oxalate crystals in your urine that cause the stabbing pain to the vulva tissue you must eat a low oxalate diet eliminating all foods high in oxalate you must drink lots of liquids like cherry juice or water or apple cider there are others look to the low oxalate diet alternatives buy calcium citrate with no additives figure out the times of the day when your pain is highest and take 500 or 750 mg of calcium citrate on an empty stomach with 8 or 10 oz of water the calcium citrate will return the urine to a normal ph over time get a vegetable laxative you will get severe constipation from the calcium citrate so you must take laxatives you can take a warm bath with some apple cider vinegar to relieve the pain no soaps or harsh chemicals to the area get on an anti depressant now to be able to better manage or cope with this horrible pain i have vulvadynia again probably it came back as i had a first time ever yeast infection or its heredity and stress plays a role in chronic pain conditions you will get better look to the vulvar pain foundation for support there are about 2 million women who suffer from vulvadynia you are not alone you can also try biofeedback to the pelvic muscle stay away from too many doctors as they dont know whats wrong and may give you topical treatments to the vagina which will make it worse and or antibiotics which will not help theyll think because of a white odor colorless discharge that doesnt test positive for yeast its still a yeast infection and treat as such this will set back your recovery and you dont need that stress let me know how youre feeling i pray you get well soon and you will but you must follow the regimen i have explained its the only cure reply replied by joan s santa maria ca 08062017so glad to see your post here about taking diatomaceous earth and using the senna tea also for the constipation ive been trying to teach people about this very same regimen to take for ic and using dieters tea made with senna especially in the beginning since constipation is the number one side effect when starting the de its worked so well for me that ive not had any ic flare since my last one in the middle of december 2016 i used to have flares at least 45 times a year and i would take prescribed pyridium to relieve the pain i would have to take 2 tablets twice a day for 5 days before the pain was completely gone my last flare was when after starting de i began my first break on the second day of the break from de i had a flare of my ic i decided instead of taking my prescribed med that i would just restart the de and i kid you not my pain was gone within hours thats when i decided that i would only take a break from the de when i felt it was necessary ive only taken one other 7day break and luckily no flare of the ic during that break so i am totally convinced that not only did the de clear up my ibs andor leaky gut but it also helped my ic among other physical problems that i could write a list about i will not be without de probably for the rest of my life my doctors have been absolutely amazed at what its done for me and im almost 63 years oldreply 4replied by debbie philadelphia 02032018if you can find an ic specialist in your area ask about dmso this is a procedure where they inject a chemical cocktail into your bladder for 20 mins once a week it is what gave me back my life i suffered for about 6 years before i found dr philip hanno philly he now lives in california reply 2posted by deborah riverview fl on 08022008deb for your ic please get some ph paper and test your urine you want it alkaline not acidic check it all day long i think you might have a fungal growth to kill it and get alkaline take 400mg of potassium citrate 3 times a day also take 14 tsp borax 18 to 14 tsp baking soda and 1 to 2 tbls apple cider vinegar in a little water take it 3 times a day you can drink some plain water after it to wash it down the fungus wont like this and you may feel worse before you get better please stick with it and stay away from all sugars i can now go 2 to 3 hours without going to the bathroom and only get up 3 times at night it use to be every 20 minutes good luck and i will pray for you reply 1replied by anjie goodlettsville tn 04162009please help me understand this i was told 3 weeks ago that i probably had i c ugh my dr gave me enanblex and the run down on this disease and told me to check several websites and support groups on how to deal with this his nurse said it all to do with what i ate and if i ate something acidic to do the baking soda trick it didnt help as a matter of fact it seem to get worse and my urine then had a foul odor with some pus in it i finally convinced my neurologist not my gyno to put me on antibiotics even though the urinalysis was negativeand it seem to start getting better right away does any body else have this problem i did find that you can use  to remove the acid from foods and it comes in a oral tablet  a granule formula to put in foods that you are cooking i feel like i need to find a different dr because he wasnt very helpful and basically told me to talk to the internet if i had a problem any feed back would be so helpful reply replied by elizabeth nashville tn 05032009this is for angie from goodlettsville tn that suffers from icif you had pus in your urine than it sounds like an infection to me my urologist said that the does not rely on the urinalysis done in the office because they can be unreliable he always sends them out to be cultured i would definitely get a second opinion if i were you i would much rather have utis which can be cleared up rather than ic which is a chronic condition best of luck to you reply replied by pooky san diego ca 07012009potassium that would kill an ic patient an ic patient cant get alkalined with acids it would kill them the potassium test is a test to see if you have ic if you are crying after it you have ic its a cruel test reply replied by susan grand rapids mi 07262009i have had ic for 19 years so i have a lot of experience dealing with it when i first came down with it i also noticed that antibiotics relieved my symptoms so i kept going to the doctor and begging for antibiotics whatever causes it is some kind of virulent fungus what has worked best for me is   anticandida supplement and colloidal

did constipation on just the calcium citrate wthe little magnesium oxide that was in the capsel so had to add more magnesium oxide  but adding too much caused diarrhea after finetuning this i still need to move on to do more wglucosamine and condritan but have a hard time taking that due to gastro issues i am going to try some manesium citrate and ozide together as i keep reading about how the

reply replied by ali brisbane qld australia 04192012i had recurrent cystitus for 30 years got to the point where i could not have sex without getting it i would also get it if i got too dehydrated doctors advice did not prevent the attacks i had to help myself i cured myself by using a mild antibacterial cream instead of ky jelly before sex for six months i have not had an attack since and that was 5 years ago sounds simple but it worked if you are into more natural methods you could try acijel which is just vinegar in a cream you can also try 14 tsp of bicarb with water twice a day to keep you alkaline as the problem thrives in an acid conditions good luck to all you long sufferers my heart goes out to you reply replied by sueb potsdam new york usa 01032013to ali from austraila could you please tell me what kind of mild antibacterial cream you used is it specifically for the vagina or intercourse thank you reply replied by helisphere raymond wa 02102013i have to say that i havent seen anyone mention digestive issues as being a root cause for ic but in my research of ic i have found that it may well be caused by digestive tract problems not urinary tract problems some of you may want to consider dumping your urologist and finding a good gastroenterologist or other digestive specialist many of you may just be on the wrong tract if the root cause is indeed in the digestive tract search for ibd and ic together and see what you find reply 2replied by grandma narooma nsw australia 02102013on the subject of cystitis about 25 years ago i had chronic cystitis bled from the bladder each time and life was pretty tough try holding down a job while suffering a bout after 7 doctors and 3 surgeons and the only solution seemed to be live on antibiotics for the rest of my life plus one doc who inferred that i might get help from a psychiatrist  i walked away and began my own long journey into natural solutions its right that cystitus is more about the digestion than the urinary tract what ive found its caused by candida yeast overgrowth candidiasis due to poor digestion from this grains and dairy in particular clog the whole digestive system especially the bowel and feed the yeast while the good bacteria are smothered remove grains and dairy from the diet clean the build up of sludge through the system by eating a small piece of cabbage each day to cleanse and heal the digestive system you may suffer bloating and wind for 23 days but thats the cabbage doing its job because candida is a small plant its roots reach through the bowel wall into places like the bladder cruising the blood stream creating itchy nose ears rear area skin problems general havoc the more antibiotics they fill us with the more the candida yeast is happy and grows ive been free now for more than 20 years after being told by a lady doctor that its something that many women get and have for life i have it and id better get used to it a couple of other things to note  its best to stay away from oranges mandarins peaches nectarines apricots and pineapple until the whole inflamed system is healed because they can be an irritant after some 35 years of living on lots of fresh vegetable juices raw fruit vegetables nuts and dried fruits i found i could eat any fruit or vegetable i liked with no affect my husband and i still live this way today having raised our family on the above diet juicing and a raw food diet will help to heal any health problem without fail were all basically suffering from malnutrition and toxic chemical overload i wish you good health reply 4replied by mar sunrise florida 02152013hi i am very happy to know that you are healed from ic i like you believe that there is a cure in healthy eating how much cabbage do you eat do you juice it how

urinary problems for 5 long years in fact at the beginning i noticed that there is a connection between the difficulty of urinating and spasms felt in the rectum i went to see a good urologist who told me after reviewing exams urine analysis that i have no problem with my urinary apparatus and that i have to see other specialists i was later noticed that each time i have to liberate stool i felt burning and spasms in my bladder accompanied by the difficulty and even impossiblity to urinate later i have to use very warm water in order to urinate and even liberate stool i couldnt find a good doctor to help me with my conditions i feel pain and burning all day i rarely leave home as i have to go to toilet very often and have to use warm water to release urine could you let me know

hydrodistention i did a ton of research and found some treatments not a cure but helpedthe simplest way we found and best tasting way to do alkaline water is pour 8 cups of water into a jug cut up a lemon into 8 pieces and let sit at room temperature for 12 hours do not squeeze the lemons drink it throughout the day it helps alot to get your alkalinity upthe second one has had the best results with her and her friend that has had ic for 20 years is a mix of two herbal remedies a marshmallow root tea as many as you want during the day i get her the already bagged version that also contains the marshmallow leaves tastes actually pretty good and i even take 2 cups of water pour in 3 tea bags cut open and a half a peppermint tea bag and let sit in the fridge for 12 hours take it out and strain it and serve cold she says its delicious then we add cantharis please read up on these before you use them she finally emptied her bladder first pee in the morning first time going to the bathroom that day this has not happened in 15 years for her this is just food for thought i am not a doctor i just want her to lead as close to a normal life as possible and keep her out of the hospital and help anyone out that i can that feels there is no answers for you pain fyi i am now researching monuril made of fosfomycin so if any improvements come of that i will let you know if you use any of this and it works keep going if it doesnt try mixing some stuff up but please remember to always consult a doctor when introducing anything as it could counter react your meds and for ic

shampoo los angeles california 05282012ok ive read aloe vera doesnt really work per se but you need the concentrated freeze dried aloe vera from desert lily or something i forget the name its expensive but worth it i guess ive heard of women being able to return to work by taking 3 to 4 pills a day also colostrum along with other herbal supplements marshmallow root quercitine etc has put some people in remission one lady i read buys msm powder every month and takes quit a bit thru out the day and it takes care of the pain 75 you can either put it in empty gel caps or take it in water or juice also turmeric is supposed to be very helpful several caps a day ok i thought i had interstitial cystitus and since im very prone to utis and i get them all the time i finally did some kind of damage to my bladder from all the infections or the cures cuz i take vitamin c and drink apple cidar vinegar like its my job and i figured i burnt my bladder lining or something anywhoo my conclusion is that this maybe perhaps most probably in many cases not all interstitial cystitus is an infection of some kind that wont go away for whatever reason the ecoli has embedded itself in your bladder lining or something cuz i started taking essential oils and it got 85 better try thieves oil 3 drops a day every day for a month its expensive but im planning on buying it next month since ive used other oils with success and ive read great things online about it reply replied by nonib lower michigan 05232015aloe vera pure organic and very expensive juice did nothing for me made me extremely nauseated there are some of us who cant tolerate various natural items even though they are themselves straight from earth the fact that my daughter and i share the same intolerances aloe vera echanesia gluten st johns wort etc indicates to me that there may be a genetic component my ic is very mild compared to many posting on this thread and im very grateful for that in my case ive found that carbonated beverages and sadly coffee can be irritating i avoid soda pop for the most part drink coffee sporadically and never strong brew i just discovered that apple cider vinegar wa small amount of raw unfiltered locallyproduced honey helps the ic as well as the various aches and pains from my constellation of autoimmune disorders mainstream medicine has saved my life a few times now

might help ive had four or five utis and each time the cs stopped it so if yours is virus related maybe experimenting with cs could help i google searched ic virus cause spelling out ic and found one site that listed fifty or so studies that showed possible causes of ic many but one stood outa study that showed how ic was 8 times greater with people who had lower tract surgeries leading to the

thru the urologist treatment doctor to doctor it took over 2 years of antibiotics but my bladder is pain free and the urologist treatments made it worse and did not work do not let any doctor tell you that antibiotics will not work it affected my pelvic floor i was in physical therapy for 6 months so i went to three different doctors who treated me each one was a blessing so if you are in the east go and see ruth kriz she does treat long distance if you are in the west los angeles go see dr erica lehman she was recently in the people magazine with avril and also there is dr gonzalez in thousand oaks dr gonzalez contracts with most insurance except obama care sorry if you do not believe in antibiotics you can try samento and banderol it will take time but there is help and believe me my pain was so bad i did not think i was going to make it i am a single mom and this took its toll but if i can survive this anyone can do not give up take care everyone reply 3replied by diamond ma 04162015i went to way too many doctors for what they felt absolutely sure i too had an infection the drs continued to treat me when months went by with still the itching burning and strong foul smell i went to a specialist in boston ma and found i have a mold virus where antibiotics is a derivative of a mold compound hence it made matters worse and my problem not only worsened but continued on into two years of pure hell and pain antibiotics eventually break down the immune system instead of running another risk of mistaken illnesses i will continue to do herbs i appreciate your better part of advice and so happy it worked for you god bless you reply posted by cherieh odessa texas usa on 09042010i was diagnosed with interstitial cystitis more than 2 years ago and its been excruciating having been told there is no cure and after many painful and expensive treatments i had to be my own health care advocate a couple of months ago i began to douche 2x a day morning and afternoon using equal parts apple cider vinegar and hydrogen peroxide do not douche in the evening or the hydrogen peroxide will keep you from sleeping  within 4 days the constant urge to urinate was completely gone and i was able to discontinue the flo i was taking to help me urinate after the second week i was able to discontinue taking el because all my symptoms of i c disappeared my doctor is utterly amazed and telling his other i c patients i am able to eat anything i want with the exception of beets and hibiscus tea without fear of a flare up i have my life back amazing that the help i needed was under my roof the whole time i am still douching 2x a day as of today reply 2replied by greatful frisco texas 09122010wow thank you for sharing i am going to try this right away reply replied by silliesyl long beach ca 09202010hello i am in so much agony with my ic and have been trying everything just wanted to know how soon you got relief reply replied by zsaqwe brownsville texas 09212010i think dmso is for interstitial cystitis cvs pharmacy might have it for that condition i got it from the web dmso although it is not approved by the fda for anything except an obscure bladder condition interstitial cystitis is widely used in sports medicine professional sports in particular are obligated to use dmso to get their athletes recovered from injury and back on the playing field each team knows the competition will use it and this would mean a tremendous advantage for the other team if it were to be ignored combine that with the fact that dmso is as safe as it is effective unlike largedose steroid injections which were once commonly used in professional sports and its use becomes mandatory in professional sports medicine when you consider the fact that dmso is not a new and patentable drug is cheap safe and effective and knowing what you should know about the medical establishment in the u s  you could predict with your eyes closed that there is a propaganda campaign against dmso the fda has done nothing except drag its feet in dmso research since october 25 1963 when the first research application to study dmso was filed with that agency i got the information from the doctors medical library by ron kennedy m d  santa rosa careply rikki ann texas 03122016how are you using the dmso reply replied by elizabeth nashville tn 09212010that is wonderful to hear i also had suffered from ic and never once thought to look in that area until i read this articleresearchers ruben gittes md and robert nakamura md of the scripps clinic and research foundation recently published a research study on female urethral syndrome a female prostatis in the may 1996 issue of wjm their studies have conclusively proven that women do indeed have a set glands the paraurethral glands which are homologues of the male prostate in the abstract for their research project they state the most important aspect of recognizing this microscopic female prostate as an anatomical feature is that its infections may completely explain many cases of the urethral syndrome i noticed my symptoms decreasing when i started using boric acid capsules for my recurring bvyeast infections i noticed within weeks that my ic symptoms improved dramatically i now use a verrrry diluted oregano oil for my vaginal health and guess what no ic symptoms i take my daily turmeric just in case its a great antiinflammatory i just thank the lord that i found earthclinic over a year ago i have found soooo many awesome remedies that workreply 2replied by rs san francisco ca 09222010i also tried all the remedies for bv and also had continuous bladder infections so i thought most likely caused by douching with h20 and h202 i read about the boric acid capsules and quickly bought boric acid and veggie caps and made my own very cheap i inserted one capsule nightly for about 34 nights and it was gone totally gone and like you i never had another bladder infection again which i later found out was i c and i never knew it i also believe that the boric acid capsule cured the i c when i feel the bv or the i c coming on i immediately insert a boric acid capsule and its totally gone i also highly reccommend liquid colloidal silver for i c i read about it on this site for treating i c and also make that a daily part of my regimen the first day i took the liquid colloidal silver i felt all my i c symptoms go away i take it everyday now without fail and no pain everything is back to normal i also take large doses of super cranberry extract everyday just to be sure i have everything covered it may be over kill but its better than dealing with the pain and discomfort of i c and bv on a daily basis thanks for your comment and thank your earthclinic for helping me and others reply

miscarriage last year a doc put me on various types of antibiotics which always made my bladder feel better for ureaplasma and possible lyme disease i have not had a positive urine culture since the onset of my ic because of the antibiotics i got yeast infections a lot frustrated i began douching with peroxide and  surprise my constant bladder symptoms urgency frequency burning pressure and pain during intercourse were nearly erased so i ordered a vaginal test to figure out why it showed that i dont have bv at all and very little yeast but a serious overgrowth of group b strep 4 on a scale of 04   an antibiotic and herbal sensitivity test was done showing all antibiotics to work and also oregano and colloidal silver im currently trying oregano mixed with coconut oil so i can mold it into a suppository and it wont sting my doc says the herbals are better for vaginal problems because antibiotics kill off the lactobacillusbifidobacterium allowing infectious bacteria to return stronger whats interesting is i tested negative for group b strep while pregnant with my son 3 years ago also i noticed while using the antibiotics kefir or any other cultured milk was the only product that seemed to truly have live and active bacteria if i drank this my stomach was fine but with probiotic capsules regular yogurt my stomach was not happy i hope this helps someone ill keep you guys updatedreply 2replied by shawna bronson mi 02252011i want to say thank you for this idea i have been battleing urinary issues since just before thanksgiving these issues include constant burning

out of bed sleep in a recliner with pillows between my legs and have been off work for over a month running to the bathroom 30 or 40 times a day and 812 times at night has foreced me to hybernate i

feel the spasms or my bladder hardening i quit taking my scripts yesterday and can not wait to go back in next week and find out the results of my scope and udi test but am so thankful you shared this remedy reply 1replied by lauren los angeles ca 03042011i too started douching w peroxide and vinegar due to a stubborn yeast infection and voila ic symptoms burning pressure pain frequency were soooo much better so i douched for about 2 months but it kept coming back quickly unless i douched every few hours i learned i have a very heavy growth of group b strep in my vagina tested negative for it 3 years ago before ic started so this explains why antibiotics always made my bladder feel better but after i stopped id get a major flareup good bacteria killed off enabled bad ones to proliferate more currently having luck with boric acid i insert a 00 size veggie cap full of it at least once a day and also a cap full of kefir cultured milk to repopulate good bacteria reply replied by gloria yucca

and evening after my mom in law told me about it her mom has been taking it for yrs and is rarely sick it was great until my ic started acting up my bladder was throwing terrible fits i looked on your website and did the baking soda thing and it helped so much i also went out and got an over the counter pill that my obgyn had suggested back when my ic was flaired up and initially diagnosed on monday i went to the doctor and was told my cholesterol and triglycerides were high total cholesterol was 232 i am 33 yrs old and not very active at the moment plus i have a desk job i know i need to modify my diet and get some excercise my question is this i was wondering if i mix the baking soda with the acv like i saw in another post will i still get all the benefits of the acv such as lowering my cholesterol without it causing my bladder to flare up and is the baking soda safe to take everyday i dont want to go on any medicationsanything i can do naturally is the way to go for me i was also

your thoughts with our readers write a review posted by lch1974 new york ny  on 09012016ive been dealing with health issues for a long time i have struggled with chronic lyme and ulcerative colitis ive just gotten to a very good place with the lyme and the ulcerative colitis is very quiet back in september of last year i had a uti infection that did resolve with antibiotics eight months later it returned and felt better after a few days of antibiotics except for an allergic reaction to the antibiotic it was switched and then i felt better just to mention that i havent taken antibiotics in many many years and just felt so desperate with the bladder infection that i felt i wanted it to be resolved quickly but a month later the symptoms returned constantly feeling like i needed to urinate and my bladder feeling like it was so swollen doctor appointments led me to possible early signs of interstitial cystitis which id heard of because a relative suffers from this i quickly began reading about remedies here and around the internet its been three months and the only thing that has helped is a douche with apple cider vinegar curcumin capsule opened aloe juice and distilled water if i do this three times a day the pain stops completely the issue i am having now is that im nervous that im putting things constantly in my vaginal area and changing the natural state of things which i guess was obviously not very good anyway considering my bladder is having all these issues but my vagina seems to be ok and now im concerned that i may be harming things further i did a little bit of a internal exam and the skin inside my vagina seems very different raw  and im concerned as to whether the apple cider vinegar maybe too acidic i was f illing half of a summers eve disposable douche bottle with apple cider vinegar which is obviously way way way too much so now i reduced it but i dont want to stop doing what im doing which will cause the pain to return full fledged and i also want the skin to heal  so this is half of a suggestion for a temporary relief but i also wanted to know if anyone has had any similar experiences or recommendations i am finishing my l ymir treatment and didnt want to do anything to interact with that so i plan to do prolozone therapy at the end of the month when i complete my lyme treatment also im taking aloe capsules and nutritional bladder support

had ic for 30 years my main pain triggers are vinegar lemon citric acid acidic foods vitamin c some of the b vitamins i am unable to take any products with citrates orotates asporotates the perfect remedy for me is 18 tsp baking soda i use nonaluminum product from health store mixed into very warm water usually pain subsides within the hour if not i take another 18 tsp it is important to read labels carefully because many products contain triggers my flare will occur within hours of eating a substance so i have learned that even small amounts of vinegar in mayonaise and salad dressing can be a problem before i reached menopause hormones i believe estrogen were a trigger as well that occurred at onset of menstrual cycle an over the counter product for vaginal burning was very helpful to me at that time it contained benzocaine for numbing i would only use for extreme pain though because it contains parabans etc i learned these are common causes of flares at the ic website vitamin c some b vitamins the hormone estrogen acidic foods unfortunately i suffered many years before i found what was helpful for my flares now i forget that i even have ic because i can treat it so easily im hoping this will be helpful to someone reply 2replied by shampoo los angeles california 05282012doesnt work i did a half teaspoon every 2 hours with a ton of water for two days and it did nothing for

takes about 4 months just to see if it will work i got on the internet and began reading and one day i ran accross the 18 tsp of baking soda and i told my husband the next time the pain starts im going to try it i didnt have to wait long and i tried the baking soda and within one hour the pain and frequency were gone i have now used that on several occasions and for me it stopped the pain within the hour a simple miracle cheap 18tsp in a very warm glass of water not particularly taste so now i put the 18 tsp in a gelatin capsule and i take it with the larage glass of warm water and golly gee pain free within the hour i know that everyone is different thats for sure but this has to be a first try for everyone suffering like i was and like most things we take rxs they are costly
