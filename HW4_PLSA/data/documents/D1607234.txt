antioxidants into the body than most other fruits and vegetables4 bilberries these european relatives of blueberries are even more beneficial in fighting against night blindness bilberries are rich in anthocyanosides a form of flavonoid which helps to regenerate the purple pigments in the eye that are used to see in the dark legend has it that british royal air force pilots after eating bilberry
