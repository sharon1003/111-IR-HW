also be essential if you require further advice please contact us contents of the articleswhen drafting articles the following areas usually need to be considered articles provisions on share classes most companies have just £1 ordinary shares there can be many reasons for creating different classes of shares including for tax reasons such as when special shares are created for employees or members of the shareholders families company law solutions can advise on and create special classes of shares for particular purposes and their website gives further details about share classes articles provisions on share allotments different arrangements suit different companies such asgiving the directors maximum freedom over share allotments so that they can allot shares they wish to anyone they wish our standard provision orpreemption provisions so new shares must be offered to existing shareholders orrequiring the written consent of all existing shareholders before new shares can be issued company law solutions can advise on share allotments and their website gives further details about allotment procedures etc articles provisions on share transfers the model articles give the board of directors an absolute discretion to refuse to register any share transfer our standard provision but other common alternatives arepreemption provisions on any transfer so that shares have to be offered to existing shareholders before they can be sold to anybody else orthat all shareholders must consent to any transfer orspecial transfer provisions eg that shares can be passed to members of a shareholders family orthat some classes of shares are treated differently from others company law solutions have many years of experience of drafting such provisions and more details can be found on their website articles provisions on general meetings general meetings are meetings of the shareholders where the most important decisions are made most decisions are made by passing an ordinary resolution which requires just a simple majority of those who vote some decisions eg to alter the articles require a special resolution which has to be passed by a threequarters majority of those who vote at this meeting if a poll is demanded each shareholder has the number of votes conferred by the shares they hold usually one vote per share a frequently amended provision is to fix the quorum as something other than two the standard provision this can be very important as a means of protecting shareholders from an important meeting being conducted without them articles provisions on board meetings board meetings comprise the directors of the company who may be the same people as the shareholders but need not be the board has control of the day to day running of the company including all commercial decisions at a board meeting unless the articles say to the contrary every director has one vote regardless of the number of shares held typical amendments areto fix a quorum other than twoto remove the chairs casting voteto remove the restrictions on a director who has an interest in a transaction from voting and counting in the quorum for the meeting articles provisions on directors appointment resignationand removal the model articles provisions on the appointment of directors are that the board or the general meeting can at any time appoint an additional director as to removal of directors a very important provision of the companies act 2006 sec168 is that any director can be removed by an ordinary resolution of the members the model articles also provide for automatic cessation of office in certain circumstances eg where a director becomes bankrupt or disqualified from acting these provisions can be very important take for example a typical threeperson company in which all three are directors holding onethird of the shares each under the standard provisions any two of the three can appoint additional directors to the board against the wishes of the third shareholder and can even remove that third person as a director typical amendments to the model articles areto provide that no person may be appointed as a director without the written consent of all the shareholders andorto include enhanced voting rights so that a director who is also a shareholder cannot in practice be removed by ordinary resolution the above comments are just a guide to
