the eyepiece the light passing through the telescope objective and eyepiece is focused onto retina by the optics of the eye after which it is neurally processed into the visual image hence it is the optical media of the eye  cornea crystalline lens and aqueous fluid filling the eye  that determine the final shape of the wavefront reaching retinal photoreceptors being bioengineered eye optics is far from high standards of a quality telescope however due to its small aperture and low magnification significant aberrations generated by it generally do not have much of an effect on the perceived image quality the two exceptions are eye defocus error  which is effectively corrected by appropriately defocusing the eyepiece thus inconsequential for the telescope user  and to a smaller extent eye astigmatism placing eye at the eyepiece end of a telescope changes its optical parameters this change is significant enough to justify establishing a specific term for this particular mode of operation the telescopic eye the most important change is that its aperture stop is now the eyepiece exit pupil not the iris this not only directly determines the level of eye aberrations due to its effective aperture but also may induce additional aberrations resulting from displaced stop in addition unlike the unarmed eye which observes objects directly the telescopic eye observes diffracted image of these objects in general the consequences of it are not significant but should be addressed nevertheless neural response and processing of light signals in the eye varies significantly with their intensity and wavelength making it an important subject for the telescope user in evaluating the properties of telescopic eye the starting point is unavoidably optical properties of the eye alone 131 the human eye physical properties transmittance and acuity the entire purpose of a visual telescope is to gather light from distant objects and to enlarge the incoming light angles so that these objects appear brighter larger and more detailed to the eye added benefit of the larger aperture of a telescope is lessening limitations to image quality imposed by diffraction since the light passes through both telescope system and the eye optical properties of the latter can affect the final image created by the brain being an optical element itself the eye is just as the telescope objective subjected to the effects of diffraction of light and wavefront aberrations physical and optical properties of human eye vary individually often significantly those presented here are based on experimentally determined averages  fig 216  figure 216 top view of the human right eye crosssection the light entering the eye first passes through the cornea refractive index n138 05mm thin negative meniscus of 7865mm radii anterior chamber between cornea and the eye lens is filled with aqueous humour watery fluid with n133 the iris is a muscle that forms circular opening  the pupil p eye aperture  varying from 2mm to 8mm in diameter the eye lens is biconvex made of thousands of roughly concentric layers with refractive index from 138 in the center to 141 at the edges change in the lens shape accomplished by the action of ciliary muscle enables eye accommodation maintaining focus on the retina for varying object distances when focused at infinity the lens is 36mm thick with front and back radii 10mm and 6mm respectively and focal length ƒ 24mm the eye focuses through the vitreous humour watery fluid n133 inside the vitreous body onto the retina made of the layers of cells and neural wiring connecting photoreceptors to the brain via optic nerve small spot on the retina  fovea centralis  is about 45° 13mm in diameter 48° off the optical center its central 13 is foveola the most acute vision area of the eye in daylight conditions as opposed to the outer area highly sensitive to lowintensity light square at right shows simplified scheme of a retinal segment light falling onto it first passes through plexiform the outer retinal layer consisting of a network of neural cells and wiring through which the brain both controls photoreceptor function and receives lightgenerated input from them the two main types of retinal photoreceptors are cones  active in daylight conditions covering the entire foveola and most of the outer fovea  and rods active in lowlight conditions predominant in the wide retinal area surrounding fovea the last third retinal layer is choroid which has a dual function of providing nourishment to the photoreceptors and absorbing any remaining light in order to prevent internal reflections retinal arc extends 32mm through the central meridian outer retinal area of relatively low sensitivity to daylight surrounds the yellowish oval spot of 4mm nearly 15° in diameter centered at 34mm nearly 12° from the optical axis of the eye called macula which converges toward fovea the highest daylight sensitivity area from the outskirts of macula outwards roughly 20° wide extends the ringshaped area of the highest sensitivity to lowintensity light eye light transmittance is relatively high in the 500nm700nm range and beyond into infrared but falling off quickly toward the blueviolet end of the spectrum  fig 217  figure 217 range of eye spectral transmittance based on several smallscale studies the results indicate wide individual differences although it could also result from small sample sizes four to nine individuals in four separate studies andor differences in procedures it is unclear whether eye transmittance  specifically its preference for mid and longer wavelengths within the visual spectrum  has been factored out from the eye spectral response sensitivity curve if not it would superficially lower actual sensitivity of the eye in the blueviolet relative to that in the green and red for both cones and rods since the relative change in transmittance over the range of wavelengths doesnt seem to vary significantly with the transmission level it shouldnt affect individual perception of chromatism variations in eye transmittance would mainly affect perceived brightness with the difference between high and low transmission level being close to one magnitude roughly evenly across the visible spectrum possible exception is that some individuals may have the ability to sense wavelengths well below 400nm and some not eye photoreceptors cells cones and rods form the lightsensing lining of the retina we need them to sense light just as we need nerve endings in the skin to sense touch they range in size from 2μ to over 10μ in general becoming larger toward the outer area of the retina the cones more so than the rods dominant retinal photoreceptors at mediumtosmall pupil sizes daylight and indoor light conditions are the cones while at large pupil sizes in lowlight conditions the dominant photoreceptors are the rods the two differ significantly in among other properties their respective resolution limits eye resolution level is termed acuity it varies over the retina depending on the receptor type and size it is also a function of the illumination level  fig 218  figure 218 left approximate average resolution of cones and rods over the retina varies with their size density and type of neural connection center of the fovea foveola is populated exclusively with cones their density approaching 200000 per mm² outside fovea cone density quickly decreases and their size increases with the cone resolution falling to a fraction of that in foveola rods reach their highest density just outside of fovea there they are nearly as numerous per mm² which directly implies the size of individual receptor as foveal cones but their resolution is only a fraction of the cone resolution due to the neural convergence of signals from individual receptors as opposed to individual processing of the signals from foveal cones to the right resolution in lines per arc minutes as a function of illumination level for the photopic brightlight scotopic lowlight and mesopic transitional eye modes maximum rods resolution is somewhat over 5 arc minutes a fraction of the maximum resolution of the cones as mentioned resolution of rods is inferior due to the input from several rods merging before they reach the eye nerve the purpose is increased sensitivity at a price of lowered resolution cones on the other side send individual inputs to the eye nerve maximizing resolution while partly sacrificing sensitivity with the airy disc for a typical 2mm photopic eye pupil diameter being 16 arc minutes diffraction resolution defined as the fwhm of the psf or 04 of the airy disc diameter is in the 0607 range in laboratory conditions not to be confused with the limit in field conditions which is 1 arc minute at best and usually somewhat more the area of highest cone acuity coincides with the area of their highest density and smallest individual size  foveola area of the highest rode acuity is just outside the macula in the ring roughly centered at the fovea some 10° to 15° in radius highest acuity level doesnt coincide with the highest image quality in terms of contrast level for the naked eye retinal images are of the highest quality at a pupil diameter of 2mm which means in brightlight conditions with the cones dominant when the combined effect of aberrations and diffraction is at its lowest in regard to pointimage resolution it is better at 4mm pupil size in dim light conditions with the cones still sufficiently active diffraction disc is half the size of the disc at 2mm pupil and the aberration level of 015 wave rms still doesnt significantly affect the size of central diffraction disc thus neither resolution of nearequal intensity point sources however for most other detail forms resolution is inferior to that at 2mm pupil size for the telescopic eye there is no point sources since it images through the eyepiece the airy disc formed by the objective hence given aberration level of the objective it is the level of eye aberrations that determines image quality which in general favors smaller eyepiece exit pupil this in turn favors smaller apertures with smaller exit pupil for given nominal magnification however this effect is after a certain level outweighed by the negative effects of higher magnifications132 eye at the teles co pe endat the telescope end eye plays a dual role it is an optical element and a photodetector eye optics preceding retinal photoreceptors determines quality of the image formed at the receptors while size and photosensitivity of the receptors combined with the modes of neural processing of their input determine perceived quality of his image optical part of the eye consisting of the cornea eye lens and aqueous fluid is a simple 2element system expectedly it generates significant aberrations on and offaxis eye offaxis aberrations are generally irrelevant since fixation onto selected object by eye movements brings that object onto the visual axis with its image falling onto fovea image quality in the outer field quickly decreases but it is inconsequential since the field of high acuity is narrow and both increasing size and pooled circuitry of the outer retinal receptors farther from central retina  as opposed to individual circuitry of foveal receptors  actually set acuity limit for the outer field rather than its inherent aberration level onaxis eye aberration on the other hand have disproportionally small effect on perceived image quality that is mainly the consequence of low effective magnification ie small size of the airy disc on retina of the image formed by eye however the magnitude of eye aberrations  in particular defocus and central astigmatism  is commonly large enough to noticeably degrade image quality in daily life luckily telescope users are given two important breaks eye defocus error is effectively corrected by the offsetting error in focusing the eyepiece and effective eye pupil determined by the exit pupil of eyepiece at higher magnifications is small exponentially lowering eye aberration level placed behind telescope eyepiece eye is looking at the image formed by objective that is magnified by the eyepiece the corresponding optical scheme is different than for the eye looking at an object directly  fig 219  figure 219 simplified scheme of retinal image formation through telescope eyepiece with the back focal plane of the objective nearly coinciding with the front focal plane of the eyepiece geometrically light from every point a in the image formed by the objective is transformed into collimated pencil by the eyepiece these pencils converge into the eyepiece exit pupil located at the cornea and are focused by the eye onto the retina a with the iris larger than the exit pupil as is normally the case the effective aperture of the eye equals eyepiece exit pupil and the aperture stop is approximately at the cornea the effective focal length slightly increases due to the angle of convergence being slightly smaller than the corresponding tangents ie marginal ray height ratio nearly as it would with the iris reduced to the size of eyepiece exit pupil simplified imaging geometry illustrates that angular size α of the airy disc subtended at the sky appears magnified by a factor ƒ o e for eye observing its image from distance e without eyepiece  ƒ o being the focal length of objective and by a factor ƒ o  ƒ ep observed through eyepiece of focal length ƒ ep it effectively places focal plane at the distance equal to its focal length from the eye angular size of the airy disc of telescopic eye equals that of its object  the image of airy disc formed by the objective subtended magnified in the eyepiece  given by m α where m ƒ o  ƒ ep is the telescope magnification b that poses a question whether the airy disc subtended in the eyepiece qualifies as a point source for the eye since that requires object not larger than 14 the airy disc diameter the likely answer is no but the consequences if judged by the actual telescope performance are not significant the uncertainty is in determining the portion of central diffraction maxima that effectively represents the object when imagined by an optical system  in this case the eye image of a bright disc angularly equal to the systems airy disc has nearly 90 wider fwhm than that of a pointsource with its ring structure nearly vanished but intensity distribution over the airy disc area is not even it falls rapidly toward its edges to nearzero it is commonly assumed that the effective size of central diffraction maxima is represented by its fwhm which is only about 04 the airy disc diameter an object of this angular size would only slightly enlarge the central maxima and mildly suppress the ring structure  the effect would be hard to notice in field conditions since the image formed by the objective is subjected to its diffraction any point in it is replaced by diffraction pattern formed by the objective for 055μ wavelength angular size of the airy disc formed by the objective is 46d in arc minutes for aperture diameter d in mm the same relation applies to the eye if d is replaced by the effective eye aperture e if eye is looking at the image of the objective directly e is much smaller than d and diffraction disc formed by the objective is always effectively a pointsource for the eye through the eyepiece effective aperture of the eye equals the exit pupil of the eyepiece or e ƒ ep f where f is the telescope focal ratio the corresponding angular airy disc size is 46f ƒ ep this is larger than airy disc of the objective 46d by a factor of ƒ  ƒ ep where ƒ is the telescope focal length since this is the ratio defining telescope magnification the magnified angular diffraction pattern of the objective subtended at infinity in the eyepiece equals angular diffraction pattern of the telescopic eye as illustrated on the fig 219 b bottom this implies that every point of the diffraction pattern imaged by the eye is replaced by eyes own diffraction pattern of identical angular size in practice any single point of the imaged diffraction pattern in the eyepiece is too weak to produce a perceptible central maxima on the retina as is generally the case with extended objects only a cluster of point sources with their diffraction patterns overlapping generates sufficient energy to form a smallest detectable patch of the image the peculiarity of the telescopic eye is that it forms an image of a diffraction image created by objective and magnified by the eyepiece with the angular size of diffraction pattern in this diffraction image equal to that of the telescopic eye the latter forms its retinal image based on the smallest object emitting entities somewhat larger than what strict pointsource definition is the effect on its image is as mentioned nearnegligible◄ 122 eyepiece aberrations
