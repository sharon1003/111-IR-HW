bill gates wealth index most people will have read the recent reports of how microsoft chairman bill gates has had his personal net worth soar over 100 billion dollars and then drop down to 55 billion he certainly knows how to make and lose money note this article was written in 1998 bills fortunes have dropped a touch since then consider that he made this money in the 25 years or so since microsoft was founded in 1975 if you presume that he has worked 14 hours a day on every business day of the year since then that means hes been making money at a staggering million dollars per hour around 300 per second which means that if on his way into the office should he see or drop a 1000 bill on the ground its just not worth his time to bend over and pick it up he would make more just heading off to work were assuming about 4 seconds to bend down and pocket the bill of course he can afford to hire people to follow him and pick up any 1000 bills he may drop not that he would fortunately he doesnt quite think of his wealth or time this way the rumours that when the 50000000 invoice for his new manor on lake washington came in he simply said melinda could you get my wallet i think its in my other pants are not true it is ironic that a lot of that house is going to be underground rooms built with windows wont have any when i first calculated this it was only a 20 bill and then for some time it was a 100 bill when i first wrote this as an article it appeared in upside and harpers and was noted annoyingly without credit in the wall street journal and readers digest it was a 500 bill i remember speaking to him at a conference some years ago thinking 31 per second 31 per second as we talked i didnt mention this when i later came to explain the article was really about numbers and not him it was over 100 per second as he ranted to me about how mean upside is to him its perhaps more disturbing to look at the slope of his appreciation during some periods in 1998 he netted some 45 billion meaning that at the rate hes went if he saw a 10000 bill he would have been just as well to pass it by they do exist but he wont see one until he buys the u s treasury  they are not circulated salmon chase former secretary of the treasury and chief justice is on it if its a pile of cash he has to count its even worse at 3700 per second in 98 they would have to be mythical fivethousanddollar bills  and he would need to have a quick hand  to avoid him losing the money in wasted time while hes counting them counting 1000 bills would be very unprofitable that 45b in 12 months is an astounding rate at which to make money thats higher than the entire gross domestic products of chile and egypt and hes done twice as well as guatemala 4 times better than all of sri lanka or the dominican republic 6 times better than costa rica el salvador or panama 8 times better than everybody in brunei including the sultan and 23 times better than all of bermuda thats right in 1998 bills made much more before taxes than the entire population of kuwait all the emirs oil wells sheiks millionaires and peasants  everybody and forget about companies nobody  even g m exxon ford ibm and intel combined  has earned what bills did in 98 by holding onto that msft stock his profitmonth is more than all the sales of lockheed martin j c penny ups or intel and all but 25 of the largest companies on last years fortune 500 in fact in 1998 his stock has gone up around three times microsofts entire sales  not just profits  for 1996 the toosmallabillforbill index has gone up quite a bit over the years when microsoft went public in 1986 the new multimillionaire only had to leave behind 5 bills heres a chart  click on it of the amount of currency its not been worth mr gates time to pick up off the ground over the years based on his current 800 million or so shares of microsoft he has given away quite a few and the splitadjusted stock price courtesy of microsofts own web site the chart was of course generated with microsoft excel and for those who want to play with it or print it at a better resolution heres the xls spreadsheet file to download bill gates dollars another way to examine this sort of wealth is to compare it to yours consider an average american of modest wealth perhaps she has a net worth of 70000 mr gates worth is 800000 times larger which means that if something costs 100000 to her to bill its as though it costs 12 cents you can work out the right multiplier for your own net worth so for example you might think a new lambourghini diablo would cost 250000 but in bill gates dollars thats 31 cents  that fully loaded multimedia active matrix 233 mhz laptop with the 1024x768 screen youve been drooling after half a penny  a nice home in a rich town like palo alto california two dollars  that nice mansion hes building a more reasonable 63 to him you might spend 50 on tickets food and parking to take your date to see an nhl hockey game bill on the other hand could buy the team for 50 billbills  you might buy a plane ticket on a boeing 747 for 1200 at fullfare coach in billbills mr gates could buy six 747s not tickets the planes themselves two for him two for melinda and two for young jennifer katherine yet more evan marcus a systems engineer from fair lawn new jersey who maintains a bill gates net worth page on his web site notes that bill could buy every single major league team in baseball football basketball and hockey for only about 35 of his net worth  plenty left over to buy a european sport of course then he wouldnt have around 150 for every person in the usa as he does now nor could he still give 670 to every person on the planet marcus suggests that bill could pay michael jordans 1997 salary only 1300 times but that he could buy 902 million subscriptions to tv guide hes also fascinated by how much much all this money would be if put into dollar bills laid end to end the bills would stretch 38 million miles  to the moon and back over 8 times they could paper over all of manhatten 7 times or be stacked 2690 miles high  watch out for satellites they would weigh 40000 tons  100 times the weight of one of those 747s he bought above but one thing marcus says bill cant do is even dent the national debt should he selflessly donate his stock to the u s treasury he would reduce the 537 trillion national debt by well under 1 its nice to put things in perspective hey bill if you just spent 3 minutes reading this article do you realize you could have made 50000 in that time back to work and like i said no hard
