answer 1 human males start making sperm as part of puberty—the changes people go through when they mature all of the cells in a person’s body come from the cell that was formed when their mother’s egg cell joined with their father’s sperm cell after that the cells keep dividing different cells specialize into different jobs it’s pretty amazing that we can go from one cell into trillions of cells of so many different types when males are born they have cells that can become sperm cells but they are not sperm cells yet the cells will not start to mature until the male is about 13 to 16 years old hormones are chemicals that control many things in our bodies reproduction is one of those things hormones tell some cells to divide and then tell some of them to mature a mature sperm cell is very small it has dna a tail that allows it to swim some organelles to power the tail an outer membrane and not much else men produce about 250 million sperm a day as they get older they produce fewer sperm humans today start puberty a few years earlier than they used to some people think this is because we have better nutrition or just eat more others say it is because of chemicals in our environment how do you think scientists might answer this question thanks for asking
