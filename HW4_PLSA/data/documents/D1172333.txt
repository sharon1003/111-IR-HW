where is the hole in this rational function f xx2  2 x − 8x 2 − x − 2 algebra expressions equations and functions domain and range of a function1 answer manisit das share jun 5 2015hole is a common term for removable discontinuities for a rational function f  x which can be expressed as a quotient of two polynomial functions in the form of f  x p  xq  x  the following tutorial discusses the concept in detail finding holes in a rational functionwmv your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available click here to visit our frequently asked questions about html5 video000  352step i  we need to factorize the polynomials in the numerator and denominator given f  x x 2  2 x − 8x 2 − x − 2⇒ f  x x 2  4 x − 2 x − 8x 2  x − 2 x − 2⇒ f  x x  x  4 − 2  x  4x  x  1 − 2  x  1⇒ f  x   x − 2  x  4  x − 2  x  1step 2  we need to identify the common factor with same multiplicity in numerator and denominator elimination of which from both the numerator and denominator makes the function defined for that particular value of x in our present case both numerator and denominator contains the factor  x − 2 with a multiplicity of 1 elimination of which makes the function defined for x − 2  0 ∴ x − 2  0 is a removable discontinuity so the hole of our function is x  2 was this helpful let the contributor knowyes just asked see more how do you graph systems of linear equations in  answer22 minutes ago what is the slope of the tangent line of  answer23 minutes ago how do you determine if the lines through the  answer24 minutes ago how do you solve y  4y − 26y − 21y  3  answer28 minutes ago related questions how do you find the domain of f  x  − 16 x 2  2  what is the domain and range for h  x  − √ x  3  how do you find the domain and range for f  x 11  x 2 what is the domain and range of y   x − 5   how do you find the range of a rational function algebraically y − 4 x − 3x − 2 see more trending questions how does surface area to volume ratio affect the rate of diffusion bio how many isomers are there for propene c 3 h 6  org how do you take the derivative of tan − 1  yx cal how do i find the value of sin 225 tri what is the difference between monocytes neutrophils eosinophils lymphocytes and basophils ana how do you get the complex cube root of 8 pre how can a series of synoptic weather maps be used to predict the future location of a low pressure  ear where are waves found in nature ast what is the angular velocity of the minute hand on a clock phy how come a threedimensional figure with a curved surface is not a polyhedron geo what are three equivalent fractions for 34 pre where was the western front the eastern front how were the fronts similar and different wor what happens when a red giant star becomes a white dwarf ast what is assimilation psy what are two songs with examples of metonymy or paradox in the lyrics eng q and r are independent events if p  q  08 and p  r  02 what is p  q and r  sta what is 45 as an equivalent fraction alg calculate the heat required to raise the temperature of 075 kg of water from 5˚c to 90˚c che what is the tinker how is the tinker awarded how about grade saver soc what are environmental consequences of using fossil fuel env why did soldiers fire into the crowd at the boston massacre u simpact of this question20 views around the world you can reuse this answer creative commons license
