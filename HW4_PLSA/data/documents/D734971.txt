i’m a capitalist for one reason to raise living standards in my community a familiar mantra of capitalism guides me markets are powerful and efficient i’m also a realist so i temper that mantra markets are powerful and efficient and markets fail market failure is an established wellunderstood field of study in mainstream economics generations of economists accept the basics of market failure however american economists turn their heads away at the mention of it because it sounds like heresy consider the four biggest market failures in human history climate change 40 trillion so far health care in america trillions per year ongoing the housingfinancial asset bubble at least 8 trillion free trade 8 trillion so far according to the chief economist for the world bank nicholas stern climate change is the greatest market failure in human history greenhouse gas emissions are a classic externality where everyone on earth subsidizes oil companies and consumers of fossil fuels fossil fuels are underpriced by 40 trillion — a rough estimate of the cost that future generations will pay for damage we’re doing to the earth health care in america wastes roughly 1 trillion per year compared to other wealthy countries and the problem is steadily worsening first health care is not a market a market involves buyers and sellers in american health care we’re not really sure who is a buyer and a seller figure 1 find the buyer and the seller in american health care as a result market incentives are badly misaligned very few patients shop around for deals after the doctor says the word “cancer” most people lose their shopping instincts the housing and financial asset bubble is a classic market failure mortgage brokers misled home buyers into bad mortgages banks bundled unaffordable mortgages into bogus securities and sold them to investors rating agencies provided false security to investors herd mentality and massive groupthink inflated the asset bubble losses in housing values alone exceeded 8 trillion we should add costs for the recession millions of foreclosed homes personal bankruptcies lost opportunities millions of workers unemployed and careers damaged permanently markets rewarded bad behavior and punished millions who behaved responsibly free trade is a market failure but it is also an intellectual failure for the economics profession and a policy failure on the part of elected officials our cumulative trade debt since nafta is well over 8 trillion our economy is deindustrializing with thousands of factories closed millions of jobs lost and no improvement in sight free trade has enjoyed inexplicably unassailable reverence since david ricardo introduced it in 1817 it was unrealistic in 1817 and it is unrealistic today it starts with hopelessly idealized assumptions applied blindly in the complex global economy where trading partners and multinational companies exploit those assumptions for their own purposes we were promised mutual gain but we suffer huge deficits concentration of wealth and power among trade’s “winners” and loss of bargaining power deindustrialization and stagnant wages for the rest of us if the study of free trade were moved from economics departments in universities to mathematics departments it would be discredited on logical grounds by the end of the first day similarly its halflife in a physics astronomy or chemistry department would be a week or two — the time it would take to send graduates students to the lab to collect data it is worth noting that conventional free trade theory is considered largely irrelevant in business schools where students learn the realities of how to move capital and production around the world worse by far our socalled free trade agreements are really designed to protect and enrich global companies these agreements toss aside democratic checks and balances weaken civil society and erode the middle class under the right conditions markets will in fact produce broadbased wellbeing in 1776 adam smith argued that beneficial market control occurred when merchants in the village were personally connected to the wellbeing of their neighbors who lived and shopped in the village social and economic cohesion would prevent market failure but globalization as we’ve managed it decouples modern corporate decisionmakers from any obligation or connection to communities anywhere figure 2 globalization decouples investor interests from public interests the test of a market economy is whether it raises living standards we fail that test when we look at growing inequality and reduced career prospects for the next generations of americans as a society we have stopped sharing the gains from productivity and trade almost all new income goes to the top 1 percent — more than 1 trillion per year some economists object that inequality is beyond the narrow scope of economics so it’s not “really” a market failure granted our looming inequality has broad dimensions — social political and moral as well as economic however when economists duck responsibility for inequality they are really acknowledging that free markets and free trade will predictably create inequality without strong intervention in the form of public policy and social values that sounds like market failure to me here’s the takeaway message the narrow orthodoxy of free markets and free trade says that markets will solve all our problems and government intervention is bad look at politics in america today unfortunately the real world is a very large system with many interacting forces and interests markets fail a legitimate purpose of public policy is to intervene in markets to prevent market failure public policy has a necessary role in protecting the environment human rights labor rights education and public health managing growth regulating markets and managing global trade that’s capitalism for realists
