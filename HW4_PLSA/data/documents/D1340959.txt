over 50mph i always take the junk new tires off and install new michelins so thats what i did still has a chevy shake but no one at the dealers seem to care they blame it on the michelins at first when decelerating the engine would begin tapping exactly like a rocker arm coming loose took it to the dealer and as expected they said it was normal also the shifting rpms were too high causing me to drive around town at 1800rpm but they said that was normal and there was nothing they could do a couple months later i took it to richie cadillacgmc where i bought it i explained the same as i did with the first dealer still no cure now the engine is still tapping but at times when driving normally not just deceleration if ford did not have such an ugly front end this year id trade it off 2 friends already got rid of their duramax gmcs at very low miles due to the same issues ive had with this one maybe ill go to dodge one thing for sure ive owned 5 duramax engines in chevrolet and gmc and this will be my last whenever im asked about this truck and im asked quite a bit due to it being such a beautiful truck my answer is always stay away from gmc and chevy absolutely the poorest service and the biggest slug ive ever had buy a ford view more helpful 4 people found this review helpfulrandy of redwood city ca verified reviewer original review dec 19 2017i own a 2015 gmc yukon denali and have taken this vehicle in several times for a transmission issue that the dealer cannot fix i was told that we did a flash on the computer and within a 1k miles it comes right back with less than 40000 miles on the odometer this has been going on since owning the car transmission feels like it is going over a railroad track at very low speeds gm needs to solve this with a proper fix possibly a new tune to the transmission or a replacement too many complaints and no action from gm my only fix may be is to trade it in and purchase a new suv anything but a gm helpful 15 people found

brought it in and was never fixed next the ac was replaced then radio screen started glitching fixed that by reloading the software next the steering column was replaced then the lift mechanism for the rear hatch was replaced the gps lost its signal they fixed it was told it was corrosion between the antenna and the vehicle body then the transmission the fix was change the fluid 3 times and try it broken again now its not even 2 years old and the rear suspension is fully inflated and wont release the vehicle rides like a 1 ton truck without a load and will not be covered because im over the 36k miles gm said it was the new michelin tire i had it checked by a 3rd party and its the rear shocks the gps antenna failed again an rainwater running through the headliner discovered while evacuating from irma and although it was previously repaired under warranty i was told 525 for the part plus labor filed a complaint with gm and 3 weeks later they said theyd cover the antenna said id have to pay to have the suspension evaluated last gm product for me traded it for a toyota landcruiser view more helpful 13 people found this review helpful how do i know i can trust these reviews

told me to try my extended warranty total care which i purchased thru gmc i contacted total care and they would not cover it they told me to get with my gmc dealership i then contacted a gmc senior advisor she advised me they could not cover because i had a extended warranty she also lied to me and told me they were not aware of anyone complaining of cracked dashboards on gmc vehicles well this is the second one i own i had a sierra which did the same in the same place my sons dash cracked on his gmc yukon denali in the same place as my vehicles and there are thousands of customers on the internet complaining of crack dashboards on gmc vehicles i am thinking about trading it off i read a lot of gmc owners fix their crack dash and it cracks again a year later i would like to warn people about this issue it is also a safety hazard because it is next to the airbag area so please think about this before purchasing a gmc because they want fix it if it cracks and think about the safety of you and a passenger if the airbag would go off view more helpful 15 people found this review helpful alex of cherry grove ab verified reviewer original review oct 20 2017so my story is long but will try keep it on point we purchased a 2015 yukon xl denali we started having transmission issues much like many of the other stories on here after 18 separate visits to the dealer complaints to gm we just traded it in on a 2016 one instead kind of wrote it off to being a lemon and not having the time to be bothered arguing with gm over and over about it so should of been all fine except after about 4000 miles it started again transmission seemed to get stuck in one gear and didnt want to accelerate from a stop back to the dealer again and of course they can never replicate the problem but far worse than this the adaptive cruise started to either not see things or see things that werent there for example the yukon accelerated hard despite the fact there was a dump truck ahead of me i had to slam on the brakes and it was really scary actually so back to the dealer for three days they replaced a module and a sensor i was off on my way again on a road trip with my family while traveling at 70mph on the highway in traffic all of a sudden there was a bright red light in the heads up display and the truck slammed on the brakes hard this cause an accident behind me that i was lucky to avoid so off the freeway to the gm dealer unload my family into a base model minivan for my 1200 mile road trip one week later i am back in town to pick up the yukon they again replaced a bunch of parts and said they had the same thing happen to them during a test drive they said they had test drove it so i went on my way again less than twenty minutes later it did the same thing again accelerated towards a vehicle in front of it while adaptive cruise was set so ok fine no cruise control but within minutes it slammed on the brakes again for no reason and almost caused another accident back to gm again and they didnt want to give me a loaner as they had already fixed it so now i am fairly pissed off as its obviously completely unsafe to drive it but fine i rent myself another vehicle and leave it three days later they claim to be unable to replicate the issue so i phone gm canada and complain long story short after three more visits to service fourteen days of rentals that i had to pay for and many calls to gm the darn thing still was unsafe to drive in my opinion as it would still slam on the brakes for no reason on the highway oh yeah the transmission was still acting up but the safety issues had me forget about that minor issue i did manage to resolve it all through in about one hour of my time i drove to the lexus dealer and took home a brand new lexus gx problem solved and amazingly i have never needed anything other than an oil change since just to note i had previously purchased a brand new yukon xl every other year faithfully from gm and never had any major issues with any of them its very frustrating to have a major issue with a vehicle and have the manufacturer basically refuse to deal with it view more helpful 19 people found this review helpful brittany of carpinteria ca verified reviewer original review aug 2 2017ok after looking for a suv for a year we decide to get a yukon denali we finally found one that suited our needs at a dealership 40 mins away from where we live and bought a used low mileage denali yukon bought it late one night drove fine in test drive and everything seemed ok there was a minor scape and we brought it up at time of sale to ask for it to be fix or take the price down our request was completely ignored and we were give some made up excuse about it still being a new car strike 1 we get home and realize the next day theres a chip in the windshield strike 2 in the heat of a june summer in so cal we quickly learn the ac does not work strike 3 we then learn the back rear window makes a loud whining noise thats pretty obvious something is wrong so we call the dealership they keep the car over night after keeping me there for 5 hours couldnt fix the ac problem at the time and we need to bring it back in when they get the replacement part ok 2nd time in we get the ac replacement part and the ac works for one day they want me to bring the car back in a fourth time for me to drive the 40 mins to the dealership i asked for them to pick up the car because i cant take off work for them to replace it yet again takes the dealership some back and forth run around finally they agree to pick up my yukon like it was such an inconvenience for them in the mean time while all this back and forth with the ac is going on im trying to also contact the sales manager at oxnard gmc to talk about how this car was clearly not ready for resale after multiple attempts we never got a call back from the sales manager ok big red flag in the meantime while flip flopping from service to phantom sales im keeping in contact with corporate gmc on this case corporate was helpful but not that helpful apparently no one from sales would call them back either so now we are with out the car we bought cuz its in the shop and they finally agreed to a loaner not a rental thank you but for a purchase of this amount we are extremely disappointed and inconvenienced never underestimate the amount you pay for a car because this was a lot of money i got ripped off by oxnard gmc and taken for a long run around by gmc we are now filing for a lemon and i hope this gets resolved if it does i will update this review but as of right now ive wasted time and money time in which i cannot get back were pissed and work hard for a living and this is been handle like we bought a 100 dollar used bicycle oh and we learned that the ac is an issue out of 30000 other people with ac issue for gmc why did you sell us a car when you clearly knew the ac was dysfunctional view more helpful 24 people found this

buick gmc of bakersfield ca my purchase price 8965817 with 34 miles on the vehicle a very short time after bringing the car home we begin to notice that when coming to a rolling stop the truck would start to jerking then when at a complete stop it would hesitate to drive going over speed bumps it sounds as if the shocks are worn out so by this time we have about 5k miles on this vehicle i call in to my local dealership they check it out and said they cant duplicate the problem so i bring it back home the vehicle is still doing it my rear tv shorts out my kids were not happy i take it back in they replaced it along with the few recalls it had i pick it up and a short time later the rear ac gives out so now we are in triple digits and no ac my kids are cooking in the 3rd row took it in and they couldnt duplicate the issue so i took it back home and come to find when it sits in the heat the ac shuts down so it finally blows out completely back to the dealership it goes they fix that problem and 2 weeks later the rear ac blows out again took it back in they replace a fuse box orders of gm and that also didnt work so here we are no ac and we take our vehicle on a family vacation with 5 children in my back seats and as we are driving up the mountain the door locks start to malfunction and our console along with it my kids are freaking out im trying to stay calm as i look to my husband for reassurance that our vehicle is not going to fall over the cliff when we got to a safe pull out section we did he put it in park the car wouldnt let me out so to the door locks kept malfunctioning i have made a case with gm motors and they have done nothing they have given me the run around dont get me wrong the vehicle on the outside is beautiful the inside is lovely but the reliability of the vehicle and the safety of our family is not worth it please please dont buy gm my car is sitting at the dealership as of right now only has 15000 miles on the vehicle and they just cant figure it out i asked for a rental car through gm they said they cant so here i am making a 105131 payment for a car that i cant even drive and still have to pay out of my pocket for a rental car i owned a 2008 jeep commander before this problem and chrysler would put me in a rental just for a recall part come on gm shame on you i bought my 2016 gmc yukon denali in good faith and this is what gm does not only to me but everyone here who has purchased from your company very disappointed i will never own another gm vehicle again view more helpful 47 people found this review helpful vicki of

this year a battery cable malfunction left me without this very costly car for another 4 weeks because parts were not available first why is a relatively new car having these types of parts failure

when my brotherinlaw passed last year he purchased it new and took exceptional care of it two days ago the check engine light came on along with two additional warnings service traction control  service stabilitrak after having it towed to the dealer im told that there is a collapsed lifter in cylinder seven when asked how that happens with an engine with low miles and has been well maintained the answer i received sounded very much like the engine failed because the truck wasnt driven enough that doesnt make much sense when modern cars are being driven up to and over 200k miles i believe this is due to a defect in materials or workmanship not from lack of driving the dealer quotes 4k to rebuild the engine gmc needs to take responsibility and correct this issue this is the engine that automatically selects the number of cylinders to use during operation helpful 23 people found this review helpful customer increased rating by 3 starsmark of mountain brook al verified reviewer resolution response may 26 2017after some discussion we have reached an agreement with gm they have offered to replace the vehicle and we have agreed to pay an amount to upgrade the year we are satisfied with this result my advice to gm is to talk directly to the customer earlier in the process as communicating through the dealer can be irritating not due to anything about the dealership but simply because communicating via a third person is a pain customers are usually happier when they get to speak directly with the person making the decision because gm correctly resolved the issue ive updated the rating which would have been a 5 but gets reduced to a 4 because of the effort it took to get this resolved original review may 6 2017purchased a 2016 gmc yukon denali fully loaded in november 2016 immediately started having electronic issues and system failures after multiple attempts had to resort to sending gmc the alabama lemon law certified letter they made their final repair attempt and said they couldnt fix the vehicle so under alabama law we get to choose between them buying the vehicle back or replacing the vehicle we decided to replace the vehicle and were willing to pay any difference in sticker price between the two vehicles gmc now says theyll not comply with the lemon law but theyll replace the vehicle in good faith to gmc good faith means well stick it to you because were a big corporation and we can they offered to let us pay only 2200 to replace the vehicle i was told they were not doing the lemon law thing and that i could go that route if i wanted clearly meaning they would make me sue them in order to force them to comply with the law apparently gmc thinks its above the law im sure gmc figures most consumers will cave in and pay the 2k rather than file a lawsuit however im a license attorney in alabama so that wont be happening in my case its just really sad that gmc has decided to treat its customers with such disdain i imagine there are numerous other gmc customers whove gotten a similar lemon of a vehicle only to be shafted by gmc as a jester of their good faith view more helpful 37 people found this review helpful brittney of greenup il verified reviewer original review may 1 2017i bought a 2016 yukon denali brand new off the lot from diepholz in paris illinois out of all the dealerships closer to me this is where i found the best price on the exact vehicle i wanted my job consists of me traveling depending on what project i am overseeing for marathon petroleum my dad is a used car dealer and swears by gm vehicles its all i have ever drove starting with my first vehicle i have owned 97 pontiac firebird 07 pontiac g6 gtp 07 cadillac cts 06 pontiac torrent as you can see i have driven the very low end of vehicles except for the cadillac cts which i have nothing good to say about it either at 110000 miles the timing chain bridge completely broke and center carrier bearing went out requiring the whole driveshaft to be replaced which wasnt under warranty other than that i havent had one single problem with any of my cheap used vehicles by gm so on my very first brand new vehicle from a dealership i am very very dissatisfied with my purchase just a month after taking it off the lot it started rattling in the exhaust being optimistic and not wanting to be a complainer i thought i would see if it would go away well it did not so while on a business trip to memphis tennessee i was due for an oil change and so i found closest dealership hatcher chevrolet buick gmc in brownsville tennessee and scheduled an oil change and asked them to look into the noise they informed me there was a problem occurring in gms exhausts and said they would replace the whole exhaust after waiting at the dealership for four hours it was fixed and i headed back up to illinois well on the three hundred and some mile at interstate it started making the noise again i was not happy but again i work and didnt have time to take off again for the issue after driving it for a few more months the noise has literally been driving me insane so thinking maybe since i am a female my husband will have better luck he took it into jk mitchell in casey illinois my hometown on his day off and had them drive it well they said they could not hear anything i have multiple people in my vehicle very often due to work and they can hear it and supposedly this person could not so i took it to my dad who has been a mechanic and used car dealer for forty years who is also 65 years old and half deaf and he could hear it but since he isnt certified and its under warranty he will not touch it and says i just need to keep taking it in until its fixed then i hit a deer and had to have my front bumper replaced and when they were driving and checking out my car at a certified body shop they noticed the sound and asked if it was there before the deer i said yes and since it wasnt due to the deer they did look into it but said i should have it looked at now i am on my third dealership and going to have them take a look at it tomorrow if they dont find the issue or fix it im literally to the point i dont care if i take a loss i do not want to drive a 70000 vehicle that sounds like a pile of junk im going to get rid of the damn thing and go buy a ford when i spend that much money on a vehicle i expect a certain quality and i am not getting it i have driven the low end of the low and have driven the high end maserati audi mercedes and due to my fathers suggestion of sticking with gm and not going for the foreign luxury cars that gms are better and easier to maintenance and more affordable maintenance and has owned multiple for the past forty years i bought the yukon denali i love the interior except for the fact the coco shale leather absorbs the dye from jeans so i guess dont wear blue jeans in the vehicle cause my seats are already blue i was told to put seat covers on which is absolutely ridiculous to have to spend more money on seat covers to cover leather that i already paid more money for it has the nice luxurious feel when just sitting in it but once i start driving i feel like i am in my 2006 pontiac torrent that cost me 5000overall the only reason i am still driving this thing is because i love the look the inside design and i spent a boat load of money on it if i had bought this used and had these problems and it wasnt under warranty it would be gone and i would no longer be a gm supporter i am absolutely infuriated with this vehicle like i said i spent a lot of money on it expecting the quality and luxury of having a new vehicle and honestly i have had more trouble with it than any used vehicle i have owned other than the cadillac cts which was also a big disappointment and why i didnt buy another cadillac now i am literally to the point i wont buy another gm view more helpful 18 people found this review helpful dusty of jeddo mioriginal review april 12 2017i have recently

stopped at a stop sign i went to take off to cross the intersection the vehicle made it about a quarter of the way out into the intersection when it decided to stop i remember some noise but cant exactly describe the initial noise i just remember one specific noise that came after i immediately tried to put it in park and restart the vehicle thinking it just stalled out after restarting it i then tried shifting from park to drive again and this was the noise i remember an extremely loud and awful spinning and or grinding noise sounded like broken spinning gears or something anyways it would sit running without this noise but as soon as you shifted into any gear other than park it would make the awful noise it would not go anywhere either had it towed to a repair shop mechanic says the transmission went in it and is rebuilding the transmission charging 2100 for a transmission rebuild all of the electrical issues still exsist needing help and trying to figure out these weird

53000 dollar truck from carl black in roswell ga after a few weeks i started noticing some strange electronic glitches in shifting 4 wheel drive transfer case and steering loosening communication with ecm this would be displayed by the truck on the diagnostic screen just for a second you can only see it if you happen to look down right when the truck loses control of the steering the first time i towed the truck in for this gm dealer reset the truck and all started working again except engine light was on the guy said they were closing had no rental trucks and to come back so i did and they said the truck had no codes and basically said i was lying after a few days while pulling out in traffic the truck acted like i was pulling a huge taylor barely going from a stop but then as you go faster would get better found out it was getting stuck it 5 gear so after 8 rental cars 5 towings this stuff happening all the time very long story over 30 days in the shop i finally called the consumer protection agency now called something else turns out the lady who arbitrated the case did not know a thing about vehicles and was convened by their slick lawyers and auto experts they sent from new york to smash me that trucks did not have to have power steering since some dont come with it every one knows if it comes with power steering it wont steer without it she was in on the scam you have to see to believe what she actually wrote on the judgment mailed to me she said loss of steering does not constitute a breach of warranty and does not lower the value safety or use of the vehicle wow how could anyone say write or read that with a straight face so now contacted a lemon lawyer he said he worked for gm for 30 years now works for the consumer sounded great but if you think like i do now not so great if he worked for them 30 years then they are all friends and that is now what i know to be the case this lawyer dragged this out another 2 years while the truck sits in my driveway 700 dollars a month and my wife and kids and all my neighbors and friends talk about this all the time when is gm going to fix the piece of crap will this lawyer turns out when i freak out and want this scheduled for court he tries to talk me into settling for 10000 pay off and keeps trying to get me to just sell it he was all on my side until i found out he is just stalling just like gm they all make money working on this why would they want to pay me back my 53000 when that is their job they only make money if they are working on cases and they drag them out till you give up my lemon lawyer online must benefit from talking me into taking a small payoff and keeping the truck he tells me they wont ever pay me and if i go to court i will lose and have to pay their attorneys fees around 60000 today he said to take 5000 and sell the truck to carmax i said the person who buys it could die or hit him head on and he laughed and said who cares that i would not know them that it did not matter and i should not care what happens because i would not be liable this is the biggest crap i cant find anyone to help i tried calling fox 5 and clark howard no return calls i just dont see how this can happen we have lemon laws and rights how can a company sell you a huge product that is dangerous for you and everyone around you and not have to at least give your money back they have tried and tried to fix it there is so much more that happened the more i write the more i remember this to the cliff notes and im not fixing my spelling they will probably try to sue me for

model that i own further i was contacted by our dealership and they told me that now our vehicle is not under warranty so we will need to pay approximately 8300 for each piece of trim to be fixed from here on out ill be purchasing some gorilla glue issue 2 vehicle will not engage into gear at start up as you push on the gas the vehicle does not move and then lurches into motion i almost ran over a family friend as i was pulling out of our garage i brought the vehicle to our local dealership several times for this issue the vehicle replicated the issue while they drove it they told me that they cant figure it out they dont know what is wrong with it because its not giving them a code and there is not any bulletins from gmc on this issue 3 vehicle lurches forward while driving around 70 miles per hour this has happened so many times while we are driving the vehicle that its a habit to brace for it if we are driving on ice or snow this has been discussed with the dealership i have told them that this vehicle is going to kill us or someone else if they dont fix the problem they say that they dont know what is wrong with it no codes and no bulletins issue 4 the vehicle has had around 4 recalls and i was just notified that there is another one for the airbag advice do not purchase this year make and model a 7500000 vehicle should never be this much of a hassle or concern i would also like to add that we have several friends that drive the same exact vehicle as ours and the problems with this suv are not a secret view more helpful 27 people found this review helpful scott of tomball tx verified reviewer original review aug 29 2016the car turns off twice as i was slowing at a stop sign on my street i know this is hard to recreate but nevertheless it shouldn’t happen and the dealer dont know why the low rev sputtering is getting worse especially in slow speed traffic on one occasion while pulling out to overtake it took about 23 seconds to finally get power this is embarrassing taking people out for lunch… in a 70k car people cannot believe the technician  gm said nothing was wrong at most speeds but certainly above 50 mph there is a 12 seconds of shuddervibration that rolls through the cabin this is getting worse sometimes as often as every 1530 seconds while driving feels like a loose wheel or something in the drive train slamming into gear is very annoying garage door opener only works when you are 5 feet from it facing towards it sometime i need to pull the car slightly into the garage to start it then reverse quickly out before the door hits me helpful 19 people found this review helpful mrs of lake elsinore ca verified reviewer verified buyer original review aug 20 2016my husband and i purchased a 2016 yukon xl denali at the

this review helpfulbud of richmond va verified reviewer original review july 21 2016there should be a class action suit filed against gmc for selling the faulty and fraudulent automobile called the 2015 gmc yukon xl denali from day 1 there have been issues car would shift into four wheel drive automatically bumpy ride car movement after placed from drive to park engine acceleration between gear shifting engine rebuilt after breakdown on highway fuel pump ticking after truck runs metal exhaust flap squeaks on 4 to 8 valve shifting and now all shocks and struts need to be replaced as the ride has gotten worst the issue is that gmc is using a different product than originally installed apparently the original shocks and struts are faulty however gmc wants me to pay for the replacement since i am over the 35000 mile limit  even though gmc was well aware of the ride issue documented by two gmc engineers that rode in the car and confirmed issues with the ride  stating that gmc was working on a computer fix which should be completed within the year i have been on the phone with gmc for the past month and have just gotten the runaround 8667905700 my main contact has been sharena senior advisor who has been unresponsive i finally spoke to her after numerous emails and phone calls she refused to give me her supervisors name and transferred me to another senior advisors voice mail her response has been that the dealer is independent and gmc could not do anything for me and i would just have to accept the car the way it runs if i did not want to fix it there are major issues with this vehicle and it looks like gmc will not stand behind their product i will have to trade this car in before other major issues arise i dread the reduced value when all the repairs are listed on a carfax report view more helpful 27 people found this review helpful robert of richmond va verified reviewer original review july 12 20161400 miles and the center console infotainment system goes blank take it in to the dealership its a week later an entire week later 9 days after i dropped it off they call and tell me they dont know when theyll get it fixed because the part to fix it has been indefinitely backordered they have other vehicles just like it on the lot that are working for now you would think that gmc with already have this issue well and your hand for their flagship suv extremely disappointed helpful 18 people found this review helpful customer increased rating by 2 starsjay of sparrowbush ny verified reviewer resolution response june 23 2016i found out what happened there was nothing wrong with the vehicle sadly it was my floor mat that got stuck to the pedal original review june 20 2016i recently just purchased a 2012 yukon denali and was very pleased with it until something horrifying happened while driving with my 2 young children just 2 days ago i was driving and out of nowhere the car started driving on its own and not in cruise control either i was driving at 30 mph it sped up speeding up to 50 or 60 mph on its own i tried pressing the brakes and the truck would stop but as i released the brakes it kept speeding like it wanted to race i almost hit several cars  luckily i didnt thank god i was finally able to get the car to stop i pulled over put it in neutral shut the car off then put it in park i gave it a few minutes then restarted it back up and it drove normal but now it makes me nervous to drive it gonna take it back to the dealer and see why it did that helpful 10 people found this review helpful marcie d of williston fl verified reviewer verified buyer original review april 30 2016my truck was purchased new and has approx 32000 miles on it it is kept in a heatedair conditioned garage and maintenance is kept up to date i had 2 door locks replaced under warranty and now the front passenger lock is broken i cant reach it and i took it to the dealer who wanted 45000 to replace it i also have pictures of a burn on my back that happened one day when the heated seat would not shut off and i could not get to a safe place to get out of the car gm wants me to pay half of the cost of the heated seat it doesnt seem to matter to them that it took over 4 months for the burn to heal because it was on my back now i am reading about your transmission problems and i was at the grocery store one day and i put my truck into reverse having the backup camera has created the habit that even though i use my mirrors and check blind spots i wait for that camera to click on i let my foot off of the brake a bit and the truck went forward fortunately there was a pole in front of the truck because there was a lady with her little girl right between my truck and the building even though i barely tapped the pole it put a nice dent in the cheap plastic bumper once i finally got the truck to go in reverse i left the parking lot and turned on my left turn indicator and the windshield wipers came on i realize that this could happen since all of those controls are on the same arm but i checked it and i could not turn the wipers off or signal i drove a 1997 suburban for 10 years and the dealership replaced at least 7 automatic door lock mechanisms under warranty there were always electrical issue but i would have thought gm might have found a new supplier for the door locks and figured out the electrical problems be on the safe side and never shut your doors with the keys inside you can set up an account with gm online and then they have to at least answer your questions however they seem to want to make it a career choice for you to try to take care of these issues does anyone know if you can replace or at least cover these cheap plastic bumpers with the old style they say it gives better mileage due to less wind resistance yes we are supposed to fall for that one but i get the same mileage as i got with my 1997 suburban that had real bumpers and was heavier because it had 4 wheel drive view more
