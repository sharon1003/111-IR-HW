an intuitive study of rabbit tobacco gnaphalium obtusifolium l sweet everlasting cudweed old field balsam sweet white balsamindian posy life of man poverty weed fussy gussy matthew wood ms herbal medicineregistered herbalist ahgabstract the isolated biologically active molecule is the basis for the definition of the properties of a drug in biomedicine the association of a particular molecular structure with an identifiable function in the body is the basis of the ‘structurefunction’ claim which a drug is entitled to bear by comparison in herbalism the whole plant is used thus the medicinal properties of the plant need to be defined in terms of the action of the whole this requires different methods of analysis and different standards of definition these have not yet been settled upon by herbalists for instance do we define the medicinal properties of the plant by its major medicinal constituents or as a whole entity containing those constituent parts this touches upon the issue of reductionism versus holism herbalists as individuals and as a community can make the choice whether they want to define medicinal plants according to the reductionist approach of biomedicine the holistic approach of natural medicine or both the following paper represents a study of a medicinal plant according to the holistic approach so that the emphasis is placed upon understanding the plant as a whole entity containing constituents rather than as a group of constituent parts an intuitive method is used since the intuition comprehends patterns that unite separate phenomena into a whole the results of intuitive research are checked against historical usage pharmacology and clinical experience the paper therefore suggests methods and definitions through which the understanding of the whole plant as a medicinal agent can be developed in addition it provides a demonstration of how an herbalist the author enlarged his understanding of the medicinal properties of an herb rabbit tobacco gnaphalium obtusifolium l from reputation only to active use introduction the usual approach in science is reductionistic ie the whole is reduced to its parts the part can isolated quantified and its action tested thus biomedicine would study the active ingredients in order to understand the action of the whole plant in holistic medicine on the other hand the greatest value is placed on understanding and treating the whole organism likewise it is supposed that the whole medicinal substance say the plant is superior to the fragmented parts the constitute the whole plant methods of study1 the whole plant can be treated like a ‘personality’ in order to understand the whole plant rather than the isolated ingredient we first of all need to be able to visualize that the separate constituents of the plant are united together into a whole and that this whole can have attributes in other words the plant is not just a slurry of different chemicals but possesses an inherent wholeness that unites these diverse ingredients into a single operative entity we are not used to thinking of plants like this we do not think of them as being individual entities with specific traits this makes it sound too much like the plant has or is a ‘personality’ this however is exactly what we need to learn the plant is not a bundle of separate chemicals but is an intelligent being the directs all of these constituents in an integrated selfmaintaining selfhealing fashion the separate parts are bound together by an entitylike core and this as director of the parts has characteristic habits and expressions just like a personality now we are really speaking of the plant species as an untity rather than the individual plant because each individual reacts much the same as other members of the same the species all have the same genetic programming thus the ‘personality’ that the species has is not so much like the personality of a separate human or dog for instance but the personality of the entire species we really have to posit the existence of ‘personality’ in all lifeforms because they unite separate components into a whole entity that reacts to external stimulation in a characteristic fashion a bunch of chemicals by themselves could not navigate the many threats posed by evolution and natural selection rather it is the intelligence of the specific life form that reacts to environmental stress this underlying personality in turn reflects the medicinal properties of the whole plant because it contains them and uses them altogether in concert for its own survival2 studying personality via the intuition in order to understand a plant in such a way it is necessary to draw upon a wide range of resources than the material alone we might think of how we do this in regard to analyzing humans some are more hidden and some are more readily displayed some like george washington adolf hitler or leonardo da vinci remain to some extent hidden unknown and inexplicable while others like abraham lincoln vincent van gogh or winston churchill seem almost to have poured themselves out to the last drop and left very little in hiding it is through their actions and appearance that we understand such people not their chemistry and it is the same with the medicinal powers of plants in using them we gain experience and insight additional information is supplied by their taste smell touch and appearance the natural history stages of growth and environmental niche supply additional knowledge chemical constituents contribute to our understanding but they are not the basis for a wellrounded knowledge of either the medicinal properties or the personality of the plant undoubtedly we run a risk of anthropomorphizing our sense of plant identity just as we tend to project our own characteristics on the people we study our knowledge is imperfect – this must be freely admitted – but how much less perfect is it when the plant is merely viewed as a bunch of chemicals independent of any guiding intelligence overall purpose or – for lack of a better word – personality if the scientist ignores the personality because it is too subjective or does not leave material traces then scientific knowledge is true within its own sphere but incomplete from another perspective3 plant properties and morphology among the old methods used to discern the essential nature of the plant is the doctrine of signatures this is widely dismissed as child’s play in conventional science but i find the doctrine to be particularly helpful the signatum if rightly understood reflects the innate energy pattern or personality of the plant very closely as rudolf steiner explains the signature represents a bunching up of energy in resistance to external environmental stresses which in a human being would cause a disease but which in a plant causes adaptation resulting in a “distortion” or change of structure wilhelm pelikan 1997 12 the signature thus represents the stress the plant has survived and also its healing property many regret the doctrine of signatures as an archaic survival of “magical thinking” as a matter of fact we need to cultivate the poetic faculty or imagination to oftentimes see the signature and this is basis for true magical thought we might just as well criticize such people for their “materialistic thought” but such arguments are circular closely related to the doctrine of signatures are the physical properties of the plant such as we find through our senses the taste closely corresponds to the medicinal properties of the plant a method used in traditional chinese ayurvedic and western herbalism for millennia these in turn often reflect the medicinal constituents located in the laboratory for instance flavonoids are usually associated with fruit acids and thus with the sour taste a taste which we like in hot weather for its cooling capacities lemonade fruit etc as we analyze the properties and constituents of the plant we naturally find a need to express these properties in general terms this gives rise to the doctrine of energetics thus plants are divided into two categories hot and cold suited to the treatment of cold stagnant depressed conditions and hot overexcited irritated ones respectively further categories include damp and dry dampness may be further subdivide into damp flowing which responds to astringents and damp stagnation which responds to alteratives in the east another category wind represents spasm and tension energetic categories vary from culture to culture but generally we have from two to six another important area of insight comes to us through examination of the morphology and botanical kinship of a plant study of the morphology shape is closely related to the doctrine of signatures in some ways but also more closely related to scientific interests this method comes down to us through the work of j w goethe rudolf steiner joakim bockemuhl and margaret colquhoun by understanding the shape of a plant through its different periods of growth and in its different structures as well as by relationship with its close kin we can grasp its energy personality or essence the study of the relationship of a plant to its kin is also important because there may be a relationship between the medicinal constituents and properties in the plant and its close relatives when there is not – when close relatives have highly different properties – this also is interesting3 empirical knowledge finally we come to the scientific study of plant chemistry we often find plant constituents listed in textbooks in a disorganized framework in the plant of course they form a functional unit each compound undertaking work necessary for plant survival if we truly understand the energetics taste morphology and signatures of a plant we will begin to understand how these multiple constituents fall together into a meaningful whole both for the plant and for the person who receives it as a medicine our learning does not stop here with the plant itself but also includes the action of the plant on the human being often indeed it is not easy for us to understand the properties of a plant until it is “translated” into the human realm this means that we interact with the plant in our mind emotions and body the plant has an effect on all levels probably the most profound learning possible comes from actual communication with the plant as an equal – it can tell us for what it is medicinal we can also take the plant to produce physiological symptoms as is done in a homeopathic proving finally however it is in the actual use of the plant in a clinical setting that our knowledge become galvanized as we see the plant work in more and more cases we understand more deeply and multifacetedly its personality and properties conventional evidencebased medicine disapproves of the use of case histories for learning about the action of drugs or herbs but it is here that the story line is richest and we have the most to learn again however there is an argument between those who value the primal constituents of human nature – intuition imagination and instinct – and those who consider them unreliable the argument is circular but for myself i choose to know the story of creation in its large and small parts to illustrate these different methods of learning i have chosen a plant called sweet everlasting or rabbit tobacco in the united states i chose this for two reasons first because i came across a case history that indicated its use in a very hard to treat condition congenital asthma and second because i knew it had an association with the spirit world in american indian medicine tobacco is used for communication with spirits very late in my study the relationship between these two facts became clear at least in my mind and that led me to feel that i did in fact have a well founded understanding of this plant i rabbit tobacco the everlastings are a group of plants known for the survival of their flowers in a dried preserved state after the end of the growing season the name is now applied generally to any plant which tends to be preserved in this way but the original everlastings belonged to four closely related genii in the asteraceae family gnaphalium anaphalis antennaria and helichrysum dioscorides used the greek word gnaphalon “a lock of wool” to describe a member of this group or probably several related species the term gnaphalium was subsequently adopted to describe the various everlastings by the present time most everlastings including members of all four genera have been known by this name at some time in their history changes in botanical nomenclature have separated them into four groups but their kinship is apparent in appearance popular names and medicinal uses if we look through the records of diverse times cultures and continents we find general agreement in the use of the everlastings except for one unusual member  gnaphalium arenarium  in short this wide group of plants needs to be studied as a whole to provide a context for the discussion of even one of its members one of the most outstanding of the everlastings is gnaphalium obtusifolium l or sweet everlasting not only is it an everlasting but it has a beautiful scent and most remarkable of all this smell is spontaneously emitted from time to time months and years after it was dried due to changes in the moisture of the air or barometric pressure standing out in a field of sweet everlasting when the first drops of rain fall is quite an experience ‘what’s that smell’ unlike the european everlastings which were not widely used in folk and professional medicine sweet everlasting is an important plant in the medicine of the indian people of eastern north america sweet everlasting is a prominent inhabitant of old sandy fields and meadows in eastern north america it was well known to the indian people and still carries the name rabbit tobacco as testimony to their idea of its place in the universe it is said that rabbit while untangling himself from a thicket first discovered the properties of this plant as a cure for cuts it was widely used by the indian people – as well as euroamericans – for this purpose another story explains that rabbit uses sweet everlasting as a tobacco to communicate with creator just as humans have their own kinds of tobacco it was – and still is – used in tobacco smoking mixes by some indian people yet because of certain properties it is avoided in smoking mixtures by others upon the discovery of the north american continent by explorers from europe various everlastings were recognized as cousins of the old world everlastings specimens were first identified as gnaphalium americanum but due to a glitch in communication it was not clear where in the western hemisphere they originated the boat on which they arrived had been in both north and south america however g americanum became the technical name most commonly used by early writers on the american everlastings such as john gerard 1597 of london john clayton 1687 of virginia and william salmon 1710 of south carolina and london in 1756 linneus gave this particular species the name g obtusifolium referring to the appearance of the blunt lower leaves and this is the appellation under which it is known in botany today michaux attempted to make an end run around linneus calling it g polycephalum in 1806 it appears under both names in nineteenth century medical literature but today the linnean denomination is considered correct the english settlers recognized this new plant as a relative of their own cudweed cottonweed or everlasting but because of its beautiful smell it was known in distinction to the others as sweet everlasting throughout its american range it is often associated with a cousin from which it needs to be distinguished pearly everlasting anaphalis margaritacea l this plant has pearly white unscented flowers and overlaps in range it tends to grow further to the north and west from its habitat in poor sandy and exhausted soils rabbit tobacco also came to be known as ‘old field balsam’ and ‘poverty weed’ collected in bouquets as an everlasting gave rise to the name ‘indian posy’ the most poetic name is ‘fussy gussy’ while the most mysterious is perhaps ‘life of man’ the most spooky is ‘owl’s crown’ since the owl is considered to be a messenger bringing tidings of death in american indian medicine it is also the chief predator of the rabbit the following common names are collected by timothy coffey in the history and folklore of north american wildflowers 1993 260 balsam n y  balsamweed chafeweed featherweed n y  filed balsam fragrant

cudweed and cottonweed salmon 1710 were completely unknown in the new world many settlers apparently saw this plant for the first time on the sandy coastal shores of eastern north america the striking appearance stimulated their imagination to provide new names however coffey tracked the name ‘chafeweed’ to william turner 1551 and ‘goldenmotherwort’ to john gerard’s 1635 ‘golden mothwort’ coffey explains that the soft leaves of the british species were used to prevent chafing and “mixed with fat were given to cattle that had lost their cud” gerard explains that mothwort or mothweed repels moths coffey traces the name ‘feather weed ‘to the practice of the poor in new york who stuffed their mattresses with the plant when they couldn’t get goose down at the time when the english settlers first arrived in north america the european everlastings were widely appreciated by housewives in britain for their decorative potential gerard 1635 642 but they were hardly used in medicine “i have seen it used only in one place” testified nicholas culpeper 1652 45 however as will be noted below cudweed is still in use in english folk medicine today in north america the use of sweet everlasting as an indoor bouquet or posy was a well established folk custom among early angloamerican housewives peter kalm 1751 70 notes that “english ladies” as opposed to german dutch or swedishamerican housewives liked to pick the plant – stalk leaf and flower – and put the bouquet in the house about the windows or chimney i carry on this practice myself the occasional release of the beautiful scent at unexpected moments when there is some kind of atmospheric change makes it a special ingredient in the home rabbit tobacco was also used in the home by american indians though here it was used not just for its smell but for protection against ghosts and witchcraft see smith and merring below the popularity which rabbit tobacco achieved among the angloamerican settlers as a medicine was probably due to indian influence rather than european culpeper 1652 testifies that it was little used in england the bestowal of new names also shows that europe was probably not the origin of medical knowledge of this plant by the time constantine rafinesque wrote in 1830 rabbit tobacco was well established as an american folk remedy for cuts colds asthma diarrhea and pain it was used by lay healers and professional doctors however gnaphalium never entered deeply into the medical tradition and today would be considered an obscure and seldom used medicinal agent by herbalists following the literary as opposed to the folk tradition it remains something of a folk remedy in the american south and is sometimes used by eastern europeans searching for gnaphalium uliginosum during the height of its popularity in the nineteenth century gnaphalium obtusifolium was given a homeopathic proving ie it was given in repeated doses until it produced symptoms these revolved mostly around muscular and skeletal issues especially sciatica some of these symptoms were confirmed in practice but due to its narrow scope gnaphalium remained a remedy of little consequence in nineteenth century homeopathy and has largely passed into oblivion in contemporary homeopathy the fact that the traditional folk medical uses of the plant were not brought out in the provings may be significant a good sense for the plant was not developed in the homeopathic provings or clinical experience in the twentieth century the use of rabbit tobacco in herbal medicine and homeopathy declined significantly to the point where it must be considered mostly a local southern folk remedy of sporadic application i first learned about its efficacy in congenital asthma from a woman in virginia however sweet everlasting is still available in western herbal commerce and it is still well known among american indian people ii botany history and traditional uses botany the gnaphaliums are native throughout the world in north america there are about 10 representatives plus a close cousin anaphalis margaritacea pearly everlasting another genus closely related to gnaphalium found in both the new and old world is antennaria in europe there are also about a dozen gnaphaliums as well as a few antennarias then there is a fourth genus helichrysum only found in the old world table 1 geographical distribution americas both eurasia     anaphalis gnaphalium antennaria helichrysum gnaphalium obtusifolium is the most common representative of the everlasting clan in eastern north america and the most easily recognized with its distinct pleasant smell it ranges from the canadian maritimes quebec and ontario south to florida west to texas and wisconsin it prefers poor sandy soil hence the name ‘old field balsam’ or ‘poverty weed’ equally as common anaphalis margaritacea ranges further north and west and not as far south north american indian medicine rabbit tobacco is widely used among the southern indians the name is undeniably of american indian origin it is usually applied to gnaphalium obtusifolium but sometimes to anaphalis margaritacea j t garret 2003 91 236 an eastern cherokeeuses the name rabbit tobacco for gnaphalium obtusifolium anaphalis margaritacea and antennaria plantaginifolia garret treats us to a cherokee folk tale describing the origin of the name rabbit was caught in the underbrush one day and while freeing himself he got cut there was some sweet everlasting growing nearby and he quickly discovered that the plant was curative for cuts this story reflects a knowledge of the habitat in which rabbits like to hide and feed thickets and their weaknesses rabbit skin is very thin and delicate if a rabbit is chased by a dog or predator the skin can tear and bleed this tale does not explain the association with tobacco so i asked my friend sondra boyd r n ph d of erwinna pennsylvania a cherokee trained in medicine by both the eastern and western bands why the plant was called ‘rabbit tobacco’ she explained “the old people noticed that the rabbits liked to gather where there was a lot of this plant growing so they thought it must be their tobacco their way of connecting to the creator”in 1687 the rev john clayton noted that the indians of virginia were “most famed for curing of wounds” among the diverse “very good woundherbs” they utilized were “the gnaphalium americanum commonly known by the name white plantain” erichsenbrown 1989 403 the reputation of sweet everlasting as a wound remedy was reported by peter kalm 1751 70 he learned of it from john bartram the noted botanist widely traveled in both indian and colonial america along the eastern seaboard mr bartram told me another use of this plant a decoction of the flowers and stalks is used to bathe pained or bruised parts of the body or they may be rubbed with the plant itself tied up in a thin cloth or bag here we see the idea of the sweet everlasting pillow which will be further encountered below james mooney 1886 325 who studied extensively among the eastern cherokee wrote about the use of gnaphalium decurrens winged cudweed or winged life everlasting this species now known as g viscosum is identical to g obtusifolium except that the leaves are stalkless it is probable that the two were not differentiated by the cherokees he writes that it is “considered one of their most valuable medical plants” the decoction is drunk for colds and it is used in the sweat lodge as the next source notes it is also diaphoretic several books by modern cherokee authors mention the use of rabbit tobacco paul b hamel and mary u chiltoskey cherokee plants and their uses – a 400 year history 1975 51 identify rabbit tobacco as gnaphalium obtusifolium and record the following uses
