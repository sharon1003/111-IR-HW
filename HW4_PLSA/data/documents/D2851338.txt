the u s senate  attempts by adventurers to land on cuba hoping to spark a revolution and take over the country  there were plans to add cuba to america going back to the days of thomas jefferson  one of the first was by a former spanish general narcisco lopez 1797–1851 led expeditions into cuba from new orleans prior to the american civil war  narcisco lopez with his flag lópez realized the advantages for the south of a free cuba he and other southerners hoped that cuba would become a strong partner in the slavery and perhaps like texas join the union as a slave state he moved his headquarters to new orleans and tried to gain popular support by recruiting the influential men of the south to lead his expedition he solicited the military help of senator jefferson davis  davis turned him down but he recommended major robert e lee lee thought seriously about lópezs offer but eventually also decided not to become involved cuban flag designed by lopez lopez enlisted about sixhundred filibusters in his expedition and successfully reached cuba in may 1850 his troops arrived in and took the town of cárdenas carrying a flag that lópez had designed and which would become the flag of modern cuba nevertheless the local support that he had hoped for failed to materialize when the fighting started much of the local population joined the spanish against lópez and he hastily retreated to key west where he disbanded the expedition within minutes of landing in order to avoid prosecution under the u s neutrality law of 1818 in august 1851 lópez once again departed for cuba with several hundred men when he arrived he took one half of his expedition to march inland while the other half commanded by colonel william crittenden remained on the northern coast to protect supplies as in his first attempt the local support that lópez had counted upon did not answer his appeals outnumbered and surrounded by spanish forces lópez and many men were captured crittendens forces shared the same fate the spanish executed most of the prisoners sending others to work in mining labor camps those executed included many americans colonel crittenden and lopez

with america short of granting cuba independence  senator proctors report senator redfield proctor the decisive event leading to war was the speech of republican senator redfield proctor  1831  1908  delivered on march 17 1898 which thoroughly and calmly analyzed the situation and concluded war was the only answer the business and religious communities which had opposed war switched sides leaving president william mc kinley and thomas brackett reed almost alone in their opposition to the war senator redfield proctor of vermont visited cuba after the destruction of the maine and gave a disturbing account of conditions in cuba as a result of the spanish attempts to isolate the cuban rebels outside havana all is changed it is not peace nor is it war it is desolation and distress misery and starvation every town and village is surrounded by a trocha trench a sort of riflepit but constructed on a plan new to me the dirt being thrown upon the inside and a barb wire fence on the outer side of the trench these trochas have at every corner and at frequent intervals along the sides what are there called forts but which are really small blockhouses many of them more like a large sentry box loopholed for musketry and with a guard of from two to ten soldiers in each the purpose of these trochas is to keep the reconcentrados in as well as to keep the insurgents out from all the surrounding country the people have been driven into these fortified towns and held there to subsist as they can they are virtually prisonyards and not unlike one in general appearance except the walls are not so high and strong but they suffice where every point is in range of a soldiers rifle to keep in the poor reconcentrado women and children every rail road station is within one of these trochas and has an armed guard with this exception there is no human life or habitation between these fortified towns and villages and throughout the whole of the four western provinces except to a very limited extent among the hills where the spaniards have not been able to go and drive the people to the towns and burn their dwellings i saw no house or hut in the 400 miles of railroad rides from pinar del rio province in the west across the full width of havana and matanza provinces and to sagua la grande on tin north shore and to cienfuegos on the south shore of santa clara except within the spanish trochas there are no domestic animals or crops on the rich fields and pastures except such as are under guard in the immediate vicinity of the towns in other words the spaniards hold in these four western provinces just what their army sits on every man woman and child and every domestic animal wherever their columns have reached is under guard and within their socalled fortifications to describe one place is to describe all to repeat it is neither peace nor war it is concentration and desolation these dreadful conditions were brought about by the famous and brutal order of captaingeneral weyler the first clause of which senator proctor quoted and which is here repeated it readi order and command first all the inhabitants of the country or outside of the line of fortification of the towns shall within the period of eight days concentrate themselves in the town so occupied by the troops any individual who after the expiration of this period is found in the uninhabited parts will be considered a rebel and tried as such according to proctor this was nothing less than an artfully planned scheme to exterminate by starvation and disease the native population under the order of his government general fitzhugh lee consul general of the united states at havana had the 9th of april closed his office turned over to the english consul the care of american interests and with a number of other americans had embarked for key west reaching there the next day president mc kinleys reluctance to go to war president mc kinley the preceding administration of grover cleveland had been opposed to war the president elect republican william mc kinley was also opposed to war  why was president mc kinley reluctant to go to war with spain  there were a few reasons for this first as a union officer during the civil war he had seen death first hand second america was revving from an economic depression and it was thought the war would be a drag on the economy third america did not know what the european reaction would be to such a war and if it would bring in other european powers the european press was hostile to america during the war cartoon of mc kinley trying to keepa lid on war pressure despite the sinking of the maine  it was spains failure to grant autonomy to cuba that was the major force leading to the war  on march 18 1898 mc kinley sent three messages to the american ambassador in madrid that unless spain would give full née to cuba he would resort to turning the question over to the war favoring congress  on april 11 1898 mc kinley sent a message to congress and congress passed a resolution recognizing the independence of cuba and on april 25 passed a war resolution on april 22 the navy had sailed to set up a blockade of ports in cuba  on april 23 mc kinley called for 125000 and there was a great rush to volunteer william mc kinley 1843 1901 hd 9 26 14your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats

message of the president proved a disappointment the efforts of mr mc kinley at delay had been received with undisguised impatience and joined to his pacific intentions which were well known had created a question in the public mind whether in case the decision should be left with him he could be relied on to carry out the now set purpose of the people to allow no further equivocation but to proceed at once by force of arms to compel spain to withdraw from cuba without debate the message was the very next day the 13th of april congress began to act each of the two committees to which the presidents message had been referred made its returns each consisting of two reports one of the majority and the other of the minority objections from a senator carried the two reports of the senate committee over for a day  but in the house immediate consideration was had the minority report offered by the democrats and recognizing the insurrectionary cuban government was voted down 147 to 190 then the house by a vote of 322 to 19 adopted the resolutions reported by the majority of its committee on foreign affairs denouncing spains methods in cuba as inhuman and uncivilized holding spain responsible for the destruction of the maine and directing the president  to intervene at once  for the restoration of order in cuba and for the establishment of  a stable and independent government in the island for which intervention  he is empowered to use the land and naval forces of the united states in the senate where objection delayed immediate consideration a majority of the committee on foreign relations re ported resolutions declaring that the people of cuba are and of right ought to be free and independent denouncing spanish misrule in the island as cruel barbarous and inhuman demanding that spain at once withdraw her forces from the island and empowering and directing the president to intervene with the army and navy of the united states to drive spain from cuba the minority of the senate committee consisting of the democratic members and senator foraker brought in resolutions definitely recognizing the independence of the insurgent cuban government on the 16th after a debate of three days the senate adopted resolutions similar to those adopted by the house but embracing a recognition of the insurgent government thus matters rested over sunday the 17th when after many and prolonged consultations beginning the morning of the 18th and extending far into the night of the 19th the conference committee agreed upon a final report this declared that the people of cuba are and of right ought to be free and independent demanded that spain at once withdraw from cuba directed the president of the united states to use the army and navy if necessary to enforce this demand and pledged the united states to leave the people of cuba free after the expulsion of spain to establish their own form of government concessions were made by both house and senate to this agreement though as the resolutions were at last adopted they proved to be those reported to the senate by the majority of its foreign relations committee with the addition of the amendment pledging liberty to cuba to establish its own governmenthe conference reported was promptly adopted by the senate by a vote of 42 to 35 the house however did not get through its roll call for more than an hour later finally adopting the report by a vote of 310 to 6 thus was the congress a unit and behind it an overwhelming majority of the people referred to the appropriate committees but when congress adjourned that afternoon no doubt was anywhere entertained that a state of war already existing a formal declaration of war was but the matter of a few days or hours the joint resolution the joint resolution as it was finally adopted by the two houses of congress and was signed by the president read as follows resolved by the senate and the house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled1 that the people of the island of cuba are and of a right ought to be free and independent2 that it is the duty of the united states to demand and the government of the united states does hereby demand that the government of spain at once relinquish its authority and government in the island of cuba and withdraw its land and naval forces from cuba and cuban waters3 that the president of the united states be and he hereby is directed and empowered to use the entire land and naval forces of the united states and to call into the actual service of the united states the militia of the several states to such an extent as may be necessary to carry these resolutions into effect4 that the united states hereby disclaims any disposition or intention to exercise sovereignty jurisdiction or control over said island except for the pacifi cation thereof and asserts its determination when that is accomplished to leave the government and control of the island to its people the discretion asked by the president was withheld partly because as was claimed congress should not surrender to the executive its warmaking prerogative and partly because the war party thought the president was not sufficiently aggressive in temper and purpose there appeared however no reason to find fault with the conduct of the president in the emergency created by the action of congress minister woodford at madrid was promptly instructed to lay the ultimatum of the united states before the government of spain and to demand an answer by the following saturday the 23rd of april it being now wednesday the 20th spain however did not wait to be officially advised senor barnabe who had succeeded signor de lome as spanish minister at washington demanded and received his pass ports at once taking the train that same evening and without event of any kind going through to toronto canada the instructions from the state department sent in cipher did not reach minister woodford at madrid in time to be translated and delivered to the spanish premier senor sagasta that same wednesday evening and the action of congress being already known was deemed by the premier allsufficient so that before minister woodford had time to present the ultimatum of his government next day he was given his passports and told that spain considered the congressional proceeding of the previous day a declaration of war minister woodford although furnished an escort to the spanish frontier was not so fortunate in the circumstances of his departure from madrid as signor barnabe had been in his departure from washington there was much excitement among the populace who assembled in noisy crowds about the railway stations and at valladolid a mob collected demanding the surrender of a member of the ministers official staff and otherwise menacing general woodford and his party without serious accident however the frontier was reached and on friday evening the americans arrived in paris thus although there had been no formal declaration of war on either side actual war was at hand a tension little short of a state of war having existed from the day when the maine report had been submitted to congress the situation in spainassassination of premier canovas on august 8 1897 premier canovas was assassinated by an italian anarchist assassin michele angiolillo and sagasta was returned to power  sagasta declared the warlike policy of canovas to be a failure and was open to a new policy  a measure of autonomy would be offered to cuba with spanish control of the military foreign relations and courts  general weylar would be recalled and ramon blanco y erenas would replace him americans newspapers were distrustful of the offer of autonomy and demanded independence  reaction in spain to american action antiamerican demonstration in madrid in 1896spain in 1898 was a constitutional monarchy there was a parliament the cortes and a prime minister  the 12 year old king alfonso xiii was the regent of his strongwilled mother maria cristina  despite the facade parlinentary rule spain was basically run like a huge feudal estate and it was on the verge of bankruptcy  peasants worked on great estates of absentee aristocrats the young king alfonso xiii of spain andhis regent mother maria cristina in the 1890s when it became obvious that america  japan and germany had designs on spanish colonies spanish the well developed spanish sense of honor and fear of a revolt at home meant that he spanish were compelled to fight many spaniards knew the coming fight was hopeless but determined to fight heroically  common spaniards were growing resentful of upstart american actions and there were antiamerican demonstrations in spain  the response of the ruling classes was if possible still more animated it was vehement and defiant spain regarded cuba which had been a part of the spanish empire for 400 years as an integral part of spain the cortes had been assembled in extraordinary session even whilst the congress at washington was framing the ultimatum to spain a scene both impressive and pathetic was passing at madrid the queenregent with her son the youthful king of spain appeared in the spanish senate chamber where were assembled not only the legislative bodies the cabinet and the great officials civil and military but all the wealth and beauty of the capital gorgeously attired and arrayed the spectacle was truly magnificent senor sagasta when queen christina and the little king alfonso appeared the enthusiasm knew no bounds though there must have been many among that brilliant throng who seeing this stately and noble lady and reflecting upon the true character and meaning of hurrying events could not but feel more of sadness than of exaltation the queenregent read her speech from the throne the boy king standing on her right senor sagasta on her left spain considered cuba not as a colony but as a district of spain  she described the menaces and insults of america as intolerable provocations which would compel her government to sever relations with the government of the united states she expressed her gratitude to the pope and powers and hoped that the supreme decision of parliament would sanction the unalterable resolution of her government to defend the rights of spain she appealed to the spanish people to maintain the integrity both of the dynasty and the nation i have summoned the cortes she said to defend our rights whatever sacrifice they may entail thus identifying myself with the nation i not only fulfill the oath i swore in accepting the regency but i follow the dictates of a mothers heart trusting to the spanish people to gather behind my sons throne and to defend it until he is old enough to defend it himself as well as trusting to the spanish people to defend the honor and the territory of the nation on the 24th spain declared war against the united states  her brave words found their answer in all hearts and were echoed and reechoed throughout the senate chamber and the nation it was not until the 25th of april that congress passed a bill formally declaring war to exist and dating this from the preceding 21st of april though the president had already called out 125000 volunteer soldiers meanwhile the entire north coast of cuba including havana had been blockaded and several spanish prizes had been captured and brought into key west by the naval vessels operating in that quarter foreign reaction to the war what was the foreign reaction to the american decision to go to war with spain  the great powers sympathized with spain but did not intend on provoking the united states  the newspapers of germany of every shape of opinion condemned the united states out of 52 papers in paris only 3 were favorable to the u s and even in england where the official attitude was one of almost sentimental friendliness many papers were teeming with insults the pope trying to help catholic spain did try to mediate but nothing came of this  home preparationsfor war
