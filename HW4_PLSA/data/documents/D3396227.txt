chapter 4 – transportation terminals all spatial flows with the exception of personal vehicular and pedestrian trips involve movements between terminals transport modes require assembly and distribution of their traffic both passenger and freight for example passengers have to go to bus terminals and airports first in order to reach their final destinations and freight has to be consolidated at a port or a rail yard before onward shipment terminals are therefore essential links in transportation chains with many representing substantial infrastructure and capital investments the goal of this chapter is to examine the spatial and functional characteristics of transport terminals they occupy specific locations and they exert a strong influence over their surroundings at the same time they perform specific economic functions and serve as clusters of specialized activities contents the function of transport terminals transport terminals and hinterlands port terminals rail
