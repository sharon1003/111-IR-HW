pathogen safety data sheet  infectious substancessection i  infectious agentname rubella virus synonym or cross reference german measles  1  5 3 day measles  4 congenital rubella syndrome  crs  1  5 characteristics family togaviridae genus rubivirus each virion is 5589 nm and contains one positive stranded rna molecule genetic material is enveloped in an isometric nucleocapsid the capsid consists of multiple copies of one virusspecific protein surrounded in a lipid bilayer containing two virusspecific glycoproteins section ii  hazard identificationpathogenicity toxicity rubella mild infection characterized by rash starting on the face and gradually spreading to the feet fever lymphadenopathy and other flulike symptoms such as coughing sore throat and sneezing  2 3 older children and adults may experience joint involvement and purpuric rash  2 rare complications include encephalitis thrombocytopenia with hemorrhagic manifestations neuritis conjunctivitis and ochitis  3 congenital rubella syndrome women in their first trimester who contract rubella have an increased risk of passing the infection to the developing foetus  3 when contracted during the first trimester the effects on the child are most marked ocular cardiovascular and central nervous system defects are common along with deafness and intrauterine growth retardation contraction of rubella later in pregnancy reduces the risk and severity of symptoms second trimester infections are associated with deafness retinopathy microcephaly and mental retardation while third trimester infections are associated with intrauterine growth retardation epidemiology worldwide  1 3 epidemics occurred roughly every 69 years but immunisation programmes have greatly reduced the number of cases in developed countries  1 3 infections peaks in late winter and spring  3 host range humans  1 5 infectious dose thirty viral units subcutaneously 10 viral units by pharyngeal spray and 60 units by nasal drops are sufficient for infection  6 mode of transmission the virus is transmitted by aerosols from the respiratory tract in infected individuals  7 transmission may also occur via nasal and respiratory tract secretions carried on hands that come in contact with nasal mucosa incubation period the incubation period is 1417 days with a range of 1421 days  8 rash is the first symptoms to appear rash appears 2 weeks after infection  1 3 communicability carrier is infectious for 7 days before appearance of rash and for 57 days after the appearance of the rash  2 3 transmission requires close persontoperson contact  7 section iii  disseminationreservoir humans  3 5zoonosis none vectors none section iv  stability and viabilitydrug susceptibility susceptibility to antiviral drugs has not been reported  1 susceptibility to disinfectants rubella virions are susceptible to ether chloroform sodium dodecyl sulphate  sds  saponin formaldehyde ethylene oxide and beta propiolactone  1 1 sodium hypochlorite and 70 ethanol are also effective disinfectants  7 physical inactivation temperatures exceeding 56 °c for 220 minutes 37°c for 48 hours or 20 °c will inactivate the rubella virus  1 virions are also susceptible to uv light virions are not stable at a p h less than 68 or greater than 80  1 survival outside host rubella has a half life of 1 hour at 37 °c outside of the host  9 the mean survival time is 09 days section v  first aid  medicalsurveillance monitor for symptoms confirm diagnosis with serological testing  1 enzymelinked immunosorbent assays  elisa  hemagglutination inhibition test  hi  and immunofluorescent antibody assay  ifa are common methods used serologic testing can also be used to confirm congenital rubella syndrome in an infant which may yield more harm than the rubella virus itself note all diagnostic methods are not necessarily available in all countries first aidtreatment treatment for rubella is supportive  1 there have been no reports of successful treatment with antiviral drugs immunisation vaccine available vaccine is combined with measles and mumps vaccines and is known as the measles mumps and rubella mmr vaccine 25 vaccination for women is suggested 1 month before conception if not previously vaccinated 3 recent studies show any risk to foetus during the first month of pregnancy from the vaccine is negligible prophylaxis vaccination of females of child bearing age decreases the risk of crs  1 3 immune globulin given soon after exposure to rubella may modify or suppress symptoms but is not certain to prevent infection including congenital infection and thus is not recommended for routine use  10 section vi  laboratory hazardslaboratoryacquired infections two cases of rubella in laboratory workers were reported as of 1985 and the source of these infections may have been from the community  11 health care workers have been known to carry the virus and act as a source of infection to in larger community  12 sourcesspecimens blood faeces urine and nasopharyngeal secretions contain the viral agent during the course of infection  2 primary hazards inhalation of aerosols during manipulation of infectious samples or cultures are the primary hazards associated with the rubella virus  6 13 splashing of infectious samples in the eye also poses risk of infection special hazards rubella is a teratogen  14 based on the outcomes of a local risk assessment mitigation measures should be put in place to protect pregnant women and women trying to become pregnant from possible exposures when working in a laboratory where rubella virus is handled section vii  exposure controls  personal protectionrisk group classification risk group 2  15 containment requirements containment level 2 facilities equipment and operational practices for work involving infected or potentially infected materials animals or cultures protective clothing lab coat gloves when direct skin contact with infected materials or animals is unavoidable eye protection must be used where there is a known or potential risk of exposure to splashes  13 other precautions all procedures that may produce aerosols or involve high concentrations or large volumes should be conducted in a biological safety cabinet  bsc  the use of needles syringes and other sharp objects should be strictly limited additional precautions should be considered with work involving animals or large scale activities  13 section viii  handling and storagespills allow all aerosols to settle and while wearing protective clothing cover the spill gently with paper towel and apply appropriate disinfectant starting at the edges of the spill zone and working inward allow an appropriate contact time before clean up  13 disposal decontamination using steam sterilization chemical disinfection or incineration must be performed before disposal of infectious waste  13 storage all infectious materials should be stored in sealed containers bearing the appropriate labelling  13 section ix  regulatory and other informationregulatory information the import transport and use of pathogens in canada is regulated under many regulatory bodies including the public health agency of canada health canada canadian food inspection agency environment canada and transport canada users are responsible for ensuring they are compliant with all relevant acts
