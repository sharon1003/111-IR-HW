assessment of the posture and movement skills needed by infants for daily life activities target populationages 34 weeks postconceptional age through 4 months post term time requirements unspecified test administration administration testing reviews a total of 42 items 13 items are observed during a period of spontaneous activity 5 items on the test are all related to head control in supported sitting the following series of items examine postural control in the supine position there is also a series of prone items that can be evaluated together the remaining items to be evaluated focus on righting reactions during tilting and sidelying as well as postural control in standing scoring correct scoring is explained during workshops type of information resulting from testingdiscriminate

nursery or home exercise programs offered to premature infants posthospital discharge environmnt for testing the timp can be used both in special care nursery settings and in early intervention

motor development of age group tested and sensitive to show effects of physical therapy provided to high risk infants in the special care nursery weaknesses requires expensive training workshops in order to be administered clinical applications along with identifying infants that are high risk for poor motor performance and showing progress with motor performance over time this test can also be

galloway jc early intensive postural and movement training advances head control in very young infants phys ther 201292935947 the purpose of the study was to determine the effects of the postural and movement experiences on the head control through measurement with the test of infant motor performance beginning when infants were 1 month old the population consisted of 22 fullterm 1 month old infants with no known sensory or motor impairments the patients were randomly selected to training group or control group the training group consisted of 6 males and 5 females they were provided at least 20 minutes of daily postural training requiring increased use of neck shoulder girdle and trunk muscles and movement training requiring increased use of arm movements for reaching the caretakers of treatment group were also encouraged to use a front carrier ie baby björn for at least 20 minutes per day the control group consisted of 8 males and 3 females they were provided social interaction from the care giver as they werein a supine position caretakers provided visual and verbal contact but no physical contact of the infant nor the use of toys was allowed each session lasted for at least 20 minutes per day over a 4 week period testing was performed every other week from the 1 to 4 months of age following analysis of the the results it was shown that the training group had higher timp scores on head control–related items during the training period and after training stopped compared with the control group after conclusion of treatment the treatment group infants actively moved their heads forward more often and for further distances the author concluded that young infants can benefit from postural and movement experiences to rapidly enhance their head control as early as 4 to 6 weeks of postnatal life the author also concluded that improvement in timp scores and increase head mobility and head control was the result of infant positioning caregiver handling and
