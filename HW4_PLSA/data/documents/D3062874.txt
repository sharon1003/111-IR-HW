not as needy as dogs but typically more cuddly than cats a pet rabbit can be an ideal addition to your family like any animal kept indoors however there are a few potential drawbacks including possible odors fortunately rabbits arent known for smelling bad and any odor is probably a result of improper care body odor unlike dogs rabbits dont have a body odor you shouldnt notice any odor emanating from them if you do the rabbit is probably sick or has an infection an ear infection for example can give off a musty smell occasionally an intact male rabbit or buck will produce a musky scent when hes around a female or doe otherwise if your rabbit has body odor a trip to the vet is in order to determine the cause feces in a healthy rabbit the feces should be nearly odorless rabbit feces are small round brown pellets that should be somewhat firm and dry if your rabbits feces are watery look like cow patties or have an odor he might have intestinal parasites or another illness if you notice a smell coming from the feces check with your vet urine nearly all the smell produced by rabbits comes from the urine it has a distinctive ammoniatinged odor that is especially strong right after urination and can be quite strong the urine from a buck tends to have a stronger smell than that from a doe bucks also use urine to mark their territory so they urinate more often producing more scent litter box containing your rabbits urination in a litter box is very effective at reducing odor since rabbits tend to choose a single spot to relieve themselves its very easy to train your rabbit to use a litter box litter with a natural odor reducer like baking soda will help keep the smell down even more scented litters are not a good choice for rabbits however since it irritates their sensitive noses also wood shavings specifically pine and cedar can be poisonous to rabbits and are not good litter choices cleanliness when the living quarters and litter box are kept clean with soiled litter removed regularly a pet rabbit is virtually odorless except for a few minutes following urination when the smell is strongest however if the cage and litter box are not kept clean odor can build up very quickly and the smell can be stronger than that produced by a cat if your rabbit smells its probably because his cage and litter box need cleaned sterilization having your rabbit spayed or neutered can help reduce odors in two ways first it reduces the musky odor in the urine and gives it a milder less offensive smell second it stops bucks from spraying to mark their territory when your buck isnt urinating as much there is a lot less odor ads by revcontent you may like this app teaches complete beginners a new language in 3 weeks babbel you could become a pch multimillionaire on 427publishers clearing house american picker mike wolfes mansion is just plain disgusting miss penny stocks you should never shop on amazon again after seeing this site tophatter7 time lottery winner says youre all playing the lottery wrong financial review 247gorgeous kids of the rich  famous you wont believe who their famous mother is lawyers favorite references 4photo credits rabbit image by veseliysyslik from fotoliacom cite this article see more animals is it necessary to spay my female pet rabbit what is the purpose of a dewlap on a rabbit what is that bump on a rabbits cheeks do ferrets stink
