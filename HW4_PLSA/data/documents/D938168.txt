by john lamm jul 1 2015 51k john lamm does anyone do drama like the italians it wasnt enough to just to unveil the alfa romeo giulia quadrifoglio with the bit of disorganization that can come with debuts in italy they also trotted out famed tenor andrea bocelli who sang nessun dorma from giacomo puccinis turandot this threatened to bring a tear to the eyes of hardened journalists just as the car was driven out for the first time its been two decades since alfa romeo halted sedan sales in the u s and about a half decade since work began on the new giulia designs were rejected the project rebooted and placed in the hands of socalled skunks a reminder of lockheed martins seven decades of behindthescenes toil in its skunk works where most automakers debut a new model in its base form and later add the performance versions alfa is doing the opposite leading with its hero version sporting that quadrifoglio moniker here are a halfdozen things you need to know about this antibmw antimercedes antiaudi and anticadillac john lamm the engine and its enemies hows this for heritage ferrari tuned but didnt supply the quadrifoglios allaluminum 30liter twinturbo v6 alfa is claiming 510 metric hp which translates to 503 sae hp in the u s we did not get a torque number but alfa contends theres enough oomph to get the sedan to 62 mph in 39 seconds also in the package is cylinder deactivation to improve fuel mileage and a nicely nasty exhaust note the enemies according to alfa romeo the bmw m3 with its 425hp 30liter twinturbo inlinesix good for 0–60 mph in 39 seconds the mercedesamg c63 s with its 503hp 40liter twinturbo v8 0–60 mph in 39 seconds and the audi s4 making 333 hp from a 30liter supercharged v6 0–60 mph in 49 seconds nate hassler and an american pair apparently ignored by alfa romeo the cadillac atsv with its 464hp 36liter twinturbo v6 0–60 mph in 38 seconds and its larger sibling the ctsv with a 640hp supercharged 62liter v8 0–60 mph in 37 seconds advertisement  continue reading below we received no information about the quadrifoglios gearbox but the show cars appeared to have sixspeed manuals if an automatic is not offered in the u s though consider that a selfinflicted wound on alfas part there will be other engines to go with the standard giulia in the u s well see a fourcylinder and a 30liter nonturbo v6 john lamm shape style and carbon fiber in this class aggression often replaces beauty and the giulia quadrifoglio is no exception note the short overhangs front and rear and the bmw m3ish outlets on the front fenders which exaggerate the aggression further naturally the design leads with a version of the classic alfa grille flanked by broadmouth openings below the grille is an activeaero lip spoiler along the sides are aggressive sills and the trunk is capped with a decklid spoiler below the bumper are a diffuser and four exhaust pipes we expect most of these design elements will not be on the standard giulias while the fenders and doors are made of aluminum the hood roof and prop shaft are done in carbon fiber—all the better to trim weight john lamm inside story we werent allowed inside the alfas with their darkened windows but thanks to the wonders of digital photography and 52000 iso we got a look it appears to be very much a drivers design with wellhooded instruments and proper knobs for most controls several controls are on the steering wheel including the start button a la f1 the seats appear to have carbon fiber shells and proper side bolstering were told interior materials include carbon fiber wood and fabrics advertisement  continue reading below john lamm gripping the ground a performance alfa aint an alfa if doesnt handle properly the giulia quadrifoglio has 5050 weight distribution and is claimed to be better than the competition in torsional rigidity at the front is a double wishbone suspension and what alfa calls a semivirtual steering axis—which is claimed to improve steering by keeping a constant caster trail while cornering at the back is a multilink design both ends using major aluminum elements another part of the handling package is torque vectoring via a pair of clutches that mete out torque to the wheels individually also included is an integrated brake system and overall control from the wonderfully named chassis domain control one of those center console knobs allows the driver to choose between dynamic natural advanced efficient ie ecofriendly and racing modes carbonceramic brakes ride inside 19inch wheels mounted with pirelli p zero corsa tires john lamm whats in a name considering most americans are used to seeing giulia as julia thats one the automaker can easily spell out for them but giulia is simple compared to quadrifoglio which is roughly kwahdrihfohleeoh that is incidentally the fourleaf clover emblem worn by alfas since the 1923 targa florio we sometimes despair that alphanumeric names have replaced actual names but at least m3 c63 and atsv are pronounced about the same from kennebunkport maine to beaverton oregon but quadrifoglio lots of luck alfa it will be interesting to see if the names alfa romeo giulia and quadrifoglio register in the u s or if the marques highly regarded history will mean anything in 2016 alfas have long been major players in the vintage scene with many owners and fans pledging allegiance to the brand thats a starting point but will it be enough advertisement  continue reading below john lamm why last year alfa romeo sold around 74000 cars worldwide but fca ceo sergio marchionne plans to sell some 400000 annually by 2018 the u s is supposed to contribute 150000 sales to that 2018 total helping will be another eight alfa models to be launched by that deadline expect a full lineup of small and large vehicles plus of course an suv that offensive begins with the giulia and one has to admire marchionnes confidence as he marches ahead with alfa romeo as a lead brand for fca expect alfa romeo giulia quadrifoglios in dealerships in early 2016 prices are unknown but the bmw m3 starts at 62995 and you can easily pump one over 70000 would you pay that amount for the distinction of parking your alfa quadrifoglio next to an m3 or a c63 at cars and coffee more from future cars  spy shots look at the cars testing at the nurburgring2019 audi a6 avant is just so beautiful the 2019
