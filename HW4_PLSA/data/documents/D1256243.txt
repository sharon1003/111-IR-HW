contents  previous  next2 protein requirements of infants21 using the breastfed as a model 06 months211 rationale for this approach in the 1985 report protein requirements during the first 6 months were based on estimated intakes of breastfed infants the explicit assumption of this approach was that the protein needs of an infant will be met if its energy needs are met and the food providing the energy contains protein in quantity and quality equivalent to that of breast milk p 98 this approach is often justified using the evolutionary argument that human milk has been adapted to be ideally suited to the nutritional needs of the human infant therefore its protein content by definition should meet or exceed the required amounts the above argument should be carefully examined because it is the underpinning of most calculations of nutrient requirements not just for protein during early infancy in criticising this argument fomon 1993 has suggested that the composition of human milk represents an evolutionary compromise between the needs of the infant and the needs of the mother theoretically if the true needs of the infant required a milk protein concentration that would result in excessive depletion of the mothers reserves it is argued that natural selection might result in milk protein levels somewhat less than optimal from the infants point of view the observation that after the first 23 months breastfed infants gain weight less rapidly than do formulafed infants leads some to question whether breastfed infants are really meeting their protein requirements this evolutionary compromise theory deserves further scrutiny in the case of protein it is useful to calculate how much of a saving the mother might achieve if her milk were somewhat lower in protein than the amount truly required by the infant if one assumes an average production of about 800 mld and a milk protein concentration of 9 g1 the average woman secretes approximately 7 gd of protein butte et al 1984 heinig et al 1993 if the infants true requirement were closer to the typical intakes of formulafed infants approximately 11 gd at 3 months heinig et al 1993 the saving to the mother of producing a lowerprotein milk would be about 4 gd this represents about 8 of the current rda in the us of 50 gd protein for an adult woman during the period of exclusive breastfeeding after other foods are introduced to the infant and breast milk production decreases this saving would be even less during most of our evolutionary past it is believed that the typical human diet was based heavily on wild game and fish and was thus very high in protein eaton and konner 1985 therefore it is unlikely that there was much evolutionary pressure to limit protein secretion in human milk after the agricultural revolution of about 12 000 years ago a relatively recent event in evolutionary terms humans began to rely more extensively on plant foods as the dietary staples it is possible that a decrease in availability of animal protein preceded perhaps even prompted the agricultural revolution fomon 1993 argues that if selection pressure is strong enough 1220000 years is sufficient time for the spread of a favorable gene he provides as an example the maintenance of lactase activity among adults of dairying cultures however it is debatable whether a reduction in protein secretion by adult women in agrarian societies that represents  8 of total daily needs would confer enough of a selective advantage to result in a decrease in milk protein concentrations over such a time frame in modernday agrarian societies with heavy reliance on plant foods there is little evidence that adult protein intakes are marginal although some would argue that intakes of certain amino acids may be low current thinking is that it is generally the poor availability of micro nutrients such as iron and zinc from predominantly plantbased diets that is the most serious nutritional problem in such societies rather than protein deficiency per se beaton et al 1992 allen 1993 1994 in terms of outcomes such as immune function and behavioral development breastfed infants apparently do better than formulafed infants despite their lower protein intakes institute of medicine 1991 rogan and gladen 1993 lucas et al 1992 of course it could be claimed that this is an unfair comparison given that there are many other differences between human milk and infant formula and potentially in parental behaviors associated with breast vs bottlefeeding however even when functional measures such as morbidity and activity level are compared within a breastfed cohort there is no evidence that lower protein intakes expressed either as gd or as percent of energy are associated with adverse outcomes heinig et al 1993 in fact in the study by heinig et al a higher protein intake at 69 months was significantly associated with greater morbidity with respect to growth the differences that exist between breastfed and formulafed infants are greater for weight than for length dewey et al 1992 who 1994 indicating that the level of fatness differs more than doe the rate of linear growth dewey et al 1993 it does not appear that protein intake is responsible for these differences when controlling for energy intake protein intake ie protein density of the diet was not associated with weight or length gain during any quarter of the first year of life within a breastfed cohort heinig et al 1993 if protein concentration of human milk were marginal one would have expected a positive association between protein density and growth thus with the evidence in hand there is little reason to suspect that the amount of protein consumed by breastfed infants in the first 46 months is inadequate212 assumptions of the 1985 recommendations for 06 months the 1985 report estimated the protein intakes of breastfed infants from data available in the literature at that time the average protein content of human milk was assumed to be 115 g100 ml after the first month post partum calculated from total nitrogen content × 625 it was recognized that a substantial proportion of human milk nitrogen is contributed by nonprotein nitrogen but it was assumed that the nonprotein fraction is fully utilized it was also assumed that the protein concentration of human milk remains stable after the first month which is not the case section 213 discusses these issues in light of more recent data to calculate total protein intake the 1985 report utilized data on average breast milk intake from two studies wallgren 194445 whitehead and paul 1981 however in those studies the systematic bias 36 caused by insensible water loss from the infant while testweighing was not taken into account resulting in an underestimate of the amount of milk actually consumed section 214 presents data on breast milk intake with an adjustment for insensible water lossto estimate protein intake per kg body weight the 1985 report used average weights of infants in the nchs reference which are based on the fels longitudinal study however the majority of infants in the fels study were bottlefed given the abovementioned differences in growth between breastfed and bottlefed infants it would be preferable to estimate protein intake per kg on the basis of actual weights of breastfed infants whose intake has been measured section 214 utilizes this approach in revising the estimates in table 29 of the 1985 report finally the estimates presented in the 1985 report extended only to 4 months of age because there was insufficient information on the intakes of exclusively breastfed infants beyond that age section 214 includes data up to 6 months of age for exclusively breastfed infants in the 1985 report the average intake of breastfed infants was assumed to approximate the mean requirement however it has since been pointed out beaton and chery 1988 waterlow 1990 1992 a  that this approach was incorrect as it will automatically define half of breastfed infants as having deficient intakes if it is assumed that nearly all breastfed infants are meeting their protein requirements then their average intake should be above the safe level for protein intake ie  2 sd higher than the mean requirement this issue is discussed in more detail in section 228213 protein content of human milk and utilization of nonprotein nitrogen  the protein content of human milk decreases during the course of lactation lonnerdal et al 1976 a  this decrease is most pronounced during the very early part of lactation values for colostrum approx 15 days of lactation can be as high as 2030 g1 but by day 10 they are around 13 15gl and at one month about 1012gl subsequently there is a slow decline with values in midlactation being around 89 g1 it should be emphasized that these are concentrations of true protein ie total nitrogen nonprotein nitrogen × 625 which is equivalent to protein analyzed by amino acid analysis lonnerdal et al 1976 b  various protein assays have also been used and although they can give reasonable estimates when care is taken to use appropriate standards they all have a tendency to overestimate the true protein content lonnerdal et al  1987 human milk proteins are usually divided into two major classes casein and whey proteins overall caseins are easily digested and utilized while the digestibility of some whey proteins is more limited lindberg et al 1982 and intact proteins have been found in the stool of breastfed infants davidson and lonnerdal 1987 it should be noted that the changes in protein content of human milk described above are net changes the patterns for these two classes are quite different kunz and lonnerdal 1992 the casein content of colostrum is initially very low or casein is absent and it then rapidly increases to reach a peak at about 810 days of lactation thereafter concentrations decline in contrast whey proteins are very high in concentration in early colostrum and they then immediately decrease in concentration thus the commonly used whey casein ratio is not constant for human milk but varies from about 80 20 in early milk to 60 40 in midlactation and about 50 50 in late lactation kunz and lonnerdal 1992 these ratios are important when considering digestibility of human milk proteins and as a consequence amino acid utilization and requirements the proportion of nonprotein nitrogen npn in human milk about 2027 of total nitrogen is large as compared to most other species hambraeus et al 1978 when determining the true protein content of human milk this npn fraction is subtracted from the total nitrogen to obtain protein nitrogen although this is formally correct this fraction must be considered when assessing the amino acid requirements of breastfed infants amino acids in free form or bound in smaller peptides are likely to be utilized and together comprise about 30 of the npn donovan and lonnerdal 1989a the major component of the npn fraction in human milk is urea as much as 50 of the npn belongs to this fraction donovan and lonnerdal 1989a the level of urea in human milk can be affected by maternal protein intake forsum and lonnerdal 1980 studies utilizing stable isotopes have attempted to assess the utilization of urea nitrogen for amino acid synthesis in breastfed infants donovan et al 1990 heine et al  1986 fomon et al 1988 these have shown that about 1020 of this nitrogen is utilizable however results vary among studies for example heine et al 1986 found higher utilization rates of urea nitrogen 3943 but their studies were performed in children recuperating from infection in whom there may have been rapid regeneration of the intestinal mucosa it is not clear whether these results could be applied to healthy children other components of the npn fraction include choline carnitine creatine creatinine nucleotides and nitrogencontaining carbohydrates such as sialic acid and oligosaccharides atkinson et al 1989 several of these compounds are involved in lipid and nucleic acid metabolism and are likely to be used for amino acid synthesis some are present in low concentrations and the amounts of nitrogen contributed are very small as compared to the requirements of infants214 revised estimates of protein intake of breastfed infants table 1 provides estimates of the protein intake of exclusively breastfed infants from 1 to 6 months in a similar format to that of table 29 in the 1985 report data were taken from two studies in the usa in which breast milk intake was carefully measured by test weighing with electronic balances for periods of 24 butte et al 1984 or 96 hours heinig et al 1993 in both studies milk samples were collected over a 24h period at each age using the alternate breast expression method and pooled samples were analyzed for protein concentration in the butte et al study the actual breakdown of protein nitrogen and nonprotein nitrogen npn was provided the latter averaged 266 of total nitrogen in the study by heinig et al it was estimated that 255 of the total nitrogen was npn although several other studies have presented data on breast milk intake with values similar to those observed in these two studies they were not included here either because milk protein concentration was not measured the samples were not representative of a 24h period or the weights of the infants were not stated in table 1 the data from the above two studies were used to calculate total nitrogen intake crude protein intake total n × 625 end adjusted protein intake to estimate adjusted protein intake it was assumed that of the npn fraction all of the � amino nitrogen and glucosamines together representing about 35 of npn fomon 1993 and 1740 of the remaining npn can be utilized thus the values are given for a range representing 4661 utilization of the npn in human milk table 1 shows that adjusted protein intake gd declines sharply between 1 and 2 months as the protein concentration of human milk decreases and then levels off at 7584 gd when expressed per kg body weight the adjusted protein intakes range from 195204gkgd at 1 month to 105116gkgd at 46 months these values are about 020046 gkgd less than the values listed in table 29 of the 1985 report a difference of 1026 depending on age this comparison takes into account the fact that table 29 in the 1985 report used age ranges rather than specific ages the latter was chosen for table 1 because the two studies cited generally measured intake within a few days of the age specified most of this difference is due to the change in assumption regarding the proportion of the npn fraction utilized but part of the difference is due to higher means for infant weight in table 1 than in the previous table 29 and another part is related to the decrease in milk protein concentration over time which was not accounted for in the 1985 report table 1 revised

interested in estimating the true amount of protein that is utilizable by the breastfed infant the adjusted protein values in table 1 are most appropriate however when comparing intakes of breastfed infants to factorial models of requirements it is generally more appropriate to use total nitrogen intake this is because the factorial models usually include assumptions regarding the efficiency of utilization of dietary nitrogen if this has already been adjusted for when calculating intake there is a risk of adjusting twice for the same phenomenon incomplete utilization of dietary nitrogen22 using the factorial approach221 basis of the 1985 recommendations a modified factorial method was used in the 1985 report to estimate protein requirements of infants and children after the age of 6 months this approach requires the estimation of both maintenance nitrogen needs and the amount of nitrogen required for growth the factorial method necessitates several assumptions regarding a the adequacy of nitrogen balance data for estimating maintenance requirements b the rate of growth and the composition of tissue gain during growth c the degree of daily intraindividual variation in growth rate d the efficiency of conversion of dietary protein to body protein and e the amount of interindividual variability in nitrogen needed for maintenance and growth the following sections examine each of these assumptions222 estimated maintenance nitrogen requirement although there are many criticisms of using nitrogen balance studies to estimate protein requirements fao whounu 1985 at present there are no satisfactory alternative data to estimate maintenance nitrogen needs of infants see section 25 for a discussion of amino acid requirements in the 1985 report the values for maintenance nitrogen needs of infants and children were based primarily on shortterm balance studies generally performed in children who were healthy but had recently recovered from malnutrition and were still short in stature though normal in weight for height energy intake was maintained at a level assumed to be adequate and protein was fed at various levels the maintenance requirement nitrogen intake needed to achieve balance assuming no growth was calculated from the regression of nitrogen balance on nitrogen intake allowing 10 mg nkgd for sweat and miscellaneous losses the only data cited in the 1985 report for maintenance protein needs of infants were from a study of children 917 months of age huang et al 1980 see table 2 data from other studies were shown but none of the children were younger than 12 months in the huang et al study the infants energy intake was only 77 kcalkgd far below both the recommended level  100 kcalkgd for this age range and the average intake of breastfed infants at 12 months 9o kcalkgd heinig et al 1993 the authors explained that the childrens usual intake was 100 kcalkgd but when they were confined on the metabolic beds their appetite decreased and their intake during the study was much lower than normal maintenance nitrogen needs were calculated to be 113 mg nkgd on the milk diet including the extra 10 mg nkgd for unmeasured losses the 1985 report chose 120 mg nkgd as the average maintenance requirement given that this key value included only one study of infants and that study involved energy intakes below usual requirements it is worthwhile to reconsider maintenance nitrogen needs of infants in a freeliving population consuming higher energy intakes one might expect that maintenance nitrogen needs would be considerably lower than 120 mg nkgd balance data for infants 46 months of age reported by fomon 1986 p 64 fomon et al  1965 but not cited in the 1985 report appear to support this conclusion in two studies of infants fed very low protein diets for 6 days total nitrogen excretion was 68 mgkgd when fed 016 gkgd protein and 93 mgkgd when fed 039 gkgd protein when higher levels of protein were given 126 gkgd total nitrogen losses were considerably higher 141 ma kgd however if one defines inevitable nitrogen losses in the same fashion as used in balance studies with adults one would conclude that they should be less than the losses observed when the lowest protein diet was given to the infants ie  68 mgkgd table 2 various estimates of basal andor maintenance nitrogen needs in infants and

viteri 1981a for children 1731 months of age which again suggests that the estimate from huang et al was too high assuming integumental losses of about 10 mg nkgd the total basal need would be 6068 mg nkgd maintenance needs calculated from the regressions for the infants in the fomon et al study range from 64 to 102 mg nkgd depending on the method of calculation however neither of the slopes obtained 049 and 091 is consistent with the expected efficiency of utilization of dietary nitrogen which is generally 7380 in both animal and human studies even in rapidly growing individuals the low slope obtained using the conventional balance calculation retention against absolute intake occurs because there is a relatively strong relationship between nitrogen intake and fecal nitrogen excretion in the fomon et al data whereas most other studies generally show a weak relationship between these two variables the high slope obtained using the alternative calculation using apparent nitrogen absorption for the × axis as shown in footnote e table 2 probably occurs because that method assumes that all fecal nitrogen is unabsorbed which is not the case  endogenous fecal nitrogen losses can be substantial and thus may underestimate nitrogen absorbed from the diet because of this discrepancy when estimating maintenance needs it is probably more prudent to apply an assumed slope of 073 to the range of basal needs calculated from the actual data 6068 mg nkgd this results in an estimate of 8293 mg nkgd a value of 90 mg nkgd was chosen for the factorial model presented in section 227223 estimated needs for growth during infancy the amount of protein required for growth is an important component of total protein needs as shown in table 3 this proportion declines from about 64 in the first month to 24 in the second six months of life to estimate body protein gain during growth the 1985 report used data from fomon et al 1982 those data were based on formulafed infants during the first 112 days of life and on nchs reference data from 3 to 10 y of age between 112 days and 3 y the values were interpolated with the requirement that they parallel as closely as possible the shape of the nchs curves p 1170 during infancy the nchs curves are also based primarily on formulafed infants given that the growth patterns of breastfed and formulafed infants differ considerably it is worthwhile to examine how the estimates in table 32 of the 1985 report might differ if they were based on growth of breastfed infants table 4 shows the estimated daily increment in body protein of male breastfed infants based on growth data for 109 males who were breastfed throughout the first year of life these data were derived from a pooled analysis of studies from the us canada denmark sweden finland and the uk who working group on infant growth 1994 the percentage of weight gain contributed by the fat free body mass ffbm and the percentage of ffbm assumed to be protein are taken from the estimates provided by fomon et al 1982 although it is recognized that body composition of breastfed and formulafed infants also may differ see below the resulting estimates of body protein gain range from 100 gkgd in the first month to 015 gkgd from 9 to 12 months of age for reference the values recently published for formulafed infants by fomon 1991 which are almost identical to the values in table 32 of the 1985 report are shown in the last column these are generally similar to the estimated values for breastfed infants in table 4 from 0 to 6 months but are 1520 higher after 6 months of age because of the higher growth rate of formulafed infants from 6 to 12 months continued contents  previous  next
