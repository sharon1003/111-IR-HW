computers  internet internet other  internet why does internet explorer keeps on crashing and pop up this send error report thingwhy does internet explorer keeps on crashing and pop up this send error report thing also how will i uninstall my internet explorer since i dont see it on my add remove programs i hate internet explorer6 following 9 answers answers relevance rating newest oldest best answer there are many possible reasons why your internet explorer keeps crashing the short and most likely answer is simply that your copy of internet explorer is pooched the long answer is that it could be any one or combination of the following things 1 virus 2 spywaremalware 3 corrupt internet explorer program the popup you mentioned is part of windows programming when a program crashes itll try to send information it believes pertinent to the crash to microsoft where their team might be able to diagnose and fix the problem dont hold your breath the first thing you should do is to try and make sure that your computer isnt infected with viruses spyware or malware this will be a long and arduous process because there are many scans to run and most of them take a long time whether or not you have an uptodate antivirus software on your computer i recommend that you run both of the following online virus scan programs because your antivirus might not catch everything thats out there oh yeah clear your temporary internet files also known as browser cache before running these scans 1 panda active scan httpwwwpandasoftwarecomactivescan 2 trend micro house call httphousecalltrendmicrocom these should automatically removequarantine any viruses they find but they wont remove the spywaremalware because they want you to buy their product next if you dont have any antivirus software installed or the above two scans found viruses despite your current antivirus software you need better antivirus protection try either anti vir at httpwwwfreeavcom or avg antivirus at httpfreegrisoftcom both are free then its time to check for spywaremalware youll need to download install update and run scans with the following programs 1 adaware httpwwwdownloadcomadaware200730008022410747652htmltaglst01 2 spybot  search  destroy httpwwwdownloadcomspybotsearchdestroy30008022410743107htmltaglst01 when youre done scanning with both programs it might be a good idea to reinstall your internet explorer the reason for this is because it is integrated into windows if any part of ie is corrupt it might cause other problems even when youre just looking for files on your computer windows explorer uses internet explorer also as others have already mentioned because of this you cannot uninstall ie from your system you can download the setup file from microsoft httpwwwmicrosoftcomdownloadsdetailsaspx family id1e1550cb5e5d48f5b02b20b602228de6display langen finally you can install a thirdpart browser you should do this after running the scans because some viruses can infect files you download plus thirdparty browsers can import your ie settings and some of those settings might have been created by spyware here too you have choices my browser of choice would be firefox which is also a media favorite and has already been mentioned here 1 mozilla firefox httpwwwmozillaorg 2 opera httpwwwoperacom 3 safari for windows beta httpwwwapplecomsafaridownload with thirdparty browsers you might also need 1 flash player httpwwwadobecomshockwavedownloaddownloadcgi p1prodversionshockwave flashpromoidbiow 2 java runtime environment

internet explorer needs to close  the latter usually produces the automatic popup message regarding sending the error report this can be useful in 2 ways firstly you can click on the link shown to enable you to examine the error report being sent though really you need to be a programmerengineer to make any sense of it secondly you also may get a link after the report has completed and been sent that takes you to the microsoft crash analysis site here you often are advised of the cause of the crash or offered other useful information occasionally the crash can be caused by your virus scanning programme running in the background it senses something about your usage of internet explorer or about the web page you are visiting and causes the crash by interrupting the scripts running more often the crash is caused by another programme running in the background  an im programme i found this the case with yahoo messenger on many occasions you get directed to the yahoo site and advised to download the latest version of messenger unfortunately for uk this is often the us version which screws up your plugins such as weather etc other possible causes are too numerous to mention here and include a full temporary internet files cache dodgy or outofdate cookies tracking cookies spyware and background programmes that need updating java etc the list goes on you cannot uninstall ie only install another browser as your default browser however that may not help the problem as other browsers still depend on the same files within windows that ie uses so whats the answer  try making notes at each instance of a crash  what you were doing at the time which website you were on what you had open on other tabs what other programmes you had running at the same time etc after a dozen or more crashes check your notes and look for a common denominator that may give you an idea as to what could be the cause note sometimes you will see internet explorer exhibiting weird behaviour  bits of the page missing that miraculously reappear when you mouse over headers appearing twice on the same page bits of a previously viewed page superimposed on the current one etc this can sometimes be caused in times of excessive bandwidth usage to the site you are viewing the easiest way to deal with it is merely to either close internet explorer and reopen it after a minute or two or to restart your computer usually this weird behaviour occurs when visiting the same very popular site anonymous · 1 decade ago0 0 commentdont worry with firefox just look at their support faq they have as much trouble as anyone you need to do the following with ie7 to fix ie7  boot windows in safe mode if windows fails to do this select safe with networking or some other safe option in safe mode using explorer delete the contents of datastore folder datastore folder is found in cwindowssoftwaredistribution datastore this is safe to do as the file will rebuild itself you may have to do it again 6 months time etc usually this is the trick but if you still have problems go to google and search for “reset ie7” as for a major shake up fix in ie7 1 turn of the phishing filter 2  in
