i now find not one not two not three but four places to get my favorite home state microbrew abita beer right here in el lay1 trader joes yep my favorite little grocery chain has started to carry three types of abita  amber ale turbo dog and purple haze its a little over six bucks a sixpack which is a very good price it really is an import sorta just remember the one annoying thing about trader joes  never fall in love with anything there thats not a store brand because they often have limited supplies or else they just stop carrying a product even if abita suddenly disappears from trader joes due to their inconsistency theres always 2 galcos soda pop stop york blvd at avenue 57 highland park besides hundreds of kinds of soda from all over the world and a fair amount of beer as well galcos carries all three now too its more expensive there about 850 a sixpack but they might end up having it more consistenly than trader joes galcos also carries the other varieties of dixie beer  crimson voodoo and blackened voodoo those are both okay but im much more of an abita fan dixie created those beers to compete with abita since their traditional lager produced for eons in new orleans is pretty bad i dont know if they still make it with river water but sometimes a dixie used to taste like whatever they had spilled into the river that week its a good thing to drink on a hot day after ya mow da lawn but it has very little body or flavor3 beverage warehouse 4935 mc connell ave 21 culver city i still havent been to this place it has inconvenient hours closing on weekdays at 6pm but i hear its good and that they do carry abita4 fathers office a bar at 1018 montana in santa monica a small crowded and mindsplittingly noisy bar in santa monica saved by the fact that they have the best bar food ive seen in the city spanish tapas and an astonishing burger on french bread with maytag blue and gruyère cheeses bacon compote caramelized red onion and arugula and the fact that they serve about 30 microbrews including both amber and turbo dog  on tap bogglecreole and cajun recipe page  the gumbo pagessearch this site chuck taggart  email chuck
