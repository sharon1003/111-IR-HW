9 common types of magnesium explainedby dr edward group dc np dacbn dcbcn dabfmlast updated on january 11 2017magnesium is one of the most abundant minerals in the human body and 50 of magnesium is located in the bones magnesium similar to zinc is a necessary cofactor for over 300 biochemical reactions in the human body this includes everyday processes such as muscle building maintaining nerve function keeping a healthy heartbeat and sustaining optimal immune system function because scientific studies are examining the role of magnesium in alleviating or circumventing many commonly occurring chronic ailments it is important to be educated on the variations in magnesium supplements especially magnesium orotate the best form of the mineral supplement magnesium is not easily absorbed in the body unless first attached to transporting substance for this reason many supplement manufacturers have “chelated” magnesium to organic and amino acids a few of these include magnesium oxide magnesium sulfate and magnesium carbonate quality depends on the amount of magnesium in the supplement and how bioavailable it is bioavailability refers to the amount of magnesium in the supplement that can be assimilated by the digestive system and used for cellular activity and health benefit9 types of magnesium1 magnesium amino acid chelate a mineral chelate form of magnesium containing an ion of magnesium oxide connected to a mixture of some other form of amino acid this could be a lactate a glycine aspartate or arginate etc the best chelated amino acid form of magnesium is aspartate or arginate2 magnesium oxide also referred to as “magnesia” magnesium oxide is commonly used therapeutically as a laxative and relief for acid reflux this type of magnesium shows high levels of concentration but poor levels of bioavailability only 43 magnesium citrate derived from the magnesium salt of citric acid this form of magnesium has lower concentration but a high level of bioavalibity 90 magnesium citrate is commonly used as to induce a bowel movement but has also been studied for kidney stone prevention4 magnesium orotate the most effective form of magnesium supplement created through the use of the mineral salts of orotic acid both plants and animals use orotates to create dna and rna extensive scientific research by dr hans a nieper m d shows orotates can penetrate cell membranes enabling the effective delivery of the magnesium ion to the innermost layers of the cellular mitochondria and nucleus magnesium orotate contains many properties that can help protect you and your health while offering your cells the most readily absorbable form of magnesium on the market today5 magnesium chloride a form of magnesium showing moderate concentrations but higher levels of bioavalibity when compared to magnesium oxide magnesium chloride has many uses most commonly to help manufacture paper some types of cements and fireproofing agents6 magnesium lactate this type of magnesium shows moderate concentrations but higher levels of bioavalibity as compared to magnesium oxide magnesium lactate is a mineral supplement that is most commonly used for treating digestive issues magnesium lactate should be avoided by those with kidney disease or kidneyrelated problems7 magnesium sulfate an inorganic form of magnesium with an elemental concentration of 10 and lower levels of bioavailability magnesium sulfate contains magnesium and sulfer and oxygen it’s commonly referred to as epsom salt8 magnesium carbonate this form of magnesium has moderate levels of elemental concentration and 30 bioavalibity rates magnesium carbonate has a strong laxativeeffect when taken in high amounts it is also commonly known as chalk and is used as a drying agent by pitchers gymnasts rock climbers and weight lifters9 magnesium glycinate malate  taurates chelated forms of magnesium are less concentrated but the magnesium in them is a much more bioavailable form all three types of magnesium have a variety of uses but none are as beneficial as the previous magnesium supplements listed above a magnesium supplement is best taken with calcium for this reason i developed intra cal™ it provides the best ratio of calcium and magnesium orotate references 4†results may vary information and statements made are for education purposes and are not intended to

health website and i always look out for blogs that have wellresearched content though i’ve commented on this wonderful article on mg and its types i’ve read allyour previous blogs and i find all of them particularly informative thankshthihow about magnesium stearate marcie i have found for my cardiac lyme symptoms that even orotate was not adequate there is a company with a patent kind of obnoxious for dimagnesium malate this combines high concentration and extremely high bioavailability even regular magnesium malate alone is often especially helpful for limefibro symptoms dimagnesium malate is amazing a supplement with dimagnesium malate and calcium citrate in a three to one ration would be wonderful for neurological muscle issues thank you for including this marcie matthews p m lawrence chalk is actually a form of calcium carbonate not magnesium carbonate though i suppose the latter might like enough like chalk that some people might call it that p m lawrence oops – “ look enough like”dooberheim any magnesium salt as long as it doesn’t raise the p h of the stomach too much will exit the stomach as ionized mg due to the hydrochloric acid in the stomach eating a diet high in veggies and nuts should give you all the magnesium you need – supplementation is unnecessary for most peoplehttpwwwnlmnihgovmedlineplusencyarticle002423htm also magnesium ion is transported into cells by specialized proteins on the cell surface called transporters they only work with ionized magnesium dkjudy while i’m certainly interested in the comparative information i was disappointed on two counts first the total absence of mention of magnesium ascorbate which i understand to have good bioavailability and is my primary source and second no mention of magnesium chloride as magnesium oil being used transdermally which avoids the digestive system issues dr edward group hi judyyou are absolutely correct i will update the post to include the other forms of magnesium you mention i also recommend magnesium chloride transdermallydr group me the type of chalk used by weight lifters gymnasts rock climbers etc to help with grip is magnesium carbonate though i suppose people who don’t know better might say otherwisehealthylife i learned more about magnesium in this blog then from any other thanks for the informationmagnesium oxide thanks for the informative post on the magnesium oxide magnesium oxide is very useful product for our body’s functionality ross thanks for doing this hope you add magnesium threonate see eg magteincom to this list recent research think it was jama indicates vgood brainrelated bioavailability thanks again mary hii wonder if you could post the sources which give information regarding the bioavailability of magnesium in different magnesium types please i’ve found some us government research stating that mg oxide has low bioavailibility at 4 but i can’t find any other credible research out there on the net it would really help my research into the bioavailability of magnesium types thanks ben hi marycheck these linkshttpwwwncbinlmnihgovpubmed11794633httpwwwncbinlmnihgovpubmed2407766httpwwwglobalhealingcentercomnaturalhealthtypesofmagnesiummary thanks for that much appreciated april yes thanks for all the useful information i am 37 years old  was diagnosed as a type 1 diabetic ten years ago just two weeks ago on a whim  a little reading on magnesium i began taking magnesium oxide and whereas it may not be the best form of magnesium i am already reaping many benefits from this precious mineral not only is my body soaking it up so is my brain i cannot stop reading up on the many many benefits of magnesium i am very anxious to try the oil thanks so muchdianne how much magnesium orotate should you take daily i just started taking it for leg cramping is that the one i should be using i have to make sure it is stomach friendly as i am on nexiumand have to stay on it thanks dianne peter roe i’m not sure i understand the statement that the chloride has ‘higher levels of bioavailabity when compared to magnesium oxide’ surely small amounts of magnesium oxide will immediately react with stomach acids to form magnesium chloride and water and so should become equally bioavailable when ingested edit i see that dooberheim has already made and elaborated this point an anon“any magnesium salt as long as it doesn’t raise the p h of the stomach too much will exit the stomach as ionized mg due to the hydrochloric acid in the stomach”not entirely true it depends on the amount of hydrochloric acid produced in the stomach as well as other foods and drinks that are present in the meal different salts dissociate at different rates and so not all of the ions will be liberated for absorption and utilization“eating a diet high in veggies and nuts should give you all the magnesium you need – supplementation is unnecessary for most people”not so much in today’s world the availability of magnesium is dependent on soil conditions very poor in most parts of the agricultural united states and other parts of the world and the amount of antinutrients found in the foods nuts seeds grains and legumes especially soy contain high levels of phytic acid if not sprouted fermented andor cooked properly phytic acids binds magnesium iron zinc and calcium phytates are not digestible by humans add to the fact that food from meals buffers the stomach’s acids so let us not overestimate hydrochloric acid’s “unlimited power” especially in the elderly it is tricky to get enough bioavailable magnesium in diet alone these days your source mainstream no surprise lists nuts legumes and whole grains as good sources of magnesium you would think with the amount of whole grains that healthconscious consumers eat there would be no such thing as a magnesium deficiency among them yet there is and they find relief of their symptoms by supplementing with magnesium green leafy vegetables are a good source more so if cooked enough to soften the fiber bondstexmex  where can you find mg chloride in the usa as alimentary supplement in europe i find it in every pharmacy it is a great disinfectant on skin and i drink some when i feel a flu coming or stomach pain soejinn1 you forgot magnesium ascorbate ascorbic acid and magnesium form a very synergetic combination that is very good for the body2 orotate and orotic acid have issues in regards to helping cancer growth3 magnesium aspartate has many questions in terms of it’s bioavailability and effectivenessghchealth excellent information soejinn thanks for sharing soejinnthanks i have done a tremendous amount of study over the years previously my blood pressure was in the prehypertension range and i looked for natural ways to lower it in addition to diet and exercise it is now consistently around 11575 which is very good note many doctors now say that even 12080 which was normal before is a bit high biologically magnesium helps regulate sodium potassium and calcium many people are way too high in calcium and sodium and way too low in magnesium and potassium and this bad balance will create a very dangerous and disastrous effect on the body wiz chipyeah how about magnesium stearate wikipedia has a article on itghchealth check out this article about orotates it might clear up some things joey hi i would like to know what will be the best magnesium for muscle recovery and what should be the starting

having irregular heartbeats pls respond thanks global healing center i like magnesium orotate but whether or not it’s safe and the best choice for you is going to have to be answered by your healthcare provider who has personally evaluated your physical condition and is familiar with your specific situation michael wallace ellwood can’t give you a dosage myself although i agree more mg will help but just wanted to add that 2 things to reduce high bp which have been suggested to me are 1 beetroot extract tablets or juice and 2 hawthorn berry capsules they are not too expensive either too early to say if they work for me but they seem to work for many people michael wallace ellwood but don’t some of those contain oxalates which is yet another potential “minefield” seems to be a contentious issue if one searches for itbrandon evans this is dangerous information aspartate has horrible effects in your brain ever wonder why aspartame gives people migraines also magnesium should not be taken with calcium the calcium has your body push the magnesium out in urine rendering it totally useless we get more than enough calcium as is and supplementation should be avoided unless testing says otherwise doubting thomas where on earth did you hear that brandon evans which part both are pretty obvious if you have any basic understanding of biochem gisellemy mother has pain in her

body does not handle even small amounts of sulfur at this time even though i know it is very good for most other people global healing center i use intra cal great quality and sulfur free lisamhey cynthiayou can take the mineral molybdenum which helps in handling sulfur and then try reintroducing sulfur cynthia schoenbauer from reading the ingredients i find that intra cal has msm which is a form of sulfur am i wrong cynthia schoenbauer thank you lisa do you know if just any brand will do global healing center you’re correct if sulfur free is a must intra cal wouldn’t be appropriate cynthia schoenbauer thank you for your reply dr group but it just brings me back to my original question do you know a good brand other than your own of the calmag orotate together or separately that would make a good substitute or is any orotate just fine thank you cindy global healing center i’d look for another orotate i find that’s the most absorbable i don’t have another brand i can

improvements it is also probably the most expensive form glycinate and taurate are linked to mdd studies in a university of adelaide report “magnesium in the central nervous system” malate is said to

benefits of beets how can they boost your health – robert s morgan pingback diy  hb of organic hemp milk – site title desmaris soejinn – i have one response to your comment about getting magnesium naturally from the diet via consumption of the foods you mentioned certainly in the world we used to live in before monsanto dominated the growing fields and controlled the sales of all the adulterated gmo seeds we could rely on the food that was produced for our consumption however since monsanto took over the gmo seeds produce foods that require application of excessive amounts of pesticides herbicides fungicides and insecticides – all of which have contaminated and ruined the soils that used to be rich with minerals that would produce mineralrich foods – which is where our natural supply of minerals used to come from today our food chain supplies food that is so nutritionallydeficient that we actually can not depend on reaping good nutrition from the foods we are supplied with even foods labeled as “organic” are not always ideal and they are very expensive this is why our need to supplement the food we eat with good quality storebought supplements in order to make sure our bodies are getting what they need i believe that the right kind of magnesium is perhaps the most important mineral we need to take because it sure can’t be found present in the food we are supplied in the food chain anymore kim mcleod with slow motility what magnesium would be best to taken daily oxy powder should only be used 2 times a week so on the other days what would be best
