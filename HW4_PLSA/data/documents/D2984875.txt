 agarose the higher  agarose the gel is the slower the dna runs however the bands are tighter so it is sometimes easier to see small pieces at higher  agarose we typically use 2 for dna  200 bp and 1 for dna  200 bp kinds of agarose there are several kinds of agarose in the lab seakem le is the cheap stuff it is useful for analytical gels for running pcr reactions to see if there is something there or not seaplaque gtg is a low melting point gel to use when you want to get the dna bands back out for cloning sequencing etc seakem gold is used for large 10 kb dna fragments sizes of gel rigs we have several sizes of rigs there are casting trays for the small medium and large rigs for pouring gels in the hood small rigs can run to 12 samplesrow and two rows it takes 30 ml to make a shallow gel and 50 ml to make a deeper gel to hold 50 ul using the 8 tooth comb the medium rigs can run up to 14 samplesrow and 2 rows it takes at least 60ml to make a thin gel the large rig can run up to 26 samples  row and 2 rows this rig is nice for running half of a 96 well plate 2 x 24 plus size standards the extra large rig can run up 42 samples  row and 3 rows we also have a pulsed field gel rig for large dna fragments 10 kb pouring gels set up the gel tray in gel box or pouring tray make sure the o rings are sealed and not rolled up between plastic tray and box put desired combs in holder locations include 1 lane for size standard in each row combs with more teeth make wells which hold less volume you can calculate the volume from the well length x width x gel height make up enough gel to fill tray in an erlenmeyer flask you can make up a bigger batch of gel 300 ml in 500 ml bottle and remicrowave as needed for 1 gel add 1g of agarose for each 100 ml of running buffer 1x tae microwave till agarose is dissolved and there are no bubbles note never microwave gel with gel red in it pour required volume into erlenmeyer flask and cool slightly add gel red in drawer under microwave about 5 ul of 10000x gel red stock per 50 ml of gel gives enough staining essentially no background pour into gel tray and let cool gels can also be stained after running to post stain add gel red to running buffer to 05 ugml and stain the gel for a half hour
