custom shampoo by function of beauty—a review june 21 2016beauty review today i was recently asked to try out customized shampoo and conditioner by function of beauty here’s what i thought in case you’ve never heard of this new brand basically function of beauty is a service that gives customers fully customized shampoo and conditioner sets based on their exact hair needs you can pick almost everything about your particular formula based on your hair’s texture and even pick what color and scent you want it to be if you’re interested use this link to get 5 off your orderthe function of function of beauty tee hee is to change the way people buy products instead of a onesizefitsall kinda thing or even products tailored to treat one specific function ie curly hair colortreated hair etc  function of beauty’s mission is to “create a world where brands don’t exist” interesting indeed here’s the process of filling out your unique “hair profile”you can see the options i chose and there’s also support and explanations if you’re not sure for example if your hair has thin strands or thick ones it’s seriously so cool to see my name on these pretty bottles they even write you a note telling you how best to use the shampoo for example mine told me to rub the shampoo in between my hands to lather it before applying the people behind this brand created over 450 million formulations to address literally everyone’s hair needs so how did it stack up i personally was pretty impressed with the formula the one characteristic i noticed the most was oil control i could go three days without washing my hair and not notice oiliness a huge plus it’s also a boon to know that this shampoo is taking care of everything i need in a wash time will tell if it keeps working well or if i’ll need a reformulation soon my hair tends to be temperamental will update this post if necessarysome things about function of beauty they are made without parabens sulfates phthalates gmos or triclosan they’re not tested on animals and if you’re not satisfied with your formula you can have it reformulated for free so yayshare like this loading related beauty  hask chia seed volumizing shampoo  conditioner december 5 2016in beautybeauty review  new wash by hairstory a shampoo replacement july 10 2017in beautygiveaway  gift card to function of beauty february 1 2017in beauty10 comments · labels beauty
