people tried to escape as soon as possible the boom has also blown up all the old economic realities as oil and gas companies are pouring billions into the region to tap the sweet hydrocarbon lode found in a shale formation beneath two dozen counties ranchers who once scraped by on bony cattle and seasonal deer leases have become millionaires new motels restaurants and other businesses are

drillsite consultants can make 1500 a day youths without special skills or college degrees can earn sixfigure incomes by working 90hour weeks in sometimes rough conditions you have no lifebut as every oil field veteran knows there is a harsh tradeoff beyond the grueling labor some men work hundreds of miles from their families others live in primitive conditions or face the real risk of being maimed you have no life its basically work sleep work sleep and when you do go home you sleep said carlos garza 36 who drives a fluid truck and rarely sees his four kids in mission just two hours away sometimes were 30 hours on location i havent seen my house in the daytime in two weeks said garza who bunks in asherton but the lure of big checks is still bringing waves of workers in dimmit county population 10000 before the boom more than 1000 oil field jobs were added in 2011 around the 20 eagle ford shale counties at least 7000 jobs have been added in two years when we do hiring events we draw candidates from all over the state we had one individual drive all the way from el paso for a job fair said betty sifuentes director of work force programs for the region the average wage for a driver is 25 an hour some pay by the mile others by the trip for a roughneck its about 16 an hour she said the massive influx of workers is causing housing and labor shortages traffic congestion increased crime and new infrastructure demands id say the population of asherton has at least doubled in the last two years we have 10 to 15 rv parks two man camps with a third being built and a motel being built said ralph cordova cordova 27 a city councilman in this once dirtpoor city south of carrizo springs quit his job at the toyota plant in san antonio for one in the oil patch i haul fuel for a petroleum company im doing much better he said around the region dozens of man camps  large clusters of mobile homes equipped with bathrooms and a mess hall  have suddenly materialized hundreds of oftenprimitive roadside rv parks have also sprouted on freshly graded caliche lots there are now more than 60 in dimmit county alone up from just two a few years ago the more fortunate workers such as gonzalez who was staying at the mesquite lodge a newly opened camp sleep on clean sheets and eat good meals tougher for some in the evenings they can play horseshoes watch movies on the patio or sip a beer around a campfire all behind a security fence but smaller companies cannot cough up the 125 to 160 a day to house and feed a man at a good man camp some workers who have to find their own housing stay in everything from horse trailers to converted shipping containers to mobile units parked by the rig site still others are jammed into singlefamily houses being rented by the bed for 100 or 150 a week or even hot bedding in which two men working opposite shifts share a bunk far worse conditions used to be the norm say the oldtimers who recall sleeping in shacks trucks or even empty tanks the goodold days were the hardold days if you lived at the drilling rig you lived in a little room with six or eight guys on top of you you ate whatever you could bring out there and you took a shower every three days said alan roberts 53 who has worked offshore from norway to africa i like what i dothe old stereotype of the heavydrinking drugusing reckless roughneck with a shady record is also pretty much part of the colorful past companies are now far more safetyconscious and less tolerant of misbehavior most do background checks provide training and have zero tolerance for drug use or alcohol abuse leo lopez 54 who began in the oil field as a teenager doesnt miss the old days when i started it was 315 an hour for a roughneck now im making 160000 a year with no education i cant complain said lopez a tool pusher or drill crew boss from mission back then there was no safety not even hard hats now were treated much better and we dont work as hard now they give you the equipment you need he said i worked at this all my life i like what i do he added while eating roast chicken with his crew at the tailgate of his gleaming 2012 denali hd pickupjmaccormackexpressnewsnet
