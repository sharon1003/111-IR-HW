the following article was written by seattle lawyer margaret dore and published on december 31 on the missoulian website under the title oregon washington assisted suicide laws include no protections for patients margaret dore indicated that she had titled the article assisted suicide in washington and oregon a recipe for elder abuse and cloaked in secrecy by margaret dore esq i disagree with susan hancock’s description of how the washington and oregon assisted suicide laws work  dec 20 guest column i disagree that assisted suicide cannot be forced upon an unwilling person the oregon and washington assisted suicide acts have a formal application process the acts allow an heir who will benefit from the patient’s death to actively participate in this process once the lethal dose is issued by the pharmacy there is no oversight for example there is no witness required at the death without disinterested witnesses the opportunity is created for an heir or for another person who will benefit from the patient’s death to administer the lethal dose to the patient without his consent one method would be by injection when the patient is sleeping the drugs used in oregon and washington are water soluble and therefore injectable if the patient woke up and struggled who would know the washington and oregon acts require the state health departments to collect statistical information for the purpose of annual reports according to these reports users of assistedsuicide are overwhelmingly white and generally welleducated many have private insurance most are age 65 and older typically persons with these attributes are seniors with money which would be the middle class and above a group disproportionately at risk of financial abuse and exploitation the forms used to collect the statistical information do not ask about abuse moreover not even law enforcement is allowed to access information about a particular case alicia parkman a mortality research analyst at the center for health statistics oregon health authority wrote me“we have been contacted by law enforcement and legal representatives in the past but have not provided identifying information of any type“assisted suicide in washington and oregon is a recipe for elder abuse and cloaked in secrecy don’t make our mistake supporting documentation below margaret dore esq seattle washington 1 see for
