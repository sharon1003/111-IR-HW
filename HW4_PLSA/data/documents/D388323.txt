benzy4 mechanical op 15 mar 09 0423please can you explain me what is the fail safe design for a standard api slab gate valve thank yousheiko chemical 15 mar 09 0959failsafe is a much abused word it is very dramatic because it combines the apparently contradictory concepts of failure and safety in a single word the reality is not so dramatic it means that the failure of a component is unlikely to cause any harm the formal definition i prefer is a failsafe design is one in which the most probable failure mode results in the most probably safe condition walter driedger limit switches key to valve reliability intech  january 1993 we dont believe things because they are true things are true because we believe them zdas04 mechanical 15 mar 09 1309to take that a step further never specify fail safe for a valve or anything else you need to select a failure direction that is safe for example a failclosed valve on the discharge of a positive displacement pump would be anything but safe since a couple of strokes after the valve fails a psv is going to go off or something is going to break sometimes it is a bit grey whether a valve should fail open closed or asis that is where engineering judgement comes into play you as the system designer have to look at every actuated valve and decide 1 what does failure mean and 2 in a failure what direction should this fail for example many pneumatic valves have solenoid valves sending pressure to them you need to think about what should happen on both a loss of air pressure both global and between the actuator and the solenoid and a loss of electrical pressure this can be tough but is necessary for this example if you have a thread leak between the pneumatic actuator and the solenoid valve what do you want to happen most of the time i would say that i want the valve to be in its depressurized state between activations ie a dump valve should be pressure to open vent to shut so a leak like this is no big deal sometimes that is not possible and you need to think about it hope this helps important thing is to realize that fail safe is a mass media term that will get a system designer into all sorts of trouble davidgerhardl mechanical 16 mar 09 0459i from a europeanscandinavian viewhighly agree with the above comments 1 failsafe is without meaning and content if not discribed exactly together with what to fail and what to happen 2 other failures present or happening together with main failure and not described are normally not taken into account 3 most commonly for valves is the requirement failsafe closed or open requiring that the valve is actuated by an actuator and the actuator has a stored force to close the valve if the valve is open and power fails normally this will be interpreted to mean a pneumatic actuator with spring return but could of course be other devices and variations a pneumatic actuator with spring return will close with a failure of electrical current but only if the solenoid valve is of type normally closed without current and note the solenoid valve is connected to the actuators working air inletexhaust port to give this effect b will close also if air pressure fails together with electrical current or air pressure fails alone in the last case to further ensure closere solenoid valve should be operated to closed position to evcuate air from working chamber in the actuator if nescessary 5 you are with this and the above comments left with the questions you usually have to place to clarify unclear product specifications  total process and fluid description  what standards to apply  if outside any standard please describe exact requirements and how to qualify  how will products be tested and by whoom after installment 6 if the inquirer can not answer you can although bid with your own interpretation and answering the questions within what you can supply be sure to put limitations to your bid for instance as described in our data sheets only no certifications or verifying tests available process tests after agreement in writing before order acceptance only  or similar as suitable jlseagull electrical 16 mar 09 0617i too regard failsafe in the context of automated isolation valves or control valves automated slab gate valves are not common manually operated valves are not failsafe spring return piston or diaphragm actuators oppose the pneumatic force close the air supply and vent the diaphragm or piston permits the spring to move the valve to the selected failure or trip position the combintation of the spring return actuator and electronic accessories should provide the same results to open or close the valve upon loss of air or electrical signal or supply if you loose all energy supply and the valve stays in the last position then the valve is not failsafe thus many other style actuators such as gasoveroil vane or hydraulic actuators with a backup supply are not failsafe regardless of the actuator suppliers rhetorical descriptions big inch petroleum 21 mar 09 1129if you loose all energy supply and the valve stays in the last position then the valve is not failsafe does that make sense closed open or last position could be a safe position depending on the process for example i might want a particular valve to failsafe in the same position that just happened to also be its last position  pumping

httpvirtualpipelinespaceslivecomzdas04 mechanical 21 mar 09 1257you are right big inch it is up to the designer to determine what safe means ive designed a bunch of applications where i want the valve to fail as is because a loss of impulse power eg electrical power fails on a compressor suction controller is not necessarily related to the safe process condition i was looking at a well just yesterday with an electric driven suction controller on a compressor the pid said fail open without the compressor wellhead pressure builds to over 200 psig within a few minutes and the compressor has a 100 psig psv on the suction scrubber failing that valve open would take the compressor down on high suction pressure within seconds the psv would go off not many seconds after that not a particularly safe condition if the thing had been designed to fail shut you are relying of the low suction kill to keep from pulling the pressure so low that youd risk damaging the valve seals having the valve fail asis happens to be the safest possible result i started out in nuclear power and at least half of the actuated valves in the plant were fail asis because major transients unrelated to reactor operation were really frowned upon we had one rising stem gate valve that was fail asis on loss of pneumatic pressure fail shut on a number of reactor transients manually open i cant imagine a valve in the world that had more critical high quality analysis of its operating modes than that one and it was fail asis on loss of pneumatics the designer has to evaluate all of the credible failure of valve operating power and of process scenarios and determine what minimizes the risk of personal injury or property damage that is why i really hate the term fail safe especially when a lot of idiots interpret it to mean fail closed i wont even comment on jlseagulls assertion that oil over hydraulic actuators cant be fail safe take it as read that i disagree david big inch petroleum 21 mar

me among the idiots as i fully agree with you both and repeat again 1 failsafe is without meaning and content if not discribed exactly together with what to fail and what to happen and 2 most common for valves is the requirement failsafe closed or open requiring  i should also have thought about including the remaining as is as one of the possible failsafe conditions i have supplied to this last requirement several times but semantically not described with failsafe but rather the longer and more detailed remaining in last position if power fails even this description is not fully detailed in itself you have to qualify further by asking questions as failure in electrical power only how to ensure failsafe condition by actuator type only is the actuator and mecanical remaining forces in itself acceptable within safety margins do we need special solenoid valves or backup reserves electrical andor mecanicalair or hydraulic is the selected solution acceptable tests time limits redundandcy risk and consequence analysisetc etc i think the problem is not the very often misused description failsafe but rather the lack of requirement for exact details from engineers both describing side and supplying side when this very in itself lacking description failsafe pops up big inch petroleum 21 mar 09 1846i didnt say idiot  pumping accounts for 20 of the worlds energy used

0654biginch the entire last paragraph makes less sense to me now than it did when i posted if the last position was the failure position then the valve could be fail safe still some valve actuators such as vanes require hydraulic pressure that permits stroking the valve once or twice once the stored energy is depleted then no force is available to move the valve an actuator with a spring that can force the valve to a specified position may be fail safe a valve without a spring probably is not fail safe big inch petroleum 23 mar 09 0816ok and yes ive used a bank of bottled n2hydraulics and

the total electrical energy usage in certain industrial facilities doe statistic note make that 99 for pipeline companies httpvirtualpipelinespaceslivecomjohnnybv industrial 23 mar 09 1947it is really late but may be worth pointing out the difference between loss of power loss of air and loss of signal  all of which could be handled differently positioned valves could be designed to fail in a number of different positions depending on the failure mechanism the valve could move to the open position on a loss of control signal and move to the closed position in a loss of air power all can be handled from the logic of the positioner jlseagull electrical 24 mar 09 0717vane actuators etc may be suitable for crosscountry pipeline stations however i worked on a platform with vane actuators operating several nps 36 riser shutdown valves i seriously disagree with the use of gas powered hydraulic vane valves for platform riser valves many situations such as a fire or explosion that damages the tubing between the hydraulic reservoirs and the valve would prevent closing the riser during such an event an operator would not likely use the manual hand pumps that could take several minutes to close the valve these are valves that justify those enormous single acting scotch yoke style piston operators that use a spring to close upon loss of electrical or pneumatic signal in some unmanned platforms the pneumatic supply may be natural gas on manned platforms i would require instrument air some companies prefer blowdown valves with solenoids that were energized to blowdown electrically with a spring to open upon air failure thus a short term power issue with their sis output would not dump the process to the flare however a total loss of instrument air or the failure of the air supply at an idividual blowdown valve would dump to flare i understand that the term failsafe is just semantics to some people but the concept is important i recognize that an object jambed in the actuator mechanism can prevent the spring from moving the valve some applications require the nearest thing available to failsafe in such cases consider using a springzdas04 mechanical 24 mar 09 0810jlseagull semantics can be important fail safe as an engineering concept is not important and is often worse than worthless designing a system that fails in the safest possible manner taking into account both personnel safety and protection of equipment is very important the analysis you alluded to above is exactly what needs to be done the designer needs to look at every credible failure and determine how he wants actuated valves to perform during that failure every esd that ive ever installed has been pressure to open pressure to hold open loss of pressure to close ive always done it with the hugespring kind of actuator that way you dont have an operator standing in a fire trying to pump a manual actuator but that is just one facet of the analysis how do i want the solenoid that supplies gas to the actuator to fail on loss of signal loss of power does it need to just close or does it need to vent downstream i say that the answer to every one of these questions is valvespecific and the pha or one of the less formal alternatives needs to address all of these questions instead of being a psvminette that is so scripted that no one would consider asking a question that was not on the script david786392 petroleum 24 mar 09 1151although a lot of discussion and commentary has been in this thread by many of the forum giants i add my little bit to it the concept is basically meant to define certain condition s for some solitary valves as regards 1their position s open or shut when the failure of some particular nature occurthe scenario is considered to yield safer process conditions 2sometimes multiple signal actuation scheme sare supplemeted to take care and ensuure that valves operation almostnever failsthis also has its own limitationsbut may be nick
