mozambique has a total area of 801590 square kilometers 309493 square miles—an expanse which is slightly less than twice the size of the state of california the coastline of the country which spans 2470 kilometers 1535 miles along the entire eastern frontier borders the mozambique channel and the indian ocean to the north of mozambique lies tanzania to the northwest malawi and zambia to the west zimbabwe and to the southwest south africa and swaziland maputo the capital of mozambique is situated at the pointy southern tip of the countrys territory not far from the south african and swaziland border population from 1975 to 1998 the population of mozambique grew at an average annual rate of 26 percent increasing substantially from approximately 105 to 189 million with a current annual growth rate of 17 percent the population should reach 252 million by 2015 in order to restrain this growth the government announced a population control policy in 1997 among other things the plan seeks to disseminate information on different forms of birth control one of the major impediments however is that most people in rural areas must have large families in order to have more workers to till the family plots according to a 1997 census approximately 708 percent of the population live in rural areas where poverty is rampant and birth control limited the current birth rate in mozambique is 3799 births per 1000 persons while the death rate is 2329 deaths per 1000 persons 2000 est the high death rate reflects in part a growing hivaids epidemic the health minister aurelio zihao for example estimated that approximately 250000 mozambicans died as a result of aids in 1999 though most of these deaths were not registered as hivaids related zihao states that the major causes behind the hivaids epidemic are poverty unemployment illiteracy and the low status of women the educational campaign sponsored by the health ministry targets vulnerable groups such as soldiers longdistance truck drivers students poorly educated women street children migrant mineworkers and their wives and prostitutes the government at large has been criticized for not taking an active role in the hivaids campaign with 43 percent of the population aged 14 years and younger 54 percent aged between 15 and 64 years and only 3 percent aged 65 years and over the population of mozambique is relatively young a young population may offer opportunities in terms of an expanding labor force and thus a potentially expanding economy if economic decline accompanies labor force growth however the results will be higher unemployment and exacerbated poverty approximately 9966 percent of the mozambican population belong to one of the many indigenous local ethnic groups such as the shangaan chokwemanyika sena and makua europeans comprise a marginal 006 percent of the population while euroafricans and indians respectively account for 02 percent and 008 percent in terms of religion 50 percent of mozambicans are adherents of indigenous religious systems 30 percent are christians and 20 percent are muslims the official language of mozambique is portuguese though most mozambicans express themselves primarily in one of the numerous local languages that are spoken financial services there are a total of 8 banks in mozambique in addition to the central bank the bank of mozambique all of these banks many of which were controlled by the government prior to mid1990s are now part of the private sector the banco comercial de mocambique bcm which has a considerable presence across the country dominates commercial banking the government controlled bcm until 1996 when it was sold to a consortium led by the portuguese banco portugues mello the government still retains a 49 percent share in the bcm though it plans on selling its shares despite these plans the government was forced to authorize the issuing of 39 million in treasury bills as part of an effort to recapitalize the bcm along with the banco austral to prevent each from becoming insolvent both banks have large loan portfolios that have proved unrecoverable the banco austral mozambiques second largest bank was sold
